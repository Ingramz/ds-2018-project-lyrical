"Buck 65","a game worth winnin from the beginnin of the first inning an essential day off since its provincial playoffs and im playin shortstop batting fourth in the line up the opposing pitchers a right hander with an unorthodox wind up and a good move to first throws a curve and changes speeds can be wild at times and known to blow the strangest leads like the last time we faced him he turned one savage lead into a loss for his team and inflated his earned run average but today he seems focused and we were stuck out to dry in the top of the first cause he struck out the side but in the bottom half the bad guys came out swingin a lot of coaches like to choose takin the same route bringing the big hitters to the plate and players that are purely speed and try to manufacture runs and jump out to an early lead and this time it worked so we were gonna need a hero cause after one complete the scores already 3 to 0 leadin off the second i swung at the first pitch no wonder the center fielder back peddled to the track and settled under it 0 for 1 and cant get goin the balls thrown around the horn and back to the pitcher now and all is going good for the bad guys but not so hot for the visitors the big right hander is takin no prisoners he seems to have us figured out the question is can we compete hes pitching perfect after 3 complete and has a 3 1 lead top of the fourth and our lead off hitter makes it to first base and here we go its the worst case scenario for any opposing pitcher because he got a reckon that the first chance he gets hes gonna try to steal second which he does so for the first time during the mission weve got nobody out and a man in scoring position the next batter flies out to right but yo word thats still only one out and a runner on third so then the number 3 hitter steps up to the conventional talk showin where hell hit but draws the intentional walk its an old maneuver they made cause trouble may follow unless they get the double play from the clean up hitter and thats me the infielders set up a double play depth when theyre ready but i smack a line drive into left center for a double bringing two across which just leaves it up to me to do the damage in the clean up spot cause now the score was 3 to 2 the score remained the same through five past hits to pretense we kept it close with a dazzling display of defense we had to pull the starting pitcher the one that was left handed the story of the sixth inning was base runners left stranded and bullpen activity but still the job is gettin it done after a perfectly executed hit and run and what may later prove to be the ultimate game winning catch we got a tie game going into the seventh inning stretch","The Blues, Pt. 1","1999"

the harder they try the more everything goes wrong the tryhards talk until the back of my neck hurts no matter what the topic is the experts the tryhards cant dance but do dance anyways then they say tryhards are kinda retarded but i wouldnt go that far i should mention for starters theyre modern day maureders just dyin for attention yeah tryhards candy coated comedians live through medium sized imaginations lies and exagerrations all on an average weekday they have a unique way of making you want to vomit drama slash nonsense akways part of the content opinions and comments from cowboys and indians climbin a steep hill just for a cheap thrill dancin queens cant seem to keep still the tryhards dotn sleep well they just toss and turn and im not concerned about it to tell you the truth they get on my nerves i refer to them as perverted earthworms as they prefer to play dirty the tryin hardest theyd probably say im an artist obvious novices that just feel so informed thats its even more annoying than being trapped in a toystore with hardcore rappers paraders and wannabes i say probably highway robbery aint worse than being pestered by this type of person tryhard children still throw tantrums on their mattresses in their mansions and pay attention fully to the bully with the headphones fascinated actually with makin a fashion statement tryhards dont know how to relax its ridiculous how he always overreacts the tryhards just go along for the ride i guess the nbeed for speed can be stronger than pride the tryhards they jump so high they run so fast and dont know why i was raised on a dirt road ghost town stray dogs whole nine the gold mine closed down i knew the woods like the back of my hand and i would shoot the breeze with the roots and trees id go by the river and watch the way the devil dances but never took his hand even though i did have several chances everybody slept when the morning dew turned to frost darkness moved in and somebody burned a cross a girl named stella cuwin was prettier than youd imagine the town shouldve given her the crown for the beauty pageant but instead some local pinhead started spreading rumors about the cuwins being inbreds and whats worse people believed it cause the family was dirt poor and down on their luck so that made it hurt more picking up garbage and mowing the grass at this point stella stopped going to class you know how they ridicule a kid in school and this shits enough to make anybody feel like a misfit she made herself invisible and hid inside a house of mirrors whenever the fear stops so did the tear drops but fear is forever and lies become legend and eventually growing slowly exponentially she shouldve been a cover girl treated like a princess but shes an enigma haunted by the stigma of incest she tried to hide the scars her name reminds me of the stars i saw diamonds divide in the corners of her eyes she tried to hide the scars her name reminds me of the stars i saw diamonds divide in the corners of her eyes one horse town known for the most softness little old schoolhouse burned down post office blueberries and bulrushes a tree with a tire swing volunteer firemans fair the whole entire thing stella was heartbroken decided to start smoking bad taste in her mouth she grew into a sad face her few friends were worried but her parents were always pround of her but she never escaped from under the cloud cover a woman reduced she was eaten by a monster and after all these years the past it still haunts her it whispers her name when shes trying instead to just listen to music while shes lying in bed now the story of stella is one that every child knows but the witch in the woods is more like a wild rose she tried to hide the scars her name reminds me of the stars i
