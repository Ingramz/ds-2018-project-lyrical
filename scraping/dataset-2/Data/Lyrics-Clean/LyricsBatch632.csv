they cant relate or even adapt to it forgive those who dont think im great and wanna see me go forgive oprah for editing most my comments off her show dont get me wrong i know some people got a image to hold but those who criticize the youth might just be getting too old we still traveling through life finding whats right or wrong i know some folks may not agree or even like this song but im just speaking my truth cause i heard it sets you free and my conversations with god even though he speaks through me im smarter cause of my daughter and im not too dense im 28 years old it just now started making sense and ive been ive been searchin so long i admit that ive been lost in them clouds im just tryna stay strong baby you know ima make you proud i know life is full of contradictions im tryna become a better man prayin for redemption each and every day hallelujah as the choir sings searching so long so long lost in the clouds in the clouds trying to stay strong and make you proud make you proud took me some time took me some time now i see oh now i see he resides in me yeah ladies and gentlemen we have a special guest in the house tonight came with some words of encouragement bishop eddie long what you just heard is real life its real life for you its real life for many its about where you been yet at the same time you hey you find yourself in the midst of conflict and turmoil yes im talking to you in the midst of conflict and turmoil cause you realize hey its time to change right now and in the middle of that i wanna say this the bible says that when i was a child i spoke as a child i understood as a child i fought as a child hey but when i became a man i put away those childish things did you not know that your environment has shaped you where you were born in the projects in the ghettos in the upper downtown wherever it was the people around you the things around you cause you to do strange things because you were seeking to learn but what you learned was on the streets and not in the book god called you a prophet when you open up your mouth everything of god comes out and it commands attention it commands change im talking about the power thats inside of you and in the midst when youre starting to understand that i caught the wrong message and now its time im hearing from god what amazing experience as you hear from god he said is there forth any man be in christ he is a new creation old things are passed away somebody needs to hear that and behold everything becomes new and when everything becomes new in you its time to stop the killing i said its time to stop the stealing its time to stop disrespecting our women its time for us to come home and raise our children its time for us to really mold our communities its time for us not to get hooked up in religion but to get hooked up in relationship with god and the amazing thing about it is wherever you find yourself right now you can confess and you can tell god im sorry i had the wrong cue i was doing the wrong thing i was going after things that i thought were right but it wasnt right and now that im getting it right im asking you to forgive me and i may have done the things that they said i did but im not who they say i am i am who you made me to be and im changing in that and it takes a few moments but every time i fall down ill get right back up and every time i make a wrong turn ill get myself back in line because i recognize i have been called for such a time as this you cant resist the change and youre not condemned by your yesterday if you can grab hold of your now and move in your destiny move change and be now searching so long lost in the clouds trying to stay strong and make you proud make you proud took me some time took me some time now i see he resides he resides in me in me yeah","Freedom of Preach","2006"
