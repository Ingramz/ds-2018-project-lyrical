eltern gehort wo wir alle endlich platz ham david spielt im garten ich schau vom fenster aus mit inge zu die ehe lauft harmonisch ja fast so wie im bilderbuch neulich kam nach all den jahren wieder ne postkarte von monika aus lanzarote und sie schreibt sie wohnt jetzt da es ist doch komisch ha man sitzt in seinem mercedes rast an allem vorbei und merkt es erst dann wenn es zu spat ist jetzt ist mein leben doch schon aus mit sechsundvierzig ist doch kein wunder dass man dauernd deprimiert ist meine frau meint ich soll zum therapeuten doch ich brauch kein nicht so einen mein seelenklemptner bleibt n guter rotwein mit inge laufts auch nicht mehr so wie in den besten tagen denn seit den wechseljahren ist sie kaum noch fur sex zu haben david bleibt meine einzige motivation in dieses doofe buro geh ich doch bloss fur meinen sohn wir tun doch alles fur ihn ham uns den arsch aufgerissen und er hat den tauchkurs schon nach vierzehn tagen geschmissen manchmal glaub ich wir lassen ihm zu viel freiheit david vergiss nicht um zehn musst du daheim sein jetzt bin ich dreisssig jahre in der firma und das feiern wir mein chef uberreicht mir ne munze mit dem firmenlogo eingraviert und bei den meisten zahl ich hier bereits zum alten eisen aber den youngsters kann ich immer noch das wasser reichen ich werd es allen zeigen dass ich noch was beweg auch wenn sie meinen meine programmiersprachen sind nicht mehr up to date na gut ich hab vielleicht paar graue haare doch das soll nicht heissen dass ich nichts mehr an energie und power habe nur die familie macht mir grade bisschen sorgen ich will dass david studiert nur daraus ist bisher noch nichts geworden er sagt zu mir immer nur live your dreams doch ohne ausbildung wird das nicht gehn denn dann wird er mal nix verdienen und inge wird nicht grade attraktiver mit den jahren drum geh ich aus und entdeck den reiz fur liebe zu bezahlen ich ruf sie an und sage schatz heut komm ich spater heim hab da n projekt das muss bis morgen fruh erledigt sein und mit meinen inlineskates halt ich mich fit und gesund und auch wenn ich bald sechzig bin fuhl ich mich immer noch jung doch dann kommt die uberraschung david kriegt nen sohn von seiner mona den kleinen lothar verdammt jetzt bin ich opa es hiess ich sei ein teil der firma daran andert sich nichts denn in der abteilung sei noch keiner langer als ich sie sagten sie brauchten wirklich mehr manner wie mich dann ham sie mir die hand gedruckt und mich in rente geschickt und jetzt sitzt auf meinem stuhl ein andrer hinterm schreibtisch und ich los die kreuzwortratsel in der fernsehzeitschrift denn ich langweil mich so ohne beruf und bin nur glucklich wenn mich mal der kleine lothar besucht ja ich brauche was zu tun und deshalb geh ich in den garten ich stutz die hecken jate unkraut und mah den rasen und im winter sind wir wirklich niemals eingeschneit denn dann steh ich um sechs uhr auf und raum die einfahrt frei und auch wenn ich von meinen freunden schon die namen vergess und mein mercedes eigentlich kaum noch die garage verlasst weil immer wenn ich im schritttempo durch die strassen schleich gleich alle hupen und brullen ey jetzt fahr schon du tattergreis will ich kein leben auf dem abstellgleis weil ich noch power hab nur in letzter zeit bin ich bei meinem arzt n dauergast denn laufend hab ich irgendwelche wehwehchen und sind die einen vorbei dann kommen die nachsten meine augen werden schlechter und mein kopf wird kahl ich krieg ne dicke brille und ne grosse prostata ich bin so schwach dass ich im winter nicht mehr schneeraumen kann und meine hose fuhlt sich oft wien feuchter teebeutel an ich hab mein leben lang gebuckelt und was hab ich davon ne minirente und nen sohn der jedes jahr einmal kommt und ich bin so froh dass es inge gibt denn ohne ihre hilfe ging es nicht und wenn ich aufsteh wird mir schwindelig und deshalb lieg ich eigentlich bloss noch in meinem bett herum und statt auf wiedersehen hor ich nur gute besserung inge sagt ich werd schon wieder kerngesund wenn ich nur immer brav meine pillen nehm doch ich kenn sie zu gut und ich spur wenn sie lugt und ich fuhl genau dass alle wissen was hier geschieht ich hab kein bock mehr die bloden medikamente zu nehm seh zu den alten photos ruber die am fensterbrett stehen ich mit inge frischverliebt am markusplatz die einschulung von david das bild von ihm zum vatertag die firmenurkunde die ich zur rente bekam und ich vorm weihnachtsbaum mit meinem enkel im arm vor meinen augen zieht nochmal mein ganzes leben vorbei ich wollte so vieles machen und hatte so wenig zeit david lachelt mich an inge halt meine hand und ich will nur noch schlafen man bin ich mude verdammt","Manfred Mustermann","2003"
