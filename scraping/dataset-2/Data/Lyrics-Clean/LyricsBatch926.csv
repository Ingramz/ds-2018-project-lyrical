"Richie Ray","yo adivino el parpadeo de las luces que a lo lejos van marcando mi retorno son las mismas que alumbraron con sus palidos reflejos hondas horas de dolor y aunque no quise el regreso siempre se vuelve al primer amor la vieja calle donde me cobijo tuya es su vida tuyo es su querer bajo el burlon mirar de las estrellas que con indiferencia hoy me ven volver volver con la frente marchita las nieves del tiempo platearon mi sien sentir que es un soplo la vida que veinte anos no es nada que febril la mirada errante en las sombras te busca y te nombra vivir con el alma aferrada a un dulce recuerdo que lloro otra vez tengo miedo del encuentro con el pasado que vuelve a enfrentarse con mi vida tengo miedo de las noches que pobladas de recuerdos encadenen mi sonar pero el viajero que huye tarde o temprano detiene su andar y aunque el olvido que todo destruye haya matado mi vieja ilusion guardo escondida una esperanza humilde que es toda la fortuna de mi corazon volver con la frente marchita las nieves del tiempo platearon mi sien sentir que es un soplo la vida que veinte anos no es nada que febril la mirada errante en las sombras te busca y te nombra vivir con el alma aferrada a un dulce recuerdo que lloro otra vez","Volver","1971"
