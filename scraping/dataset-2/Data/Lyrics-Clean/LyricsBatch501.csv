"Jonathan Edwards","im as restless as a willow in a windstorm im as jumpy as a puppet on a string id say that i had spring fever but i know it isnt spring i am starry eyed and vaguely discontented like a nightingale without a song to sing oh why should i have spring fever when it isnt even spring i keep wishing i were somewhere else walking down a strange new street hearing words that i have never heard from a girl ive yet to meet im as busy as a spider spinning daydreams im as giddy as a baby on a swing i havent seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing but i feel so gay in a melancholy way that it might as well be spring it might as well be spring","It Might as Well Be Spring","2009"
"Jonathan Edwards","and now the purple dusk of twilight time steals across the meadows of my heart high up in the sky the little stars climb always reminding me that were apart you wander down the lane and far away leaving me a song that will not die love is now the stardust of yesterday the music of the years gone by sometimes i wonder how i spend the lonely nights dreaming of a song the melody haunts my reverie and i am once again with you when our love was new and each kiss an inspiration but that was long ago and now my consolation is in the stardust of a song besides the garden wall when stars are bright you are in my arms the nightingale tells his fairytale of paradise where roses grew though i dream in vain in my heart it will remain my stardust melody the memory of loves refrain","Stardust","2009"
