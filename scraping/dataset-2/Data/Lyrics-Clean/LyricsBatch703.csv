denn dieses album ist fur mich so wie ein eigenes kind wenn das kind spricht dann horst du reime mit sinn manchmal weint es die hatershow wie neidisch sie sind kriegen einen hohenflug obwohl das schiff eigentlich sinkt jede wahrheit aufs papier schreibe ich hin auch wenn du den die augen offnest bleiben sie blind seit mein schwager verstarb hab ich das lachen verlernt es fuhlt sich an als

der voll ist glaub daran wenn gott dir ne chance gibt auch wenn der porsche jetzt aus chrom ist sag was bringt dir das ganze wenn du dafur deinen stolz brichst und ware ich heute so wie sie oder wie er dann ware ich sicher millionar ich war gerade zu meinen mitmenschen und immer fair denn ich glaube an karma und weiss das alles wiederkehrt man hat versucht mich indirekt in eine ecke zu drangen deswegen lasse ich von euren rappern die texte verbrennen anscheinend sind eure herabwertende satze im trend jeder redet uber drogen uber knaste und gangs sie verleugnen die erziehung ihrer eltern und prahlen damit rum das sie mehr als alle geld haben mehr geld als sie oder er mehr als der der fur wenig geld trotz harter arbeit sein kind ernahrt mehr als der der vierzig stunden ackern geht nur damit am ende des tages auf dem tisch etwas warmes steht nur damit die kinder was zu essen kriegen rest in piece ihr drecks mcs habt fur mich nicht ein cent verdient die krassesten gangster in der szene mit dem krassesten hype wir haben alle schon verstanden das ihr die krassesten seid wir haben alle schon verstanden ihr habt waffen dabei ich raffe es nicht nein wann kriegen das die affen gepeilt und mit der zeit bete ich das eure patte nicht reicht ich bete das ihr alle fallt damit der hass euch befreit damit ihr endlich wach werdet und danach begreift das ihr ohne parra nichts seid

a job i thought i believed him security guard for a month and ended up leaving in fact i got fired because i was inspired by all of my friends to stage a robbery the third saturday i clocked in projects tore up gang signs get thrown up cocaine laced in marijuana and they wonder why i rarely smoke now imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth i was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even i made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding you know the reasons but still wont ever know my life kendrick aka comptons human sacrifice cocaine weed niggas been
