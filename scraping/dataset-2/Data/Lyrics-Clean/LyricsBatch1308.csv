"7th Poet","pasado el tiempo y an cambiado muchas cosas an surgido nuevos cantantes y nuevas modas pero el mundo sigue teniendo la misma escena alegrias pero tambien tristezas amor pero tambien odio y este que te habla ha caminado por sombras de valle de muerte conociendo las dos caras de la vida y recopelando episodios por episodio para traernos este dia y sembrarlos en tu consiencia a pasado el tiempo y an cambiado muchas cosas an surgido nuevos cantantes y nuevas modas ayer estuve muerto y hoy vivo miden mi lenguayo aquel que habia muertode la tumba salio y ahora contra ataca con lo que aprendio la voz de la experiencia con potencia regreso listen dia a dia canto mi presar y represento dia a dia tengo a todo el mundo mas adentro dia a dia tratan de quedarse con mi asiento pero dia a dia se que sigo siendo el mas violento porque los violentos somos los que arrebatamos el reino de los cielos donde nunca nos tiramos los que creamos musica madura y expresamos no es necesario pare que aprendamos y asi que estamos listen up kid sabes que le que traigo en accion mirando bien atento cual es tu reaccion como suena no es solo por la satisfaccion si no por la batalla contra la distraccion ra pap pap pa quita quita la risita sita que segun la mensaje que te ajita jita asi ke dime dime antes que opines pines canta algo que no solamente rime rime ah raperito que ya acabas de nacer ah que es lo que pasa que no te puedo entender ah que por el lado a quien queres aconsejar ah y por el lado me queres asesinar nino funny canta solamente por la fama y por el money aprendete mi lirica mas tirable como el broni alimenticio como el cereal del tigre tony y agradable como el honey abre los ojos y averigua por ti mismo que al que daran por muerto ha subido del avismo todo sucede siempre aunque muchos no quieran regreso como el zorro cuando menos se lo esperan ok yo lyrical traqui trac no traten de enganar al mundo y diciendo mil palabras por segundo porque no tiene sentido porque su contenido no es veral tratan de hacer algo especial pero terminan igual repeticiones muchos dan consejos pero no dan soluciones se obuscan de la fama para obtener posiciones buscando reacciones personatico pero con ese estilo el fracaso esta automatico maniatico rebelde y mas clemente de inocentes si quieres ser diferente no te quites mas lo delincuente porque ya es hora de que busques otra tactica pues tienes el talento pero te falta mucha practica ay va el regreso con el verdadero flow pues aquel que habbia muerto pues regresa con el muy largo yo y uno arrancando la semilla que no crese y poniendo en su lugar la que no carece frittirta el rapero llego el trero te di un hip hop papa el esh shu papa el que returtalo junto furtalo demonstrandome como el aguila que yo vuelo contaminando con el virus de mi bula muchas filosofias pero si con la palabra creando como trueno que extremese graduados de la academia de propisio 3 13 solo dice ser poem maestro de ceremonia y todos siendo el nuevo de pc check the flei va sho la de merci si le pone action dale paso al rey de reyes cuando llega tu section repartiendo las buenas nuevas de salvation a lo unico que le queda de la generation yo tengo un enemigo que me quiere aplastar chacucha cuchu cucha cucha pero cada vez que puedo voy a intentar chacucha cuchu cucha cucha agresivo vengo yo con el sonido destal chacucha cuchu cucha cucha con el permiso del papa ya no me puede imparar chacucha cuchu cucha jee tengo para la presion brega con la situacion habla con el corazon lucha por la bendicion vela por mi condicion porque la drogadiccion no respeta posicion tanto como tu educacion habran paso al novato asme caso tu forma de expresarte para el mundo es un atraso tu musica nos habla de aprender a dar plomasos mi musica te ensena a madurar y a dar pasos english translation passed the time and an changed many things arisen an new singers and new fashions but the world continues having the same scene alegrias but also sadnesses love but also hatred and this that speaks to you has walked by shades of death valley knowing the two faces the life and recopelando episodes by episode to bring this day to us and to seed them in your consiencia to passed the time and an changed many things arisen an new singers and new fashions i was dead and today alive yesterday that measures my lenguayo that habia muertode the tomb salio and now con attacks with which aprendio the voice of the experience with power return they list day to day song my presar and i represent day to day i have to everybody but inside day to day they try to remain with my seat but day to day that i continue being but the violent one because the violent ones we are those that we snatched the kingdom of skies where never we threw ourselves those that we created mature musica and we expressed it is not necessary stops that we learn and asi that estamos listen up kid you know that that i bring him in action watching well kind as is your reaction como sounds he is not single by the satisfaction if not by the battle against the distraction ra pap pap pa acquittal clears the giggle situated that segun the message that ajita jita you asi ke tell me tell me before think pins sing something that not only rime rime ah raperito that already you finish being born ah that it is what happens that i cannot understand ah to you that by the side to that queres to advise ah and by the side queres to assassinate to me boy funny only sings by the fame and the money aprendete my shotable lirica but like the broni nutritional like the cereal of the tony tiger and pleasant like the honey it is on the awares and it finds out by same you who to that you would daran by dead has raised of the avismo everything always happens although many do not want return as the fox at least is expected it ok lyrical i traqui trac does not try to deceive the world and saying thousand words per second because it does not have sense because its content is not veral they try to do something special but finishes equal repetitions many give advice but they do not give solutions they are obuscan of the fame to obtain positions looking for reactions personatico but with that style the failure this automatico rebellious and but merciful maniatico of innocents if you want to be different not you clear but the delinquent because it is already hour of which you look for another tactica then you have the talent but you need much practices ay goes the return with true flow then that that habbia died then it returns with very long i and one taking the seed that did not crese and putting in its place the one that does not lack frittirta the rapero i arrive the trero i gave to a hip hop pope you esh shu pope the one
