master plan to step up and put the mic in my hand everybody was there from junior high to high schools dyin to get busy because i knew i had the tools then i got the heart and went by the set i said yo i wanna rock the set yeah no sweat kickin rhymes in the place people couldnt take it the style i flowed the way i shaked and baked it later on i made a record and got recognition everybodys jockin now nobodys dissin written and produced by the new rap duo yes epmd now im known in school i see the backstabbers and the elderly creature features that used to diss me when i was tryin to reach the tip tip top and i wont stop to be the master in the field of hip hop i did that and got a name for myself the image of e and all of my wealth i see my fake friends but things aint the same oh what a shame i diss em who to blame it wasnt me it was the fame it wasnt me it was the fame before i cut records i had dreams of livin large earnin crazy cash flow the whole nine yards but when i told my college friends they kicked back and laughed said you better grab your books and take your behind to class they said you couldnt make a record and expect to get paid cause theres too many def rappers in the world today i said yo my name is m d and my style is def they said your name is parrish son youre like all the rest frontin you gettin a contract but then you fess but when you heard my record playin your mouth was wide open your head was tilted back that you was almost chokin but i just lounge and cool with the fellas like my roomie d wade top notch and james ellis i never hung with girls only one and she was mellow first name was terry last name romanello my records started sellin then p withdrew from the college southern con known as scsu but when i often go and visit they say p bust a rhyme i shake my head and then chuckle and throw up the peace sign they wanna feel my gold and sport my rolex but p reply its really nothin and dont like to flex and when i step up on the scene i always hear them whisper yo ps not the same did you see him diss you i go deep into my thoughts then i questioned my brain it wasnt me the money or the fortune it was the fame it wasnt me it was the fame oh now you wanna know me before you wasnt speakin now you watch yo mtv raps every weekend just to see me the e and the p coolin out on the scene with fab 5 freddy back then you didnt know that i was determined to be a def rapper with the name erick sermon to be a crowd mover someone that cause trouble then i thought and came up with e double i cant forget how they used to diss sayin he cant rap because he talks with a lisp but i got paid now you feel stupid amazed by the style the sound and how we looped it now i clock gs trunk jewels and star trims cool around town and flex my black benz definitely hooked up with the system that cranks livin well off with dinero in the bank epmd is erick parrish makin dollars always on tour so you can call us rhodes scholars you saw me in eighty seven where have you been because we miss you i dismissed you it wasnt me who dissed you it was the fame it wasnt me it was the fame as i freak a funky style to a funky fresh rhythm i use my crazy def talent that god has given me to flow slow and still live large to drop a def lp and catch mcs off guard because my friends started buggin we used to cool at the mall but on the s t the sneak tip they prayed for my downfall i used to cruise by in my rock and always hear them mumble they got lucky on strictly biz but watch the next one crumble my father always told me to wisen up son cause if you hung with nine broke friends youre bound to be the 10th one so i cut my friends off and p went for self me and erick sermon and no one else strictly writin def lyrics to my best ability with the crazy imagination as my only utility cause mcs around my way brag how def they are but now they workin full time and sharin their moms cars always frontin to the girls how hard you can rock but you leave out how you carpin to go punch the clock yeah we came hittin hard so all the talkin had to halt but dont blame us blame god its his fault for assistin us on the mission of a point of no return to do a crab mc who did not learn now when youre hot youre hot and when youre not youre not and when it comes to funky music the two rock the spot so next time you see me coolin bite your lip and respect
