old lady and her cars broken down up near the byantine winery you gotta help her man go sheba go rrraah rrraah so he sent him on his way and about that time dick glued back in his dentures glued back on his toupee stood in front of the mirror and said i feel sexy i wonder what julies doin all alone in that trailer i bet shes having trouble opening up a can of peaches right now ill bring along my blowtorch just to see if she needs help so he hiked a block down the road to the one bedroom trailer behind the bowling alley and he knocked on the door and julie answered the door and she said oh hello dick i was just having trouble opening up a can of peaches cmon in so he started up the blowtorch bwooh and all the peach juice ran down his veins and he poured it in the tupperware that julie used to sell in ocean beach and he said were goin on a picnic so he loaded julie into his 57 chevy and he drove her up right near the winery into the middle of the forest he took her and he tied her up to a tree and cut half of her top down and he said stick out your tongue then he put on forty two and a half tabs of brown acid that he still had from his woodstock days sprickled a little paote on her tongue just for good measure she saw all kinds of colors lemon yellow orange orange cherry red kaleidoscope eyes the world was on fire and about that time there was a mommy deer walking through the forest with a baby deer and dick cut down julies arm and he poured in some granola and he mixed it up with stricnine poison and he said oh cmere little deer i have some food for you look at julie and the mommy deer said oh i better eat it first because it could be poisonous and my heart is much stronger than yours child but really the mommy deer was just a glutton and wanted all the food and the mommy deer stuck her little mommy snout into julie s palm and it licked it mmmm mmmm and it said oh go ahead eat some but the mommys heart was much stronger and when the baby deer stuck her tongue into the palm of julies hand and licked it died flat shooby doo wop down and the mommy deer died shortly thereafter zippity doo wah out on the ground and dick cut julie down from the tree and he
