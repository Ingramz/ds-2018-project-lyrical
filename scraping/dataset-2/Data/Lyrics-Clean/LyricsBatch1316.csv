long what you just heard is real life its real life for you its real life for many its about where you been yet at the same time you hey you find yourself in the midst of conflict and turmoil yes im talking to you in the midst of conflict and turmoil cause you realize hey its time to change right now and in the middle of that i wanna say this the bible says that when i was a child i spoke as a child i understood as a child i fought as a child hey but when i became a man i put away those childish things did you not know that your environment has shaped you where you were born in the projects in the ghettos in the upper downtown wherever it was the people around you the things around you cause you to do strange things because you were seeking to learn but what you learned was on the streets and not in the book god called you a prophet when you open up your mouth everything of god comes out and it commands attention it commands change im talking about the power thats inside of you and in the midst when youre starting to understand that i caught the wrong message and now its time im hearing from god what amazing experience as you hear from god he said is there forth any man be in christ he is a new creation old things are passed away somebody needs to hear that and behold everything becomes new and when everything becomes new in you its time to stop the killing i said its time to stop the stealing its time to stop disrespecting our women its time for us to come home and raise our children its time for us to really mold our communities its time for us not to get hooked up in religion but to get hooked up in relationship with god and the amazing thing about it is wherever you find yourself right now you can confess and you can tell god im sorry i had the wrong cue i was doing the wrong thing i was going after things that i thought were right but it wasnt right and now that im getting it right im asking you to forgive me and i may have done the things that they said i did but im not who they say i am i am who you made me to be and im changing in that and it takes a few moments but every time i fall down ill get right back up and every time i make a wrong turn ill get myself back in line because i recognize i have been called for such a time as this you cant resist the change and youre not condemned by your yesterday if you can grab hold of your now and move in your destiny move change and be now searching so long lost in the clouds trying to stay strong and make you proud make you proud took me some time took me some time now i see he resides he

with me i heard every single word you say well you say it to me well it stays with me there was a man who wrote many things but carlyle said um that we could not be ruined because no lie could live forever william cullen bryan said truth crushed to earth would rise again and james russell lowell made it more plain that we would not be ruined or destroyed because he said that truth forever on the scaffold lies forever on the throne but that scaffold sways the future and behind the dim unknown standeth god within the shadow keeping watch above his own these powerful scriptures were also used by the man in whom we celebrate his birthday today dr martin luther king and dr king told us to practice non violence and the power of love non violence and the power of love has brought us thus far the agape love that we have for ourselves that we have for our people is the reason why our people in this particular diaspora called north america have not been totally ruined we have not been totally destroyed we have not been exterminated so therefore uh my dear brother um wasalu we thank you for what youve asked me to do and we shall continue to study to show ourselves approved under god workman that neednt not be ashamed rightly this dividing the word of truth and so at this time in this city where young mens lives are not worth much in this city where our people have been discriminated against and kept from the resources which we rightly deserve as a majority of people in the city we are dependent upon the most high creator of the ends of the world that i call elohim jehova and we are dependent upon him to keep us from falling to keep us from being ruined to keep us from being exterminated and we thank the almighty for the privilege of being here with my niece is to impart these words and i hope it would be of assistance in this project god bless you and thank you","Quotations From Chairman Fred","2018"
