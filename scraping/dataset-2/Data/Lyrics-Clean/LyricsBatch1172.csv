"The Residents","angakoks the eskimo men of magic are widely held as symbols ofmortal power among the tribe stories of their feats are very popular at tribal gatherings the whales whistled as the eskimo tribe danced on and on to the lively beatof the ceremonial band for twenty days they danced and sang and prayed and still the ice floe hugged the shore line preventing the eskimos from being able to kill their most valuable prey the large migrating whale anger had been building in the people towards the angakok who allegedly had the power to remove the ice that was blocking their passage finally a hunter challenged the magic of the angakok with hostile words and others soon joined him in the traditional taunt of necki necki necki until the angakok rose up before them and silenced them with a single cry a spell escaped from his lips and the sky darkened a curse slipped from his finger and the seas swelled the ice was cracking at last but that dull roar the eskimos looked at one another with fear in their weathered faces then it appeared a giant snake which stands on the water wiggled before them with its head in the clouds they briefly watched it eat a path through the ice floe then hysterically ran for safety but the water spout had one more job to do the hunter who challenged the angakoks magic was never seen again if an angakok is murdered in order to protect himself from itsspirit the murderer cuts off the angakoks toes and fingers and puts them in the dead mans mouth dead children are buried with a dogs head to protect the childin the afterlife if catastrophe is imminent all in the settlement exchange wivesin order to confuse the evil spirits eskimos have words for 40 varieties of snow","The Angry Angakok","1979"
"The Residents","arctic hysteria is a phenomenon that occurs in the dead of winter primarily to women the weeks of darkness and general sensory deprivation lead to the eventual temporary loss of a firm touch with reality darkness prevailed everywhere beside her igloo a woman sat in the windsinging softly to herself while beating the snow from her husbands seal fur clothing her voice and mind drifted with the soft tones of the nearby kooa player her song was about her work but her unfocused eyes revealed a growing distance the darkness seemed to confine her and the singing voice seemed not to be her own the realization struck i am dead or at least the others believe i am she thought already she hears the pounding of the tribes hands packing down the snow on her icy grave as they sing their song of farewell the rhythm of death sounds in her ears she feels cold no more as her worst fears are realized she has been sentto the land of the crestfallen where only the spirits of poor hunters and badly tatooed women spent eternity snapping at butterflies but wait even worse instead of butterflies the dreaded arctic locust swarmed into the evening air devouring all in their path the men in the tribe had become aware of the womans hysterical sufferingand joined in a circle to sing a chant of releasement chukaroq chukaroq chukaroq ei they sang until finally the woman once again returned to beating the snow mindlessly from her husbands clothing virtually unaware of what had happened as her song of work faded into the wind women cannot go out in moonlight eskimos believe the moon ismale and will impregnate women some newborn infants are killed secretly dried out and placedin a bag which is worn by a person or stuffed into a kayak nose this is said to improve hunting a menstruating woman is not allowed to go outside without firstbathing in the urine of a chile","Arctic Hysteria","1979"
"The Residents","since the most important person in the eskimo community is thehunter and since hunters are always male female infants are ritually killed if there is no infant male who will someday need a mate to cook sew and chew leather for him this social condition adds to the drama of birth the pains were coming in regular intervals and she knew that if she didntstart moving now her legs might collapse under her before she could reach the ice cave the ceremonial band was already playing birth music and the other women sang in an attempt to comfort her but as her steps carried her toward the ice cave and the ceremonial bands music became lost in the wind the true lonliness of her situation loomed even larger in her mind the gaping mouth of the ice cave eagerly awaited and although she felt fear she knew the cave also offered relief from her quickening pains for this journey had been made many times before her pace remained unchanged as she entered the cave which now enlargedbefore her and engulfed her in the sweet music of slowly moving ice vibrating within its own cristaline formations deeper into the cave she went the men were playing the kooa and chanting for the birth of a male finally she reached the furthest chamber where stood the angakok deliverybegan immediately as the magic man filled the room with protective prayers the child was born the eskimo woman reached forth with her hand gently across the already frozen crust on the infants belly to feel the childs sex the other women came into the chamber singing the song of life and bore the infant away if a good hunter dies the other men cut him up and rub thepieces on their spearheads to improve their aim bathing is done in urine eskimos eat only meat including rotten walrus which is said totaste like cheese","Birth","1979"
"The Residents","perhaps no holiday is more important to the eskimo than the deathfestival more than a tribute to the dead this festival marks the beginning of the yearly cycle by being held at the end of the six month eskimo night something moved in the dark a face as tall as a man a big round evil face wandered at random more faces and the realization the dead walk the snow whistling and chanting we have stolen the sun and you will have to live in darkness but the women of the ribe who were hiding in their igloos then rushed outshrieking and beating their chests proclaiming their right as the source of life the dead spirits were frightened by the women and fled into the darkness as the eskimo band picked up their song the women gathered in a circle symbolizing natures golden orb and sang a hymn asking the dead to return the sun to the mothers of the snow the men having removed their dead spirit masks joined the women infestive songs and hand clapping games until at last the first rays of sunlight of the eskimo year began to appear over the horizon signaling the end of six months of winter darkness gratefully the dead had released their hold once more","The Festival of Death","1979"
"The Residents","one of the many strange eskimo phenomena is the disappearance ofchildren in such inclumate conditions one can easily understand how this can happen however eskimo mythology speaks of children being stolen by the spirit of the weeping seal which is half seal and half woman and who because she can have no children must steal any she finds unguarded pop the bladders went hunting season had been good and there were manybladders to burst the band played gleefully eager to get to the next peak in the music so all could explore the inflated bladders the creatures which had fed and clothed the eskimos all year finally the music ended and everyone immediately ran toward the sea eager to throw the burst bladders through a hole in the ice so the souls of the animals could return to the sea and be caught again next year because of the excitement an important eskimo rule has been broken achild was left unattended tears froze on his cheeks as he stood crying behind an igloo suddenly there was another sound in the wind a whistle a bark a growling whine filled the air around the terrified child whirling him around in a flurry of ice the eskimo soon returned to discover that the child was missing andrealized the folly of their over excitement at the bladder festival the angakok started a chant to halt the fleeing spirit but he knew the chant would only delay the spirit of the weeping seals complete takeover of the child they would have to go to the world beneath the world and fight several dog sleds sped away across the tundra whips cracking at the barking dogs on the lead sled the childs father and the angakok crouched defending themselves against the blast of arctic wind the ride was long and tiring as they neared their destination the men sang a chant and the angakok spokea spell a dog which was brought before him was decapitated and the head still containing the dog spirit was quickly taken down to the neather world while the other dogs smelling the blood fo their own kind howled into the cold night the angakok raised the god head into the air and called forth its spirit to battlethe weeping seal and force it to return the stolen child the two spirits met and intertwined in the air with the northern lightsthey danced and sang and then they disappeared slowly as the men returned to their village in hopes that the child would be there","A Spirit Steals a Child","1979"
