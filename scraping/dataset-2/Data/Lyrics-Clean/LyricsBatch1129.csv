"Bill Anderson","when i first heard this song i was a little boy growing up down in the state of south carolina the song had been written and recorded by a man named t texas tyler the song in its original form related to something that happened during the second world war last year early in 1991 when things were going kinda crazy over on the other side of the world i remembered this old song and i rewrote the first part of it to fit the situation the second part of it i left like its been all of these years because you cant improve upon perfection id like to dedicate this tonight to all the veterans to their families their loved ones and everybody that loves this country it was a sweltering hot sunday morning in the saudi arabian desert and a young soldier sat alone in his tent deep in thought a picture of his wife and children back home in the united states rested on a table nearby his mind began to wander across the miles back to other sunday mornings that seemed so long ago now and so far away he thought of home and he knew that when this day dawned in america his family would go to church to pray for his well being and his safe return the young soldier reached into his bag and he took out a deck of playing cards he began to spread them out across his bunk about that time one of his buddies came by and said you gonna get up a game no the soldier replied im gonna spend a little quiet time with the lord looks like to me youre playing cards his friend said no you see i dont have my bible and since we cant display our religion in public here i brought along this deck of cards and with that the young boy started his story you see when i look at the ace it reminded me that there is but one god and the deuce reminds me that the bible is divided into two parts the old and the new testaments when i look at the trey i think of the father the son and the holy ghost when i see the four im reminded of the four evangelists who preached the gospel there was matthew mark luke and john and when i see the five i think of the five wise virgins who trimmed their lamps there were ten of them five were wise and were saved five were foolish and were shut out and when i look at the six im reminded that in six days god made this great heaven and earth the seven reminds me that on the seventh day god rested from his great work when i see the eight i think of the eight righteous persons god saved when he destroyed this old world there was noah his wife their three sons and their wives and when i look at the nine i think of the lepers our saviour cleansed and nine out of the ten didnt even thank him and when i see the ten i think of the ten commandments god handed down to moses on the table of stone when i look at the king it reminds me that there is but one king of heaven god almighty the queen reminds me of the blessed virgin mary queen of heaven and the jack or knave is the devil when i count the number of spots on a deck of cards i find 365 the number of days in a year theres 52 cards the number of weeks in a year theres 4 suits the number of weeks in a month theres 12 picture cards the number of months in a year theres 13 tricks the number of weeks in a quarter so you see my friend this deck of cards serves me as a bible as an almanac and as a prayer book and friends this story is true i know because i know that soldier","Deck of Cards","1991"
