to this event just wanna stay home and invent and somehow yeah that let me vent im taking shots and drinking liquor but that shit dont make a dent in how im feeling and yes im willing to keep chilling on this shit i know theres someone out there far away whos feeling all this shit and yes i know that when im low theres so much further i can go and so i look up to the sky to the sky like a single mother praying in a gadda da vida looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her praying to god wondering why her baby daddy beat her feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her all alone in the wintertime close to the heater wondering whats gonna happen and how the world gonna treat her how could her momma mislead her and her daddy just leave her like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever how could her momma mislead her and her daddy just leave her like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever how could her momma mislead her and her daddy just leave her like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever how could her momma mislead her and her daddy just leave her like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever how could her momma mislead her and her daddy just leave her like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever oh my so what now what advice can you give me what advice can i give humanity i suppose so live your life dont waste your days on the negative energy of others remember that youre not your salary youre not your house youre not your car and no matter how big your bank account is your grave is six feet under just like everyone elses so enjoy the days you have worry not bout the days that came before you nor the ones that will follow you in death remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed and the fact that you are living is what life is all about so live your life to the fullest according to your happiness and the betterment of all damn man weve been walking forever well thalias tracking system says well be there in just over an hour shit at least we got good walking music or is that it oh no man im cueing up the fourth album now his final one one two three four one two three four listen look into my eyes tell me you could see beyond the smile that im puttin on this front that im puttin up for you i spill my soul into a microphone with poems written in blood in hopes that its enough for you do you love me yet do you love me yet no okay ill go harder for you in fact i rap till i collapse all i wanted was acceptance my latest lesson ill never feel your approval till i accept my own come from a messed up home destitute and less informed about the ways to raise a child up to not become a product of his environment i need to cry and vent but i done built this wall up actin like everythings all good but in reality im lookin for something through bumpin my favorite rappers i came up after nas cole and hov eyes closed i zone till five or so in the morn im used to being alone shit you know how long ive been out on my own chasing dreams fantasies of a throne one day i wake up and see that it didnt exist all along till then i will pen verses that fans consider brilliant boosting my ego with every million that spills in and still then i wont find solace so wheres the logic in that worrying bout if they think logic could rap when it all goes back to a childhood need to be loved by parents that was in too deep with the drugs nigga my advice fuck the black and white shit be who you are identify as a star no one tells you youre that its something that you just know the world be stealing your glow your mama did what she could her life was miles from good your father fell in the trap they set for you when you black they met when they was low and therefore you a product of that and so your trauma is deep dont bury it you should weep and clean it out of your system then truly forgive em just my opinion only then can you find peace just start to notice happiness dont come from album release ive been through it before can only share with you what i know to be true but at the same time ill never be you and youll never be me no matter how hard that you try this is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly the truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky but if you want to then you ought to know why are you running from something with hopes of becoming someone thats finally worthy of love let me tell you now youre worthy enough fuck approval from strangers that shit is dangerous as hell find god learn to accept yourself and im gone accept him","AfricAryaN","2017"

ever wanted was happiness all he ever wanted was positivity all he ever wanted to do was entertain and this boy went through hell you gotta understand his mother was racist which is crazy cause how in the fuck is you gonna have all these black babies with black men but you racist like bitch that dont make sense but it is what it is you know he grew up her callin him a nigger the kids at school callin him a cracker identifying as black looking as white being told what you can or cant be this kid went through everything he went through he saw narcotics in the household violence murderers drug dealers he was kidnapped there was crazy shit that happened to this kid and he persevered while the whole world said what they said said said said you wouldnt be shit you aint gon be nothin nothin nothin nothin and i and he he said fuck that imma persevere and thats why the message is always peace love and positivity see he always saw things from two sides he always saw things from two sides he always knew that the message everybody was born equal regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation he knew that because he saw that because he was stripped and torn down by his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated and that did not know and he was stripped and he was torn down by his white side that did not know these people that are ignorant they cannot see the bigger picture that must fight and kill and murder each other but once again all he ever wanted to do was spread a message of equality for every man woman and child regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation now imagine this child growing up and seeing the craziest shit being a part of the craziest shit running around with the wrong people running around with guns and knives and fighting and stealing and all this because he didnt know he didnt know but he knew deep down in his heart that it wasnt right and he knew that he needed to get away from it now i want you to also imagine that at 17 years old this child okay leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings and then he would then come home to about 8 or 9 hours of sleep but spend 4 5 6 hours of that working on music persevering grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror and pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people just chanting his name hoping that it would happen but the but the but the world said no mothafucka little mothafucka no no no no no no no no ya nigga ya cracka ya white boy ya black mothafucka no no and he said fuck that he said peace love and positivity he said equality for all man regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation yeah now i also want you to imagine people telling him that he did not live this life you just a white boy you aint never experienced that shit you from gaithersburg maryland nothing happens there oh no no we no we werent there we didnt live with you in your section 8 household we didnt live with the narcotics and violence in your household we just saw it from the outside outside outside outside and since you white you gotta have money right and this young man persevered in spite of what people told him he was wasnt would and would never be and that man is here today proud a lover of all human beings regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation yeah yeah and hes here to say even though were all born and created equal were not treated equally theres extremists on every side and you should just do your best to live life
