busy race no matter what yer doing if you start givin up if the wine dont come to the top of yer cup if the winds got you sideways with with one hand holdin on and the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone and yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it and the woods easy findin but yer lazy to fetch it and yer sidewalk starts curlin and the street gets too long and you start walkin backwards though you know its wrong and lonesome comes up as down goes the day and tomorrows mornin seems so far away and you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin and yer rope is a slidin cause yer hands are a drippin and yer sun decked desert and evergreen valleys turn to broken down slums and trash can alleys and yer sky cries water and yer drain pipes a pourin and the lightnins a flashing and the thunders a crashin and the windows are rattlin and breakin and the roof tops a shakin and yer whole worlds a slammin and bangin and yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm and to yourself you sometimes say i never knew it was gonna be this way why didnt they tell me the day i was born and you start gettin chills and yer jumping from sweat and youre lookin for somethin you aint quite found yet and yer knee deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air and the whole worlds a watchin with a window peek stare and yer good gal leaves and shes long gone a flying and yer heart feels sick like fish when theyre fryin and yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet and you need it badly but it lays on the street and yer bells bangin loudly but you cant hear its beat and you think yer ears might a been hurt or yer eyesve turned filthy from the sight blindin dirt and you figured you failed in yesterdays rush when you were faked out an fooled white facing a four flush and

yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it and yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head and yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead and the lions mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth and his jaws start closin with you underneath and yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind and you wish youd never taken that last detour sign and you say to yourself just what am i doin on this road im walkin on this trail im turnin on this curve im hanging on this pathway im strolling in the space im taking in this air im inhaling am i mixed up too much am i mixed up too hard why am i walking where am i running what am i saying what am i knowing on this guitar im playing on this banjo im frailin on this mandolin im strummin in the song im singin in the tune im hummin in the words im writin in the words that im thinkin in this ocean of hours im all the time drinkin who am i helping what am i breaking what am i giving what am i taking but you try with your whole soul best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kind of thoughts gain ground or make yer heart pound but then again you know why theyre around just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down cause sometimes you hearem when the night times comes creeping and you fear that they might catch you a sleeping and you jump from yer bed from yer last chapter of dreamin and you cant remember for
