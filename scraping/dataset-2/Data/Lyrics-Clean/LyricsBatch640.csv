second album in higher than a motherfucka drunker than a motherfucka with my boys and im thinking damn man 5 years ago we were dead broke chilling in cleveland everyday and the next thing you know people are calling us about record deals and you know the crazy part is ashleigh rented this white nissan altima for me and slim so we could drive out to new york i think she had to some work some shit or something like that so she couldnt go so we were gonna go out there and see what these labels were talking about and im driving us there but my licenses suspended so i tell slim im like yo i gotta pull up before we get to new york and switch so you can drive in case we get pulled over cause we got pulled over the last time we went there but you know he had a license so it made sense for him to drive so cut to like 7 and a half hours later i pull over in this emergency lane and right as im opening the door to switch with slim boom this fucking car going full speed on the highway swerves off the road and smashed into us yo i swear to god i woke up half my bodys laying outside the car in a ditch like 15 20 feet away from where we just were the car was totaled the windows were smashed it was cold as fuck it was raining outside but we were we were actually okay i mean my boy had to go the hospital you know the ambulance came and shit he ended up being alright but our meetings with the record label started at 2 and we didnt have no car and now we were stuck in a fucking hospital in new jersey so this dude that i ended up partnering with later on his names james mcmillan he comes and gets us to these meetings and shit somehow someway i dont know if it was just because we just got into a crazy car crash and couldve died a couple of hours ago but im in there and like you know im not feeling this shit man im not feeling this record label shit and a we drove back to cleveland now im back in ashleighs moms basement im thinking about life you know im on a shit ton of vicodin cause the doctors at the hospital you know gave us something cause we got into that car accident and ashleigh runs downstairs and shes like yo yo kells kells youre not gonna believe who wants to talk to you right now im like who shes like hes gonna call you in 30 seconds now i guess when i was in new york i had made some kinda noise cause this dude named byron who ended up becoming my manager later on took this video i had called chip off the block over to bad boy and showed harve pierre and harve pierre went and showed that vid to a guy named puff so i answer my phone depressed down fucked up on vicodin and i hear please hold i have mister sean combs for you i said god damn lifes about to change man i felt it and sometimes thats all it takes its just that
