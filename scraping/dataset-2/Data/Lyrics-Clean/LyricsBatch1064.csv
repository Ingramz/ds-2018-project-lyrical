"Suzi Jane Hokom","don lowance the man who plays guitar with me and i were born in a small town and we kinda think it was a different sort of small town because in our town we had a dragon and people used to make up stories about the dragon sinse the stories were made up most of them started once upon a time there was a very friendly dragon except people didnt have any way of knowing that the dragon was friendly so they shot at him with guns and threw rocks at him and the dragon being a sort of a poor sport he ate a lot of those people up now the dragon was messing up their senses something fierce until one day he wandered into the store that sold spirits and after making a fast brunch of the owner and four emplyees he broke into this wine barrel and that did it from that day on the dragon was not only a friendly dragon he was a happy friendly dragon and now all he does is walk up and down the streets of our small town and tap people on their shoulders and ask them for a little change so he can buy some of that stuff that he likes better than people buddy can you spare a dime for a little glass of wine buddy dont you pity me just one drink then ill be in a world all my own the only place i call home where no hurt can get to me and no one but me can see pretty flowers dance and sing laughter is a common thing where no hate has ever been cause i wont let it in by the warm purple flame every little grape calls my name as it climbs on the fire and makes the fire burn higher higher than its ever been time and space mean nothing then i fall about a mile or two so pardon me if i ask you buddy can you spare a dime and thats the story of the little town that don and i was born in and our dragon fairly strange story","First Street Blues [#]","2013"
