camp i imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes i hadnt met yet running around all summer getting into trouble it turned out it would be me and just one girl thats you and were still at camp as long as were on the bus and not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us were still wearing our orange camp t shirts we still smell like pine needles i like you and you like me and i more than like you but i dont know if you do or dont more than like me youve never said so i havent been saying anything all summer content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me and choosing to do so again the next day and so on a girl whos smart and funny and who if i say something dumb for a laugh is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh but who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way i could never be a girl who reads books that no ones assigned to her whose curly brown hair has a line running through it from where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet back in the real world we dont go to the same school and unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood we wont go to the same high school so this is kind of it for us unless i say something and it might especially be it for us if i actually do say something the suns gone down and the bus is quiet a lot of kids are asleep were talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop that looks like a kid we know and then im like can i tell you something and all of a sudden im telling you and i keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming and your face is there and gone and there and gone as we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway and theres no expression on it and i think just after a point im just talking to lengthen the time where we live in a world where you havent said yes or no yet and regrettably i end up using the word destiny i dont remember in what context doesnt really matter before long im out of stuff to say and you smile and say okay i dont know exactly what you mean by it but it seems vaguely positive and i would leave in order not to spoil the moment but theres nowhere to go because were are on a bus so i pretend like im asleep and before long i really am i wake up the bus isnt moving anymore the domed lights that line the center aisle are all on i turn and youre not there then again a lot of kids arent in their seats anymore were parked at the pick up point which is in the parking lot of a methodist church the bus is half empty you might be in your dads car by now your bags and things piled high in the trunk the girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time disembarking as i swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus just as one of them reaches my row it used to be our row on our way off its michelle a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week after throwing rocks at my head adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body wise she stops and looks down at me and her head is blasted from behind by the dome light so i cant really see her face but i can see her smile and she says one word destiny then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh and then she turns and leads them off the bus i didnt know you were friends with them i find my dad in the parking lot he drives me back to our house and camp is over so is summer even though theres two weeks until school starts this isnt a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad this is a story about how i learned something and im not saying this thing is true or not im just saying its what i learned i told you something it was just for you and you told everybody so i learned cut out the middle man make it all for everybody always everybody cant turn around and tell everybody everybody already knows i told them but this means there isnt a place in my life for you or someone like you is it sad sure but its a sadness i chose i wish i could say this was a story about how i got on the bus a boy and got off a man more cynical hardened and mature and shit but thats not true the truth is i got on the bus a boy and i never got off the bus i still havent","That Power","2011"

una novia con un apellido bonito larita mi primer beso de amor se caso la bruja lluvia con sol alla abajo en el hueco en el boquete nacen flores por ramillete casitas de colores con la ventana abierta vecinas de la playa puerta con puerta que yo tengo de todo no me falta nada tengo la noche que me sirve de sabana tengo los mejores paisajes del cielo tengo una neverita repleta de cerveza con hielo un arcoiris con sabor a piragua gente bonita rodeada por agua los difuntos pintados en la pared con aerosol y los que quedan jugando basketball un par de gringos que me danan el paisaje vienen tirando fotos desde el aterrizaje la policia que se tira sin pena rompiendo mi casa pa cobrar la quincena aqui nacio mi mae y hasta mi bisabuela este es mi barrio y yo soy libre como mandela cuidado con la vieja escuela que no te coja que te va a meter con chancleta y palo de escoba asi que no te me pongas majadero porque yo vengo con apetito de obrero a comerme a cualquiera que venga a robarme lo mio yo soy el napoleon del caserio oye esto se lo dedico a los que trabajan con un sueldo bajito pa darle de comer a sus pollitos yo quiero a mi barrio como tito quiere a jaimito yo no lucho por un terreno pavimentado ni por metros cuadrados ni por un sueno dorado yo lucho por un paisaje bien perfumado y por un buen plato de bistec encebollado por la sonrisa de mi madre que vale un millon lucho por mi abuela meciendose en su sillon lucho por unos pinchos al carbon y por lo bonito que se ve la perla desde un avion oye dile alla abajo en el hueco en el boquete nacen flores por ramillete
