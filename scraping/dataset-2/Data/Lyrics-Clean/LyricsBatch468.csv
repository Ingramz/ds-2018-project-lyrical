me she told me theres a higher power and a lower power and that ill die if i dont find the strength to overpower then i replied well arent we all she said yeah but that should be on gods terms not

that ill be back on my feet again please help me but they act like im more than human i prove them wrong again dont fault me im only human tryin to weather the storm i thought that black cloud was gone its been beside me all along not the song i wanna sit in silence dont speak for a minute tired of being strong please let me be weak for a minute kinda thought that my disease tried to kill your man first it was easy to get my hands on 30 milligram percs worse cant be depression couldnt have it this long so many secrets i only told through a glass of patron my nigga speaking of secrets thats when i got the kaylintext read it and cried couldnt believe what she was saying next she said youre going through a lot im hoping you aint in the grave and dead cause not too many people know your brains a mess who knew that she was keeping track of it all i wrote back lol but wasnt laughing at all i aint tell her just the other day that that gun was in my lap pen and pad in my hand and i was writing a note didnt get far as soon as i wrote down mom i just stopped couldnt lie to her couldnt figure out how to say bye to her couldnt explain the why to her couldnt picture her getting a call or somebody saying her son had died to her and shortly after that my pastor called which at first i kinda thought it was weird but that convo preserved me bout gods grace and mercy he aint even say goodbye he said let us pray and then he went into a prayer gripped the phone closed my eyes just so happy he appeared nigga shed another tear maybe he could sense that something had the god devoured just thankful he shed some light upon my darkest hour all my thoughts are corrupt this shit is whack if everybody calls you a duck will you just quack guess a part of me really gives a fuck way in the back cause when i had that burner ready to bust i didnt clap joe my every thought is scary and it makes it hard to breathe again like im blinded while im staring in the mirror asking god to help me see again please help me but he tells me im only human and that ill be back on my feet again please help me but they act like im more than human i prove them wrong again dont fault me im only human guess im insanitys definition trying to step over in sanitys repetition but i cant it got me tripping whatever love we had was dead that night looking back we both needed cooler heads that night was going off no sleep eyes red that night while you was drunk texting me i hope i read that right you was beefing bout giselle beefing bout alexa suddenly you was jealous mustve thought that i had sexed her i was laughing thought it was funny giselles the homie alexas twenty with hip withdrawals nothing bout your story shoulda been sticking at all i wouldnt dick her at all im guessing maybe you were insecure and never knew me was there for four months yet you said this was a new me in your head guess the answer to this jealousy was to turn around and try to make me jealous b but the part that you neglect was never mind jealousy this was bout respect yall instagramming pictures trying to get me upset you turned that into a night we both would never forget we both said some things we both probably regret you was lying to my face and them dots didnt connect but cool only picked you up to try and talk sense into you now im fucking homeboy up just off the principle i guess he caught him self antagonizing me but hes a young nigga thats no surprising me shit i done fucked some of the baddest hoes i left shorty weeks ago you can have this ho i guess the part where i lose is now they got my face plastered all over the news im being falsely accused and i dont understand was this all part of a plan i guess ill tell the whole truth when on the stand how you go and tell the cops i had guns in my house now they got a search warrant just to come to my house question were your feelings worth taking my tomorrows kid and you know jersey gun laws im talking hollow tips so you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want but you and i know whats going on nigga that whole night just replays in my mind your face is fine this is a big waste of time lets get back to that jealousy now you got a nigga facing three felonies all for what cause we were no longer dealing you attack me but im the villain over a fucking iphone and feelings check you never see me act like a jerk i know women will provoke you and get mad when it works rather reserved and that always makes matters the worst cause i go on about my business and not act like it hurts but wait so now the whole world is watching me get burned here which is fine theres a lesson to be learned here which is only fuck with strippers and the bartenders anytime theres a pole in the bar centered so even though its from afar now i still wish you the best i know your hearts tender im sorry all i just got my own scars to tend to signing off truly yours with love gods sinner my every thought is scary and it makes it hard to breathe again like im blinded while im staring in the mirror asking god to help me see again please help me but he tells me im only human and that ill be back on my feet again please help me but they act like im more than human i prove them wrong again dont fault me im only human my every thought is scary and it makes it hard to breathe again like im blinded while im staring in the mirror asking god to help me see again please help me but he tells me im only human and that ill be back on my feet again please help me but they act like im more than human i prove them wrong again
