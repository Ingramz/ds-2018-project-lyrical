scarlet pimpernel i put a night shift in with dante on his journey into hell and thats what well all be facing if the yards put up to sell for the only life yeve known is in the shipyard now what about those trojan wars and the troubles that they caused when they sailed off on that summers afternoon aye the ship they had was crap and theyd lost the effin map when they tried to get their selves

you tempt the gods with arrogance and hubris well its obvious im gifted with the rhymin and the meter and hereabouts im thought of highly as a bard if i wasnt shooting rivets id be famous in me time
