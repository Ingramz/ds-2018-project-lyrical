"Elvira Madigan","through the woods between stem and bark blackened by an eerie sky a moonlit night high on her heels above the icecold snow thunders demons thrilled by the chase to be the one to hunt her down to seize the price for the damage done and bring this demigod to justice before the grand duke of hell and of her life as well little pity will be shown for her insubordination be gone two thousand souls on killing spree yet the first to reach her is struck by pity and to his lord and master he means no disrespect in letting her go there is but many who die this day as the most crestfallen of angels are slain the wrath bestowed on them all is tenfold greater than heavens fall when the dearest of possessions are lost for the folly of one apprentice there is no pain severe enough no sentence matching the crime that has been done here finally she is free to roam the earth and all of the above","Crestfallen","2003"
