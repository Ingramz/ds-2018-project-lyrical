quite suddenly well if something s gonna come whens it coming while youre jumping on the spot all the freshness starts to rot and another inspiration fades away and still you sell your dignity still you sell your dignity time after time and i wonder where lies your pride does it wait in there inside is it waiting for the moment when you let your heart speak is it waiting for the moment when you act out your own beliefs is it waiting for the moment when you drop your false act is it waiting for the moment when you face the facts that youre pumping your life for someone else s ideas that youre living your life under someone else s fear that its time to shift your vision time to move your head get up out of submission im counting heads how many are left the fingers of one hand keep stretching the fingers of both hands keep stretching and all i see is rock n roll all i hear is rock n roll i turn the pages of the book and force my weary eyes to look at the product of our modern world at the product of our civilised world and a child s face looks out at me questioning why does this have to be and i cant find any answer not that dead ears can hear do i make myself clear its been said that we must progress for humanity but looking at the truth of that mockery i wonder if our minds have progressed anywhere and i wonder if theres any humanity there the sightless eyes
