"Donald Shaw","last night i dreamed my head was in fever last night i dreamed it never was so far to reach the shore of safety and redemption and a gaze upon the bright morning star i dreamed i was by friends all put abandoned i dreamed i was alone but for my scars and blinded by the tears that fell like water no more to see the bright morning star the streets of dreams never looked this lonely the streets of dreams never felt this hard and i heard my voice barely of a whisper as the clouds denied the bright morning star sometimes this life is no more than a moment and sometimes this light is lost unto the dark but courage hears the sound of dawn approaching and each our own bright morning star i woke to find every window open i woke to find the heavy door jar and i walked outside and stood upon the hilltop and gazed one small bright morning star i walked outside and every bird was singing as i found again my bright morning star","Bright Morning Star","2014"
"Donald Shaw","well i know it aint been roses lately baby its just been thorns and no matter what we do nothing seems to change love has always been my shelter for you its been a storm but for a while i thought wed almost beat the rain now theres a hole here in my pocket where all my dreams have gone fallen out like so many nickels and dimes and last of all you youd always been my good luck charm i shouldve known that lucks a waste of time cause it dont bring you love if you dont love and it dont bring you time if you aint got time and it dont bring you strength baby if you aint strong and it dont bring you kindness if you aint kind now theres a whole lot of life to be unsure of but theres one thing i can safely say i know that of all the things that finally desert us pride is always the last thing to go but it wont bring you love if you dont love and it wont bring you time if you aint got time and it wont bring you strength baby if you aint strong and it wont bring you kindness if you aint kind and now i wish you only roses baby without the thorns and i hope your dreams are always within reach and i wish you shelter baby from all your storms they scared you but they never seemed to teach that i cant bring you love if you dont love and i cant bring you time if you aint got time and i cant bring you strength baby if you aint strong and i cant bring you kindness if you aint kind and i cant bring you kindness if you aint kind","It Don't Bring You","2014"
"Donald Shaw","i can tell by the way youre walking you dont want company ill let you alone and ill let you walk on and in your own good time youll be back where the sun can find you under the wise wishing tree and with all of them made well lie under the shade and call it a jubilee and i can tell by the way youre talking that the past isnt letting you go but theres only so long you can take it all on and then the wrongs gotta be on its own and when youre ready to leave it behind you youll look back and all that youll see is the wreckage and rust that you left in the dust on your way to the jubilee and i can tell by the way youre listening that youre still expecting to hear your name being called like a summons to all who have failed to account for their doubts and their fears they cant add up to to much without you and so if it were up to me id take hold of your hand saying come hear the band play your song at the jubilee and i can tell by the way youre searching for something you cant even name that you havent been able to come to the table simply glad that you came when you feel like this try to imagine that were all like frail boats on the sea just scanning the night for that great guiding light announcing the jubilee and i can tell by the way youre standing with your eyes filling with tears that its habit alone that keeps you turning for home even though your home is right here where the people who love you are gathered under the wise wishing tree may we all be considered then straight on delivered down to the jubilee because to people who love you are waiting and theyll wait just as long as need be when we look back and say those were halcyon days were talking about jubilee","Jubilee","2014"
