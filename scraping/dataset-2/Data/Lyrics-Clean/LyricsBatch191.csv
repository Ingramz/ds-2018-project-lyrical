amazed the world was raging a shattered race in this broken land this child came to resto re like an order from the gods the queen and all the children gathered around the chambers where the elder ones are joined in sleep profound in wrath she crush the tanks of crystal glass the crimson water gushed on to the ground in the unholy mace cration their souls no longer cried die their gift are denied [she drinks the life blood from the feebled man empty bodies soul drained by the vrigin queen finally given the pleasure to die she aligns the hate inside their hearts her chosen knights will make sure all life departs soon comes the end of all she watched a chamber fall she heard her master call ] live my words oh sacred child youre soon to leave this world defiled then what awaits me my lord trust me my child your wishes shall not be ignored and then he spoke his mind now his will is hers the earth shall fall the eternal curse is cast on the sands they walk now you must use your

ceased to be the people worshiped their queen such beauty before her time was unseen their were fooled by her presence and disguise faithfully they listened and swallowed all her lies the times are changing re arranging he pattern of our lives so let your heart stop beating beneath this twisted sky they were embraced by sadness but not afraid to die so pass this sacred dagger and let yourself fly free so pretend youre dreaming and rise above this world of you and me [liar all those who died with you by their side were denied access to the higher ground betrayal eternal detest from the ones left unblessed so possessed their last caress was your knife in their hearts fed from her deed watching them bleed in her own conceit a world to delete lies at her feet her demon inside do no longer hide showing its face of hate and disgrace leaving their saviour unpraised ] the ones who didnt follow now sharing this moment of grief the end of their own existence in death they had no belief despite all the faith in their queen they couldnt believe what they had seen what was the reason for this sacrifice nothing is gained from this great demise after the ordeal we know she has the powers to decieve us all but their dream of sons and daughters has made them standing tall for the king had showed them it could be done when his woman gave birth to the sacred one but is she of man made of flesh and blood or is she the offspring of the unholy a leader was chosen to unveil the hidden truth the brave ones were gathered the strongest were sent to the queen her reason to be must be known after many moons the troopsreach the temple of their majesty guarded by a hundred faithful knights there is no escape theres no entry to her sacred halls is our vision true or false they rtied to find the answer but they were led astray into a maze of slumper far from the light of day the riddle remained unanswered the queen could read ones mind make sure that no one will find the reason for her mission here the highness writhe in anger her trust had been betrayed the queen was filled with langour her decision has been made she would unleash her hate destined to devastate she heard her demons roar marching into war the spirit of their beloved king ho spoke unto his men he came to bring a message of great importance and trust the gift from the gods has come to cover the world in dust her forces are closing in to your sanctuary so use your imagination to end her reign remember these words and be strong the chosen few were sacrificed for the others life they were the bait they would seal the soldiers fate a massive grave to break the soldiers spell the forces fell into the abyss never to rise again towards the queen the last of the brave ones wandered to terminate this creature non divine the loss of troops forced her powers to release the magic uncontrolled that had wasted a thousand soul the palace controlled by demons is the heart of all evil pos sessed by the queen and her unholy servants if we destroy it the earth will be ours and it will bring us eternal existance well pray for the gift of breeding this is a game we cant concede it is worth all the blood we may bleed we must close the gate so she cant return well seal her fate watch her temple burn and well capture her soul in the chambers of crimson sleep and there she will suffer eternally for what she has done to man we fought our way into her dwelling place we searched the corridors of this infernal maze to seek our enemy the one to slay we are the ones we will not obey a disillusioned servant with great knowledge in her secrets we found him walking aimlessly trying to find his peace he said cover her eyes they are the root of her inhuman forces then shes just the child you thought she disconnect all her sources  they found a way to blind her and it could cost some lives but they must seal the entry from where all evil derives two of the brave ones were sent to distract her while the others made their way to behind her throne she saw her enemies for the last time as their leader covered her eyes we saw the return of innocence the symbol of purity we once knew we carried her to the chambers to forever lock up her soul and now the reborn earth blessed with the gift of birth can see her in this cage that eternally preserves her rage they captured all her soldiers and forever encaged their cries they had found a new leader to worship a king with her clear blue eyes","Crimson","1996"
