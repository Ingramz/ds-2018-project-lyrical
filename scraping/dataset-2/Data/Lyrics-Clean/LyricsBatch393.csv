"Jack Bruce","ive climbed this hill too many times now passion seems like its a crime my memories leaves dead on the line tomorrows finished all that fine fine wine ive run this road so many years remembering how i lived each curve and now my screens filled up with tears i cant see through the pain i learned no future now without the fear ill get too near to love that burns the night was once the night was twice the night was mine i dealt in dreams until they faded into ghosts in headlong flight felt every mile that i paid for reaching out towards the light the dancers thought it was a raid and disappeared into the night that once was mine ive sailed the storm so many ways desires vanish in the haze theres only ashes from the blaze the futures losing all the long love days ive flown these skies both dark and light but now my hearts blocked up with snow most moments felt so very right but i cant break the ice that grows no morning now without the chance of petals falling from the rose the night was once the night was twice the night was mine i traded steel until it fractured into fields of crumbling rust all the precautions that i packed were colors i could never trust the swimmers getting out of sight shes disappeared into the night that once was mine i traded steel until it fractured into fields of crumbling rust all the precautions that i packed were colors i could never trust the swimmers getting out of sight shes disappeared into the night that once was mine","The Night That Once Was Mine","2003"
"Jack Bruce","we used to walk those golden streets but wheres the glitter gone the times we knew falling back into blue from this moment on we used to sail such silver seas but they have lost their glow the days we danced have denied their romance aint nowhere to go looking through cold windows at the autumn flying by i wait for memories to come home all this time without you and i search the sky so sad the sun is on its own love used to wear a sapphire smile maybe a diamond grin the years we played were destroyed in the raids all the fools that weve been look out at the wild world through the sweet and sour rain i wish the ache would lose its sting all these broken chances cause i missed the train tomorrow just dont mean a thing we used to march against the night now theres so little shine the minds we moved have slipped out of the groove now that you are not mine the seasons just dont rhyme life is hardly worth a dime","Progress","2003"
