"Smokie Norful","i was preaching a sermon one sunday and uh it was about it was a parable and it was talking about the uh the disciples and jesus when they were going through a corn field and they began to pick the corn and the pharisees the legalistics of the day they came and they were chastising them that why are you doing this on the sabbath  they had this whole discourse and dialog between the two of them jesus was saying listen do you do you not remember that you you yourself arent even worthy you guys break unleavened bread on on the sabbath and you kill the sacrifice you clean the sacrifice they have a need and its my job and my responsibility to meet their need and im at their need i trump the synagogue i trump the sabbath im lowered of your life im lowered of everything that is you im lowered of this this day recognize who youre talking to but in the course of the whole thing what i realize is that the dialog was between the pharisees or the religious leaders of the day was between the dignitaries the officials of the church and jesus the disciples never uttered a word he literally started embodying his permanent position in our lives because he stepped in between the law and the people he says no im grace and because of me they dont have to defend themselves to you ill do all the talking my blood will speak through all of eternity i have justified them even in their wrong i know that they are wrong i know that they make mistakes i know that they are not perfect i know that they do things that are not pleasing but even in their wrong my blood will speak on their behalf and i will just somebody should have shouted right there because he didnt kill you for all the sinful acts that you committed but he justified you god bless me with this song it simply speaks the life of that message and im just excited to be able to share it with you hey justified me glorified me paid my ransom and ive been redeemed by his blood go to calvary ive been made free despite my enemy i thank god im justified paid a price for my life and all that was wrong his love made it right now what greater sign can any man show that know with his own blood he made me whole he justified me glorified me paid my ransom and ive been redeemed by his blood go to calvary ive been made free despite my enemy i thank god im justified if my sins had their way i never would have made
