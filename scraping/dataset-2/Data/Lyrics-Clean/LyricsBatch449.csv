"Angel Haze","you should write a song where the concept is youre basically writing like a love letter or like a piece of advice to your mother when she was your age i dont know maybe i would write you a happy ending i would rearrange the pieces to your sad beginning i would put you far away from the decaying roots that bore you and let you experience all the ways that happiness could bloom before you or maybe im naive maybe im just a kid who thought that if she could plant a seed it would somehow grow inside you spent so much of my time wishing you were different but reality is that with life cant never be provision but if i could wish for one thing id go back and id fix it id tackle all your obstacles and kill em with precision and better the intentions of every single person whod play a part in you learning exactly what your worth is id shower you with purpose id wipe hate off the surface id reshape all your pain and make it fucking worth it no more feeling worthless no more fucking searching no more of that fraud shit nobody else could hurt you yeah said nobody else could hurt you and if they ever tried too id wipe em from the earth too cuz i know that you hurting baby i know that you tired too i know that you been running from everything thats behind you i know youve been burying everything deep inside you i can see it killing you wish that i could revive you but im stuck sitting in this time frame struggling with my demons and playing these stupid mind game one day it could get better maybe it could get better maybe we could change shit no more inclement weather know you hated your mom know it went through your mind you were just like me wish that you had more time to see life from a different angle wrestle with a different angel wouldnt lose your wings and fall from heaven like a cliffhanger everything is different now nothing is the same and nowadays i swear it feels like you dont know my name but i look at the mirror and i see you every day im you in every way every hue and every shade and maybe you should know its the last thing that i wanted cuz what i hate about you makes me feel like im haunted and i dont wanna spend the rest of my time on the run and so im just gonna confront it yeah im just gonna confront it and tell you that i love you for everything you made me and that you need to hear this even if it makes you angry god lives inside you youve already found him the devil lives in memories and you just let him hound you and i despise your church for every fucking thing they taught you its just a fucking stain that i wish i could wipe off you that i wish i could wipe off you and i forgive you for doing everything that it cost you everything that it caused price i wish it didnt cost you losing a part of me that would follow you to hell follow you to hatred or follow you to jail followed you to patterns that i could never get out of now i realize that i could never make it with that love now i realize that shit is the alternative outcome never wanted you to save me i just wish i count some i just wish that you grew up with someone you could count on i wish you knew that you could never make it without love for your goddamn self and that you never ever find it in anybody else cuz i would help you find you and if i saw it killing you i swear i would revive you and if that meant the end of me id do it all for you so you could have your happy end in peace because you are such a special thing youre not just my mom but youre the reason i exist and the best life that you couldve had for yourself without making a

"Angel Haze","and the light the lighannotatet can make everything feel beautiful it can make it feel safe so safe that like in the night we spend all of our time running away from our truths and then we meet someone who tells us god will always love you no matter what you do the only thing that will never stop loving you is god  and because of all of our darkness which at night i still run from which at night we all still run from we get stuck chasing light thats a black synagogue and god said that the meek shall inhabit the earth but there shall be masses i said masses of bloodshed first and that will open the floodgates of heaven and pour down upon us his blessings from the floor to the ceiling but only if you praise him i said praise him shall you receive his healing save me from the pain im falling down dont you hear me calling i need you now fill me til im whole with your holy light give me sanction can you bring me back to life save me from the pain im falling down dont you hear me calling i need you now fill me til im whole with your holy light give me sanction can you bring me back to life i been running from the pain in my brain got stains on my scene while i search for the real me search for the real me lost in the night only talk to angels when im lost in a height i dont really wanna get lost in my mind so i pray until i feel im getting lost in the vibe then i took the bottle up and i drink it to my what yep drink it to my fucking souls lost in my eyes but i dont really wanna drown no cuz im not that trusting but ima keep coming round though till im sure that i found something and when i tell you what it is you better talk to god remember no feelings no thoughts allowed and if pains a trapdoor then i need god and so send someone to come walk me out but dont think dont talk about it wait dont sing dont tell nobody wait dont drink dont fail your body wait dont scream no fucking shout it see these voices in my head are the fucking loudest so belligerent so fucking rowdy and my tunnel visions so fucking clouded and i dont really have a motherfucking outlet so i talk to god but i dont really know if he can hear me but you know him well and i think that you could bring him near me so i keep praying every word that i keep saying every part of me that i needed shield from every part of me that needs saving save me from the pain im falling down dont you hear me calling i need you now fill me til im whole with your holy light give me sanction can you bring me back to life none of thiss real when it calls you thought i found you now im lost too ive been listening to service sermons a lotta redefining a lot of words reworded a lotta thoughts detected and thoughts suggested a lotta stuff that resonates with certain persons ive been searching for the truth but its embedded in lies read every single verse until im red in my eyes and godll only hear you when you offering ties and protection is the truth but when the devils a lie but what am i to do when the devil is i and everything i touch seems to shrivel and die my mama always said i was a rebel inside but now im looking for some peace and a benevolent i and how it feels to need that some humbling pie and how long it will take when it comes from the sky means ill probably be waiting until i crumble and die and just wrestling with satan while im struggling by so i think i talk about it wait i drink i tell somebody wait i sink i fail my body wait i scream im fucking shouting cause these voices in my head are the fucking loudest so belligerent so fucking rowdy and my tunnel visions so fucking clouded and i dont really have a motherfucking outlet so i talk to god but i dont really know if he can hear me and you know him well and i think that you could bring him near me so i keep praying everything that i keep saying every part of me that i needed shield from every part of me that needs saving save me from the pain im falling down dont you hear me calling i need you now fill me til im whole with your holy light give me sanction can you bring me back to life did he die on the cross for this do you have any fucking proof everything here is man made and im just searching for some fucking truth cause everything they ever told me not to do has always made me question what freedom is why listen to the words when they not from you and why feel judged when i freely live now i know what the fucking root of evil is and why peace is dead but evil lives everybody thinking they can talk to you and what they believe in they hearts are true now they feel that they had the right to persecute judge doom to hell and come first to you now i dont really know who wrote the bible but nothing under the sun goes unrecycled take every shot you have with a fucking rifle cause you rarely ever get a chance for revival so just think just talk about it wait just think just tell somebody wait dont blink dont fail your body wait just scream just fucking shout it so the voices in your head fall abruptly silent and the blood in your veins flows rough and violent and you see everything with your lifted eyelids and every burden you carry is eventually lighted and you talk to god even when you aint sure he hears you and you give it to him tell him he can keep the pain and fears too and you keep praying only now you dont repeat sayings cuz you know when you let it go then you receive satan how many people here look for jesus to solve their problems lots of people and how many of those people are fixed none of them know fucking about shit theyre all fucking fucked up anything to help you escape it takes it it takes something to just say fuck it this is reality im gonna deal with it  but do we ever really deal with it deal with it stop running
