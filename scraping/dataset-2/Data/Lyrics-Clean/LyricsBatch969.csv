"Sage Francis","its been a long and lonely trip but im glad that i took it because it was well worth it i got to read a couple books and do some research before i reached my verdict never thought that i was perfect always thought that i had a purpose used to wonder if id live to see my first kiss the most difficult thing i ever did was recite my own words at a service realizing the person i was addressing probably wasnt looking down from heaven or cooking up something in hells kitchen trying to listen in or eaves drop from some another dimension it was self serving just like this is conveniently religious on easter sunday and on christmas the television went from being a babysitter to a mistress technology made it easy for us to stay in touch while keeping a distance til we just stayed distant and never touched now all we do is text too much i dont remember much from my youth maybe my memory is repressed or i just spent too much time wondering if id live to have sex fell in love for the first time in 4th grade but i didnt have the courage to talk to her in 8th grade i wrote her the note but i slipped it in someone elses locker considered killing myself cause of that it was a big deal it was a blown cover it was over for me my goose was cooked stick a fork it me the jig is up i blew my chances the rest is history our future was torn asunder it became abundantly clear that i was only brought here to suffer at least i didnt include my name thankfully i wrote the whole note in code and it had 10 layers of scotch tape safety seal making it impossible to open plus it was set to self destruct whoever read it probably died laughing i wonder if they lived long enough to realize what happened a year later i came to understand that wasnt love that i was feeling for her i had someone else to obsess over i was older i was very mature i forged my time signature while practicing my parents autograph cause i was failing math disconnected the phone when i thought the teacher would call my home i checked the mailbox twice a day at the end of a long dirt road steamed open a couple envelopes like i was in private detective mode if you snoop around long enough for something in particular youre guaranteed to find it for better or worse thats how i learned that its best to just keep some things private it was the best of times it was the end of times it was the best of times it was the end of times i was always on deck i was next in line an only child with a pen and pad writing a list of things that i could never have the walls in my house were paper thin every squabble seemed to get deafening if my memory serves me correctly i made it a point to void and forget some things probably to keep from being embarrassed never meant to upset or give grief to my parents kept my secrets hid my talents in my head never under the mattress therapy couldnt break me never learned a word that would insure safety so i spoke softly and i tip toed often the door to my room was like a big old coffin the way that it creeked when i closed it shut anxieties peaked when it opened up as if everything that i was thinking would be exposed i still sleep fully clothed it was the best of times it was the end of times it was beautiful it was brutal it was cruel it was business as usual heaven it was hell used to wonder if id live to see 12 when i did i figured that i was immortal loved to dance but couldnt make it to the formal couldnt bear watching my imaginary girlfriend bust a move with any other dudes tone loc was talking bout a wild thang but i was still caught up in some child thangs scared of a god who couldnt spare the rod it was clearly a brimstone and fire thang pyromaniac kleptomaniac couldnt explain my desire to steal that fire now i add it to my rider like please oh please dont throw me in that patch of brier it was the best of times it was the end of times the school counselor was clueless cause i never skipped classes perfect attendance imperfect accent speech impediment they could never really fix and i faked bad eyesight so i could wear glasses considered doing something that would cripple me i wanted a wheelchair i wanted the sympathy i wanted straight teeth so then came braces 4 years of head gear helped me change faces it was the best of times it was the end of times now i wonder if ill live to see marriage wonder if ill live long enough to have kids wonder if ill live to see my kids have kids if i do im gonna tell em how it is dont listen when they tell you that these are your best years dont let anybody protect your ears its best that you hear what they dont want you to hear its better to have pressure from peers than not have peers beer wont give you chest hair spicy food wont make it curl when you think youve got it all figured out and then your universe collapses trust me kid its not the end of the world","The Best of Times","2010"
