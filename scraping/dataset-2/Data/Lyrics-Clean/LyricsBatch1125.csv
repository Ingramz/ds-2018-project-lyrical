"Big Daddy Weave","standing here in the presence of something more than merely real there are no words to describe you or explain the way i feel as you speak i find healing for my soul and your touch alone can make me whole and my heart cries holy and my spirit feels the change as my heart cries holy i will never be the same your mercies toward me last forever your faithfulness is true and as you touch the coal to my lips my mind is made brand new i could never repay all that youve done so use my life to the glory of your son everything inside me everything untrue oh lord i surrender all of it to you","Heart Cries Holy","2003"
"Big Daddy Weave","strangers are attacking me ruthless they seek to steal my life they have no regard for you lord vindicate me by your might though the darkness tries to steal my heart it comes without warning but your mercy covers me because its new every morning i place my trust in your holy blood to cleanse and protect me from all my sin though the enemy rushes in your spirit will lift up a standard against him","New Every Morning","2003"
"Big Daddy Weave","hear no evil see no evil speak no evil on the outside full of pride full of lies so well they hide on the inside theyll never be all that they say they live the life of a pharisee not perfect on the surface so far to go on the outside but a true heart and a new start is what what lives on the inside for whom the son has set free he is free free indeed receive the son who mkes us free then you will be free indeed","Pharisee","2003"
"Big Daddy Weave","locked inside this cell of flesh i sat awaiting an eminent death the fruitful labor of my sin had brought me to what i knew would be the end well i had a debt i couldnt pay you paid a debt you didnt owe you gave your life for me that day so freedom i could know set me free from the chains that bound me to my sin set me free from this life that ive been living set me free there has never been a time when your mercy did not find me tangled up in all my sin and then so faithfully unwind me but just before i slipped away you heard me when i called your name therell never be a day when you wont come and you are the author and the finisher of the faith in me i know i can trust in you to come and set me free","Set Me Free","2003"
"Big Daddy Weave","walking down the road this life is on the narrow path i try to stay but i must confess i have a tendency to stray id love to call it a mistake a momentary lapse of faith but the truth is sometimes i feel like im being dragged away by the other side that people never see a war is on between the good and bad inside of me why do i do all the things that i do when i want to do what is right change this wicked heart of mine let me walk with you in the new life so what will ever put an end to my recurring bout with sin it seems im always at a loss for a way to win when what i really need to do is to confront it with the truth and let your words of life sink in and make my mind brand new a transformation that happens over time is the product of a renewed mind create in me a clean heart place your spirit deep inside capture every thought til theres no place left to hide","Why","2003"
