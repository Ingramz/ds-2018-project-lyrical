"Immortal Technique","i once knew a nigga whose real name was william his primary concern was making a million being the illest hustler that the world ever seen he used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams a corrupted young mind at the age of thirteen nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend she put the pipe down but every year she was sober her sons heart simultaneously grew colder he started hanging out selling bags in the projects checking the young chicks looking for hit and run prospects he was fascinated by material objects but he understood money never bought respect he build a reputation cause he could hustle and steal but got locked once and didnt hesitate to squeal so criminals he chilled with didnt think he was real you see me and niggas like this have never been equal i dont project my insecurities at other people he fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles so he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil a feeble minded young man with infinite potential the product of a ghetto breed capitalistic mental coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed dancing with the devil smoked until his eyes would bleed but he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences you probably only did a month for minor offenses ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance but then again theres always the wicked that knew in advance dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block but thats what happens when you rape murder and sell rock devils used to be gods angels that fell from the top theres no diversity because were burning in the melting pot so billy started robbing niggas anything he could do to get his respect back in the eyes of his crew starting fights over little shit up on the block stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock working overtime for making money for the crack spot hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine fulfilling the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain tired of the block niggas treating him the same he wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs but when he tried to step to em niggas showed him no love they told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood even puffy smoked a motherfucker up in a club but only a real thug can stab someone till they die standing in front of them starring straight into their eyes billy realized that these men were well guarded and they wanted to test him before business started suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted so now he had a choice between going back to his life or making money with made men up in the cyph his dreams about cars and ice made him agree a hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be and so he met them friday night at a quarter to three everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences you probably only did a month for minor offenses ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance but then again theres always the wicked that knew in advance dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block but thats what happens when you rape murder and sell rock devils used to be gods angels that fell from the top theres no diversity because were burning in the melting pot they drove around the projects slow while it was raining smoking blunts drinking and joking for entertainment until they saw a woman on the street walking alone three in the morning coming back from work on her way home and so they quietly got out the car and followed her walking through the projects the darkness swallowed her they wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor this is it kid now you got your chance to be raw so billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair and dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there she struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs they got to the roof and then held her down on the ground screaming shut the fuck up and stop moving around the shirt covered her face but she screamed and clawed so billy stomped on the bitch until he had broken her jaw the dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing they kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving blood leaking through the cloth she cried silently and then they all proceeded to rape her violently billy was made to go first but each of them took a turn ripping her up and choking her until her throat burned a broken jaw mumbled for god but they werent concerned when they were done and she was lying bloody broken and bruised one of them niggas pulled out a brand new twenty two they told him that she was a witness of what shed gone through and if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew he thought about it for a minute she was practically dead and so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head im falling and i cant turn back im falling and i cant turn back right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life he thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice and he felt strong standing along with his new brothers cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover but what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter cause he was starring into the eyes of his own mother she looked back at him and cried cause he had forsaken her she cried more painfully than when they were raping her his whole world stopped he couldnt even contemplate his corruption had successfully changed his fate and he remembered how his mom used to come home late working hard for nothing cause now what was he worth he turned away from the woman that had once given him birth and crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared but only the devil responded cause god wasnt there and right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold and so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul they say death takes you to a better place but i doubt it after that they killed his mother and never spoke about it and listen cause the story that im telling is true cause i was there with billy jacobs and i raped his mom too and now the devil follows me everywhere that i go in fact im sure hes standing among one of you at my shows and every street cypher listening to little thugs flow he could be standing right next to you and you wouldnt know the devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked white brown yellow and black colored is not restricted you have a self destructive destiny when your inflicted and youll be one of gods children and fell from the top theres no diversity because were burning in the melting pot so when the devil wants to dance with you you better say never because the dance with the devil might last you forever","Dance
