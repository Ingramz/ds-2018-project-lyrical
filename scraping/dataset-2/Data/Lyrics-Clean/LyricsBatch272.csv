"Frank Sinatra","when i was a young man courting the girls i played me a waiting game if a maid refused me with tossing curls id let the old earth make a couple of whirls while i plied her with tears in lieu of pearls and as time came around she came my way as time came around she came oh its a long long while from may to december but the days grow short when you reach september when the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame and you aint got time for waiting game when days dwindle down to a precious few september november and these few golden days id share with you those golden days i share with you when you meet with the young girls early in the spring you court them in song and rhyme they answer with words and a clover ring but if you could examine the goods they bring they have little to offer but the songs they sing and the plentiful waste of time of day a plentiful waste of time oh its a long long while from may to december but the days grow short when you reach september when the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame one hasnt got time for the waiting game oh the days dwindle down to a precious few september november and these few precious days ill spend with you these precious days ill spend with you","September Song [Knickerbocker Holiday]","2008"
