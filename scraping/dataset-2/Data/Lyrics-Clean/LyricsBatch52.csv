"Chris Cornell","time aint nothing if it aint fast taking everything that you ever had and giving nothing in return but a cold bed in a quiet earth but theres a door in every cell a pearl inside of every shell how hard can it be to share your love with me how hard can it be to rise with me each morning how long when it feels like well live forever i fear that time will hide the years life aint nothing if it aint hard itll show you who you truly are knock you down when you get too tall till you spun around in a free fall but somewhere out there past the storm lies the shelter of your heart so how hard can it be to share your love with me how hard can it be to rise with me each morning how long when it feels like we live for ever i fear like we were never here so hold on tightly my dear im not one to waste my time searching for something lightning somewhere out there lies the stone lies the shelter of your heart so how hard can it be how hard to share your love with me how hard can it be to rise with me each morning how long it feels like we will live forever but i fear that time can hide the years like we were never here so hold on tightly my dear before we disappear before we disappear","Before We Disappear","2015"
"Chris Cornell","night falls while drunken angels sleep by the side of the road and im nodding in a stairwell just trying to stay out of the cold circling around the drain cant find my way back to home the road is long and never ends dark is the heart that wanders light breaks in through the window takes a minute to know where i am a dying blackbird gives her soul to the wind on the roof of the house that i can see from the bed circling around the drain show me the way back home the road is long it never ends dark is the heart that wanders id crawl a hundred thousand miles just to see your two eyes look me over id steal you flowers in the bloodshot light of the lonely hours on a moonless night just like a stray dog in the rain i can run all night and get nowhere i picture you out underneath the porch light calling my name all night and waiting for me i thought i heard your voice in the water as i walked by a fountain uptown now im an orphaned at the door of church just watching the water come down circling around the drain hope that i make it home i never felt so far away dark is the heart that wanders","Circling","2015"
