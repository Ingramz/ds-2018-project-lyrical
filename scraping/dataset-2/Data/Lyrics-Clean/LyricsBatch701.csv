"Maximillian Colby","one testimony in trials that never got heard my lovers teeth are white geese flying above me my lovers muscles are rope ladders under my hands we were driving home slow my lover and i across the long bay bridge one february midnight when midway over in the far left lane i saw a strange scene one small young man standing by the rail and in the lane itself parked straight across as if it could stop anything a large young man upon a stalled motorcycle perfectly relaxed as if hed stopped at a hamburger stand he was wearing a peacoat and levis and he had his head back roaring you could almost hear the laugh it was so real look at that fool i said in the middle of the bridge like that a very womanly remark then we heard the meaning of the noise of metal on a concrete bridge at 50 miles an hour and the far left lane filled up with a big car that had a motorcycle jammed on its front bumper like the whole thing would explode the friction sparks shot up bright orange for many feet into the air and the racket still sets my teeth on edge when the car stopped we stopped parallel and wendy headed for the callbox while i ducked across those 6 lanes like a mouse in the bowling alley are you hurt i said the middle aged driver had the greyest black face i couldnt stop i couldnt stop what happened then i remembered somebody i said was on the motorcycle i ran back one block two blocks the space for walking on the bridge is maybe 18 inches whoever engineered this arrogance in the dark stiff wind it seemed i would be pushed over the rail would fall down screaming onto the hard surface of the bay but i did not i found the tall young man who thought he owned the bridge now lying on his stomach head cradled in his broken arm he had glasses on but somewhere he had lost most of his levis where were they and his shoes two short cuts on his buttocks that was the only mark except his thin white seminal tubes were all strung out behind no child left in him and he looked asleep i plucked wildly at his wrist then put it down there were two long haired women holding back the traffic just behind me with their bare hand the machines came down like mad bulls i was scared much more than usual i felt easily squished like the earthworms crawling on a busy sidewalk after the rain i wanted to leave and met the driver walking back the guy is dead i gripped his hand the wind was going to blow us off the bridge oh my god he said havent i had enough trouble in my life he raised his head and for a second was enraged and yelling at the top of the bridge i was just driving home his head fell down my god and now ive killed somebody i looked down at my own peacoat and levis then over at the dead mans friend who was bawling and blubbering what they would call hysteria in a woman it isnt possible he wailed but it was possible it was indeed accomplished and unfeeling snoring in its peacoat and without its levis on he died laughing thats a fact i had a woman waiting for me in her car and in the middle of the bridge im frightened i said im afraid he said stay with me please dont go stay with me be my witness no i said ill be your witness later and i took his name and number but i cant stay with you im too frightened of the bridge besides i have a woman waiting and no license and no tail lights so i left as i have left so many of my lovers we drove home shaking wendys face greyer than any white persons i have ever seen maybe he beat his wife maybe he once drove taxi and raped a lover of mine how to know these things we do each other in thats a fact who will be my witness death wastes our time with drunkenness and depression death who keeps us from our lovers he had a woman waiting for him i found when i called the number days later where is he she said hes disappeared hell be all right i said we could have hit the guy as easy as anybody it wasnt anybodys fault theyll know that women so often say dumb things like that they teach us to be sweet and reassuring and say ignorant things because we dont invent the crime the punishment the bridges that same week i looked into the mirror and nobody was there to testify how clear and unemployed queer woman makes no witness at all nobody at all was there for those two questions what does she do and who is she married to i am the woman who stopped on the bridge and this is the man who was there our lovers teeth are white geese flying above us but we ourselves are easily squished keep the women small and weak and off the street and off the bridges thats the way brother one day i will leave you there as i have left you there before working for death we found out later what we left him to six big policemen answered the call all white and no child in them they put the driver up against his car and beat the hell out of him what did you kill that poor kid for you mutherfucking nigger thats a fact death only uses violence when there is any kind of resistance the rest of the time a slow weardown will do they took him to 4 different hospitals til they got a drunk test report to fit their case and held him five days in jail without a phone call how many lovers have we left there are as many contradictions to the game as there are players a woman is talking to death though talk is cheap and like takes a long time to make right he got a cheesy lawyer who had him cop a plea 15 to 20 instead of life did i say life the arrogant young man who thought he owned the bridge and fell asleep on it he died laughing thats a fact the driver sits out his time off the street somewhere does he have the most vacant of eyes will he die laughing a table they made and on it was laid a baby we gave and im so dry mud cracked i maybe we deny where these walls wont let go of my eyes we made a circle of smoke on a train please same me from saying it was easy we were driving across the bridge so slow he lost his child in the snow","Balance","2002"
