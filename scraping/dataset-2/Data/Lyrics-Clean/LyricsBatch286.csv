"Gabriel Wilson","the moon and stars they wept the morning sun was dead the savior of the world was fallen his body on the cross his blood poured out for us the weight of every curse upon him one final breath he gave as heaven looked away the son of god was laid in darkness a battle in the grave the war on death was waged the power of hell forever broken the ground began to shake the stone was rolled away his perfect love could not be overcome now death where is your sting our resurrected king has rendered you defeated forever he is glorified forever he is lifted high forever he is risen he is alive he is alive we sing hallelujah we sing hallelujah we sing hallelujah the lamb has overcome if there are words for him then i dont have them you see my brain has not yet reached the point where it could form a thought that could adequately describe the greatness of my god and my lungs have not yet developed the ability to release a breathe with enough to agility to breathe out the greatness of his love and my voice you see my voice is so inhibited restrained by human limits thats hard to even send the praise up you see if there are words for him i dont have them my god his grace is remarkable mercies are innumerable strength is impenetrable he is honorable accountable favorable hes unsearchable yet knowable indefinable yet approachable indescribable yet personal he is beyond comprehension further than imagination constant through generations king of every nation but if there are words for him then i dont have them you see my words are few in trying to capture the one true god using my vocabulary would never do but i use words as an expression an expression of worship to a savior a savior who is both worthy and deserving of my praise so i use words my heart extols the lord blesses his name forever he has won my heart captured my mind and has bond them both together he is defeated me in my rebellion conquered me in my sin he has welcomed me into his presence completely invited me in he has made himself the object of my sight flooding me with mercies in the morning drowning me with grace in the night but if there are words for him then i dont have them but what i do have is good news for my god knew that manmade words would never do the words are just tools that we use to point to the truth so he sent his son jesus christ as the word living proof he is the image of the invisible god the first born of all creation for by him all things were created giving nothingness formation and by his words he sustains in the power of his name for he is before all things and over all things he reigns holy is his name so praise him for his life the way he preserved in strife the humble son of god becoming the perfect sacrifice praise him for his death pause that he willingly stood in our place that he lovingly endured the grave that he battled our enemy and on the third day rose in victory he is everything that was promised praised as the risen king lift your voice and sing for one day he will return for us and we will finally be united with our savior for eternity eternity so its not just words that i proclaim for my words point to the word and the word has a name hope has a name joy has a name peace has a name love has a name and that name is jesus christ praise his name forever","Forever (We Sing Hallelujah)","2018"
