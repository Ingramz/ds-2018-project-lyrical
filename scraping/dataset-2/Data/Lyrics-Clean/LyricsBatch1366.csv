"Bushido","yeah zwischen all dem schmutz und dem abschaum damals in berlin gab es diesen jungen es war seine vision und kein tagtraum er wollt es sich verdienen und zwar aus gutem grund seine mutter war alleinerziehend sein bruder viel kleiner als er und genau deswegen mussten diese scheine jetzt her doch sein label wollte ihn nicht mehr bezahlen also blieb ihm keine wahl er fragte auf der strasse verzweifelt nach beistand es wurde zu nem wettlauf der junge vereinsamt die schatten wurden grosser und lichtblicke rar der raum wurde kalt als mephisto ihn sah er konnt es fur ihn klaren darauf gab er ihm sein wort denk an deine zukunft du willst weg von diesem ort mach dich auf die reise dreh dich nicht mehr um hor nicht mehr auf andere frag nicht mehr warum du kannst haben was du willst gib mir einfach die befehle ich will nicht viel von dir nur am ende deine seele der junge uberlegte zu wenig sprach dagegen heute weiss er damals trat der teufel in sein leben vergessen waren die tranen er fuhlte sich geborgen auf einmal musste er sich um die zukunft nicht mehr sorgen der neue sound electro der junge aus dem ghetto er wurde zum geschaftsmann aus brutto wurde netto in deutschland herrschte chaos er machte sich zum staatsfeind die rolle seines lebens joker dark knight jeder wollt ihm nah sein die worter wurden gold blut schweiss und tranen die lawine kam ins rollen die seele war verkauft der junge stieg auf seinen thron fur viele ein idol doch seine freiheit illusion mephisto hatte plane der konig der hyanen die schlange der apfel im garten von eden die kurve ging nach oben die worter wurden platin gewissensbisse gabs nicht wer faxen machte schlag ihn die geister die er rief sie forderten tribut in den kopfen diese stimmen an den handen dieses blut die nachte wurden langer am himmel keine sterne egal wohin er kommt uberall verbrannte erde alles kalkuliert denn am ende wars kein gluck es ging von der skyline zum bordstein zuruck das jahr 2007 am kudamm mein plakat das ganze land begriff jetzt der junge war am start rekorde fallen und plotzlich war der himmel seine grenze ein leben ohne limit bis der typ kommt mit der sense wie sagt man so schon hochmut kommt meistens vor dem fall und irgendwie wars karma auf einmal uberall diese dinge die passierten seine mutter wurde krank vergessen waren die preise keine freude nur noch angst mephisto kams gelegen denn not macht einen verletzlich er gab sein bestes hor mal mein junge komm und setz dich du kannst auf mich vertrauen ich lieb dich wie ein vater den sohn gemeinsam machen wir jetzt abermillionen er horte was er sagte und totete die zweifel dem teufel gegenuber der engel war zu leise mit jedem tag verlor er sich selbst ein bisschen mehr denn nichts war so wie vorher vergiftet war sein herz betaubt und ohne rucksicht verzweifelt auf der suche nicht leicht zu unterscheiden das bose von dem guten er opferte fast alles furs schnelle leben asap kettensagen massaker heavy metal payback glaub mir zeiten andern sich und plotzlich auch mephisto verlockend war das rampenlicht und langsam wurd er schizo er wollte eine buhne seine fratze auf der leinwand riss die zugel an sich akzeptierte keinen einwand ein teufel und diktator nach aussen immer hoflich seine tausenden gesichter zu durchschauen war nicht moglich ein meister der intrigen gespalten seine zunge der schlussel des erfolges war schon immer nur der junge und viele jahre lief es drehten sich die radchen bis zum ersten februar der junge traf ein madchen sie wurde vieles andern und irgendwie geschah es dass sie an seiner seite blieb endlich etwas wahres zwischen all den lugen und finsteren gestalten der junge wurde vater und nichts blieb mehr beim alten mephisto sate zwietracht und zog alle register auf einmal war er anwalt klager sowie richter es brach einem das herz den jungen traf das schicksal als seine mutter starb nur noch trauernde gesichter er floh vor der familie es schlug mephistos stunde und alles was er liebte ging allmahlich vor die hunde er fing sich an zu streiten im endeffekt fur gar nix versetzte das madchen in regelrechte panik sie erkannte ihn nicht wieder was war bloss aus ihm geworden das letzte bisschen hoffnung zwischen ihnen war gestorben sie fiel auf ihre knie zu viel last auf ihren schultern sie weinte denn sie wusste ganz genau wer daran schuld war doch niemand horte zu als sie warnte und flehte ein engel ohne flugel sang klare gebete mephisto der teufel ein lugner ohnegleichen fur die seele dieses jungen ging er wieder uber leichen die ehe lag in scherben er hatte was er wollte und liess ihn nicht mehr los wie ein wolf seine beute und so kam es dass der schatten ein stuck mehr von ihm besitz nahm zimmer gab es viele aber niemand macht das licht an egal was er versuchte er versank in depressionen seine standigen begleiter waren geister und damonen er versagte sich dem leben weitermachen war nicht moglich die frage die ihn qualte weshalb war er nur so toricht ihm fehlten seine kinder sein madchen seine mama am telefon erfuhr der junge sie war wieder schwanger er musste sie zuruckgewinnen und wusste was zu tun war der einzige der das nicht wollte war sein falscher bruder mephisto wurde zornig als er davon erfuhr er wollte es verhindern von gewissen keine spur die waffen die er nutzte waren schrecklich egoistisch fassade noch zu wahren war von jetzt an nicht mehr wichtig er liess es darauf ankommen und sprengte seine ketten er hob die stimme jetzt um die familie zu retten das erste mal seit jahren bekam das madchen wirklich den gebuhrenden respekt denn wahre liebe stirbt nicht die narben sassen tief doch der feind war jetzt derselbe gemeinsam durch den regen den sturm und auch die kalte sie waren voller zuversicht mutig und entschlossen er gab ihr ein versprechen und es wurde nicht gebrochen und da verlor mephisto den schrecken alter tage krallen einer ratte schwarze flugel wie ein rabe seine maske fiel so sah man seine wahre gestalt er war ein monster aus feuer doch sein atem war kalt es ging um leben und tod der junge zog in den kampf des teufels plane allesamt in den boden gestampft funfzehn jahre spater der junge fast vierzig fast alle seine traume inzwischen verwirklicht kinder hat er funf scheine hat er viele ehejahre sechs geheiratet aus liebe soloalben dreizehn das gold liegt im keller talent bringt noch immer das brot auf den teller das leben konnt so schon sein unbeschwert die wege hatte nur mephisto nicht noch immer seine seele verschlossen und versenkt verloren in den tiefen des ozeans er wurde sogar mit dem tod bezahlen denn er hat keine angst nur weil sein gegner vorher nie am boden lag genau wie damals david gegen goliath die stimmen der engel sie singen im chor ihre seelen sie stiegen zum himmel empor und erzahlen geschichten vom teufel vor ort wie ein junge aus leichtsinn fast alles verlor denn es gab zeiten da folgte er mephisto wie blind horte die lugen immer wieder wie das flustern im wind wurde genauso wie er gab den widerstand auf jetzt muss er vieles graderucken weil ihm niemand mehr glaubt so viele menschen erniedrigt sich unfair verhalten auf dem weg ihres erfolges liegen hunderte leichen man schrieb und suchte die fehler die sie machten unmoglich die dinge aus der ferne zu betrachten doch heute hat der junge die notige distanz das bild in der gesamtheit ungeschont und ohne glanz und heute sieht mephisto das schicksal nimmt seinen lauf auch er kann nichts dran andern kein feuer ohne rauch er hat gewutet und am ende schutt und asche hinterlassen er gab dem jungen mehr als einen grund um ihn zu hassen unterwarf ihn seinem willen standige kontrolle dass er daran erstickte spielt am ende keine rolle abscheulich all die dinge die er billigend in kauf nahm lebte von den menschen die wahrhaftig zu ihm aufsahen ein blender dem das geld zu kopf gestiegen ist der so viel hat aber trotzdem nie zufrieden ist der niemals schlaft der preis fur seinen frevel auf ewig soll er wandern durch taler voller schwefel zusammen mit seines gleichen auf dass sie nie mehr heimkehren nie mehr wieder wird er diesen jungen nochmal einsperren das ende einer herrschaft selbsternannter konig die welt wird ihn vergessen nicht mehr ausser nur gewohnlich wer ist ihm noch geblieben seine heerscharen fliehen gutig barmherzig er selbst war es nie die angst war sein hammer die list war sein meissel sein kranker verstand war nicht zu begreifen unfassbar wie boshaft seht euch sein werk an hunderte seelen da unten in kerkern yeah jeder weiss der teufel hat sein eigenes motiv das leid das er menschen zufugt ist sein profit der junge hatte lieber seine finger davon lassen sollen doch stattdessen machte er mephistos taschen voll er hat genug bezahlt blieb keinem etwas schuldig egal wie sehr es weh tat der junge blieb geduldig von jetzt an keine kompromisse mehr dissen ohne namen nennen glaub mir mal sie wissen wer die seele dieses jungen genommen hat aus gier er muss akzeptieren niemals wieder wir diese zeilen kommen von herzen an mephisto addressiert er war nie ein wahrer freund nur ein rucksichtsloses tier am himmel kreisen geier eine ara geht zu ende so wurde aus dem jungen eine lebende legende er nahm den mut zusammen und stellte sich seinen angsten keine maskerade denn die wahrheit wahrt am langsten er machte reinen tisch ein fur alle mal sein herz weiss man kann mit der seele nicht bezahlen also holt er sie zuruck der deal war hiermit nichtig damit am ende dieses tunnels endlich wieder licht ist und siehe da das leben war wieder voller farben so viele neue wege die sich ihm nun offenbarten er blickt nicht mehr zuruck das kapitel ist geschichte von dem dann seine enkelkinder irgendwann berichten man wird von ihm erzahlen er war ein guter junge mit wut in seiner lunge und dem herzen auf der zunge die fehler die er machte sind tief in ihm verankert fur jeden tag mit der familie ist er dankbar denn es geschehen
