forever william cullen bryan said truth crushed to earth would rise again and james russell lowell made it more plain that we would not be ruined or destroyed because he said that truth forever on the scaffold lies forever on the throne but that scaffold sways the future and behind the dim unknown standeth god within the shadow keeping watch above his own these powerful scriptures were also used by the man in whom we celebrate his birthday today dr martin luther king and dr king told us to practice non violence and the power of love non violence and the power of love has brought us thus far the agape love that we have for ourselves that we have for our people is the reason why our people in this particular diaspora called north america have not been totally ruined we have not been totally destroyed we have not been exterminated so therefore uh my dear brother um wasalu we thank you for what youve asked me to do and we shall continue to study to show ourselves approved under god workman that neednt not be ashamed rightly this dividing the word of truth and so at this time in this city where young mens lives are not worth much in this city where our people have been discriminated against and kept from the resources which we rightly deserve as a majority of people in the city we are dependent upon the most high creator of the ends of the world that i call elohim jehova and we are dependent upon him to keep us from falling to keep us from being ruined to keep us from being exterminated and we thank the almighty for the privilege of being here with my niece is to impart these words and i hope it would be of assistance in this project god bless you and thank you","Quotations From Chairman Fred","2018"
