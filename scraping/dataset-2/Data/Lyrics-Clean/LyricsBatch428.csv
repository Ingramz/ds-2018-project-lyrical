"Jermaine Jackson","im sitting in the railway station got a ticket to my destination on a tour of one night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand and evry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one man band homeward bound i wish i was homeward bound home where my thoughts escaping home where my musics playing home where my love lies waiting silently for me evry days an endless stream of cigarettes and magazines and each town looks the same to me the movies and the factories and evry strangers face i see reminds me that i long to be homeward bound i wish i was homeward bound home where my thoughts escaping home where my musics playing home where my love lies waiting silently for me tonight ill sing my songs again ill play the game and pretend but all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity like emptiness in harmony i need someone to comfort me homeward bound i wish i was homeward bound home where my thoughts escaping home where my musics playing home where my love lies waiting silently for me silently for me","Homeward Bound","1972"
