lincolns and the grants and the jacksons bitches at your door a rich dude givin you action so you kick em down one two three four hundred and when i saw you with the broad boy you sho fronted loud talker like a father figure but any punk can play her father if his pockets bigger and you hoes get treated like a child again you dont work or go to school and get beat when you act a fool go home to da 255 pounds for you gladly you know you hate the sight of him damn but youse a tramp and if it pays you good you might love him dont you have any self respect is the dollar that mighty that you trade him sex now tell me what does that price include will you suck me and fuck me and dance in the nude well now you got me trippin baby i could buy your freak toss her up and call her my lady well that sounds pretty damn reasonable ill just pay her if thats all thats pleasin the hoe what does that sound like to you well for the right price player you got yourself a prostitute i once had a bitch named anne marie fucked her sister and her mother down her family tree she was just another prospect a player had to test her flashed my money played dumb like uncle fester make her think that im her sugar daddy she can lick me cause im full of candy man i got her bitin she thinks she found herself a sucker but im a pricier lets see how much it is to fuck her and if she got a cheap price ring cool then i wont buy her nice things you see her values are low her self respect is minimal 30 dollars is a steal makes me feel like a criminal 10 for the movies 20 for an entree take her to the house and tossed her up the sautee dip her then i flip her on her tummy first yeah you know i gotta get my moneys worth you see the rule of the game is you pay to play see i call her up and its cool for me any day all there is is an initiation fee fronted one time now its always free but a sucker punk mark keeps payin the freak got sprung on the pussy cause his game was weak you better hope you can afford the hoe cause if you miss a month the rate shell be out the do lookin for the highest bidder that wants to get with her punks lease her with an option to buy but i rent her 30 dollars and i made you sin it was cool for a night now ima trade you in and let me tell you bout the trade in policy you trade a freak in and get a woman with quality one with values and high standards not a freak with no fuckin manners i need more than a piece of meat most freaks can only fuck bare gettin sleep what does that sound like to you well for the right price player you got yourself a prostitute theres a fine line between a girlfriend and a prostitute but youse a trick you thought she loves you but its not the truth its always odd when youre fuckin your lady that you always seem to fuck her on payday so
