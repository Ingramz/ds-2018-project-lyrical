"Laurie Z","twas the night before christmas when all through the house not a creature was stirring not even a mouse the stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hopes that st nicholas soon would be there the children were nestled all snug in their beds while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads and mama in her kerchief and i in my cap had just settled our brains for a long winters nap when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter i sprang from the bed to see what was the matter away to the window i flew like a flash tore open the shutters and threw up the sash the moon on the breast of the new fallen snow gave the luster of mid day to objects below when what to my wondering eyes should appear but a miniature sleigh and eight tinny reindeer with a little old driver so lively and quick i knew in a moment it must be st nick more rapid than eagles his coursers they came and he whistled and shouted and called them by name now dasher now dancer now prancer and vixen on comet on cupid on on donner and blitzen to the top of the porch to the top of the wall now dash away dash away dash away all as dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly when they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky so up to the house top the coursers they flew with the sleigh full of toys and st nicholas too and then in a twinkling i heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof as i drew in my head and was turning around down the chimney st nicholas came with a bound he was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot a bundle of toys he had flung on his back and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack his eyes how they twinkled his dimples how merry his cheeks were like roses his nose like a cherry his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath he had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly he was chubby and plump a right jolly old elf and i laughed when i saw him in spite of myself a wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread he spoke not a word but went straight to his work and filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk and laying his finger aside of his nose and giving a nod up the chimney he rose he sprang to his sleigh to his team gave a whistle and away they all flew like the down of a thistle but i heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight happy christmas to all and to all a good night","The Night Before Christmas","2001"
"Laurie Z","met my old lover in the grocery store the snow was falling christmas eve i stood behind her in the frozen foods and i touched her on the sleeve she didnt recognize the face at first but then her eyes flew open wide she went to hug me and she spilled her purse and we laughed until we cried we took her groceries to the check out stand the food was totaled up and bagged we stood there lost in our embarrassment as the conversation lagged we went to have ourselves a drink or two but couldnt find an open bar we bought a six pack at the liquor store and we drank it in her car we drank a toast to innocence we drank a toast to now we tried to reach beyond the emptiness but neither one knew how she said shes married her an architect who kept her warm and safe and dry she would have liked to say she loved the man but she didnt like to lie i said the years had been a friend to her and that her eyes were still as blue but in those eyes i wasnt sure if i saw doubt or gratitude she said she saw me in the record stores and that i must be doing well i said the audience was heavenly but the traveling was hell we drank a toast to innocence we drank a toast to now we tried to reach beyond the emptiness but neither one knew how we drank a toast to innocence we drank a toast to time reliving in our eloquence another auld lang syne the beer was empty and our tongues were tired and running out of things to say she gave a kiss to me as i got out and i watched her drive away just for a moment i was back at school and felt that old familiar pain and as i turned to make my way back home the snow turned into rain","Same Old Lang Syne Medley","2001"

"Lazyboy","the warmest welcome to everybody reading the manual the manual gives you the basic information about the ingredients and the six step easy to follow guide please pay attention to the useful advice and the helpful tips as we lead you through ingredients you need a small piece of thick paper as a mouth piece the most common is to use the top side from a hard top cigarette pack you need large size rolling papers one of the best brands on the market is smoking because their rolling papers are very thin and are the perfect size you need tobacco the finest tobacco is hand rolling tobacco but a second possibility is to use the tobacco from a normal cigarette you need pot grass ganja marijuana it has various names but they all refer to the following three main types weed weed is the bud from hemp plants the effect is usually uplifting and mellow hash hash is the pressed pollens and resins of the marijuana plant you will experience a more relaxed feeling and a stronger effect than weed skunk skunk is the artificially grown hemp plant and is usually the strongest of the three there are different ways to make a joint but we have produced this six step easy to follow guide one if you have hash you need to heat it and crumble it if its weed you need to remove the seeds first and then crumble it as well two roll the mouth piece fold the end of the paper three times and then roll it in to a cylindrical form three take the rolling paper and hold it with the gum side on top away from you four now mix the weed hash or skunk with the tobacco on the rolling paper a good mix makes the joint burn nice and smooth but be careful half a gram is enough to get four people stoned if youre beginners five begin rolling place the mouth piece in one end of the rolling paper then start rolling from the middle going outwards let your thumbs do the walking and try to give support and pressure with your fore fingers six wet the glue and seal the joint now you have a joint it s up to you what you want to do with it","The Manual [Chapter 4]","2006"
