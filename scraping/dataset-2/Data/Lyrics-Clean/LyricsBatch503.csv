"Jorn","can you remember remember my name as i flow through your life a thousand oceans i have flown and cold spirits of ice all my life i am the echo of your past echo of your past i am returning the echo of a point in time distant faces shine a thousand warriors i have known and laughing as the spirits appear all your all your life shadows of another day and if you hear me talking on the wind youve got to understand we must remain perfect strangers i know i know i must remain inside this silent well of sorrow a strand of silver hanging through the sky touching more than you see the voice of ages in your mind oh is aching with the dead of the night oh oh precious life your tears are lost in falling rain and if you hear me talking on the wind youve got to understand we must remain perfect strangers","Perfect Strangers",""
