"Symphony X","lurking out of sight night shall fall and feed my frenzy beneath an eerie moon a change comes over me eyes glow by candlelight a face divided in the mirror my psyche ripped by daggers of my alchemy side by side with myself again as midnights curse descends on trembling hands oh save my soul losing control when the bells toll savage on the prowl in the lamplights glow nocturnal my breath hangs like ghosts in the evening air this ill effect a vile creation of my design abomination the madness rages on and on side by side with myself again as midnights curse descends on trembling hands oh save my soul losing control when the bells toll oh feed my soul im in control when the bells toll","The Turning","2002"
"Symphony X","alone i traveled through the mountains led by a star fading west when i came upon an ancient ruin of a church and it was there i stopped to rest then the black and gloomy night that chased my footsteps crashed down on me like a wave whispering through the trees and eerie breeze carried a voice beckoning me to be her slave in a whisper she said burn forever leave never from my arms embrace the night from the black and twisting shadows rose a woman beauty alluring to the eye oh her devilish grin her moonlit skin and long dark hair flowing down around her thighs as she approached i felt the evil growing stronger i waltz with the wicked within frozen in my place she kissed my face and in a storm of passion bathed me in sin in the madness she said then she weaved a mist and cast me into the shadows come with me love eternally forever mine set me free in death well dance eternally forever and ever as so the light cast down from the heavens washed over me like wave i awoke it seems from some crazy dream only to find i was standing at her grave in my nightmare she said burn forever leave never from my arms dont ever leave me never leave me","Wicked","2002"
