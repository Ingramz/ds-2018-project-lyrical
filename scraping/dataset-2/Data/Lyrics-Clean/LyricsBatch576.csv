a shimmering cavity then flattening like an elasticine band that stretches and contorts and then id widen like the space highway spiraling sideways contract and dilate then straighten up at 100 mph then fall on myself in layers like a thickened band of taffy assuming every length and shape imaginable then i catapulted lorraine and her stuffed animal into still deeper space but fathoming what i

not strengthened yet and the momentum sent them stretching through my intentions and i popped dolly lost and lorraine plopped back down into her bedroom and coughed born the correlation relation
