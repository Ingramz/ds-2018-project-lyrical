friends house to eat and the food just aint no good i mean the macaronis soggy the peas are mushed and the chicken tastes like wood so you try to play it off like you think you can by saying that youre full and then your friend says momma hes just being polite he aint finished uh uh thats bull so your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie and you say that you already ate and your friend says man theres plenty of food so you pile some more on your plate while the stinky foods steaming your mind starts to dreaming of the moment that its time to leave and then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rotting into something that looks like cheese oh so you say thats it i got to leave this place i dont care what these people think im just sitting here making myself nauseous with this ugly food that stinks so you bust out the door while its still closed still sick from the food you ate and then you run to the store for quick relief from a bottle of kaopectate and then you call
