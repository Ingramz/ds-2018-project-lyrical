i let go when i first met your moms i gave your mom respect but now i see she knows me i see that she suspects im some bad guy i dont know why you have to tell your mother lies about you and i but when your first told me she said that i was a no no cause of my haircut and people call me solo before the time you said you really didnt care now you tell me to change my name or even cut my hair how would you ever go become somebodys wife and at the age of 22 you let your mother run your life me im not the type to tell your moms to get lost yell out loud to flip and get my point across see i think you should tell your moms to leave us two alone and stop reading our love letters and evesdropping on the phone cause if you really liked my youd let your mommy know she gotta mind her business before i let go your moms in our business shes in our business cant you see girl that your moms trying to end this your moms in our business now tell your moms to mind her business before i let go repeat 2x remember your sister and her boyfriend sam seed your mommas the real reason why your sister lost her man her and sam went together for a real long time but sam controlled her body while your mom controlled her mind not saying she was hurt when your moms made em break up deep down i could tell though your sister wanted to make up with sam because she wanted to become his wife and now she cant do that because your mother runs her life you baby you do the same things too you always want to to the crazy things your mommy wants you to do like when we went to the movie she had to come along i went back and forth and forth and back for peanuts and popcorn she took advantage cause i was living fat i couldnt even watch the movie she kept me running back for something that she wanted somewhere else in the store i walked and got it all til the man said theres no more and when i got back to the car she took her time to move over when i sat in the car my movie was like over i was mad hurt i didnt want to talk deep down i wanted you and your mommy both to walk i took you home anyway like what the heck cause i was raised to treat peoples mothers with respect but when we got to your home we wasnt left alone she waited there in the car with us until i headed home you called me on the phone saying you were alone but thats a lie because i heard your moms breathing on the phone and if you really like me let your moms know she should mind her business before i let go your moms in our business shes in our business cant you see girl that your moms trying to end this your moms in
