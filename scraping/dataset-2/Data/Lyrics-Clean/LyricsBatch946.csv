"Roger Powell","see yourself as a child reaching out in search of a landmark to guide your way put yourself to the test the trial by fire cause its the only way the only way the future in balance on a high wire cross a valley of stars makes you dizzy so dont look down just keep on walking towards the other side after centuries of historys unfolding madness the force of nature tempering the human race we aint got it right yet but we can still turn the whole thing around get ready for the new crusade i will be your landmark show you the way when the path is lost secrets all revealed and if we band together the universe well measure knowledge that we hold in trust is our battle shield windows emergency splashdown warning light flashes emergency splashdown its every man for himself now too late to send out for help now cant find the horizon my thoughts are capsizing then the beam of truth shining clear cuts through cloudy skies of doubt and despair and the pathway beneath your feet will lead us on to solar mystique temperatures rising each moment its climbing strapped into this hot seat i cant take the heat now life chain unwinding with split second timing let the power return to my hands let it be in your own to command all illusions will melt like ice cubes when at last we master the past","Air Pocket","1980"

"Roger Robinson","i am i am searching i am searching for faith beauty and hip hop i am searching for all those who died between hip hop and heaven and all souls set adrift and free from bedlam with headstrong lyrics that rise like smoke from silver incense burners i wonder who stole the thunder with the rasping edge and who banged for baptisms with butterflies serpentine roads and sunsets broken by cicadas have we really lost our century in an hour are we devoured by blind faith in the powers that be are these words as tense as drawn bow strings shall we rebuild the tears like sap from rubber trees answer me answer me you t s elliots in goose down jackets with your felt tip urban hieroglyphs spliff smoke and spray paint answer me you soliloquists with clenched fists round the mike answer me you angels in addidas tell me do m c s still howl rhymes into the purple black of midnight do they still fight to make arrangements with deities courting them with a jangle of gold and silver bangles on their wrist i need yearning voices of mangled passion i need rehearsed create those style of faith and fashion im searching for hip hop beats stomping feet to implore the ringing across the seagulls to muffle the sun im searching for perfumed cherry blossoms and you see there will be no toast to the future in the banquet table of no golden petals weaving a carpet of light no hint of arrogance on puckered lips no wind swept islands and dreams of sun lit silence no riot of flowers and beauty magnified through outmost attention and no free style incantations to save the souls of man im peeling off your straitjacket so you feel the sun my friend i want wings a feather and booms so we can fly like birds to better lands im wondering im wondering how temples are now smokestacks im up all night in silvery moonlight with palms of who stole my afro pick who licked my fingertips to sooth scratches from the vinyl groove has anybody seen faith beauty and hip hop i have to find faith beauty and hip hop","The Quest [Dixon's Not Released In 2001]","2004"
