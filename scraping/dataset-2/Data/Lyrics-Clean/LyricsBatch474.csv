the voice yeah yeah yeah i said leave me no choice about to bring noise got to fill this void i got to be the voice what the government is doing to most our people is downright evil but not surprising thats for certain under the conflict of propaganda i believe simply trying to slander start a civil war within the usa amongst black and white and those elite they are simply pushing us to our limit so that we can all get together and get with it they want us to rebel so that it makes easier for them to kill us and put us in jails alton sterlings are happening every day in this country and around the world the scary part boys and girls is most of these stories dont make it to the news and reach mass consciousness it is for sure time that we as a people stand up for acknowledgement and accomplishment of what we call human rights it is time to rebel better yet raise hell i just want everyone to be cautious about how they go about it because this is all part of the governments plan they been plottin theyre literally begging for this to happen so they can kill us off using uprising and rebellion as an excuse in a timely fashion the cancerous foods the chemical warfare economic suffering is not working fast enough there are many steps ahead of us and manifesting the future that they want we have to work together not only rattling them on a physical plane but to outsmart them on an intellectual mental level the same as black men i think our gangs need to do a better job at protecting us the people our communities and not assisting in destroying them brutally its time to even the score cause who do we call when the police break the law we are so quick to pick up a gun and kill one another but not quick enough to pick it up and protect each other the code words to killin a black man by police is hes got a gun damned if he do damned if he dont damned if he runs or what about them them murderers got it we need solutions you better start plotting now its always been clear that they dont value our lives my people been suffering way too long and im tired of singing the same old song people acting like this shit isnt happening its downright wrong justice wont be served by a hashtag and thats the very reason i ask that what are we to do were scattered around with no clue of this ugly truth all we know is who they ridiculed and who gets minisculed time to wake the fuck up and do our own research and not form opinions based on just what weve heard ameri k k k a is force feeding you lies down your throats with a silver spoon and eventually well all be
