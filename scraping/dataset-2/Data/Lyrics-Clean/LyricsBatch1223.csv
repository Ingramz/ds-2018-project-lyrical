began to pick the corn and the pharisees the legalistics of the day they came and they were chastising them that why are you doing this on the sabbath  they had this whole discourse and dialog between the two of them jesus was saying listen do you do you not remember that you you yourself arent even worthy you guys break unleavened bread on on the sabbath and you kill the sacrifice you clean the sacrifice they have a need and its my job and my responsibility to meet their need and im at their need i trump the synagogue i trump the sabbath im lowered of your life im lowered of everything that is you im lowered of this this day recognize who youre talking to but in the course of the whole thing what i realize is that the dialog was between the pharisees or the religious leaders of the day was between the dignitaries the officials of the church and jesus the disciples never uttered a word he literally started embodying his permanent position in our lives because he stepped in between the law and the people he says no im grace and because of me they dont have to defend themselves to you ill do all the talking my blood will speak through all of eternity i have justified them even in their wrong i know that they are wrong i know that they make mistakes i know that they are not perfect i know that they do things that are not pleasing but even in their wrong my blood will speak on their behalf and i will just somebody should have shouted right there because he didnt kill you for all the sinful acts that you committed but he justified you god bless me with this song it simply speaks the life of that message and im just excited to be able to share it with you hey justified me glorified me paid my ransom and ive been redeemed by his blood go to calvary ive been made free

"Trans-Siberian Orchestra","now why this mans soul was bleeding the angel had to understand so invisible he stood by him and then gently touched his hand which caused the man to stand there still despite the winters cold and while he stood there in that trance the angel read his soul it seemed the man was not always like the man he had become and that angel wondered how that change had happened and when it had begun the man had been born to a kind and religious family and raised in the midwest and all throughout his childhood this man clearly had been blessed he grew up believing among other things man was made in the image of god he went to school observed all rules while working very hard he had always tried to help others excelled at nearly every task and when hed graduated high school of course he was the first one in his class and in his eighteenth summer when it was time for him to leave he had offers from several colleges all of them ivy league and at college in all his studies he always received straight a s and when he tried his hand in theater he got the lead in the senior play it appeared to nearly everyone there was no talent that he lacked and for three years on the football team he was the star quarterback and there he also met the girl who did become his wife with her his world was now complete he had the perfect life when they had graduated college they were wed in a ceremony quite grand then they moved to new york in a dream they seemed caught where all had been perfectly planned she decorated their park avenue apartment in a 1920s art deco style and six months after they had moved in she told him they would soon be having a child and after their first ultrasound he knew they were having a son their lives could not have been better and they had only just begun together they arrived early at the hospital on the delivery date the father was taking no chances and did not want to risk being late but while waiting outside the delivery room he could tell that something was going wrong for too many doctors were rushing in with none coming out for too long when her own doctor finally came out with several nurses at his side he said that his wife had started hemorrhaging and despite their best efforts she died then in an effort to console him a nurse gave him his newborn to hold but from the way the child felt limp in his arms he knew there was still more bad news to be told the doctor then gave the prognosis as gently as anyone could but before he could finish explaining the father only too well understood the child had been cut off from oxygen for minutes which is far too long the damage was now irreversible his brain permanently malformed hed never hold a job learn to read or ever talk and it would be a miracle if the child even learned how to walk and with those words the father felt his entire world falling apart and he stumbled for the words to express the tearing inside of his heart he cried out why did god have to take her while she was still so young and then as if to cut him deeper leave this thing here as his son please explain to me gods wisdom how could he decide to take from me my precious wife while leaving this alive there is no reason for this life why does he even exist and if he had never been born there is no way hed have ever been missed if man is made in gods image then something here is surely amiss for there is nothing of god nothing of god nothing of god nothing of god nothing of god in this and then he asked for the child to be placed in a state run home and after he had signed the papers he walked into that night alone and in this world he found unkind he built a wall around his mind and every year hed add new parts until it had also enclosed his heart he kept his job and paid his debts as he slowly became a silhouette of a man walking among the tombs while living his life within his wounds he distanced himself from all his friends even his sisters and brothers and as time it went by he developed his eyes so they could only see the flaws in others with this final glimpse the angel stepped away and the man shook himself out of his trance then continued his walk back towards his home and few would have given his soul half of a chance and the angel himself felt helpless as he watched that old man there so he did what even humans do and he quickly said a prayer and as the prayer flew to his lord the angel did decide to carefully follow the old man and stay closely by his side for on this night can one deny the gift of a more sympathetic eye to cast upon our fellow man and on this night to understand the frailty of childhood dreams like fireflies over summer streams and if one dared to remove times veil could one retrace those childhood trails but whispers in the winters wind told of rescued dreams forgiven sins and who among us shall be deemed to rescue some forgotten dream so on this night of christmas eve as once again the spirits weave its snow swept dreams and colored lights with bits of magic into each life and as the snow comes gently down its soul intent to reach the ground to cover scars the world still feels perhaps to give them time to heal for as men invest in money and professors in what they know god invests in mercy like winter invests in snow","The Wisdom of Snow","2004"
