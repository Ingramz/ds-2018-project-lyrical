"Tote King","david bravo abogado y miembro del osr al igual que tote king grabado en una conferencia en granada el dia 23 03 06 la primera de estas mentiras es el propio nombre pirateria es algo habitual en los medios de comunicacion jugar con el lenguaje ustedes lo habran visto utilizan eufemismos para suavizar ciertos problemas graves y utilizan tambien exageraciones para convertir en problemas graves lo que son realidades para nosotros inofensivas por ejemplo en cuanto a los eufemismos es habitual que ya no existan las guerras sino las intervenciones militares donde hay efectos colaterales que son esos que saltan por los aires sin saber de que va la cosa cada vez que hay una incursion aerea es casi poetico eh una incursion aerea ya no hay paro en el paradisiaco mundo del eufemismo sino que hay tasa natural de desempleo ya no hay pobres sino carentes ya no hay ricos sino que los hay pudientes politicamente correcto es como se llama al lenguaje que utilizan en los medios de comunicacion es como se llama en realidad al disfraz que usan las palabras para salir en television en cuanto a esto de los eufemismos es curioso porque cada vez que leo los periodicos me siento mucho menos preocupado por mis problemas porque ahora se que mi economia no se va al garete como pensaba y no que simplemente esta experimentando un crecimiento negativo es decir que crece pero que crece para abajo crece en la direccion incorrecta y los ricos que me roban por el camino para que eso sea asi no son ladrones sino que son cleptomanos que se enriquecieron por un golpe de suerte que es como decir que se enriquecieron como por arte de magia en cuanto a las exageraciones ocurre igual y tiene el mismo objeto que es cambiar la percepcion que tenemos de la realidad y es ahi donde aparece en escena la palabra pirateria el hecho de que se establezca una equivalencia moral entre las personas que se descargan discos de musica en internet y las personas que asaltaban los barcos mataban a la tripulacion la asesinaban la saqueaban la violaban algunos los mas viciosos eso obviamente no es una casualidad sino que lo que se pretende es que una palabra asi pirateria c en tantas connotaciones negativas ya te este dando una pista de lo que debes pensar porque es complicado enunciar una frase como yo estoy a favor de la pirateria sin que suene a demencia senil","Interludio Osr","2005"
