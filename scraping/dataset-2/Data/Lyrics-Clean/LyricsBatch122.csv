handed him another quarter and he reached out of the window there and dropped it in the toll basket up comes the gate and out comes johnnys camero johnnys camero johnny loved his camero maybe more than life itself oh it was no big deal he was just taking her to the airport it was autumn in new york city there was a wind a lot like this it was springtime however in africa shed been saving up her money she was going to go on one of these outward bound trips so he was just giving her a ride to the airport and around and around the airport they went through that parking garage looking for a parking space theres one she said no theres one she said no you see actually it takes two parking spaces for johnnys camero johnnys camero hes a little nervous walking through the airport hes always looking back over his shoulder you can go back if you want she said no no man ill stay and he did he stayed until the plane took off then he ran back but meanwhile she was high up over the city she was looking down she was looking down at the lights of the buildings she was looking down at the lights of the boats on the water she was looking down at the lights you could see them crossing the bridges and through the little canyon streets little tiny diamond toward you and ruby away you know those little tiny moving lights and she knew that one of them was well you know man ive got to tell you about the adventure she had in africa i think i should start with the silver bracelet i think thats where it all turns around she hadnt been on the trip long and one of the guides sort of took her under his wing cause she was sort of startled easy she was a little nervous about being out there the first time she got sunburned through her hat she realized she was a long way from being home she had just left the group for a little while one day she had just went to take a pee she said ill be right back but she didnt come back for awhile and this guide this african man went to look for her laura laura he found her standing on the lowest branch of a fairly tall tree way off the ground how you get up there well she had jumped why well there was a hyena and they had told her about hyenas they have jaws that can crush bone she wasnt in a really confident position anyway and she just ran and there was the branch she jumped one hand slipped one hand held she was not coming down hes gone so now she trusted him and she swings back down and both arms straight hanging from that branch her feet are four feet off the ground man she didnt know she could jump that high ah but she does now it was changes like that that made him give her that silver bracelet it was the one that hed always wear kind of between his elbow and his shoulder kind of wrapped tight around his arm it was a beautiful silver bracelet and he bent it down to fit around her muscle there and she smiled so much so that it startled him so much so that on the last day of that trip when they were getting back on the bus to go to the small airport to go to the big airport to go across the ocean to go back to you know when they were getting back on the bus and she leaned out the window for that last little cheesecake snapshot and as he looked through the camera he had to slowly take the camera down and turn his head to the side a little bit look a little bit sad and say how you get up there she was dreaming over the ocean dreaming of being home again dreaming over the ocean of what would never be the same well he wasnt at the gate when she got into the airport he must have been looking for a parking space so she just walked through the airport you know and it wasnt like before now the airport seemed kind of small the airport seemed kind of stuffy ceiling was a little bit low and everyone was getting out of her way i dont know well actually i do know maybe it was because it had been winter you see and she had just come back from summer and she was just dressed normally everyone else was bundled up but she had on her hiking boots and shorts and tank top hair tied back and a knife on her belt and a big old silver bracelet i think it was the silver bracelet but everybody was getting out of her way she didnt see him til the backpack comes rolling down the old baggage claim and suddenly theres this arm and this voice saying ill get that and she says hey thats my backpack gimme it where you parked so he reluctantly gave her the backpack and she swung it over her shoulder and they went out and carefully nestled it in the trunk and then out of the parking garage and into the city and she had to lean out the window she pushed the button and made the window go down and she leaned out a little bit to feel the wind in her hair man this is the wild place to be i mean this is the place she has to lean a little further out of the car just to just to see it all just to look up at some of the buildings as a matter of fact she leaned a little farther back so she could look back behind and watch those big tires rolling on that pavement and then suddenly the window came back up and she comes back in startled and sure enough johnnys got his finger on the power the power the power window and hes looking at her like will you get your feet off the upholstery the upholstery the upholstery she forgot how could she forget well shed been in africa come on she took her feet off the upholstery as a matter of fact she took her feet off the upholstery politely as a matter of fact she folded her hands in her lap and she settled in for this ride i saw just a glint of a smile as she turned her face to one side maybe to feel the plush upholstery brush against her cheek maybe to see the lights of the graphic equalizer on the stereo reflected in the side window maybe to watch that lone drop of water make its weary way across that perfectly waxed surface but i think it was just to enjoy this ride this ride this last ride in johnnys camero johnnys camero a c 1991 midnight ocean bonfire music

he reached out of the window there and dropped it in the toll basket up comes the gate and out comes johnnys camero johnnys camero johnny loved his camero maybe more than life itself oh it was no big deal he was just taking her to the airport it was autumn in new york city there was a wind a lot like this it was springtime however in africa shed been saving up her money she was going to go on one of these outward bound trips so he was just giving her a ride to the airport and around and around the airport they went through that parking garage looking for a parking space theres one she said no theres one she said no you see actually it takes two parking spaces for johnnys camero johnnys camero hes a little nervous walking through the airport hes always looking back over his shoulder you can go back if you want she said no no man ill stay and he did he stayed until the plane took off then he ran back but meanwhile she was high up over the city she was looking down she was looking down at the lights of the buildings she was looking down at the lights of the boats on the water she was looking down at the lights you could see them crossing the bridges and through the little canyon streets little tiny diamond toward you and ruby away you know those little tiny moving lights and she knew that one of them was well you know man ive got to tell you about the adventure she had in africa i think i should start with the silver bracelet i think thats where it all turns around she hadnt been on the trip long and one of the guides sort of took her under his wing cause she was sort of startled easy she was a little nervous about being out there the first time she got sunburned through her hat she realized she was a long way from being home she had just left the group for a little while one day she had just went to take a pee she said ill be right back but she didnt come back for awhile and this guide this african man went to look for her laura laura he found her standing on the lowest branch of a fairly tall tree way off the ground how you get up there well she had jumped why well there was a hyena and they had told her about hyenas they have jaws that can crush bone she wasnt in a really confident position anyway and she just ran and there was the branch she jumped one hand slipped one hand held she was not coming down hes gone so now she trusted him and she swings back down and both arms straight hanging from that branch her feet are four feet off the ground man she didnt know she could jump that high ah but she does now it was changes like that that made him give her that silver bracelet it was the one that hed always wear kind of between his elbow and his shoulder kind of wrapped tight around his arm it was a beautiful silver bracelet and he bent it down to fit around her muscle there and she smiled so much so that it startled him so much so that on the last day of that trip when they were getting back on the bus to go to the small airport to go to the big airport to go across the ocean to go back to you know when they were getting back on the bus and she leaned out the window for that last little cheesecake snapshot and as he looked through the camera he had to slowly take the camera down and turn his head to the side a little bit look a little bit sad and say how you get up there she was dreaming over the ocean dreaming of being home again dreaming over the ocean of what would never be the same well he wasnt at the gate when she got into the airport he must have been looking for a parking space so she just walked through the airport you know and it wasnt like before now the airport seemed kind of small the airport seemed kind of stuffy ceiling was a little bit low and everyone was getting out of her way i dont know well actually i do know maybe it was because it had been winter you see and she had just come back from summer and she was just dressed normally everyone else was bundled up but she had on her hiking boots and shorts and tank top hair tied back and a knife on her belt and a big old silver bracelet i think it was the silver bracelet but everybody was getting out of her way she didnt see him til the backpack comes rolling down the old baggage claim and suddenly theres this arm and this voice saying ill get that and she says hey thats my backpack gimme it where you parked so he reluctantly gave her the backpack and she swung it over her shoulder and they went out and carefully nestled it in the trunk and then out of the parking garage and into the city and she had to lean out the window she pushed the button and made the window go down and she leaned out a little bit to feel the wind in her hair man this is the wild place to be i mean this is the place she has to lean a little
