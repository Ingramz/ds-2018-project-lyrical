boat out on a spring tide now ye could die and hope for heaven but yed need to work your shift and id expect yes all to back us to the hilt and if st peter at his gate were to ask ye why yer late why youd tell him that ye had to get a ship built we built battleships and cruisers for her majesty the queen super tankers for onassis and all the classes in between we built the greatest shipping tonnage that the world has ever seen and the only life weve known is in the shipyard all the platers and the welders and the boiler making crews when they see that bugger finished on the slipway all the hardships soon forgot and well cheer as like as not and the bairnsll wave their union jacks all day its a patriotic scene all thats missing is the queen but she said she couldnt make it of a tuesday then something wells up here inside and you could take it in yer stride but you wonder if youll see another payday for theres a mixture of emotions hatred gratitude and pride and you hate yourself for crying but its difficult to hide for theres a sadness in the leavin and ye worry whats ahead and that worry never leaves ye keeps on nagging in yer head and so ye pray to god for orders but yell worry till yer dead until they bury your remains in the blacksmiths shed and the only life yeve known is in the shipyard steel in the stockyard iron in the soul well conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole and i dont know what well do if this yard gets sold for the only life weve known is in the shipyard my name is adrian sanderson and rivetings me trade but its intellectual discourse im known better for and i may forego english grammar when im injured with a hammer but ive a preference for the deference of a metaphor ive read the odyssey by homer and the iliad as well i read tacitus and pliny and the scarlet pimpernel i put a night shift in with dante on his journey into hell and thats what well all be facing if the yards put up to sell for the only life yeve known is in the shipyard now what about those trojan wars and the troubles that they caused when they sailed off on that summers afternoon aye the ship they had was crap and theyd lost the effin map when they tried to get their selves back to the toon theres a lesson in these tales although they happened ages past just like in spartacus that film by stanley kubrick first its tragedy then farce then theyll kick you in the arse when you tempt the gods with arrogance and hubris well its obvious im gifted with the rhymin and the meter and hereabouts im thought of highly as a bard if i wasnt shooting rivets id be famous in me time all those literary circles i could dazzle with me rhyme and i never lacked ambition you could say it was a crime and rivets may be riveting but sonnets are sublime but the only life ive known is in the shipyard steel in the stockyard iron in the soul well conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole but we dont know what well do if the yard gets sold for the only life weve known is in the shipyard ah me name is tommy thompson im shop steward for the union me dream is proletarian revolution comrades brothers fellow travellers and others class struggle is the means of dialectic evolution das kapitals me bible and the ruling class are liable and quoting marx and engels its entirely justifiable if the workers revolution here is ever to be viable and we become the rightful owners of this shipyard so its a one day stoppage or an overtime ban or a work to rule for the five year plan til the means of production are safely in our hands and we become the rightful owners of this shipyard im not saying it wont be hard if the boss hands us me cards when they try to close us down like other shipyards and if industrial action only helps the competition as ive heard the bosses bleating from their usual position and i stand accused of anarchy disruption and sedition well yell never knock us down you reactionary clowns when its time for occupation of the shipyard my name is peggy white and ive nursed ye through your injuries and yer cuts and wounds ive bound busted arms and busted heads broken backs and broken legs id sooner put ye in a splint than have them put ye in the ground and the fumes from all the welding where the poison air is hung and the toxic radiation thats been blackening your tongue i could give yous all an aspirin while youre coughing up your lungs but its all youll ever get here in this shipyard my name is arthur cook im the union superintendent where i represent the interests of yes all and i listen to you men as you talk about the future but the truth is that were heading for a god almighty fall but its clear that interventions not the governments intention cos theyve got no need for ships now have i got your full attention while the closing of the yard may be beyond your comprehension im the one who sees the writin on the shipyard wall ive begged and ive pleaded at every meeting that weve held that we limit our demands to this reality its like two different metals in a join ye cannot weld and theres nothing to be gained from this dream of solidarity theres nowt for us to bargain with when the industrys at sea it must be obvious to you as its obvious to me and my advice to all of yous is to take redundancy and accept that theres no future in this shipyard steel in the stockyard iron in the soul well conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole but i dont know what well do if the yard gets sold for the only life weve known is in the shipyard ah me name is davy harrison i like a drink or two you could ask me when it started but i havent got a clue im never sad or miserable im never ever blue and ill still be up tomorrow for the shipyard i drink meself into a stupor and i wake up with two heeds and then the missus starts complainin about all me drunken deeds like when i got the train to sunderland but found meself in leeds and i had to get up early for the shipyard i once gave up the drinking was it 1963 but it seems as if sobriety was not the thing for me it was the worst three hours i ever hope to see steel in the stockyard iron in the soul well conjure up a ship where there used to be a hole and the ship sets sail and the tale gets told and the only life ive known is in the shipyard steel in the stockyard iron in the soul well get the bastard finished and well end up on the dole and we dont know what well do if the yard gets sold the only life weve ever known is in the shipyard","Shipyard","2013"
