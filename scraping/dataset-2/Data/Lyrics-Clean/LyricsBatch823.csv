clear the light is good i have no fear nor no one should the woods are just trees the trees are just wood i sort of hate to ask it but do you have a basket into the woods and down the dell the path is straight i know it well into the woods and who can tell whats waiting on the journey into the woods to bring some bread to granny who is sick in bed never can tell what lies ahead for all that i know shes already dead but into the woods into the woods into the woods to grandmothers house and home before dark fly birds back to the sky back to the eaves and the leaves and the fields and the hurry up and do my hair cinderella are you really wearing that here i found a little tear cinderella cant you hide it with a hat you look beautiful i know she means me put it in a twist who will be there mother said be good father said be nice that was always their advice so be nice cinderella good cinderella nice good good nice tighter whats the good of being good if everyone is blind and youre always left behind never mind cinderella kind cinderella nice good nice kind good nice not that tight sorry clod who might that be its the witch from next door the old enchantress told the couple she had placed a spell on their house what spell in the past when your mother was with child she developed an unusual appetite she took one look at my beautiful garden and told your father that what she wanted more than anything in the world was greens greens and nothing but greens parsley peppers cabbages and celery asparagus and watercress and fiddleferns and lettuce he said all right but it wasnt quite cause i caught him in the autumn in my garden one night he was robbing me raping me rooting through my rutabaga raiding my arugula and ripping up my rampion my champion my favorite i should have laid a spell on him right there could have changed him into stone or a dog or a chair but i let him have the rampion id lots to spare in return however i said fair is fair you can let me have the baby that your wife will bear and well call it square i had a brother no but you had a sister but the witch refused to tell him anymore of his sister not even that her name was rapunzel i though i had been more than reasonable but how was i to know what your father had also hidden in his pocket what beans beans the special beans i let him go i didnt know hed stolen my beans i was watching him crawl back over the wall then bang crash and the lightning flash and well thats another story never mind anyway at last the big day came and i made my claim oh dont take away the baby they shrieked and screeched but i did and i hid her where shell never be reached and your father cried and your mother died when for extra measure i admit it was a pleasure i said sorry im still not mollified and i laid little spell on them you too son that your family tree would always be a barren one so theres no more fuss and theres no more scenes and my garden thrives you should see my nectarines but im telling you the same i tell kings and queens dont ever never ever mess around with my greens especially the beans now closely to me jack lead milky white to market and fetch the best price you can are you listening to me jack jack jack head in a sack the house is getting colder this is not the time for dreaming chimney stack starting to crack the mice are getting bolder the floors gone slack your mothers getting older your fathers not back and you cant just sit here dreaming pretty dreams to wish and wait from day to day will never keep the wolves away so into the woods the time is now we have to live i dont care how into the woods to sell the cow you must begin the journey straight to the woods and dont delay you have to face the marketplace into the woods to journeys end into the woods to sell a friend meanwhile the witch for purposes of her own explained how the baker might lift the spell you wish to have the curse reversed ill need a certain potion first go to the woods and bring me back one the cow as white as milk two the cape as red as blood three the hair as yellow as corn four the slipper as pure as gold bring me these before the chime of midnight in three days time and you shall have i guarantee a child as perfect as child can be go to the wood ladies our carriage waits now may i go to the festival the festival darling those nails darling those clothes lentils are one thing but darling with those youd make us the fools of the festival and mortify the prince our carriage is waiting we must be gone good night father i wish look what i found in fathers hunting jacket six beans well take them with us no the spell is on my house only i can lift the spell the spell is on my house no no the spell is on our house we must lift the spell no you are not to come and that is final now what am i to return with you dont remember the cow as white as milk the cape as red as blood the hair as yellow as corn the slipper as pure as gold the cow as white as milk the cape as red as

cape as red as blood the hair as yellow as corn i know ill visit mothers grave the grave at the hazel tree and tell her i just want to go to the kings festival into the woods its time to go it may be all in vain you i know into the woods but even so i have to take the journey into the woods the path is straight you know it well but who can tell into the woods to lift the spell into the woods to visit mother into the woods to fetch the things to make the potion to got to the festival into the woods without regret the choice is made the task is set into the woods but not forget ting why im on the journey into the woods to get my wish i dont care how the time is now into the woods to sell the cow into the woods to get the money into the woods to lift the spell to make the potion to go to

wood no need to be afraid there theres something in the glade there into the woods without delay but careful not to lose the way into the woods who knows what may be lurking on the journey into the woods to get the thing that makes it worth the journeying into the woods to see the king to sell the cow to make the potion to see to sell to get to bring to make to lift to go to the festival into
