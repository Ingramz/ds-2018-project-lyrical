jon always said it was nicer here than under the atmospheric domes of the outer planets we have had peace since 2062 when the surviving planets were banded together under the red star of the solar

hidden beneath the cave i found it i brushed away the dust of the years and picked it up holding it reverently in my hands i had no idea what it might be but it was beautiful i learned to lay my fingers across the wires and to turn the keys to make them sound differently as i struck the wires with my other hand i produced my first harmonious sounds and soon my own music how different it could be from the music of the temples i cant wait to tell the priests about it what can this strange device be when i touch it it gives forth a sound its got wires that vibrate and give music what can this

of grim expressionless faces father brown rose to his feet and his somnolent voice echoed throughout the silent temple hall instead of the grateful joy that i expected they were words of quiet rejection instead of praise sullen dismissal i watched in shock and horror as father brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet i know its most unusual to come before you so but ive found an ancient miracle i thought that you should know listen to my music and hear what it can do theres something here as strong as life i know that it will reach you the priests yes we know its

the summit of the staircase i see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world i was overwhelmed by both wonder and understanding as i saw a completely different way to life a way that had been crushed by the federation long ago i saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things i wandered home though the silent streets and fell into a fitful sleep escape to realms beyond the night dream cant you show me the light i stand atop a spiral stair an oracle confronts me there he leads me on light years away through astral nights galactic days i see the works of gifted hands that grace this strange and wondrous land i see the hand of man arise with hungry mind and open eyes they left the

struck the wires with my other hand i produced my first harmonious sounds and soon my own music how different it could be from the music of the temples i cant wait to tell the priests about it what can this strange device be when i touch it it gives forth a sound its got wires that vibrate and give music what can this thing be that i found see how it sings like a sad heart and joyously screams

the lives and works of this world i was overwhelmed by both wonder and understanding as i saw a completely different way to life a way that had been crushed by the federation long ago i saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things i wandered home though the silent streets and fell into a fitful sleep escape to realms beyond the night dream cant you show me the light i stand atop a spiral stair an oracle confronts me there he leads me on light years away through astral nights galactic days i see the works of gifted hands that grace this strange and wondrous land i see the hand of man arise with hungry mind and open eyes they left the planet long ago the elder race still learn and grow their power grows with purpose strong to claim the home where they belong home to tear the temples down home to change i have not left this cave for days now it has become my last refuge in my total despair i have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now i can no longer live under the control of the federation but there is no other place to go my last hope is that with my death i may pass into the world of my dream and know peace at last the sleep is still in my eyes the dream is still in my head i heave a sigh and sadly smile and lie a while in bed i wish that it might come to pass not fade like all my dreams just think of what my life might be in a world

pleasure to your eyes its one for all and all for one we work together common sons never need to wonder how or why we are the priests of the temples of syrinx our great computers fill the hallowed

priests of the temples of syrinx all the gifts of life are held within our walls behind my beloved waterfall in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave i found it i brushed away the dust of the years and picked it up holding it reverently in my hands i had no idea what it might be but it was beautiful i learned to lay my fingers across the wires and to turn the keys to make them sound differently as i struck the wires with my other hand i produced my first harmonious sounds and soon my own music how different it could be from the music of the temples i cant wait to tell the priests about it what can this strange device be when i touch it it gives forth a sound its got wires that vibrate and give music what can this thing be that i found see how it sings like a sad heart and joyously screams out its pain sounds that build high like a mountain or notes that fall gently like rain i cant wait to share this new wonder the people will all see its light let them all make their own music the priests praise my name on this night in the sudden silence as i finished playing i looked up to a circle of grim expressionless faces father brown rose to his feet and his somnolent voice echoed throughout the silent temple hall instead of the grateful joy that i expected they were words of quiet rejection instead of praise sullen dismissal i watched in shock and horror as father brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet i know its most unusual to come before you so but ive found an ancient miracle i thought that you should know listen to my music and hear what it can do theres something here as strong as life i know that it will reach you yes we know its nothing new its just a waste of time we have no need for ancient ways the world is doing fine

the average what use have they for you another toy will help destroy the elder race of man forget about your silly whim it doesnt fit the plan i guess it was a dream but even now it all seems so vivid to me clearly yet i see the beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase i see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world i was overwhelmed by both wonder and understanding as i saw a completely different way to life a way that had been crushed by the federation long ago i saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things i wandered home though the silent streets and fell into a fitful sleep escape to realms beyond the night dream cant you show me the light i stand atop a spiral stair an oracle confronts me there he leads me on light years away through astral nights galactic days i see the works of gifted hands that grace this strange and wondrous land i see the hand of man arise with hungry mind and open eyes they left the planet long ago the elder race still learn and grow their power grows with purpose strong to claim the home where they belong home to tear the temples down home to change i have not left this cave for days now it has become my last refuge in my total despair i have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now i can no longer live under the control of the federation but there is no other place to go my last hope is that with my death i may pass into the world of my dream and know peace at last the sleep is still in my eyes the dream is still in my head i heave a sigh and sadly smile and lie a while in bed i wish that it might come to pass not fade like all my dreams just think of what my life might be in a world like i have seen i dont think i can carry on carry on this cold and empty life oh no my spirits are low in the depths of despair my lifeblood spills over attention all planets of the solar federation
