latin quarters listenin to afrika bambaata give the order the call of the order was to avoid the slaughter he said record companies aint got nuttin for ya without a lawyer he taught the infinity lessons in how hip hop could be a many a blessing and that was great so in 1988 there was no debate we had to end the hate the name of the game was stop the violence and unity knowledge and self reliance we started talkin bout martin and malcolm had these ghetto kids goin huh what about him 1989 professor griff speaks his mind but his freedom of speech is declined 1990 came with the west coast east coast west coast who is the best coast lookin back now of course it was bogus the whole argument was where we lost focus we got hopeless not with the lyrics and music but with hip hop and how we used it or abused it you know how the crew get you like it cause you choose it 1991 we opened our eyes with human education against lies we tried to talk about the state of humanity but all these others rappers got mad at me they called me captain human another message was sent self destruction dont pay the {fuckin} rent remember that nobody wanted conscious rap it was like where these ballers at where can they call us at all was wack hip hop culture was fallin flat and that was that so in 1992 i found my crew they said yo kris what you wanna do i said damn why they wanna get with me if i bust they {shit} im contradictory if i play the bitch role they take my shoe tell me what the {fuck} am i supposed to do so i did it dont stop get it get it get it all of a sudden these critics they wanna spit it kay are ess one is con tra dic to ry just cause i wouldnt let these rappers get with me {fuck} that {fuck} you and {fuck} your pen if a rapper wanna diss yo id do it again but im makin these ends and i got my friends and i really dont wanna have to sit in the pen so i go back to the philosopher 1993 hip hop is uhh wack go back check the facts 1994 return of the boom bap it wasnt all about the loot it was all about harry allen rhythm cultural institute blowin up 1995 conscious rap is still alive but nobody wanna play it nobody wanna say it nobody okayed it theyd all rather hate it 1996 it really dont stop we put together somethin called the temple of hip hop not just djin breakin graf and lyrics but how hip hop affects the spirit step into a world thats what i did 1997 i was raisin my kid or kids but i had to go cause new york djs changed the flows to clothes and hoes but that wasnt me ill be damned if i dance for the mtv so in 1998 i began to debate should i go now or should i really wait 99 i moved to l a you see and took a gig with the wb started studyin philosophy full time to have a full heart full body full mind but you know what the problem is or was djs dont raise our kids cuz they so caught up in the cash and jewels how they gonna really see a hip hop school how they gonna really see a hip hop temple they dont even wanna play my instrumentals but big up dr dre snoop xzibit especially xzibit he was there in a minute mic conception all of them said yo you need help i should call them when i was in l a i held the crown bloods

back to bam took me back to who i am brought me back to the new york land now i overstand {interviewer} now krs one now youve been quoted as saying that rap is something we do hip hop is something you live {krs} yes {interviewer} explain that to us please {krs one} well well today hip hop we are advocating that hip hop is not just a music it is an attitude it is an awareness it is a way to view the world so rap music is something we do but hip hop is something we live and we look at hip hop in its 9 elements which is breaking emceeing graffiti art deejaying beatboxing street fashion street language street knowledge and street entrepenurialism trade and business and uhh thats where yknow thats the hip hop that that that were about we come from the uhh the root of of kool dj herc who originated hip hop in the early 70s and then afrika bambaata and zulu nation mmhmm who instigated something called the infinity lessons and added conciousness to hip hop and then grandmaster flash with the invention of the mixer on to run d m c and then myself and uhh we created the stop the violence movement you may recall a song self destruction and and and so on all of this goes to uhh uhh
