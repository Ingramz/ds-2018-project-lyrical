"Nothing More","when you opened your eyes on the world for the first time as a child how brilliant the colors were what a jewel the sun was what marvel the stars how incredibly alive the trees were and to love again and again and have people to whom we are deeply attached go to sleep and never wake up and the laughter echoes only in ones mind but then the echo goes the memory the traces are all gone all your efforts all your achievements all your attainments turning into dust nothingness what is the feeling what happens to you the idea of god as the potter the architect of the universe it makes you feel that life is after all important that there is someone who cares it has meaning it has sense and you are valuable in the eyes of the father but after a while it got embarrassing the superstition the myth the absolutely unfounded idea why does anybody believe that so you become an atheist and then you feel terrible after that because you got rid of god but that means you got rid of yourself youre just nothing but a machine and your idea that youre a machine is just a machine too a machine in the system so if you think that thats the way things are you feel hostile to the world you feel that the world is a neurological trap into which you somehow got caught trapped you run from the maternity ward to the crematorium and thats it thats it so if youre a smart kid you commit suicide now i want to propose another idea all together the real you is not a puppet which life pushes around the real you the real deep down you is the whole universe you cannot confine yourself to what happens inside the skin your skin doesnt separate you from the world its a bridge but just as a magnet polarizes its self in north and south but its all one magnet so experience polarizes itself as self and other but its all one what you call the external world is as much you as your own body most people think that when they open theyre eyes and look around that what they are seeing is outside it seems doesnt it that you are behind your eyes we havent realized that life and death black and white good and evil being and non being come from the same center when you look for your own particularized center of being which is separate from everything else you wont be able to find it the only way youll know it isnt there is if you look hard enough to find out that it isnt there it isnt there at all there isnt a separate you there are in physical reality no such things as separate events people cant be talked out of illusions if a person believes that the earth is flat you cant talk him out of that he knows that its flat hell go down to the window and see that its obvious it looks flat so the only way to convince him that it isnt is to say well lets go and find the edge","Pyre","2014"

"Nox Aurea","since i once heard the enticing call from the depth of the most secret core the very rebellious lust of triumph burns wild in my black longing heart and now as it enchants me again stronger and clearer than ever before i run in ecstasy towards the utmost edge disregarding any border striving beyond i saddle the maelstrom of a burning charybdis without an ounce of fear nor stumbling or doubt for no chains of profane can ever prevent me even though my worlds foundation tremble nor even death as i once left the pity fellowship of man and my liberation shook their conception they scorned and feared the essence of my quest since it made them question their deceitful reasons yet their taunts and attempts to enslave me again were all in vain for lucifer himself shines within me the higher we soar the smaller we appear to those who cannot fly driven by an urge to experience the concealed and now i shalt conquer gods throne itself through aeons i have travelled floating through tunnels for nothing i seek but the gold of divine no chains of profane can ever prevent me even though my worlds foundation tremble so i followed the call and threw myself out from earthly cliffs into the unknown where those who dare to enter will burn yet ascending in triumph","Ascending in Triumph","2010"
"Nox Aurea","the beautiful odour of october winds gently caress me with its benevolent hands yet so dark and gloomy in its soul it permeates my intense heart with silent delight how i do love the passion of fading away the passion of dying for it is death herself who sweeps the landscape embracing a lost world in shades and vapour i will never forget the dread of november her grievance and stillness of lonely nights the desire of heart in minor adorned dancing so gently as dim northern lights how i do love this pleasant seclusion this old bitter sweet feeling the passion of solitude o my frozen queen of december nights let me transcend into a sleep without dreams let me wither in your cold white arms","The Delight of Autumn Passion","2010"

"Nox Aurea","as thousands of burning eyes stared at me with mocking despise from the silent distance of their cosmic thrones in a night sky so cold and vastly dark entirely i questioned this space time illusion and refused the shackles of matters intrusion so i closed my eyes and travelled deep into other specters so far from earth towards the void of spiritual tranquillity i float among stars and nebula dust crossing all restraining limits one by one on my voyage through galactic aeons i waken from an indistinct mirage to dissolve all the chains of creation the cosmic dreams of mind slowly do i now disperse into the abyss of ain eternally i proceed into the black hole of my dream to release myself from the circle of time by my purified spirits will to emerge with the infinity of nothing beyond to transcend into the absolute deus absconditus i lived in this world of darkness for myriads of years no one ever knew that i was there towards the void of spiritual tranquillity i float among stars and nebula dust crossing all restraining limits one by one on my voyage through galactic aeons","My Voyage Through Galactic Aeons","2010"
"Nox Aurea","my mind wanders beyond false boundaries to my most treasured sanctum a vast featureless landscape where the forces of my desires lingers here i can no longer comprehend the illusion of life no empty shadows wanders thus there are no walls the asperity of breathing seems to lighten as i imagine the beautiful vision of an eclipse the hymn of absolute eradication reaches my ears this swan song fills my heart with joy desolate and in myself seeking the golden depth rapturously immersing i long for the day i shalt escape this confinement the day when my constraining flesh is abolished my mind wanders beyond false boundaries to my most treasured sanctum the echoes have died their clear voices appeases my essence","The Shadowless Plains","2010"
