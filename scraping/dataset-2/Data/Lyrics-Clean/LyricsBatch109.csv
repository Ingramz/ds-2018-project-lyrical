"Dave","like i met my girl when i was 18 years old and she was just turning 23 i really love her from my heart and even though i dont deserve it fam i hope she loves me so i just done this private show im doing footlocker promo and judging from the postcode it was shoreditch or soho did 6 or 7 tracks made 6 or 7 racks a couple days later on twitter i saw this photo of myself and i was grinning that 4k camera of quality had got me tripping so im checking out who did it when i stumbled on this girl and i could tell that she was different a couple hours later now im liking all her pictures i aint finished i typed her twitter name into my insta so i could check on every single little digit why didnt i just message her trust me i was thinking but im a self centred rapper too concerned about my image the truth so when she hit me first im pretty shocked i didnt burst im calling josh jack and juss who am i ringing first man i was so excited that i replied a minute later thats that bro i think that you just let her know excited too excited no clue on what i should do excited so im just typing rambling like a fool excited look look and we were talking for hours over some minor things ignoring everyone else to her im replying quick this type of chick she got a spark like you were lighting spliffs you know you like her when youre thinking about your words she got me typing deleting my messages then re writing in the hope that theres a smile when shes replying the highlight of my day them phone calls in the night its the little things the girl she had a vibe and i liked it and shes into photography and shes got a passion for it and she respects that im rapping but she aint catting for it see thats the perfect balance theres nothing better than a girl with talent drive ambition all of them things above shes showing an abundance i aint even met her yet she works around the corner but lives just outside of london i aint fronting im a sweet boy intentions are in question so my compliments are decoys if that even makes sense the first time i met her im surrounded by my friends random ends on some staircase so much for a first date i just had a show and i asked if she could meet me after maybe we could chill you never know where things could go no problem she down to roll travelled in the cold so i went across the road grey hoodie under a coat if im remembering correctly its always kind of weird when the person that you were texting is the person you are obsessed with i was on her from the jump i think she was wearing pumps or vans when i first met her no its either either one she was looking so attractive i barely saw skin cause she was covered like a mattress man i think that shes the one i was stuck for twenty seconds tryna to give the girl a hug and all my friends are drunk so fuck it im about to kiss her any complications im blaming it on the liquor changing my name on twitter and blocking her on my insta i saw her skin blush the moment that our lips touched she pulled my bottom lip until it stretched kissed me on my cheek until she reached around my neck and had me moaning like a bitch even though im wearing jeans i had to re arrange my dick so she dont see that im erect its the first time we met got me feeling like a creep and that strawberry flavour gave her tongue a kinda sweet little taste and we could speak about anything we were friends first i dropped her to the station i remember cause we had a conversation for ages about our dreams and the things that we hadnt seen and all that we intended to do i bet shes hoping my intentions are true and as months went by we both got into it and intimate and ima spare you the details cause both of our parents are probably listening but really we were into it into us into this into everything about each other we were lovers and i love her cause she knows me and thats probably why she told me you aint ready for a girl youre still a little kid thats getting ready for the world and you dont need that kinda burden but i told her that i want it and im just being honest yes i know that girls exist but i dont see them as a problem i meant every single word and i aint gonna lie and say dms have been absurd but out of every single girl this is the weirdest of positions its usually the girl thats asking where i see her fitting or a place on her position but im telling her i need it and i dont think she sees it so im being even sweeter when were speaking and were meeting ive got affectionate messages you could read them you gotta tell a girl that shes beautiful til she sees it believes it understands it more than physically mentally and the way that im feeling i could talk 10 years about the moment that we shared the jokes that we had running the places that weve been the music we made together producing next to my bed then making my minor changes in reference to what she said i think i start to getting tired my schedules a mess replies are gettin lazy and my lady knows its crazy but shes there if im in need while im at shows getting tempted by girls that are on their knees you know im only a teen its like my eyes started drifting not as easy as i pictured to give your all to a woman ignoring all this attention thats been getting to my head the sex is so accessible one message or text and girls will get in your bed shes tryna make it happen with photos and her events i mentioned its her passion photography is her thing and i dont know if its the pressure where paper meets the passion and the pleasure we all gotta work to survive so now shes popping up at shows taking pictures on her own and at first it wasnt cool but fuck it we let it go until i saw her in some rappers tracksuit i felt a way she told me it was work and she was in some studio taking pictures and i just sighed some halfway wannabe rappers that fed her lies they aint looking for no picture i know its your profession but read their intentions they aint paying male photographers to shoot that same session and that felt so disrespectful standing on our dreams and crushing em i just told her its nothing do what you need to do if i aint feeding you then my opinions all im giving when i speak to you cause i dont have the right why should girls be punished for a males dirty mind when i think about it now im ashamed to the core i mean how many men stop their women from achieving what they can because in secret theyve been feeling insecure and i cant handle my emotions its probably why i didnt see her talent when i shoulda been supporting and promoting like i didnt have a platform a voice and a following with everyone i knew i really coulda do a lot of things to help chase her dream but instead of me to grow into the person that she needs i acted like i couldnt see and i dont mean to say this like i dont trust the girl but how can i trust her if i dont trust myself and even girls can get tempted you know how it goes what if she meets a bigger rapper when shes at a show what if he sees her backstage what if he selling lots what if hes got a bigger car got a better watch that doesnt bother me she really aint material its all the little things they do that put the fear in you what if he actually replies what if he phones her too what if hes doing all the things that im supposed to do what if hes listening laughing relating what if he even cares to ask her how her days been what if hes trying to give her everything she needs and expects from the one damn person that shes dating i shoulda helped her follow her dream but instead i held her back and had her following me and boys got a brave face so theyll never know that it hurts just as much when you let them go","How I Met My Ex","2017"

"Dave","look a question for the new prime minister howd you have a heart so sinister how are you so wasteful when people are dying in somalia afghanistan egypt libya the irony is we have no business in syria but kids are getting killed for all the business in syria and then they try and tell you its isis its isis in their attempts at killing it how many civilians died so whats the difference between us and them when you got drones killing kids just touching ten then when a bomb goes off every politicians lost like that last strike that didnt kill a hundred men you aint the same as them but all that fuel for the fire is what you gave to them and what you take from them all my life i know my mums been working in and out of nursing struggling hurting i just find it fucked that the government is struggling to care for a person that cares for a person so wheres the discussion on wages and budgets how they made them redundant when i was a youngun the letters in our car said my mum was overdraft but somehow i still had dinner money in my pocket and even the little things like ordering pizza were probably the reason for overtime in the evening five till ten six hours of sleeping for twenty two years my mum was doing the cleaning dreaming that her kids would have a better life go in bed at night struggling with getting by thats the reality for millions of people in a nation where a lot of us were looking for a second try a question for the new prime minister and please tell me if im being narrowminded but how do we spend so much money on defence and weapons to wage war when the nhs is dying bursting at the seams and what about them people that voted for us to leave for the money that it would see 350 million we give to the eu every week that our health service needs but now them politicians got what they wanted can you see an empty promise or a poster on the street nurses in tears cause theyre working every hour of the week and they still dont have the money that they need you brought the heart of the nation to its knees underpaid understaffed overworked and overseen by people who cant ever understand how it feels to live life like you and me patients lying in the corridors cause doctors cant even find a bed for them to sleep i remember a e and all them sickening screams of a little girl waiting for a surgeon to be seen privatized healthcare guns for police increased uni fees is this what theyre selling us well let me remind you just in case youve forgotten that we live in great britain not in donald trumps america speaking of america state and the president with all due respect ive got something to say to them i just find it funny you cant give a hand to palestine but you can trade whole arms with saudi arabia look look ive got a question for the new prime minister at grenfell tower your response was ridiculous you hid like a coward behind your five million dodged responsibility and acted like youre innocent and i can see youre terrified youre not good at telling lies im getting why you stay away from everything thats televised you look like a robot and you dont speak with any life it feels to me like any guy in press couldve said them lines imagine going to the council for the safety of your block and youve got kids but theyre ignoring you at every time everyone who knew about that cladding should really be going prison under rule of joint enterprise but if it aint a little kid with a knife i bet that judge is going easy when hes giving him time they dont deserve to be free any builder mp that knew about the conditions but did it to save cheese when i listen to the things that the residents had seen i was so shocked i couldnt even speak families they know that had died in their sleep how you choke on the smoke when youre struggling to breathe the glow from the fire the panic when you hear all the sirens the crackling the popping and the muffled out screams the fear in the eyes of a man that was trapped who jumped fifteen floors from the tower to the street i could only hear a fraction of the pain and the grief closing my eyes trying hard not to cry and the joy and relief in the face of a man when a woman from the flat said his neighbour was alive no help from the council in keeping any list of the people that survived his neighbours and peers and for that whole meeting i could see that he was trying so his smile was an island in a sea full of tears look ive got a message for our old prime minister david cameron i mean you fucked us resigned then sneaked out the firing line i wanna know how you managed it and are you bathing in the sun while them papers have a run at the woman that you left here to handle it you gonna teach your little lad to be the man thats got a plan and then the moment that it fails to abandon it are there bullies in his school and when you pick him up after class can you feel his embarrassment i mean you never gave a fuck about the youth and thats the truth theres no sympathy for you or your cabinet i really wish i couldve seen how you were scramblin when you lost the referendum that you had to win i feel like politicians are all addicts in a big fat game but its lives that you gamble with ive got a question for the leader of the labour party jeremy corbyn where do you wanna take the country to honestly i wanna put my trust in you but you can understand why if ive got trust issues do you really have the faith of your party do you really have faith in the party that will come with you and how do you plan on keeping all the promises man if im being honest sir im struggling to get with it i just aint getting it everybodys great until you get them into office and then guys start forgetting things prove to us youre different dont promise
