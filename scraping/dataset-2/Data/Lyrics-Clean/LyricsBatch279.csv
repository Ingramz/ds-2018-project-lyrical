"Freddie Hubbard","and now the purple dusk of twilight time steals across the meadows of my heart high up in the sky the little stars climb always reminding me that were apart you wander down the lane and far away leaving me a song that will not die love is now the stardust of yesterday the music of the years gone by sometimes i wonder how i spend the lonely nights dreaming of a song the melody haunts my reverie and i am once again with you when our love was new and each kiss an inspiration but that was long ago and now my consolation is in the stardust of a song besides the garden wall when stars are bright you are in my arms the nightingale tells his fairytale of paradise where roses grew though i dream in vain in my heart it will remain my stardust melody the memory of loves refrain","Stardust","2001"
"Freddie Hubbard","if you hear a song in blue like a flower crying for the dew that was my heart serenading you my prelude to a kiss if you hear a song that grows from my tender sentimental woes that was my heart trying to compose a prelude to a kiss though its just a simple melody with nothing fancy nothing much you could turn it to a symphony a shubert tune with a gershwin touch oh how my love song gently cries for the tenderness within your eyes my love is a prelude that never dies a prelude to a kiss though its just a simple melody with nothing fancy nothing much you could turn it to a symphony a shubert tune with a gershwin touch oh how my love song so gently cries for the tenderness within your eyes my love is a prelude that never dies a prelude to a kiss","Prelude to a Kiss","2002"
"Freddie Hubbard","the falling leaves drift by the window the autumn leaves of red and gold i see your lips the summer kisses the sun burned hands i used to hold since you went away the days grow long and soon ill hear old winters song but i miss you most of all my darling when autumn leaves start to fall cest une chanson qui nous ressemble toi tu maimais et je taimais nous vivions tous deux ensemble toi qui maimais moi qui taimais mais la vie separe ceux qui saiment tout doucement sans faire de bruit et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis","Autumn Leaves","2009"
"Freddie Hubbard","somewhere theres music how faint the tune somewhere theres heaven how high the moon there is no moon above when love is far away too till it comes true that you love me as i love you somewhere theres music how near how far somewhere theres heaven its where you are the darkest night would shine if you would come to me soon until you will how still my heart how high the moon somewhere theres music how faint the tune somewhere theres heaven how high the moon the darkest night would shine if you would come to me soon until you will how still my heart how high the moon","How High the Moon/Ornithology","2009"
