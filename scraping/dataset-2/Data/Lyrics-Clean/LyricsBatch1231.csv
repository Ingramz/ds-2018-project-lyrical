"Tupac Shakur","the nights grow cold my search for gold is leading nowhere whichever lonely road i take it seems to go nowhere its a fight to survive just until tomorrow how can i display what i know im worthy of when they turn me away the doors are closed to such as i a boy from nowhere but not to those who merely buy the right to go where theyll be met with respect not humiliation a mans place on earth i have come to realize is decided by birth so whats the future no matter where i go i will still belong in andalusia where we dont know where the next pennys coming from somethings wrong im bound to spain i wont remain a boy from nowhere there has to be a place for me and i must go there i dont fantasize unlike a million others who must bow and scrape for my one means of escape is to flourish a cape ill fight all odds and fight the gods if they oppose me i have to win i wont give in no one who knows me would expect me to fail for the want of trying not a man alive had to beg or steal or fight more than me to survive so whats the future no matter where i go i will still belong in andalusia where good honest men grow weak and the rich grow strong somethings wrong another dawn another boy a boy from nowhere my destiny will guarantee and i must go there its a fight to survive just until tomorrow one more mouth to feed and the way things are round here thats the last thing they need","A Boy From Nowhere","2002"
