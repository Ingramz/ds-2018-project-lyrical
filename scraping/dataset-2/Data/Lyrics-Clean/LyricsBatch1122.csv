pissed off by his tattoos cause they had the names of his other kids like fuck me i dont exist and you actin like im sposed to praise you my whole life you bought a pair of js and you think im sposed to say thank you thats when i knew i didnt need dad my mom was pissed i was sellin pills couldnt even afford rehab so she put me on dr got on stage and fuckin blacked out i look up im in a ranch now did four months in solitary bet that yall know it aint a act now fuck it hit a ho with no bars i remember seein clay kill a staff member jimmy with a crowbar they fled the scene in alicias car came home jumped on the scene i look online and im a fuckin meme said id shoot my mom i ont go fuckin mean you dont know what i seen what the fuck you mean i took all the pain in my heart carried that shit to the charts even when they protested i still got more blessings i never dissed my mom to get some attention take a second and listen fore you give yo dumbass opinion you bitch you aint seen nothin you dont know what ive been through you havent been there with me so dont tell me what i went through dont tell me that i disrespect my mom for the fuck of it dont tell me im just bad for the fuck of it bitch you dont know my life you dont know what i been through unless you were there with me you cant tell me nothing ho so after 6 months of being on dr show i finally got home finally i was gone for so long and i got home from a ranch and it was pretty miserable i had no touch fucking horrible like i was not in touch with the internet i did not know what was going on at all to the real world this place was far away from anything like no phones no internet no nothing like there wasnt even service there nothing and a couple a weeks after being home i finally decided that i wanted to meet with my best friend again i just missed her and i wanted to see her again someone who was not good for me at all but i ended up going to her house to see her and instantly like id say it was the next day cause she had slept over my house we just got back to doing our old shit again smoking like like trying to finesse people for money like just doing really really dumb shit again like really really dumb shit so since i was back out outside the house my mom decided to give me my phone because i was running around with zandaline take your phone back dani she wanted to make sure that if something happened i could be able to call her or whatever so just in case i logged in on instagram that i hadnt been on for almost seven months now and shouldve just stayed off of it every all these people were following me everyone was commenting on my pictures i had almost like five hundred thousand followers and i was like what the fuck is this so i went on the explore page and there was a bunch of memes that was just my face that said catch me outside and i was like what the fuck is this like i had never like i never even imagined that would happen this shits just so stupid like i didnt even remember saying catch me outside thats the funniest thing like until i seen the the bit from from the show like i didnt even remember i said that like like that shit was so irrelevant this shits so irrelevant like it was just some random ass shit so like a couple weeks later i had six hundred thousand followers and it was crazy i was like these people didnt even know if it was my real account like i had never verified that it was my real shit so it was kind of crazy they were just following it cause i guess people liked it and then my or and then now this guy adam had knocked on my door and i was like can i help you like what do you want he was like do you sing do you rap do you do anything and he was like well i wanna bring you to la so me i was like la okay cool just trust me ill make you a star so i went out there and i met meechie and i met um adams management partner dan i got you that checkmark are we cool and i stayed out there for a little bit i did some interviews and did some videos and stuff and then i went back to florida and me and zz were just like walking like the streets where its like going to the beach and stuff and people kept taking pictures of me and they kept like we we kept getting into fights and like even some of zzs friends got into fights about me and i was getting sued for it i was getting blamed for it so i then i hired my body guard frank because hey im frank hes a big ass muhfucker and hell beat up everybody and they mama just go fuck yourself so me and zz had went somewhere with one of her friends and we ended up getting tattoos that night and i didnt tell adam i was gonna do it cause i didnt think he would care like i didnt think he really like gave a fuck so i ended up getting a tattoo the tattoo i have on my arm it says family first and i went home and adam had called me and he or he facetimed me and he seen it and he was like oh my god youre going to fuckin youre youre goin youre goin back to la i cant have you out here doin this shit like youre gonna fuck yourself youre gonna get in trouble this is not happening anymore so before he had sent me back to la that day i met this girl gabby who i then started dating or talking to for a couple months i dont know why kinda dont really dont know why and i was living with her in her trailer and it was crazy like every time id go outside like there was all the neighborhood kids were surrounding like her house everyone wanted to see me and wanted pictures meanwhile while my dad was trying to get back in my life and i didnt understand why so i told him like no i dont want you to be in my life like fourteen years and you havent been here now all of a sudden you see i have fans and followers and all this and now you wanna get back in my life like no its not gonna work that way nope he didnt like that so he went to press he went to other cops everywhere you could imagine he went to news stations and other tv hosts and all this shit facebook instagram twitter dumbass talking all the shit he possibly could just trying to sabotage my whole career that wasnt a career yet he just wanted money he just wanted his voice to be heard he wanted to make sure that every time i went to court he went as well and tried to fuck shit up he lied to the judge told the judge i was suicidal told the judge i needed sexual ed classes like just a bunch of unnecessary bullshit so fast forward fuck my dad fuck his bitch pussy ass then my manager was like okay lets go to this recording studio like i have a few people i want you to meet so i went there i met this a and r aton whats good bhad bhabie and he was like well we have this song we want like we want you to record it we want to see how you sound we gotta try this out lets try this and it was just it was
