"Leo Reisman & His Orchestra","heaven im in heaven and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak and i seem to find the happiness i seek when were out together dancing cheek to cheek heaven im in heaven and the cares that hang around me thro the week seem to vanish like a gamblers lucky streak when were out together dancing cheek to cheek oh i love to climb a mountain and to reach the highest peak but it doesnt thrill me half as much as dancing cheek to cheek oh i love to go out fishing in a river or a creek but i dont enjoy it half as much as dancing cheek to cheek dance with me i want my arm about you the charm about you will carry me thro to heaven im in heaven and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak and i seem to find the happiness i seek when were out together dancing cheek to cheek","Cheek to Cheek [From the Purple Rose of Cairo]","2003"
