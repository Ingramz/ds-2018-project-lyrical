"Alana Davis","ive seen suckers loose themselves in the games they learn to play children love to sing but then their voices slowly fade away people always take a step away from what is true thats why i like you around i want you yeah you do you make me want you an open invitation to the dance happenstance set the vibe that we are in no apology because my urge is genuine and the mystery of your rhythm is so feminine here i am and i want to take a hit of your scent and it bit so deep into my soul i want you you do you do you make me want you send me all your vampires and i cant get enough and i cant get enough the village church yard is filled with bones weeping in the grave the silver lining of clouds shines on people jesus couldnt save you want to know how deeply my soul goes deeper than bones i want you and i cant get enough after we did it by the window sill smoke rings drift into the midnight sky presently in the quilt that your mother made and a candle burns to fight off the gloom i said to live in this way is not for the meek but you talk real soft and kiss me on the cheek and like a jazz dj you talk me into sleep there will be no regrets when the worms come and they will surely come you do you do i want you send me all your vampires i want you","I Want You","2001"
"Alana Davis","ive lived my life beside an ocean and every day i drown emotions with the tide and no ones ever asked me why guess im silly to waste my time i reach and stretch too far to measure and i break myself to keep together all the time its a struggle to be kind in a world that seems so blind before i grow too old to seize the day before i spread my wings and fly away id like to get to see my heart at play and see if love cant save the day what if its the only way can we save the day aside from my faith there is no glory and aside from the truth there is no story anymore were all soldiers in the war but tell me what are we fighting for feels like weve been here forever as i break myself to keep together and apart from a way that eats my heart i dont know how it got so hard before i grow too old to seize the day before i spread my wings and fly away id like to get to feel my heart at play see if love cant save the day what if its the only way can we save the day","Save the Day","2001"
