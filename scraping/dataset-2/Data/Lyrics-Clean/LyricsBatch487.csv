"John Reuben","this vulnerability is killing me internally not feeling much stability and i wish it could be easy but it dont seem to be and so im going to take it to the only place that i know to go and lay these feelings in the hand of the creator god of creation you show me how to relate to her mean while im thanking you for lessons being learned see my feelings have been shallow but ive watched my heart turn yes she looks good yes she looks fly but deep down i know theres something more inside just like im praying that theres more in me so when i look at she i just dont see naturally not saying physically that ill deny the attraction but all in all thats just a simple satisfaction that can be obtained through a glance of the eye this was five years ago man how time flies by beautiful soul full of spirit i wonder if shed hear it if i told her that she had a beautiful soul full of spirit a few year later her mind intrigues me it leaves me sort of sick wondering what makes the mystery chic tick history thick of pages and pages telling stories that cant be summed up in quick phrases shes observant so shes seen my behavior its got me nervous wanting to stay away from her i pray for her daily as well as perspective battling with pride and thoughts of being rejected and thats just not appealing its almost enough to make you disconnect your feelings or something and try to move on and give them to someone else but yet i care for her more than i care for myself man who needs this im not even good with commitments plus i value my independence in the end its probably just a waste of time spent or maybe theres something more to this relationship whats the point of caring when it hurts so much if this is what love comes with id rather not touch it in all honesty the outcome is uncertain and i do run the risk of walking away hurting searching for clarity spare me the despair id rather be alone and not even care than to share my trust because you cant control fate so maybe ill be alone but at least its safe i know thats stupid probably my insecurity or maybe god is using this to get through to me because in the back of my mind im always aware of pushing me towards prayer and bettering my character making me thing about the man i want to become regardless of the situations outcome fast forward a few years into my life man this song about my wife took me five years to write","5 Years to Write","2003"
