resplendent armies of the imperium assembled before the towering cyclopean walls of ancient gul kothoth it was some time before the billowing dust cloud raised by the massed arrival of the vast imperial host settled ultimately dissipating as the shadows of dusk descended with nightfall the imperial armys countless torches braziers and cookfires illumined the dark plain before the fortress like a coruscating sea painting the stygian heavens the colour of flame and the high summers night passed swiftly at length the dawn approached tentatively and with the first signs of the newborn sun etching its promise upon the skies the martial preparations commenced in earnest a brief and perfunctory exchange between the imperial herald and the fortifications watch commander held no surprises and the emperors banner was duly driven into the seared earth before gul kothoth with a chilling finality vast siege engines and powerful ballistae were hauled inexorably into position alongside a battery of katapelte and petrobolos the one hundred thousand strong imperial frontier army having planted their regimental blazons into the arid soil waited with a disciplined patience born of never having met defeat in pitched battle or siege the dreaded imperial war leopards straining noisily against their iron link leashes to the rear of the cohorts of conscripts and auxillieries the pitiless iron phalanx and their lord militant commander had assumed position at the head of the armys alpha wing polished swords spears and poll axes reflecting the glow from the myriad torches and braziers which still burned about the imperial host and behind them were drawn up the legendary legion of the ebon tiger pride of the emperor the infantry and cavalry famed throughout the great northern continent personal regiment of the feared general baalthus vane true to their martial reputation the six thousand strong legion were inscrutible in their jet black armour their sable banner billowing in the chill breeze which skittered over the plain and finally astride his azure shaffroned warhorse and surrounded by his elite guard the silvern armoured emperor koord himself studied the precipitious gates with a disdainful scrutiny at the emperors right hand was the renowned swordmaster of kyrmanku an eastern bladesman of preternatural skill and the most revered and expensive mercenary in the imperium at his left the infamous ogre mage of the black lake brooded silently swathed in a stygian cloak and fuliginous cowl and exuding an aura of implacable malevolence which unerved even the bravest of the imperial troops the emperor had deemed the services of these two nefarious renegades pivotal to the execution of the final campaign for they alone had knowledge of the mysterious arcane rite known as the words which unfetter and behind their titanic time worn palisades the defenders of gul kothoth beheld this awesome force ranged against them and shuddered not with fear but with an awful and night cold anticipation the emperor koord general vane we begin the final stage of this campaign with the rising of the sun this war which has raged for decades shall finally be decided here before the hoary walls of ageless gul kothoth the imperiums last and most glorious victory is at hand the procrastinating sybarites of the bureaucracy have been threatened and bribed into compliance over this venture this more than anything else is why i have deigned to grace this final battle with my imperial presence even against the advice of the grand vizier and the sage counsel of the seers baalthus vane you shall enjoy watching the ebon tiger bloody its claws sire our victory here is assured the emperor koord you should not call in your falcons before the hunt is done my loyal servitor overconfidence is but one of the many foes a general must face upon the field of war today the precepts and maxims of the imperium shall be tested and we shall see whether the velvet glove of diplomacy or the iron gauntlet of conquest has proved the more effective tool baalthus vane the days of the feudal suzerainties are long gone my liege the imperial military council is the only entity fit to govern the dominions the fall of vyrgothia shall today render the truth of the imperial mandate self evident the emperor koord and yet i am vexed for as you well know the sorcerous emmisary i despatched to the court of the over king has warned that the vyrgothians may have recovered one of the artefacts comprising the fabled trinity of might the legendary obsidian crown itself in the hands of a skilled thaumaturgist it is said that the crown may be used as a weapon of unparalleled destructive potency baalthus vane the shadow sword the obsidian crown the ebon sceptre feh the power of the trinity is but a myth no antiquated trinket weilded by a religious fanatic will prevail against the legion sire our steel is proof against such diabolism behold gul tryarch has fallen gul azlaan has been given to the earth gul nomedes is naught but smouldering rubble and soon we shall surge over the shattered remnants of gul kothoths renowned walls the vyrgothian alliance shall crumble when these gates are breached and the over king himself shall stand before thee in shackles the emperor koord indeed at any rate i have been blessed with foresight enough to prepare a contingency should the foe fulfil that fearful potential which has been weighing heavy on my mind but now the sun rises let it begin let the final chapter of our legend be written give the word raze gul kothoth to the ground the imperial war skalds an age of fire sword and shield the thunder of the battlefield the clarions call bring down the wall may the empires glory never fade righteous fury guide our blades we march to war the wizards of vyrgothia darkly bejewelled circlet of night crown of the elder king unfettered at last the trinity of might the sceptre the sword and the ring chapter 12 the fall of gul kothoth and so it was that a terrible and inestimable carnage was unleashed upon the field of battle colossal stones firebrands and howling iron tipped missiles rained pitilessly down upon the hero hewn walls of gul kothoth vast and serpentine cracks appeared in the ancient cyclopean edifice and hundreds of warriors both attackers and defenders perished in the fray either crushed beneath the ceaselessly assailed testudo hammered to crimson pulp by the merciless storm of unforgiving stone or burned to blackened husks by the nightmare onslaught of flaming quicklime and saltpetre scaling ladders raised and repulsed in turn storms of razor tipped shafts exchanged by the combatants isolated skirmishes raging upon the ramparts men blade to blade and clarions bellowing embattled defiance for seemingly inumerable hours the sanguineous battle raged with no quarter asked nor given between the bitter ancestral foes and the gates held firm at length the mightiest of the empires iron hooded battering rams dubbed the bringer of woe was brought to bear upon the besieged fortress and with the shadows of dusk lengthening upon the field of war the centuries old primary gate of gul kothoth was finally sundered amidst an earsplitting cacophony of shattering oak and iron louder than any storm born thunderclap with the rending of the mighty gate and vast fragments of the ancient walls yielding buckling and crashing to the blood sodden earth the imperiums forces breached the defenses of gul kothoth and surged into the vyrgothian alliances last and most renowned stronghold and it was at that fate steeped instant that an army of five score and ten bearing the obsidian crown arrived upon the field of battle chapter 13 the wizards do battle the sorcerer by klatrymadon and zuranthus they come they come weilding the circlet of night the dire warning issued to me as i stood before vyrgothias master wizard has been proved no idle boast the citadels spells of containment breached the black crown is upon us the emperor koord it is as i have forseen be spry my sorcerous lackey join the iron phalanx in entertaining these latecomers while i prepare a reception worthy of their audacity the sorcerer by your command o luminous imperial majesty at once the far feared and martially renowned iron phalanx wheeled to face the newcomers and at the command of a decurion a volley of armour piercing shafts screamed skywards to rain down mercilessly upon the foe and even as this transpired the emperors prime sorcerer emissary of the imperial court and master of those arts which speak to man in narcotic dreams from the darkest and most silent places summoned forth that black potency which lay entwined in stygian tendrils within his mind an ireful power born of they who writhed upon the shores of pangaea before mans progenitors ever erected their lofty spires to the restless skies and yet vyrgothias master wizard unrivalled arch mage and adept of that lost eastern order who journey beyond the boundaries of time and space upon those nebulous wings born of the sacred azure lotus rose to meet this power which lapped at the periphery of his mind like a midnight tide and stood firm against its insistent siren call and upon that arid field of war the sentinels of light and shadow spoke to eachother in tongues dormant since the third moon fell burning from the heavens and not sweet were the words they uttered until at last with the armies poised to clash and with dusk painting the sky a deep crimson exceeded in its vibrancy only by that bloody rubicund hue which stained the battlefield below it the emperors mage fell and the aeons old might of the obsidian crown was finally brought to bear against they who had breached the walls of ancient gul kothoth the imperial war skalds sundered the gate of the ancient fortress besieged now breached stand the walls and lo there and army of five score and ten behold the obsidian crown embattled the wizards their weapons arcane untramelled the circlet the prime sorcerer slain the crowns peerless power the emperors bane dark magicks and havoc now red carnage reigns like the prow of a blood hungry vessel of war rending the waves of a midnight sea a luminescent blade of shrieking cerulean light lanced from the legendary black circlet locked tight within the gnarled hand of the master wizard and clove mercilessly into the glorious ranks of the imperium and all who were touched by this ruinous arc of coruscating radiance knew no more men and beasts reduced to blackened husks charred shells of smouldering ash lifeless effigies which toppled to the seared earth to be dissipated by the whispering breath of the wind again and again the ravaging radiance smote the ranks of the empire leaving a noisome charnel pit of nightmare in its crackling wake the forces of the imperium were plunged into a howling vortex of disarray and faced with the unthinkable prospect of defeat the unprecedented first routing of the emperors glorious army began to become a grim reality yet for all the unparalleled carnage which had erupted about them there was one regiment of imperial troops for whom the taste of fear was bland compared to the sharp tang of rage which sat bitter upon their noble tongues baalthus vane by all the gods of war stand fast hounds of the imperium tis true steel is no use against this ignoble magical trickery but if our souls are bound for the pit this day well damn well take a few of these bastards with us onward my legion alpha formation banners high glory to the emperor into the foe show them the tigers claws the legion never quarter never mercy never retreat praise the emperor the emperor koord my sorcerous thrall has fallen but he has bought us

swordmaster of kyrmanku it is time now i charge thee for the glory of the imperium speak the words which unfetter and so it began the two pivotal players in the emperors plan the two key figures in the imperiums contingency stepped forth to fill their most vital of roles in that grand theatre of carnage which now ran unchecked on the field of battle the ogre mage and the swordmaster began to utter fearsome words in a tongue which was ancient ere the gleaming stars shifted upon the fathomless countenance of the distant heavens words which in truth were not words but rather a resonant key which would aspire to unlock a dire power which had reposed shackled since the fall of the legendary shadow king himself whose ebon circlets power they even now sought to thwart the incantation they gave voice to in the midst of that sanguineous turmoil which engulfed them was not so much heard by those within earshot as perceived sensed as a vague disturbance in the fabric of reality as fuliginous ripples on the surface of a hitherto still and placid pool growing ever larger and more far reaching an unnerving and unnamable sense of change which insinuated itself into the mind of the listener and suggested with a cold and disturbing quasi certainty that something of preternaturally ineffable magnitude was transpiring as surely as a festering and gangrenous corpse would split to spill its noisome gore and as that maddeningly implacable incantation reached its resounding climax a momentary silence enshrouded the battlefield swathing the vista of chaos in an aura of noiselessness more pure and untainted than the tranquility of the boundless and stygian void it was as if time itself had halted for one immemorial moment and it was in that oddly immeasurable instant that the dark and peerless power unfettered by those grim pseudo words finally ultimately made itself known before the sundered gates of ancient gul kothoth to be continued in episode x the shadow

"Bal-Sagoth","fragmentary delusional recollections from within the confines of grimms hold sanitarium when blackthorne returns from his expedition to tiahuanaco and the peruvian jungle i shall duly tell him of the catalyst which compelled me to those cursed black vaults in ancient ur should hildebrandt allow me another visit yes giza karnak thebes i see them now once more in the grip of a waking dream i walk those restless sands again egypt here my journey began and here i took the first steps towards destiny and damnation the events recounted here take place before the dreamer in the catacombs of ur from the expeditionary journal of doctor ignatius x stone giza egypt march 17 1890 the heat here is damnably oppressive and all day the omnipresent sand has been whipped up by an impudent wind making progress all the more difficult at dawn i pinpointed the location of the great pyramids secret chamber which my old friend professor caleb blackthorne and his benefactor lord blakiston had discovered several months previously but ingress to its concealed depths was denied me by a partial collapse of the age old edifices stone ceiling excavation is evidently impossible lest more of the mighty tomb come crashing down about us at any rate blackthorne has studied the incredible inscriptions within that hidden alcove exhaustively and in truth my own interests lie elsewhere in this desolate sand flayed landscape the traditionalists believe that in keeping with egyptian tenets only mundane things such as new air shafts and ever more ornate sarcophagi are yet to be discovered deep within the tunnel networks of these cyclopean monuments feh if only they knew the true extent of this great cosmic puzzle they are as fools who view a tapestry in a darkened room by the light of only one candle seeing only small sections illuminated one by one and refusing to recognize or connect the darkened and unseen areas to the entirety working from the geometric calculations which i prepared before our arrival here i have studied the alignment of cheops chefren and mykerinos it is as i suspected tomorrow i leave the the imperious and hoary mausoleum of khufu and seek answers within the great temple of karnak karnak egypt march 18 1890 what oblations to the grim chthonic deities of the ancient world were once offered solemnly beneath the stygian skies of this sweltering place i wonder what sublime power awaits the aspirant the querent who dares seek answers in those shadowed places where men of lesser fortitude fear to gaze blackthorne often berates me for what he calls my preoccupation with the arcane the occult the sinistrous lore of the chthonic he insists no good will come of such delving into nighted realms ha the path to elucidation is seldom devoid of thorns the road to knowledge rarely free of perils i seek enlightenment and by the erudite tongue of herodotus i may have found it ancient tradition of this land has long spoken of strange flashes of light emanating from the depths of pyramid passages and temple catacombs over a thousand years ago the arabs wrote of the transient walls and hidden chambers of these monuments of secret doors moved by an unseen force and of implacable sentries who guarded the secrets of the temples with dour tenacity what i found this evening gives credence to all that and more is the lore which i discovered carved into the ancient stone of karnaks temple the next fragment of the cryptic conundrum which i have dedicated my life to solving the coptic papyrus states that upon the walls of the pyramids and the temples were inscribed the mysteries of science astronomy geometry and physics inscriptions of unknown peoples and lost civilizations whose lore was carved into the stone to preserve it from the ravages of the great deluge the surviving knowledge of long forgotten antediluvian races aye prudent surid heeding the warnings of his priests erected certain repositories of long forgotten knowledge to withstand first a great flood and then an all consuming fire which was prophesied would come from the sky masoudi in the tenth century described automata titanic guardians of stone and metal which were placed to guard the treasures and the entombed lore and which were tasked to destroy all those deemed unworthy all those who dared enter the chambers unbidden i see them the hoary sentinels of karnak unfettered rising from their sandy tombs to smite the intruder the raider and the interloper with righteous fury and what is this was there once a glimmer of life within the sightless stone eyes of the theban guardian does the silent watcher at giza even now descend from its granite dias to once more stalk the shifting sands on carven claws hu horem akhet the alignment of cheops chefren and mykerinos revealed chthonic lore concealed in khufus imperious mausoleum by the erudite tongue of herodotus i have found the answers arcane secrets inscribed in the ancient coptic papyrus the pyramids legacy compells me to these dark discoveries the theban guardian rises from its sandy tomb to meet us the silent watcher stalks behold the sentinels of karnak thebes egypt march

karnak which i somehow understood implicitly the visions i experienced within the temple it is all quite clearly compelling me to the next stage in my grand voyage of enlightenment according to the inscriptions the truth the key awaits me within the ziggurats of ancient sumeria i hear the call of the ancients beckoning me to that aeon veiled place across the unforgiving sands we shall depart at
