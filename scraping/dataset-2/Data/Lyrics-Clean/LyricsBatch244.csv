"Evita London Cast Orchestra","it wont be easy youll think it strange when i try to explain how i feel that i still need your love after all that ive done you wont believe me all you will see is a girl you once knew although shes dressed up to the nines at sixes and sevens with you i had to let it happen i had to change couldnt stay all my life down at heel looking out of the window staying out of the sun so i chose freedom running around trying everything new but nothing impressed me at all i never expected it to dont cry for me argentina the truth is i never left you all through my wild days my mad existence i kept my promise dont keep your distance and as for fortune and as for fame i never invited them in though it seemed to the world they were all i desired they are illusions theyre not the solutions they promised to be the answer was here all the time i love you and hope you love me dont cry for me argentina dont cry for me argentina the truth is i never left you all through my wild days my mad existence i kept my promise dont keep your distance have i said too much theres nothing more i can think of to say to you but all you have to do is look at me to know that every word is true","Don't Cry For Me Argentina [From the Musical ""Evita""] [From the Musical","1983"
"Evocation","i only observed when hordes of hell spread their wrath and made thee flee i saw the flames beyond the horizon as dark shadows were falling from the sky make way for the unburied ones bow down salute your death make way for the unholy ones step aside here comes the dead i too heard distant explosions the major blasts spread ashes through the air i heard the cries from non believers they sacrificed and left piled dead i kneel down ill join the sky","The Dead","2007"
"Evocation","down the aggression path we ride blood our blood temperature rises beware of the bullets we send late is the time for solutions the soil under your feet is about to be red and nasty through the past we became an obscurity by today we are the beasts youve created pain one secret lust emotion bleed it never hurts to bleed seek the release fight the disease static overload death is the future we see left empty are our thrones so roll up your map show me where you are twisted little fuckers idol servants suckers the color of evil cast shadows on thee in the mouth of hell soon we all will be","From Menace to Mayhem","2007"
"Evocation","lowered in her fire reborn in her flames we asked for much desire consuming down our lanes strong currents are killing me seduced between our dreams i found her in my faith my angel of torment so strong the bizarre angel of torment my angel built upon bizarre fading loss of shame tempting twinkling stars poisoned bullets made wrong currents are holding me beneath the surface of sanity held in scarlet our fantasy the vast of all virginity i sold my soul for purity under the surface of sanity","Angel of Torment","2008"
