so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window like i reach my full potential i peeked continue to peep still bent low keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak all the way round to the back porch man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this you dont plan for intruders before hand surprised to see me cat got your tongue gag chloroform rag gag almost hack of a lung like you picked up an axe up and then swung stick to the core plan drag to the back of a trunk by one of your fans irony spectacular huh now whos a faggot you punk and heres your bronco hat you

bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered coming back on you every woman you insult there with the double standards you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers the rappers personas have a facade and matthew and stans just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until its gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them im the hindsight to say i told you so foreshadows of all the things that are to follow im the

wallop so one last time im back before it fades into black and its all over behold the final chapter in the saga trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the magic that started it

boy we aint gonna lie to you black boy black boy we dont like the sight of you pull up on the side of you window rolled down profile then we wonder why we see this side of you probably comin from the dope house we could let you slide but your tail light is blew out we know youre hidin that heidi klum on you another drug charge homie its back inside for you and just in case a chase might ensue we got that tried and true pistol drew right at you wed be delighted to unload it in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you fucked up but what the fuck am i to do i keep tellin myself keep doin like youre doin no matter how many lives you ruin its for the red white and blue time to go find a new one and split his head right in two no ones ever indicted you why cause youre a white boy white boy youre a rockstar my momma talkin to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i dont listen to her cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy youre untouchable the worlds coming to an end i dont even care nobody can tell me shit cause im a big rockstar black boy black boy we dont get your culture and we dont care what our governments done to fuck you over man dont tell us your attitudes a result of that balderdash whered you get the chip on your shoulder at why you kicking that soda can pull your pants up we bout to roll up and throw your ass in the van cuffed you dont have to know our plans or what our intentions are our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands and put our minds more at ease or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy were fightin a crime war here come the swine tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities thats what we call em pigsties for theyre like eyesores to police talked to like youre just a piece of trash feels like were stuck in a time warp to me as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions as this beat backspins its like were drifting back in to the sixties having black skin is risky cause this keeps happening throughout history african americans have been treated like shit and i admit there have been times where its been embarrassin to be a white boy white boy youre a rockstar my momma talkin to me tryna tell me how to live white boy white boy in your cop car but i dont listen to her cause my head is like a sieve white boy white boy youre untouchable the worlds coming to an end i dont even care nobody can tell me shit cause im a big rockstar seems like the average lifespan of a white man is more than twice than a black life span i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner i feel like checking out on life cant escape this circumstance id rather hear em say die n word than die antwoord ninja now its better disguised banter but thats life strapped cause were strapped financially and cant find answers were applying but mcdonalds seems to be the only franchise thatll hire so how can we have higher standards as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter we fight back with violence but acts like that are black eyes on the movement which makes black lives madder at cops and cops madder thats why its at a stalemate and cant arrive at a compromise so its black ops i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot call the attack dogs off of us man you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop sendin white cops in the black neighborhoods who aint acclimated to em like thats the way to do it who seen some fuckin videos of rappers waving guns and know nobody black so they act afraid of us and thats racism the fear that a black face gives em a subconscious racist wait why are there black neighborhoods cause america segregated us designated us to an area separated us section eightd us when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us and education sucks and every days another freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz why is it they treat us like dryer lint we just want a safe environment for our kids but cant escape the sirens dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in the lowest classes its like a razor wire fence and were trapped in these racial biases that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise every time we see a devils face lions tigers and bears oh my its more like billy clubs and gats and we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black but you kill each other facts you peel each others caps for silly stuff like hats single mother strugglin through substance abuse while people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes fuck your republican views pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots and streets act as a narrator dont gotta read comics or be that into characters just to see that just to be black you better be strapped with a derringer or be capped in america like steve rogers cause no one oversees these cops and all we see is em beat charges we done seen em beat rodney king unconscious and got off so we dont need all you crooked police officers peace offerings just keep marchin til we reach congress but theyre gonna say youre tryin to take an irrational stance if you try to slander the flag but somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb so they call it a kaepernick tantrum if you dont stand for the national anthem we raise it you better praise it or youll be made to feel like a traitor well treat you like rodney dangerfield home of the brave is still racist ville so this whole nation feels like a plantation field in a country that claims that its foundation was based on united states ideals that had its natives killed got you singin this star spangled spiel to a piece of cloth that represents the land of the free that made people slaves to build","Untouchable","2017"
