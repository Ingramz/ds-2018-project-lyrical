what i say were goin to the drive thru so we head out the front door open the garage door then i open the car doors and we get in those car doors put my key in the ignition and then i turn it sideways then we fasten our seat belts as we pull out the driveway then we drive to the drive thru heading off to the drive thru were approaching the drive thru getting close to the drive thru almost there at the drive thru now were here at the drive thru here in line at the drive thru did i mention the drive thru well here we are in the drive thru line me and her cars in front of us cars in back of us all just waiting to order theres some idiot in a volvo with his brights on behind me i lean out the window and scream hey whatcha tryin to do blind me my wife says maybe we should park we could just go eat inside i said im wearin bunny slippers so i aint leavin this ride now a woman on a speaker box is sayin can i take your order please i said yes indeed you certainly can wed like two hamburgers with onions and cheese then my wife says baby hold on ive changed my mind i think im gonna have a chicken sandwich instead this time i said you always get a cheeseburger she says thats not what im hungry for i put my head in my hands and screamed i dont know who you are anymore the voice on the speaker says i dont have all day i said then take our order and well be on our way i wanna get a chicken sandwich and i want a cheeseburger too shes like you want onions on that im like yeah i already said that i do plus we need curly fries and dont you dare forget it and two medium root beers no

cheeseburger three curly fries and a large root beer stop dont go no further i never ordered a large rootbeer i said medium not large then she says were havin a special i supersized you at no charge oh and thats all i could say was oh and she says now there is somethin else that i really think you should know you can have unlimited refills for just a quarter more i say great except were in the drive thru so what would i want that for then she says wait a minute your voice sounds so familiar hey is this paul and my wife is all like no that aint paul now tell me whos this paul she says oh hes just some guy who goes to school with me i sat behind him last year and i copied off him in geometry i said i know a guy named paul he used to be my plumber he was prematurely bald and he moved to pittsburgh last summer he also had bladder problems and a really bad infection on his toe and she said mister please you can stop right there thats way more than i needed to know and then we both were quiet and things got real intense then she says next window please thatll be five dollars and eighty two cents so we inched ahead in line movin painfully slow i got a little bored so i turned on the radio click turned it off because my wife was getting a headache so we both just sat there quietly for her sake then i looked at her and she looked back at me and i said umm i think you have somethin in your teeth she turned away from me and then turned back and said did i get it i said yeah well i mean most of it but hey ya know dont sweat it then she said how about now i said yeah almost theres still a little bit there but dont worry its probably just a piece of toast now were at the pay window or whatever you call it put my hand in my pocket i cant believe theres no wallet and the lady at the windows like well well well thatll be five eighty two i turn around to my wife and say how much have you got on you she just rolls her eyes and says ill pay for this i guess so she reaches into her purse and pulls out the american express i hand it to the lady and she says oh dear its gotta be cash only we dont take credit cards here i took back the card and said gee really well that sucks and thats when i found out my wife was only carryin three bucks i said i thought you were going to hit the atm today she says i never got around to it so wheres your wallet anyway and i said never mind just help me to find some change now the lady at the window is lookin at me kinda strange and she says mister please we gotta move this line along i said now hold your stinkin horses lady we wont be long so we looked around inside the glove box and check the mat beneath my feet i found a nickel in the ashtray and a couple pennies and a dime in the space between he seats before long i had a little pile of coins of every sort the lady counts it up and says youre still about a dollar short and now my womans got this weird look frozen on her face she screams you know i wasnt even really hungry in the first place and so i turned around to the cashier again i shrugged and said okay forget the chicken sandwich then so i pick up my change pick up my receipt and i drive to the pickup window man i just cant wait to eat and now we see this acne ridden kid about sixteen wearin a dorky name tag that says hello my name is eugene and he hands me a paper bag i look him in the eyes and i say to him hey eugene could i get some ketchup for my fries well he looks at me and i look at him and he looks at me and i look at him and he looks at me and i look at him and he says im sorry what did you want again i say ketchup and he says oh yeah thats right i just spaced out there for a second im really kind of burnt tonight and then he hands me the ketchup and now were finally drivin away and the food is drivin me mad with its intoxicating bouquet im starvin to death by the time we pull up at the traffic light i say baby gimme that burger i just gotta have a bite so she reaches in the bag and pulls out the burger and she hands me the burger and i pick up the burger and then i unwrap the paper i bite into those buns and i just cant believe it they forgot the onions","Trapped in the
