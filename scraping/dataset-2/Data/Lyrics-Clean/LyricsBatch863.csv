herabschickt denn auch ohne nachtsicht fernglas oder firlefarnz hab ich paar versteckte krieger im grunen gewirr erkannt folgen wir mal diesen schriftzeichen jeden umweg wurde ich meiden auf uns zeigen dutzende von giftpfeilen in blasrohren aus bambus aber scheiss drauf leben ist wie das olympische 3000 meter rennen ein kreislauf gut getarnt wie echsen bahnen wir pfade durch die farngewachse

knochenbergen und angenagten totenschadeln umklammert von bodennebel dann der klang von bogensehnen pfeilgeschosse gehen nieder abgefeuert von halbgekleideten gewaltbereiten eingeborenen kriegern ey yo in ausserster not fang ich nen pfeil aus der luft dreh ihn um werf zuruck und der hauptling ist tot sie ziehen sich zuruck in verstecke pfade und gange es bleiben barbarische klange schamanengesange und auf einmal setzen sich die knochen zusammen erheben sich leere augenhohlen glotzen uns an ein skelett kommt an ich nehm sein kopf in die hand hol aus und schlag mit ihm ein motherfucking loch in die wand yeah und wir schlagen uns durch die armee der knochengerippe ich verteil lockere tritte oder box sie in stucke dann noch ein paar schritte und wir sind raus aus der holle und drinnen in einem weiteren verstaubten gewolbe wo auf nem goldaltar das ziel unserer reise steht sich von nem tiefroten energiestrom umkreist erhebt ein tomahawk mit pulsierend gluhender
