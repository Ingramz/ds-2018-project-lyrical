live it to feel it you didnt you wouldnt get it or see what the big deal is why it was and it still is to be walking this borderline of detroits city limits its different and its a certain significance a certificate of authenticity youd never even see but its everything to me its my credibility youd never seen heard smelled or met a real mc whos incredible or on the same pedestal as me but yet still unsigned having a rough time sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes go to work and serve mcs in the lunch line when it comes crunch time where did my punch lines go who must i show to bust my flow where must i go who must i know or am i just another crab in the bucket cause i aint having to run with this little rabbits but fuck it maybe i need a new outlet im starting to doubt shit im feeling a little skeptical who i hang out with i live like a bum yo my clothes aint about shit at the salvation army trying to salvage an outfit and its cold trying to travel this road plus i feel like im always stuck in this battling mode my defenses are so up the one thing i dont want is pity from no one this city is no fun there is no sun and its so dark sometimes i just feel like im being pulled apart from each one of my limbs by each one of my friends its enough to just make me want to jump out of my skin sometimes i feel like a robot sometimes i just know not what im doing i just blow my head is a stove top i just explode the kettle gets so hot sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that i dont got but ive learned its time for me to u turn yo it only takes one time for me to get burned aint no fallin on next time ill meet a new girl i can not only play stupid or be immature i got every ingredient all i need is the courage like i already got the beat all i need is the words got the urge suddenly its a surge suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred time to show these free world leaders the three and a third i am no longer scared now im free as a bird then i turn and cross over the median curb hit the burbs and all you see is a blur im eight mile road im a man gotta make a new plan time for me to just stand up and travel new land time for
