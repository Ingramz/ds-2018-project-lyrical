"Jackson Browne","some of them were dreamers and some of them were fools who were making plans and thinking of the future with the energy of the innocent they were gathering the tools they would need to make their journey back to nature while the sand slipped through the opening and their hands reached for the golden ring with their hearts they turned to each others hearts for refuge in the troubled years that came before the deluge some of them knew pleasure and some of them knew pain and for some of them it was only the moment that mattered and on the brave and crazy wings of youth they went flying around in the rain and their feathers once so fine grew torn and tattered and in the end they traded their tired wings for the resignation that living brings and exchanged loves bright and fragile glow for the glitter and the rouge and in a moment they were swept before the deluge let the music keep our spirits high let the buildings keep our children dry let creation reveal its secrets by and by by and by when the light thats lost within us reaches the sky some of them were angry at the way the earth was abused by the men who learned how to forge her beauty into power and they struggled to protect her from them only to be confused by the magnitude of her fury in the final hour and when the sand was gone and the time arrived in the naked dawn only a few survived and in attempts to understand a thing so simple and so huge believed that they were meant to live after the deluge let the music keep our spirits high let the buildings keep our children dry let creation reveal its secrets by and by by and by when the light thats lost within us reaches the sky","Before the Deluge","1974"
"Jackson Browne","in my early years i hid my tears and passed my days alone adrift on an ocean of loneliness my dreams like nets were thrown to catch the love that id heard of in books and films and songs now theres a world of illusion and fantasy in the place where the real world belongs still i look for the beauty in songs to fill my head and lead me on though my dreams have come up torn and empty as many times as love has come and gone to those gentle ones my memory runs to the laughter we shared at the meals i filled their kitchens and living rooms with my schemes and my broken wheels it was never clear how far or near the gates to my citadel lay they were cutting from stone some dreams of their own but they listened to mine anyway im not sure what im trying to say it could be ive lost my way though i keep a watch over the distance heavens no closer than it was yesterday and the angels are older they know not to wait up for the sun they look over my shoulder at the maps and the drawings of the journey ive begun now the distance leads me farther on though the reasons i once had are gone i keep thinking ill find what im looking for in the sand beneath the dawn but the angels are older they can see that the suns setting fast they look over my shoulder at the vision of paradise contained in the light of the past and they lay down behind me to sleep beside the road till the morning has come where they know they will find me with my maps and my faith in the distance moving farther on","Farther On","1974"

"Jackson Browne","looking through some photographs i found inside a drawer i was taken by a photograph of you there were one or two i know that you would have liked a little more but they didnt show your spirit quite as true you were turning round to see who was behind you and i took your childish laughter by surprise and at the moment that my camera happened to find you there was just a trace of sorrow in your eyes now the things that i remember seem so distant and so small though it hasnt really been that long a time what i was seeing wasnt what was happening at all although for a while our path did seem to climb when you see through loves illusions there lies the danger and your perfect lover just looks like a perfect fool so you go running off in search of a perfect stranger while the loneliness seems to spring from your life like a fountain from a pool fountain of sorrow fountain of light youve known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight youve had to hide sometimes but now youre all right and its good to see your smiling face tonight now for you and me it may not be that hard to reach our dreams but that magic feeling never seems to last and while the futures there for anyone to change still you know it seems it would be easier sometimes to change the past im just one or two years and a couple of changes behind you in my lessons at loves pain and heartache school where if you feel too free and you need something to remind you theres this loneliness springing up from your life like a fountain from a pool fountain of sorrow fountain of light youve known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight youve had to hide sometimes but now youre all right and its good to see your smiling face tonight fountain of sorrow fountain of light youve known that hollow sound of your own steps in flight youve had to struggle youve had to fight to keep understanding and compassion in sight you could be laughing at me youve got the right but you go on smiling so clear and so bright","Fountain of Sorrow","1974"
