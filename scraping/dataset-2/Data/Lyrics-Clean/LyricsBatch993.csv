reason hear i stand just rocked another show just cant remember where i am and my families far from here but the stars are bright this evening on this morning on this afternoon just got here now im leaving and i shall remember the marble just as clear as i do yesterday never dance with the devil cause i cant afford the hell to pay when i blast through your speakers every time your pressing play when i fish the phonograph so we could set the record straight dear god i pray just let me show this world a better way how you helped through to your heart and all the times you fade away i get to say these words and speak my piece to catholic crowds not certain if its day or night but i know the time is now and if we ever lose the purpose as a prelude to the sound lets just call it a day and

with class so step fast we pushed and finally pushed that was burnin staying determined and yearnin cause the lessons we learnin were life long life long its my song i place to erase and transpose all these average joes with weak flows who knows not the true livin roles who ascended blended with the beat compete and apprehended todays feelin all right color all right being blocked by the shotgun and pray every day and night now ive gone a full day without some wackness heard the ones speakin absurd are finally heeding my word ya right and now im left with nothing else to say that be the night that i called it a day called it a day im gonna throw thoughts to a page let em fall where they please let em rise to the sky rain down on four seas an ocean of possibilities that dwellin yellin at the top of my lungs convicted by stone tablets as a felon a nocturnal being of love since the grown of time watch the sunrise with both my daughters eyes permanent shine refine my reflection inside livin to die dyin to live and all glory given back to god it was the night that 24 turned into 12 had to adjust my spiral off from the top of the shelf on the blank page using the utensil of potential im diggin in my brain so i could rip the instrumental with 20 bars left and im consistent from the intro lighting candle sticks as the rain hits my window need to focus in take the topic and let it flow got 8 down for the count and 16 to go the writers blocks are stepping stones towards the metronome im racing dead last im head last placed on my prose nocturnal with my journal a wordplay professor the aggressor resembling soda cans under pressure im shakin but not stirred deterrent from my train of think now im aligned readjusted to infuse the ink i want to handcuff the hands of time no great spirit here allotted for heres the sunshine bet im casting nets and dreads the deep blue ways are wet gods silhouette i want to palettes painted pink by suns and sets burnt from a long days work but feelin fine tip his cap and path the moon on his back his day declines candlelight switch as you slip into the evening a courtesy to the sun as it dips below the ceiling feeling sort of satellite like the wind beneath my wings or the tightrope or gravity keeps lunar kites on orbit strings man on the moonlight dream before my time like the moon reflects the sun i make the black begin to shine like the moon rewinds the waters makes the ocean recline i collapse your mind im syntax but melancholy kind redefine the best framed fresh in terms of holiness bless the mike device cause i get nice to keep the conscious and i split tense mints spit words like sentence fragments moon dust the must cause i aint in it for the cabbage the incandescent presence spins as im your present flame but my name would flicker out my name syntax the wax and wane for the name above names im so glad that christ came the black bird bright the night we called it a day shadows step on the one on under every tongue run spoken sentence frags spoken on shattered breaks its a black hole soul with my faith as i take break minutes back with father time to coordinate seconds i surround the 11th hour with sound as my weapon villain threatened to sweat the syndrome of the wicked heading for your auditory where the listener would stick it fiction were steel when it breaks from the construction crushing your framework and far surpassing your presumption sunrays like a score with notes my surfacing great mad at meteors or record the all heed and when the sun sets some one lets the mike down we pipe down unplug it and leave it hide down but not before we retire the pen cause yo tomorrow well be back just to do it again uh shackled and scarred i still maintain my praise of dark days a sullen world covered in pain so from dusk till dawn i represent his word deepspace 5 set to serve we travel in this land of the lost and we understand we battle with the possible chance you take the cross on your
