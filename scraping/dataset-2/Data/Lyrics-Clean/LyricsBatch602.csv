"Linda Eder","everybody needs to be with somebody even after all the cold hard facts are known like your heart will probably break what with all that give and take still you just cant seem to leave the thing alone so you hold your breath and you count to ten and youre scared to death but you close your eyes and fall in love again cause in the middle of the night hell hold you tight and then everything thats wrong will be alright now you swear youll keep romance in perspective but with love its always famine or its feast and a hungry heart forgets tends to minimize regrets so as sure as theres a sunrise in the east theres a silver moon that your heart cant waste and then pretty soon theres a strangers kiss that you cant wait to taste cause when the apple is in sight you take a bite hopin everything thats wrong will be alright maybe this time jealousy and fear will get the best of you maybe this time you will give a little more maybe this time you will look and find somebody who isnt quite as crazy as those times before so you try again till you get it right and you never know when to let it go or when to hold on tight but when theres nothin else that works well love just might so when romance comes along we all struggle to belong so that everything thats wrong will be alright the lyrics in the cd liner notes differ from what is sung","Everything That's Wrong","2002"
