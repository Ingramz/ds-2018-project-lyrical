"Miss Pamela","i was walking down the street the other day a sight came before my eyes it was a little hippie boy i must have been twice his size his appearance typefied his strange breed gaudy clothes long stringy hair hanging down id seen perhaps a thousand in my early trips to town as he walked on beside me on down the block i noticed no unpleasing smell he might have been on the weed or even lsd but if he was i couldnt tell so we walked together that way through this neighborhood finally he turned around to me and he he said friend you know were a million miles apart but you know something we can enjoy the sunshine and the weather so why dont we put our differences aside and just talk to each other you see this box beneath my arm to you its plain it has no charm but to someone dearest to my heart this box has played a tragic part this little one cant tell you himself about his life and how he died but if anyone else could speak for him i guess im qualified this boy was in chicago he didnt know why he was there he was with his family and friends and he didnt really care you might have been one of those who saw the struggle there on your television screen the tragic thing is so much else happened that no one else could have seen a stranger handed this boy a dollar to do a simple chore to carry a package to a nearby hotel and when he returned hed get two more but when he came back he sort of lost his way walking through the crowd one of them things you ask yourself how the lord allowed but when he was found he was like he is now dreaming sweet and still and in his little hand was a crumpled dollar bill now you can take that dollar get four cents on it compound it quarterly at any downtown bank so they can back some hot new tank or atom bomb well what im going to tell you now you can stay or you can leave you kind of listened to my story so far but just one more thing its the same for any hippie bum or hillbilly out on the street just remember this little boy and never carry more than you can eat now could you help us sing this song please there will be peace in the valley for him now we pray i will think of the little hippie boy that way","Hippie Boy","1969"
