plupart de mon enfance je lai passe aupres de ma mere je peux pas ne pas mentionner quelle surmonta beaucoup de galeres et elle continue a ramer trimer jusqua cette heure sur une main je peux compter le nombre de fois que je les vu en pleurs on nous fit venir en france au prix de nombreux sacrifices pensant que la france etait terre de reussite octobre 85 dans ce pays jatterrissais le temps etait gris et jignorais ce qui mattendait souvent les parents ont pour leurs gosses de lambition ainsi ma soeur et moi on sest retrouve en pension loin de ma mere tu le sais enfance amere loin dses enfants pour une mere vie amere eloignes delle le temps quelle construise ses reperes jusqua ce quelle nous recupere puis on a quitte la pension pour venir vivre a orly et ce que jai vu ce jour la a surement change ma vie dans un pavillon ma mere louait une seule piece quun rideau separait 30 metres carre au plus dans ce truc la on etait 5 vivant dans la promiscuite ouvrir un frigidaire vide me demande pas si je sais ce que cest mais maman nous a jamais laisse crever de faim maman a toujours subvenu a nos besoins pour notre bonheur elle a sacrifie le sien etonnant ce que lon peut faire par amour pour des gosses avant je ne portais pas de nike air mais plutot des jokers mon style vestimentaire provoquait des sourires moqueurs ce qui developpa en moi tres vite la rage de vaincre la rage dexister lenvie de reussir influence par les orcas litle jay et manu key avec teddy et harry ideal j on a forme a lage de 14 ans est sorti notre premier disque alors jai espere pouvoir vivre de la musique mais mon rap etait trop sincere trop dur trop franc consequence succes destime mais trop choquant pour leur france nos vies souvent se ressemblent le destins parfois nous separent les erreurs ont des consequences qui font senvoler nos espoirs nos vies souvent se ressemblent le destins parfois nous separent les erreurs ont des consequences qui font senvoler nos espoirs puis lecole contre la rue peu a peu jai echange sont arrives les premiers joints du lycee jai pris conge jetais de ces gosses qui auraient pu reussir mais legerement trop feroce pour que le systeme puisse me contenir issu des blocs de beton la rue mattendait au tournant elle mavait toujours guette mais jusque la je lavais feintee et avant que je puisse me rendre compte elle ma emporte avec elle est venu lepoque que jappelle entre rap et business entre rap et business mes potes et moi grosse equipe veux tu que je te raconte la suite skunk popo et shit transactions illicites sur le terrain on prend des risques on pretend devenir millionnaires sans jamais rien donner au fisc sans meme sen rendre compte on senfonce dans la violence le plus souvent sous defonce tout ce qui bouge on te le defonce une embrouille on bouge a 10 a cote ca vend des disques jusqua croire reellement que tu peux pas test mafia dafrique les ennemis se multiplient jusqua ce quon puisse plus les compter vu que la vie nest pas un film on sort enfourailler on le sait et on sent on le sait et on sent que ca part en boulette ca parle de se ranger mais quapres avoir pris des pepetes cest ce que jappelle la rue et ses illusions derriere lesquelles se cachent la mort ou la prison la prison mes potes y rentrent y sortent reviennent et moi jechappe a leur justice de justesse cest dans la rue que jai appris a connaitre l a s et su que derriere tout dur se cache un peu de faiblesse aujourdhui tes avec un pote et vous vous charriez mais tattend pas a ce que la mort tenvoie un courrier l a s nous a quitte subitement que allah le preserve du chatiment dans ce bas monde les actes et pas de comptes mais dans lau dela les comptes et pas dactes je me suis reellement senti en danger jai su que je risquais de me noyer si jamais je plongeais les vagues de la violence tot ou tard mauraient submerge victime de mon insolence de la rue je suis un naufrage et jai nage alourdi dun fardeau de mes regrets charge et meme a ce jour ne croit pas que jai emerge je tassure je garde les traces de mon passe tu sais ces choses quon ne pourra pas effacer puis jai appris lislam cette religion honorable de transmission orale aupres de gens beaux et fiables elle ma rendu ma fierte ma montre ce quetait un homme et comment affronter les demons qui nous talonnent jai embrasse le chemin droit et delaisse les slaloms ceux qui mont eduque je remercie jpasse le salam a tout les musulmans de france de loccident a lorient ceux qui ce bas monde voudrait quitter en souriant mais yeux se sont ouverts mon coeur sest epanoui me fut devoile peu a

plus dans tout les sens ne soit pas etonne si au rap conscient je donne naissance a la precipitation je prefere aujourdhui la patience aux paroles inutiles la sauvegarde du silence a lintolerance et au racisme lindulgence et a lignorance jaimerai retorquer par la science ce bas monde terre de semence que plus tard tu recoltes le jour ou lame te quitte subitement qula mort temporte sois intelligent et seme y ce qui tes utile ceci est lenseignement de lislam et il hisse lame loin de tout extremisme la voie de droiture lunique voie a suivre et si le systeme te sature lislam ramene lamour rassemble les gens de tous les pays de toutes les origines toute les cultures toutes les ethnies ya pas que des riches et des pauvres y a des gens mauvais ou biens jai reappris a vivre compris les causes de notre declin et quand je regarde mon passe jai failli y passer si je navais eu lislam peut etre que je me serais fait repasse ou la moitie de ma vie en prison jaurais passe pour ceux qui y sont passes ici jai une pensee mais combien sont partis sans avoir eu le temps de se preparer charges de peches et dinjustices a reparer avant que la mort ne me vienne faut que je repare les miennes si je veux recolter du bien cest du bien quil faut que je seme un jour je partirai et serai enveloppe dun linceul au mieux de mes vetements dans un modeste cercueil et lorsque je serai mort et que cette chanson tu te rememores surement quelques larmes viendront humecter ta memoire maintenant tu sais dou je viens qui je suis et ou je vais et pourquoi mes textes de sagesse sont impregnes dune

tous adeptes du chacun pour soi personne ne nous respecte et je crois savoir pourquoi on est avares et divises on se fait avoir on ne forme meme pas une communaute preoccupes par le besoin serait on tous myopes incapables de voir loin on veut pas le bien on veut le gain quitte a detruire linteret commun on vit dans linconscience des enjeux et malgre nous les medias nous ont mis dans le jeu manipules comme des pions tout le monde mise sur notre division on subit la xenophobie incapables de sorganiser en lobby on sera toujours des mendiants aux portes de leur monde tant quon croira que le respect se quemande le respect simpose et la lutte est economique observe la communaute asiatique nous on fait beaucoup de bruit et peu de chiffres on donne peu de coups et on recoit beaucoup de gifles impunement les medias nous salissent car conscients que nous insulter ne comporte aucun risque on ne fait peur a personne on est la risee de tous et nos emeutes se deroulent loin de lelysee a part bruler quelques voitures de pauvres gens comme nous et saboter nos propres structures ou est notre revolution ou est notre evolution on est en france depuis plusieurs generations et ou en est on meme si ca me fout un coup au moral force de constater quon est en bas de lechelle sociale dans le collimateur des medias ya pas plus vises que nous alors toi explique moi pourquoi ya pas plus divises on se plaint du racisme mais ne lest on pas nous memes cest eux contre nous mais surtout nous contre nous memes les algeriens contre les marocains les marocains contre les tunisiens les antillais contre les maghrebins les maghrebins contre les africains les turcs entre eux meme dans les mosquees nos coeurs se sont divises chacun veut diriger chacun veut dominer et refuse denvisager que le

nous salissent realise que tu sers didiot utile tant que tu nas aucune vision si tu naimes pas te faire battre pourquoi tendre le baton tu veux faire tomber le systeme vomis la pilule et commence par refuser quil te manipule pour quune rebellion aboutisse elle doit etre pensee et je sais quon ne mene pas une revolution le froc baisse et ceux qui entrent en politique nous trahissent se complaisent
