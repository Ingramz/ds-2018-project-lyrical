fate so the sex and the money and the murder are the pictures we paint if an artist is a part of a community and got an opportunity to get that cake would never come back to the hood no immunity

understand you aint nothing but a waste look into the face of a young girl raising up like a flag when its unfurled got game listening to her mothers pearls and she love beyonce cause she run the world her mama used to run this city way back before the nigga puff was diddy when it came to the music then she got real picky from new york but preferred 2pac over biggie no disrespect to ms wallace but she liked to do the knowledge and she felt that pac was more lyrical plus she never went to college but she called herself earth found rhythm with the gods more spiritual she god in the physical and its only natural to pray for a little you musical so she played the umbilical chords so her daughter was born it was a miracle music is the light when its dark and the way that you spit your dart is a big part she grew up loving hip hop now all her daughter got is love hip hop nowadays niggas turn up for the sex niggas turn up for the money never turn up for the movement ratchet reality stars

along when she heard it in a song she used to be front row at the shows til she overdosed on the testosterone her favorite rapper invited her backstage would have stayed but she felt like she really aint belong when she wouldnt let him hit this nigga called her a bitch she erased all her songs from the phone you are who you fuck with so the guy that she stuck with you can bump it or dump it the artist she trusted just broke her heart so misogynistic and disgusting she tried not to judge him in her heart she still loved him and the way that he lusting a part of his suffering and this young
