to swallow a pocket full of stones put the remix on menace shit we had it going on got love in the streets and played on the air but the homey putting us out wasnt playing too fair had to separate ourself bring in a new team but sometimes the other side aint always what it seems we dropped super tight a album full of killer flows but then we got caught up with the drugs and the hoes we didnt realize what was happening on the real and new management was cutting back room deals hiding different money and concealing the price he had us doing all the work but was keeping the biggest slice took a while to catch on to what homey was doing but by the time we did all the paperwork was in ruins nigga kept all the receipts so we couldnt file taxes the next thing you know irs hitting us with axes pimp you owe seven figures bun you owe six better get your paper together get this shit fixed remixed the management team and tried it ourself cussed out the gm almost got put on the shelf fuck it dropped ridin dirty instant classic in the south reclaimed the southern title shut everybodys mouth got some clout in the game boys calling us the greatest but meanwhile me and pimp is still ducking haters the old manager calling and say he fina sue and put a padlock on the everything we trying to do put a call out to the prince this nigga still hating we got heat for the streets and we

you turn on mtv and bet we getting our burn on grammy nominated cant believe that we made it and we got a call from jive that left us all faded and it stated that due to the success of the track we here at jive records would like to piggy back get another beat from timb then get a verse from jay let hype shoot the video and well be on the way shit it sounded okay but me i had to ask if we dont do big pimpin 2 would you still put us on blast a song like that might take a nigga to the top but my true fan base might think a nigga flop they got mad and put niggaz on hold for damn near a year till the buzz got cold so we said fuck em and went back to the basics trying to find ways to get the fuck up out the matrix we put dirty money together and it was aces but thats around the time that pimp caught two cases he got probation said fuck you hoes we finish the album got ready to do a couple shows and then he violated one month before we dropped and shit just got put on hold or fucking stopped now 30 days done we back to the nitty gritty album got released big showdown in chocolate city niggaz with masks on vests and all black its christmas 2000 and 1 bitch we was all that strongest on the block nobody could budge and then he violated now we right back before the judge they calling him a nuisance put my dog behind a fence it was january 28th he aint been home since threw a nigga

ever bred see l butler better known as chad or pimp see the closest homeboy that i ever had now when we first met we wasnt on the same page from pettiness understandings that got cleared up with age two young boys who was ready to mash put p a on the map and maybe make a little cash jumped down with big tyme put down a few songs everybody co signed saying that we could do no wrong then hit the streets with a big ass bang them gangsta ass rhymes with that country ass twang dropped tell me something good took off and went live shit next thing you know we was signing to jive dropped too hard to swallow a pocket full of stones put the remix on menace shit we had it going on got love in the streets and played on the air but the homey putting us out wasnt playing too fair had to separate ourself bring in a new team but sometimes the other side aint always what it seems we dropped super tight a album full of killer flows but then we got caught up with the drugs and the hoes we didnt realize what was happening on the real and new management was cutting back room deals hiding different money and concealing the price he had us doing all the work but was keeping the biggest slice took a while to catch on to what homey was doing but by the time we did all the paperwork was in ruins nigga kept all the receipts so we couldnt file taxes the next thing you know irs hitting us with axes pimp you owe seven figures bun you owe six better get your paper together get this shit fixed remixed the management team and tried it ourself cussed out the gm almost got put on the shelf fuck it dropped ridin dirty instant classic in the south reclaimed the southern title shut everybodys mouth got some clout in the game boys calling us the greatest but meanwhile me and pimp is still ducking haters the old manager calling and say he fina sue and put a padlock on the everything we trying to do put a call out to the prince this nigga still hating we got heat for the streets and we

you turn on mtv and bet we getting our burn on grammy nominated cant believe that we made it and we got a call from jive that left us all faded and it stated that due to the success of the track we here at jive records would like to piggy back get another beat from timb then get a verse from jay let hype shoot the video and well be on the way shit it sounded okay but me i had to ask if we dont do big pimpin 2 would you still put us on blast a song like that might take a nigga to the top but my true fan base might think a nigga flop they got mad and put niggaz on hold for damn near a year till the buzz got cold so we said fuck em and went back to the basics trying to find ways to get the fuck up out the matrix we put dirty money together and it was aces but thats around the time that pimp caught two cases he got probation said fuck you hoes we finish the album got ready to do a couple shows and then he violated one month before we dropped and shit just got put on hold or fucking stopped now 30 days done we back to the nitty gritty album got released big showdown in chocolate city niggaz with masks on vests and all black its christmas 2000 and 1 bitch we was all that strongest on the block nobody could budge and then he violated now we right back before the judge they calling him a nuisance put my dog behind a fence it was january 28th he aint been home since threw a nigga through a loop and caught me in the crosses standing cold ceo now im the fucking boss had the devil on my back got to drinking and drugging had to make a choice get back to rapping or thugging so i
