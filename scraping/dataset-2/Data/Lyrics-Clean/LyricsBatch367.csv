"Horace Parlan","a country dance was being held in a garden i felt a bump and heard an oh beg your pardon suddenly i saw polka dots and moonbeams all around a pug nosed dream the music started and was i the perplexed one i held my breath and said may i have the next one in my frightened arms polka dots and moonbeams sparkled on a pug nosed dream there were questions in the eyes of other dancers as we floated over the floor there were questions but my heart knew all the answers and perhaps a few things more now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter i know the meaning of the words ever after and ill always see polka dots and moonbeams when i kiss the pug nosed dream","Polka Dots and Moonbeams","1974"
"Horace Parlan","the night is like a lovely tune beware my foolish heart how white the ever constant moon take care my foolish heart theres a line between love and fascination thats hard to see how many names such as this for they both have the very same sensation when youre locked in the magic of a kiss her lips are much too close to mine beware my foolish heart but should our eager lips combine then let the fire start for this time it isnt fascination or a dream that will fade and fall apart its love this time its love my foolish heart","My Foolish Heart","1975"

"Horace Parlan","and now the purple dusk of twilight time steals across the meadows of my heart high up in the sky the little stars climb always reminding me that were apart you wander down the lane and far away leaving me a song that will not die love is now the stardust of yesterday the music of the years gone by sometimes i wonder how i spend the lonely nights dreaming of a song the melody haunts my reverie and i am once again with you when our love was new and each kiss an inspiration but that was long ago and now my consolation is in the stardust of a song besides the garden wall when stars are bright you are in my arms the nightingale tells his fairytale of paradise where roses grew though i dream in vain in my heart it will remain my stardust melody the memory of loves refrain","Stardust","1979"
