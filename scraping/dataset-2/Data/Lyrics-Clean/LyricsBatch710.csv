cant let the streets beat you uh well a picture can express a thousand words to describe all the beauty of life you give and if the world was yours to do over i know youd paint a better place to live where the colors would swirl and the boys and girls can grow in peace and harmony and where murals stand on walls so grand as far as the eyes are able to see ha i never knew art till i saw your face and therell never be one to take your place cause each and every time you touch a spraypaint can michaelangelos soul controls your hands then serenades of blue and red and the beauty of the rainbow fills your head crescendo colors playin tunes man why oh why youd have to die so soon ashes to ashes and dust to dust where the good die young is all thy must cause as life must live death must die and the tears shall fall from the living eye huh teardrops fall for the state of mind of the beautiful lady that you left behind in love and alone but now youre dead and she still cant get you out of her head huh more tears fall for all youve done tried to be a good father to your only son but now whos gonna make sure that hes fed put a shirt on his back and a roof over head tell me whos gonna dream the impossible dream of the beautiful cities and the islands when your works of art brought into being all that the ghetto stopped you from seeing bums on the sidewalk garbage in the street abandoned buildings bricks of concrete the ladies on the corner are sellin that body and everybody wants a part in that party im hangin out tough rockin late at night runnin wild in the town of the neon lights you either play some ball or stand in the hall huh you gotta make somethin out of nothin at all im sittin in the classroom learnin the rules and it says you cant do graffiti in school that cant be wrong in the hallowed hall so my notebook turned into a big wall the heart of a lion and the courage of three and the mind of a man much wiser than me youre the soul of the brother who wont come back who died in my arms on the railroad track cause im caught in a rat race lookin for my own space it gotta be a better place for you and me theres pie in the sky and a eye for a eye some people gotta die just to be free you search for justice and what do you find you find just us on the unemployment line you find just us sweatin from dawn to dusk theres no justice its huh just us still life urban masterpiece your trademark was written on trains and walls a million dollar gift only god released huh and yet you got killed for nothin at all so after this therell be no more hard time no more bad times and no more pain no more chump change none of that bull just movies museums and the hall of fame so all you hip hops get on up and lets take it to the top where we belong cause the age of the beat street wave is here everybody lets sing along now come on and say hooo hooo say hooo hooo and to let me know im rockin the microphone everybody say ramon ramon ramon ramon rrrrhaa a newspaper burns in the sand and the headlines say man destroys man extra extra read all the bad news on the war for peace that everybody would lose the rise and fall the last great empire the sound of the whole world caught on fire the ruthless struggle the desperate gamble the game that left the whole world in shambles the cheats the lies the alibies and the foolish attempts to conquer the sky lost in space and what is it worth huh the president just forgot about earth spendin multi billions and maybe even trillions the cost of weapons ran in the zillions theres gold in the street and theres diamond under feet and the children in africa dont even eat flies on their faces theyre livin like mice and their houses even make the ghetto look nice huh the water tastes funny its forever too sunny and they work all month and dont make no money a fight for power a nuclear shower a people shout out in the darkest hour sights unseen and voices unheard and finally the bomb gets the last word christians killed muslims and germans killed jews and everybodys bodies are used and abused huh minds are poisoned and souls are polluted superiority complex is deep rooted leeches and lices and people got prices egomaniacs control the self righteous nothin is sacred and nothin is pure so the revelation of death is our cure peoples in terror the leaders made a error and now they cant even look in the mirror cause we gotta suffer while things get rougher and thats the reason why we got to get tougher so learn from the past and work for the future and dont be a slave to no computer cause the children of man inherit the land and the future of the world is in your hands so just throw your hands in the air and wave em like you just dont care and if you believe that youre the future
