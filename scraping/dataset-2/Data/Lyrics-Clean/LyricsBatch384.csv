"Insane Clown Posse","to all that are receiving this broadcast we are now entering the thirteenth hour of continuing cloud coverage this ongoing event has now been upgraded to a national emergency it has been a sleepless night past metro detroit as panic and terror has swept the streets it seems much of detroit as well as the rest of the country are still unsettled by this unexplainable cloud that still clutches the sky from new york to honolulu miami to fairbanks the expansion of the cloud has subsided but a wall of darkness and artificial night still grips the land witnesses now tell us thousands upon thousands of people are emerging from sewers everywhere their faces are painted and and and they look like clowns the people are running and screaming but eye witnesses say theyre not in pain its almost like a strange type of joy has overtaken them at this time we do not know where or why the people are running but there seems to be an organized plan directing there action its like a guiding force is giving them supernatural stamina the immense crowd of clowns are now on the move all in unison moving in one direction towards an unknown destination almost as if they see what others cannot heeding an inaudible call that silently pierces this calm before the storm","Intro [1998 Hollowicked Concert Intro]","2005"
