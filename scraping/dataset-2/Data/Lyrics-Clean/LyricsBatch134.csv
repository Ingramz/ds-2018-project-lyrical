"Depeche Mode","on another world by another star at another place and time in another state of consciousness in another state of mind everything was almost perfect everything fell into place that you may reach a different verdict if all the judges missed the case in a parallel universe thats happening right now things between us must be worse but its hard to see just how and everything could have been perfect everything in the right place then i wouldnt have to play the suspect accused abandoned and disgraced i didnt choose i didnt pull the trigger it wasnt me im just a plain and simple singer i heard the sound i turned my head around to watch our love shot down in another lonely universe were laying side by side well no ones hurt and no ones cursed and no one needs to hide and everything is almost perfect everything is almost right there are never any conflicts there are never any fights","Perfect","2009"
