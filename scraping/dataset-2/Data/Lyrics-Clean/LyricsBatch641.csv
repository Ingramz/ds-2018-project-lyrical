dollars they want talking topics they want trending topics they want outfits to be outlandish they want sideways glances beef and problems they want nipple slips cause they live for clips this is economics so we botox our skin and we smile for the camera might as well get a new nose while were at it this is america and insecuritys our fabric and we wear it and we renamed it fashion i look to my right theres a cameraman snapping picture after picture after sister after sister of the line of kardashians mind so distracted realized theres an ovation and everyones clapping last night the skys

inside looking out is it my place to give my two cents or should i stand on the side and shut my mouth no justice no peace okay im saying that theyre chanting out black lives matter but i dont say it back is it okay for me to say i dont know so i watch and stand in front of a line of police that look the same as me only separated by a badge a baton a can of mace a mask a shield a gun with gloves and hands that gives an alibi in case somebody dies behind a bullet that flies out of the nine takes another childs life on sight blood in the streets no justice no peace no racist beliefs no rest til

keep people out its all stolen anyway cant you see that now theres no way for you to even that out you can join the march protest scream and shout get on twitter hashtag and seem like youre down but they see through it all people believe you now you said publicly rest in peace mike brown you speak about equality but do you really mean it are you marching for freedom or when its convenient want people to like you want to be accepted thats probably why you are out here protesting dont think for a second you dont have incentive is this about you well then whats your intention whats the intention whats the intention pssst i totally get it youre by yourself and the last thing you want to do is take a picture but seriously my little girl loves you shes always singing im gonna pop some tags im not kidding my oldest you even got him to go thrifting and one love  oh my god that song brilliant their aunt is gay when that song came out my son told his whole class he was actually proud

cool yeah yeah like all the guns and the drugs the bitches and the hoes and the gangs and the thugs even the protest outside so sad and so dumb if a cop pulls you over its your fault if you run huh damn a lot of opinions a lot of confusion a lot of resentment some of us scared some of us defensive and most of us arent even paying attention it seems like were more concerned with being called racist than we actually are with racism ive heard that silences are action and god knows that ive been passive what if i actually read a article actually had a dialogue actually looked at myself actually got involved if im aware of my privilege and do nothing at all i dont know hip hop has always been political yes its the reason why this music connects so what the fuck has happened to my voice if i stay silent when black people are dying then im trying to be politically correct i can book a whole tour sell out the tickets rap entrepreneur built his own business if im only in this for my own self interest not the culture that gave me a voice to begin with then this isnt authentic it is just a gimmick the d i y underdog so independent but the one thing the american dream fails to mention is i was many steps ahead to begin with my skin matches the hero likeness the image america feels safe with my music in their systems and its suited me perfect the role ive fulfilled it and if im the hero you know who gets cast as the villain white supremacy isnt just a white dude in idaho white supremacy protects the privilege i hold white supremacy is the soil the foundation the cement
