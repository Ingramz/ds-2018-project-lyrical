saw in the past you never chose sides we were so sad but when it came to happiness youre all we really had youre an angel so happy go lucky such a good soul words cant express you had a gift of making people fall in love with you you affected every single person you met and we aint have much we spoiled you to death anything you wanted you can have i still laugh think about the holiday when you snuck and ate a whole cheesecake we aint even get mad thats your favorite we was so stressed out we were about to lose the house that we stayed in i was trying to be a rapper we couldve moved in my parents basement but couldnt bring you really youre the one that made me quit trying to rap so i went and got a job so that we could get a house id do anything for you you me and your mom moved with your grandma it was us three stuck in a little room finally had a place to play outside i would love to see you run like a dream coming true i was riding in my car to some tracks one day played this beat started thinking of you and now im looking in my rear view wishing i was near you its quiet here without ya and ive been thinking about ya feeling of nostalgia i hated my job i loved coming home i would lay in bed with you for hours on end me and your mom were obsessed with you cause you were mommas baby boy and daddys best friend but daddy aint been home a lot lately to play with i tried to set you down and explain that i got a new job that i wanted all my life and that everything might possibly change that ima have to go out of town for some months but when im home ima be around every day and when im gone ima need you to look out for your mom keep her company while daddys away your momma sends pics of you and her in bed i would feel bad thinking that you thought i left but i was saving bread so we could finally have our own place live a life that we shouldve always had and i did that now youre spoiled even more cause instead of being cramped now you got your own room your mom quit her job and you and her could chill every day for the most part id be home too and life is looking bright used to see it so blue we finally were content had a daily routine i made a bunch of songs with your name in them i would come into your room hugging you and i would sing you were always treated like a king cause you were everything that mattered to us and i would hate to see your cute face crying cause you knew that i was leaving for a tour always hated when i go and grab that red suitcase out the closet youd look at me and say you promise you stayed by your mom when im gone ill be back in a couple of months give me kisses ill be missing you a ton homesick every time im looking in my rear view wishing i was near you its quiet here without ya and ive been thinking about ya feeling of nostalgia you grew up so fast but you always had a baby face so its hard for me to tell you were sick on and off we were just rough housing on the bed good to see you getting well i had to go to omaha for a show but your mom called me up and told me that you slipped and fell but you were limping we figured that you twisted something and had to give it time to tell i got home and you were breathing funny and your hip was big as hell your momma said that she began to see it swell this morning this isnt normal we took him to the doctor we thought he might of broke his hip bone and it would heal its crazy how life change in an instant the doctor walked in with his x rays said he thought he broke his hip but he didnt he got bad news and there aint no way to fix it what is it he said the x rays showed bone cancer was spreading through his legs in a crazy position the amputation the chemo wasnt a option he probably aint gon make it to christmas i blacked out cause christmas is like three weeks away when i left he was okay now your telling me hes gonna die he said hes strong so hes gonna fight eventually youre gonna have to put him down whenever yall decide please god not a dog were in shock not our son hes the only thing we got we was done itd be different if we knew that he was suffering for months but hes limping how the fuck is it that nothing can be done tried to comfort him as much as we could drug his mattress down the stairs to the center of the living room me and his mom laid with him every night petting him while he was crying you could tell the pain was getting to him and me and her in disbelief all we did was cry all we did was scream struggling to try wed take him outside but he could barely walk and every day it seems its spreading even more the medicine we fed him isnt doing anything and we just cant accept it that our boy the most important thing is dying right in front of us like how much do we let him suffer til we go and make the choice we were laying on the floor almost twenty days he aint eating anymore he cant move his legs its december 21st i think its time for us to let him go so we can send him to a better place its been several weeks me and your mom still grieving feeling like we in denial i go in your bedroom every day smell the air start to cry for a while then i smile thinking bout ya looking in my rear view
