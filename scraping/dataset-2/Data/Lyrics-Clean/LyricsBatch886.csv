"Ray Davies","it was back to the drawing board and i think it was out of frustration we wanted to sound as distorted as chuck berrys guitar on memphis tennessee we played the record so many times on that old radiogram and so loud that some of the speakers were crackling in the radiogram completely distorted and the valves were rattling in the machine so in fact you know god save the queen sounded like chuck berry everything sounded really distorted and dave and i thought how can we make the green amp sound that distorted so dave took one of mums knitting needles and he stuck it into the speakers of the little green amp the dave played a chord pfft it sounded great yes brilliant thats the sound dave rechristened the green amp the fart box now as i said the front room was a place where we had celebrations usually singsongs when we very young when i was 13 years old our oldest sister came back from canada where she had emigrated after the war and she died in tragic circumstances so at the age of 30 she was burried and we had a new experience in the front room a wake but dave and i were surprised that these adults still drinking and singing songs we thought that was odd as they were all dressed in black that it was a sad time its hard to describe the front room it had a really magical quality to it really spiritual in a way i went to a church school but the closest i felt to religion was not when i was singing in the school choir or when i was at sunday school which i always went to but it was more when i rehearsed with dave in the front room","The Front Room","1998"
"Ray Davies","and as i walked round those tidy streets i thought to myself how can anybody be at all unhappy in such a perfect world how wrong i was theres a little hunchback man he used to walk round the streets of north london his head was bowed forced to look at the ground by this cruel debilitating hump on his back and all of my school friends had a name for this hunchback they called him the freak and every time the freak walked down the street my friends would laugh and i laughed with them now my dad was a sports fan but in order to achieve all the ambitions my father had for me i trained really hard and eventually i became the captain of the school team until one cold winters afternoon i sustained an injury actually it was kick up the arse but hey i was sent to a specialist and he took x rays of my back examined me and he said well youre gonna have to give up all sport for all time otherwise youre going to end up a hunchback like that man i see you laughing at maybe that was meant to scare me i dont know but all of a sudden i started to look at that freak in a new light because in him i saw my future i would become a freak but we all know that ugliness like beauty is only skin deep","Hunchback","1998"
"Ray Davies","the phone rang it was a call from larry hello cock cock its time for the third single if this is a flop if the third single doesnt make it our career would be over id written another song that we played on stage quite a lot it was called you really got me and the audiences loved it no the audiences loved it they liked it because they could dance to it but the record company hated it they said you cant record that piece of rubish and we dont like the sound of that terrible distorted green amplifier no no you cant record it thats final but robert and grenville thought it was marvelous dont you think so grenville oh every time they play you really got me i get shivers up my spine i think its a hit cock i gotta tell ya ill state my reputation on it now with management like that how could we fail but the record company said look we dont believe in it were very sorry we dont believe in it if you want to make the record fine but you have to pay for the recording yourselves and that was really cruel because they knew we were broke but robert knew a man here ray heres 200 quid go in the bloody studio and make that record and make sure its a bloody hit what you see mick avory hadnt signed the recording contract and they said he couldnt play on the record wed have to get a session drummer in hes a guy thatd come in and play for hire and they said this thinking that wed be loyal to mick and cancel the session but we werent gonna do that but at the last minute we snug mick into the studio he can only play tambourine but at least he was on the record id written you really got me as tribute to all those great blues people i love leadbelly and big bill broonzy and dave was playing the song in the studio that day but he was playing it in the style id written it but then dave plugged the guitar into the green amp and he plugged the green amp into a vox ac30 and it sounded hugh and when dave played the opening chords to you really got me they were so loud that the session drummer forgot the complicated little patern he was gonna play at the beginning and just hit one beat on the snare drum as loud as he could pow as if to say to dave you noisy little bleeder i can play just as loud as you can and ive got a big stick but thats exactly what we wanted you see we wanted to sound loud now we sounded like a group halfway through the song it was time for daves guitar solo this moment had to be right so i shouted across the studio to dave give him encouragement but i seemed to spoil his concentration he looked at me with a dazed expression fuck off if you doubt me if you doubt what im saying i challenge you to listen to the original kinks recording of you really got me halfway through the song after the second chorus before the guitar solo theres a drum break boo ka boo boo ka boo ka boo boo and in the background you can hear fuckoff you can you can when i did the vocal i tried to cover it up by going oh no but in the background you still hear it fuckoff and its even clearer on cd its really embarrassing well then dave looked like youd done something wrong his mouth relaxed and his jaw dropped but it was halfway through the most important track wed ever do and if it wasnt a hit it would be the last track wed ever do and the lead guitarist stops playing before the solo but then daves eyes squinted and his face broke into that arrogant sideways grin ive learnt to love and hate over the years you see he hadnt heard me shout at all he just thought of looking at me at the same time as i looked at him a kind of telepathic way of saying this is it remember the front room then he gritted his teeth and sneered at me one more time and cocked an attitude before turning away into the corner of the studio to play himself into rock n roll history","The Third Single","1998"
