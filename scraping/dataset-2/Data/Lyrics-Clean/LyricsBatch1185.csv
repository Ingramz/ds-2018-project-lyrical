"The Velvet Underground","waldo jeffers had reached his limit it was now mid august which meant he had been separated from marsha for more than two months two months and all he had to show was three dog eared letters and two very expensive long distance phone calls true when school had ended and shed returned to wisconsin and he to locust pennsylvania she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity she would date occasionally but merely as amusement she would remain faithful but lately waldo had begun to worry he had trouble sleeping at night and when he did he had horrible dreams he lay awake at night tossing and turning underneath his pleated quilt protector tears welling in his eyes as he pictured marsha her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothing of some neanderthal finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion it was more than the human mind could bear visions of marshas faithlessness haunted him daytime fantasies of sexual abandon permeated his thoughts and the thing was they wouldnt understand how she really was he waldo alone understood this he had intuitively grasped every nook and cranny of her psyche he had made her smile she needed him and he wasnt there awww the idea came to him on the thursday before the mummers parade was scheduled to appear hed just finished mowing and etching the edelsons lawn for a dollar fifty and had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from marsha there was nothing but a circular from the amalgamated aluminum company of america inquiring into his awing needs at least they cared enough to write it was a new york company you could go anywhere in the mails then it struck him he didnt have enough money to go to wisconsin in the accepted fashion true but why not mail himself it was absurdly simple he would ship himself parcel post special delivery the next day waldo went to the supermarket to purchase the necessary equipment he bought masking tape a staple gun and a medium sized cardboard box just right for a person of his build he judged that with a minimum of jostling he could ride quite comfortably a few airholes some water perhaps some midnight snacks and it would probably be as good as going tourist by friday afternoon waldo was set he was thoroughly packed and the post office had agreed to pick him up at three oclock hed marked the package fragile and as he sat curled up inside resting on the foam rubber cushioning hed thoughtfully included he tried to picture the look of awe and happiness on marshas face as she opened her door saw the package tipped the deliverer and then opened it to see her waldo finally there in person she would kiss him and then maybe they could see a movie if hed only thought of this before suddenly rough hands gripped his package and he felt himself borne up he landed with a thud in a truck and was off marsha bronson had just finished setting her hair it had been a very rough weekend she had to remember not to drink like that bill had been nice about it though after it was over hed said he still respected her and after all it was certainly the way of nature and even though no he didnt love her he did feel an affection for her and after all they were grown adults oh what bill could teach waldo but that seemed many years ago sheila klein her very very best friend walked in through the porch screen door and into the kitchen oh gawd its absolutely maudlin outside ach i know what you mean i feel all icky marsha tightened the belt on her cotton robe with the silk outer edge sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on the kitchen table licked her finger and made a face im supposed to be taking these salt pills but she wrinkled her nose they make me feel like throwing up marsha started to pat herself under the chin an exercise shed seen on television god dont even talk about that she got up from the table and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue vitamins want one supposed to be better than steak and then attempted to touch her knees i dont think ill ever touch a daiquiri again she gave up and sat down this time nearer the small table that supported the telephone maybe billll call she said to sheilas glance sheila nibbled on a cuticle after last night i thought maybe youd be through with him i know what you mean my god he was like an octopus hands all over the place she gestured raising her arms upwards in defense the thing is after a while you get tired of fighting with him you know and after all i didnt really do anything friday and saturday so i kind of owed it to him you know what i mean she started to scratch sheila was giggling with her hand over her mouth ill tell you i felt the same way and even after a while here she bent forward in a whisper i wanted to now she was laughing very loudly it was at this point that mr jameson of the clarence darrow post office rang the doorbell of the large stucco colored frame house when marsha bronson opened the door he helped her carry the package in he had his yellow and his green slips of paper signed and left with a fifteen cent tip that marsha had gotten out of her mothers small beige pocketbook in the den what do you think it is sheila asked marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back she stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in the middle of the living room i dunno inside the package waldo quivered with excitement as he listened to the muffled voices sheila ran her fingernail over the masking tape that ran down the center of the carton why dont you look at the return address and see who its from waldo felt his heart beating he could feel the vibrating footsteps it would be soon marsha walked around the carton and read the ink scratched label ah god its from waldo

up she had a large sheet metal cutter in her hand this is the best i could find she was very out of breath here you do it i im gonna die she sank into a large fluffy couch and exhaled noisily sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape and the end of the cardboard flap but the blade was too big and there wasnt enough room god damn this thing she said feeling very exasperated then smiling i got an idea what said marsha just watch said sheila touching her finger to her head inside the package waldo was so transfixed with excitement that he could barely breathe his skin felt prickly from the heat and he could feel his heart beating in his throat it would be soon sheila stood quite upright and walked around to the other side of the package then she sank down to her knees grasped the cutter by both handles took a deep breath and plunged the long blade through the middle of the package through the masking tape through the cardboard through the cushioning and thud right through the
