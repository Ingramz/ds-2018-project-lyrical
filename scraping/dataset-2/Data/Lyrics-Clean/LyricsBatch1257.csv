"W.A.S.P.","i was born jonathon aaron steel to the parents of william and elizabeth steel i am a leo born under the sign of the lion and i was raised in a lower middle class family with only one brother michael whom i love dearly he was five years my senior my fathers nickname was red which i could never understand why because his hair was sandy blond nevertheless the name stuck so when my brother was born my father became big red and my brother little red i should have known from the first time when i realised their special connection that i just didnt fit in to my fathers plans and as i grew older the constant comparison between my brother and myself left little doubt who was the image of perfection in my fathers eye to him my brother could do no wrong and i became the invisible boy the proverbial black sheep and i soon figured out that red and black dont mix the beatings i received became more and more frequent to the point where i would ask my father am i the orphaned son you would never need but oddly enough i worshipped the ground my father walked upon my brother and i were a strange mixture as different as daylight and dark looking back its hard to imagine we came from the same parents i sometimes wondered if we had the same father but i always dismissed that idea as my mother was far too religious my father as well to ever even think of such a thing but my brother who had always sensed my parents instilled insecurities tried his best to encourage me for i was born different and he knew it he often told me when i was born an angel flew over my bed and christened me with a magic wand and said you shall be the one and i had no idea what the one was but as i grew older i began to understand most boys put their mother on a pedestal and worship them like the virgin mary but with her too my relationship was different and not for the good she was opinionated uneducated sometimes prejudiced overbearing believed everything she read true or not and when it came to religion was over zealous to say the least a mind boggling combination but she was pretty very pretty and i would often wonder bordering on complete confusion how a person of this description could rationalise life this was a series of characteristics that many times in my life i would look back on in bewilderment and the women i sought after when i was older would be nothing like her in the pain of youth the misery of my neglect would manifest itself in many ways depression my enemy fear my friend hatred my lover and anger fuel for my fire these four characteristics of my personality would become the guiding force of my life and would control everything i did or was to become i shall explain later in the story about them which i call my four doors of doom the mirror the great plaything for mans vanity the mirror was to become at times my altar of refuge and other my alter ego and its magnificent obsession with a relentless pursuit of attention it served as a chilling reflection of my own wretchedness and my greatness it was the one place i could go to see inside myself to find love in an otherwise loveless household where i could be great where i could be anything or anyone i wanted to be one hundred percent pure escapism until i discovered its precious secret the mirror lives it breathes it talks it lies it has a personality all its own it is a genie that grants all the wishes you could ever dream at least in my case all except two it was my 14th birthday the day that changed my life forever my brother michael the one person who was my guiding light my friend my hero was killed by a drunk driver in a head on collision he died instantly i couldnt even bring myself to go to his funeral my agony was so great i just couldnt come face to face with him that one last time my failure to attend intensified my parents resentment for me even more but from that moment on nothing seemed to matter especially that living hell called home for one year after his death i roamed the streets in a fog barely conscious of anything or anyone i discovered alcohol and girls drugs and in general a life i had never known which was exciting frightening and wonderfully dangerous and it was then as i staggered through a down town city street in one of my drunken rages i stumbled across a small music shop and in the window stood the instrument the fiery tool that would become the object of my new found desire the instrument of my passion my obsession the blood red six string it was like id known the thing all my life i soon found it was the only way i could truly express myself it was a way to vent all my frustrations and all my pain completely opened all my four doors of doom and i found myself going to the mirror for counsel less and less because of this my songs seemed to write themselves and i knew my destiny was in my music but i was going to have to get out of this backwards town i was in if i was ever going to succeed i was 16 going nowhere and the only thing my parents knew was live work die  and if i stayed there that was exactly what was going to happen to me i was gonna die so i ran away to the big city with the lights excitement and danger and a chance for me to finally live and do my music without the persecution i had known for so long i hitchhiked all the way with a suitcase in one hand and my guitar in the other and as i stood at the edge of the city the magic of the place was incredibly intense it was to be my new home the place i would call the arena of pleasure i lived and struggled in the arena for two years trying to get a break in music and make a record and thats when i ran across a delightful business man named charlie he had been a lawyer for 25 years before he discovered he could fuck over more people in the recording industry then he ever could in a court of law and he was the president of one of the biggest record companies in the world the music business to charlie was nothing more than a sacrificial lamb to be led to slaughter and the weapon of choice was his record company that hed wield like a mighty sword the great tool he would lovingly refer to as the chainsaw the morgue charlie said was the music business where everyone sells out where all the artists will eventually whore themselves to commercialism the place where the music comes to die and through him i learned everything i needed to know about the music business and even things i didnt want to know he said he could make me a star one of the biggest things the world had ever seen the big time was calling and i was on my way he introduced me to an aspiring young manager named alex rodman and together we took on the whole fucking world and kicked it square in the ass just before the release of my first album i was sitting on the steps in front of my apartment when a gypsy woman passed by she stopped and asked me if i would like my fortune read and i had never had it done so i was more than happy to say yes she revealed a deck of tarot cards and began to tell me of my past in which she went into great detail about the pain of my youth my brother and my parents she saw my present with my great struggle to succeed and fulfillment of my dreams and new found happiness but after about ten minutes she stopped and i wanted to know of my future and pleaded for her to go on and finally she spoke she showed me a very disturbing vision of where i was going i told her that i wanted a phenomenal wealth and fame and in the cards she saw a fallen hero and looked at me and said be careful what
