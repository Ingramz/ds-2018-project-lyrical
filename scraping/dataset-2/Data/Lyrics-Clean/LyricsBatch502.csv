"Joni Mitchell","it fell from midnight skies it drummed on the galvanized in the washroom women tracked the rain up to the make up mirror liquid soap and grass and jungle gardenia crash on pine sol and beer its stifling in here ive got to get some air im going outside to get some air back in my hometown they would have cleared the floor just to watch the rain come down theyre such sky oriented people geared to changing weather im floating off in time im floating off im floating off in time when i was three feet tall and wide eyed open to it all with their tasseled teams they came to mcgees general store all in their beaded leathers i would tie on colored feathers and id beat the drum like war i would beat the drum like war id beat the drum id beat the drum like war but when the church got through they traded their beads for bottles smashed on railway avenue and they cut off their braids and lost some link with nature im floating into dreams im floating off im floating into my dreams i dream paprika plains vast and bleak and god forsaken paprika plains and a turquoise river snaking the rain retreats like troops to fall on other fields and streets meanwhile theyre sweet talking and name calling and brawling on the fringes of the floor i spot you through the smoke with your eyes on fire from j and b and coke as im coming through the door im coming back im coming back for more the band plugs in again you see that mirrored ball begin to sputter lights and spin dizzy on the dancers geared to changing rhythms no matter what you do im floating back im floating back to you","Paprika Plains [Remix][#][Mix]","2005"
