"JP Cooper","if you wanna know something bout me the blood in my veins is full of northern grit i got that northern soul man i got bags of it were far from ordinary people and if you wanna know something bout us the hearts in our chest are full of northern love and even when were broke well always have enough were far from ordinary people were far from ordinary alright how can i say this im from a place where no one expects us to make it there was the stone roses and oasis but when they were big we were still babies im talking to the new generation and we wasnt born in the 80s they say that we dont see many places cause nobody left here for ages serious love for the people that raised us even though it got crazy poverty stricken but that never phased us not one of us lazy and ill be the first to say money dont change us well it didnt change me ill never forget where i came from thats cause its the struggle that saved me on the streets we got brought up and wed play on the grass cause were tryna be pro footballers they say theres no kings out here nobodys got money everyone of us paupers i beg to differ cause i see the bigger picture every one of us kings we could live on the street and make it a castle fuck what they call us they can keep throwing out orders in fact bring cameras and recorders weve been fighting for survival and youre gonna learn what war does why did they call it an army thats cause its filled with soldiers theres a war going on outside and its life you can keep the revolvers if you wanna know something bout me the blood in my veins is full of northern grit i got that northern soul man i got bags of it were far from ordinary people and if you wanna know something bout us the hearts in our chest are full of northern love and even when were broke well always have enough were far from ordinary people were far from ordinary okay what did they expect they expect us to fail this test they think cause were broke and were not blessed like were gonna watch our parents stress no chance and more time our parents are broken up anyway theres no romance and the cars been sold and thats cause theres no keeping up with their finance what do they want us to do skip down the road to the job centre and just hold hands its not easy out here depressions a killer especially when youve got no plans so much pain on a daily basis would you not grab the painkiller with both hands its a shame the painkillers weed and liquor strong enough to wipe out the whole gang if im being brutally honest i dont condone it but i understand the stealing and the violence yeah man run when they hear the sirens no comment leave the room in silence thats the same boy whos mum got treated bad in the job centre on friday dad dont care so he lacks the guidance its a shame that the streets are evil but thats just where we grown up and not everything was legal but thats where we learnt to be tough most people grind to a halt like a car with no petrol or no diesel but we keep it moving round here cause were far from ordinary people if you wanna know something bout me the blood in my veins is full of northern grit i got that northern soul man i got bags of it were far from ordinary people and if you wanna know something bout us the hearts in our chest are full of northern love and even when were broke well always have enough were far from ordinary people were far from ordinary i see the raindrops falling again we look up to greet the heavens who cares if we had harsh beginnings we know congruence if you wanna know something bout me the blood in my veins is full of northern grit i got that northern soul man i got bags of it were far from ordinary people and if you wanna know something bout us the hearts in our chest are full of northern love and even when were broke well always have enough were far from ordinary people were far from ordinary people people people people people were far from ordinary","Ordinary People","2018"
