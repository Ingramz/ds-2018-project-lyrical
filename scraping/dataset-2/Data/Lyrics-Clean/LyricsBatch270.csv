"Frank Kelly","day one dear nuala thank you very much for your lovely present of a partridge in a pear tree were getting the hang of feeding the partridge now although it was difficult at first to win its confidence it bit the mother rather badly on the hand but theyre good friends now and were keeping the pear tree indoors in a bucket thank you again yours affectionately gobnait olunasa day two dear nuala i cannot tell you how surprised we were to hear from you so soon again and to receive your lovely present of two turtle doves you really are too kind at first the partridge was very jealous and suspicious of the doves and they had a terrible row the night the doves arrived we had to send for the vet but the birds are okay again and the stitches are due to some out in a week or two the vets bill was 8 but the mother is over her annoyance now and the doves and the partridge are watching the telly from the pear tree as i write yours ever gobnait day three dear nuala we must be foremost in your thoughts i had only posted my letter when the three french hens arrived there was another sort out between the hens and the doves who sided with the partridge and the vet had to be sent for again the mother was raging because the bill was 16 this time but she has almost cooled down however the fact that the birds droppings keep falling down on her hair whilen shes watching the telly doesnt help matters thanking you for your kindness i remain your gobnait day four dear nuala you mustnt have received my last letter when you were sending us the four calling birds there was pandemonium in the pear tree again last night and the vets bill was 32 the mother is on sedation as i write i know you meant no harm and remain your close friend gobnauit day five nuala your generosity knows no bounds five gold rings when the parcel arrived i was scared stiff that it might be more birds because the smell in the living room is atrocious however i dont want to seem ungrateful for the beautiful rings your affectionate friend gobnait day six nuala what are you trying to do to us it isnt that we dont appreciate your generosity but the six geese have not alone nearly murdered the calling birds but they laid their eggs on top of the vets head from the pear tree and his bill was 68 in cash my mother is munching 60 grains of valium a day and talking to herself in a most alarming way you must keep your feelings for me in check gobnait day seven nuala we are not amused by your little joke seven swans a swimming is a most romantic idea but not in the bath of a private house we cannot use the bathroom now because theyve gone completely savage and rush the door every time we try to enter if things go on this way the mother and i will smell as bad as the living room carpet please lay off it is not fair gobnait day eight nuala who the hell do you think gave you the right to send eight hefty maids a milking here to eat us out of house and home their cattle are all over the front lawn and have trampled the hell out of the mothers rose beds the swans invaded the living room in a sneak attack and the ensuing battle between them and the calling birds turtle doves french hens and partridge make the battle of the somme seem like wanderly wagon the mother is on a bottle of whiskey a day as well as the sixty grains of valium im very annoyed with you gobnait day nine listen you looser theres enough pandemonium in this place night and day without nine drummers drumming while the eight flaming maids a milking are beating my poor old alcoholic mother out of her own kitchen and gobbling everything in sight im warning you youre making an enemy of me gobnait day ten listen manure face i hope youll be haunted by the strains of ten pipers piping which you sent to torment us last night they were aided in their evil work by those maniac drummers and it wasnt a pleasant sight to look out the window and see eight hefty maids a milking pogo ing around with the ensuing punk rock uproar my mother has just finished her third bottle of whiskey on top of a hundred and twenty four grains of valium youll get yours gobnait olunasa day eleven you have scandalized my mother you dirty jezebel it was bad enough to have eight maids a milking dancing to punk music on the front lawn but theyve now been joined by your friends the eleven lords a leaping and the antics of the whole lot of them would leave the most decadent days of the roman empire looking like outlook ill get you yet you loud bag day twelve listen slurry head you have ruined our lives the twelve maidens dancing turned up last night and beat the living daylights out of the eight maids a milking cause they found them carrying on with the eleven lords a leaping meanwhile the swans got out of the living room where theyd been hiding since the big battle and savaged hell out of the lords and all the maids there were eight ambulances here last night and the local civil defence as well the mother is in a home for the bewildered and im sitting here up to my neck in birds droppings empty whiskey and valium bottles birds blood and feathers while the flaming cows eat the leaves off the pear tree im a broken man","Christmas Countdown","1996"
