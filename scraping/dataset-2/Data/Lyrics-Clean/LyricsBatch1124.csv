"Big Bill Broonzy","there was once a farmer walking down the road whistling a tune to himself he said dog gone i wish i had some words to that tune but all ive got is the melody just then he came to a little bridge and he leaned on the railing looking down at the brook there was a big old bullfrog hopping from bank to bank well the bullfrog looked up and saw the farmer and decided to show off he took an extra special big hop z z z z tt he landed splash in the water and got himself all wet the farmer laughed and laughed and started singing way down south in the yankety yank a bull frog jumped from bank to bank just because hed nothing better for to do he stubbed his toe and fell in the water you could hear him yell for a mile and a quarter just because hed nothing better for to do now the farmer went walking down the road feeling mighty proud of himself for making up a song he went down to the corner store bought himself some groceries a pair of work gloves and a plug of chewing tobacco and said oh before i go i have to sing you my new song go on home says the storekeeper im busy here cant you see all these customers i wont pay you any money unless you let me sing you my song well sing it and get it over with then said the storekeeper the farmer began to sing and the man in the store cried out thats a w o o nderful song gather round everybody well have a party and he passed round the free coca colas and the free soda crackers and everyone was stamping on the floor meanwhile all the wives and children back home were sitting down to supper and wheres father the mother said children you better run down to the corner store and fetch your old man hes probably down there wasting his time as usual so all the children run down the road they run inside the corner store you know they heard all that music they forgot about coming home the children started singing and they were passing around the free coca colas and now in every farmhouse it was the same situation the mother said to themselves this has gone far enough suppers getting cold spect us to work all the day nobody show up they reached over on the stove and grabbed some heavy frying pans and start down the road with a mad look in their eyes somebodys going to get beaned well they get near and they hear all that pretty music and they forget all about being mad they drop the frying pans in the gutter walk into the store and the mothers start singing way down yonder in the yankety yank a bullfrog jumped from bank to bank and theyre passing round the free coca colas and the free soda crackers and everybody is stamping on the floor meanwhile out in the barns all the cows started talking where is everybody were supposed to be milked and its getting mighty uncomfortable so the cows left their stalls they wobbled out of the barn and down the road right into the corner store and the cows started singing moo moo moo moo moo moo moo moo moo moo and the cows tails were swishing out the windows and they were stamping on the floor and drinking the free coca colas and eating the free soda out in the barnyard all the chickens said where is everybody were supposed to be fed and were getting hungry so the chickens hopped over the fence hopped down the road hopped into the store and the chickens started chicken imitation to tune and the chicken were stamping on the floor and drinking the free coca c meanwhile all the barns started talking to each other we feel mighty lonely they said without any cows or any chickens i guess well have to go find them so the barns picked themselves off their foundations and galumphed down the road and s q u e e z e d themselves into that corner store believe it or not did you ever hear a rusty hinge on a barn door thats the way the barns sang out in the fields all the grass says where is everybody the cows are supposed to come and eat us i guess well have to go find them and the grass picked itself up and swished off down the road and swished right into the store and started singing of course when the grass was gone the fields were gone so the brook didnt have any banks to flow between it said ive got to go someplace so it bubbled down the road it bubbled right up into the corner store and the brook started bubbl bubbl bubbl bubbl bubbl bubbl bubbl the brook was bubbling up and down the stairway the grass was growing out the chimney feathers flying through the air cows tails swishing through the windows everybody stamping on the floor and drinking the free coca cola and eating the free soda crackers meanwhile theres the bullfrog in mid air he looks down theres nothing underneath him he looks over and theres no bank to land on he says where am i and he starts hopping down the road hop hop hop hop hop hey whats all that racket down at the corner store says the frog why theyre singing theyre singing about me and he was so proud he puffed himself up with pride and he puffed and he puffed and he puffed and he boom he exploded cows barns chickens farmers the whole corner store went up in the air and everybody floated down and landed right where they were supposed to have been all the time they all sat down eating supper again feeling kind of foolish for themselves next day they went out to find the frog they looked high they looked low coca cola bottles and soda crackers in all directions but no frog so all there is left of the frog is the song we might as well sing er once again way down yonder in the yankety yank","The Foolish Frog","2016"
