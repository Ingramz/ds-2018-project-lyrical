while the stinky foods steamin your mind starts to dreamin of the moment that its time to leave and then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin into something that looks like cheese oh so you say thats it i gotta leave this place i dont care what these people think im just sittin here makin myself nauseous with this ugly food that stinks so you bust out the door while its still closed still sick from the food you ate and then you run to the store for quick relief from a bottle of kaopectate and then you call your friend two weeks later to see how he has been and he says i
