"Robert Earl Keen, Jr.","its been five years come this autumn she remembers well the day the day the fever got him and took him far away far away from always knowing that the love they shared was true far away the fiddlers bowing the grass forever blue it was in the dead of winter when her man first caught the chill and he said he heard the angels singing cabin on the hill through the springtime he was groaning the good times are past and gone by the summer she was moaning old lover please come home now she stands out in the midnight in the moonlight all aglow she prays to carter stanley wont you please tell bill monroe rather be in some dark hollow or some dark deep shady grove than to be a bluegrass widow spoken word break i started listening to bluegrass music in bryan duckworths rust red 1970 ford maverick had an eight track tape deck and an eight track tape of bill monroes greatest hits we used to skip second period chemistry and go over to the shamrock station across the street from the high school and get a case of texas pride beer charge it on my dads credit card and get em to write it up as oil so dad never knew the difference then wed ride around and drink texas pride listen to bill monroe soon we got to be bluegrass experts and wed stop in another shamrock station and get another texas pride case drink that and listen to the stanley brothers and then wed go get a tape of jim and jesse and it was on to the kentucky colonels and mack wiseman and the new grass revival peter rowan and finally i got the brilliant idea one day to take all the greatest bluegrass song titles in the world and string em together to make this song right here the bluegrass widow quite possibly the worst bluegrass song ever written i did this in tribute to the front porch boys which was a bluegrass band i was in in college station texas we were a little four piece band we played weddings and parties and out on the porch and beer joints and one weekend on a handful of cheap amphetamines we decided to go to crockett texas we entered the international bluegrass band competition and took second place we could play faster than anybody in the competition the other two bands took first and third respectively i met some friends and went off into the night separated from the front porch boys and met back up with them in the cold gray light of dawn as the bluegrass songs say they were standing underneath a giant pine tree there in crockett singing the rudest most grotesque nastiest bluegrass songs youve ever heard in your life im talking about the kind of song where not only is the character in the song dead by the end of the song but hes been dismembered as well and the front porch boys stopped and looked up at me just long enough to say were taking bluegrass music where its never been before and were not taking you with us cause you dont have that high and lonesome sound that bluegrass music requires  well im not one to fight failure i packed up my stuff and left the front porch boys broke up three days later when they realized i owned the pa system will you miss me when im gone  were his final words to her darlin think of what youve done  then replied his knoxville girl and the leaves had started turning when his mind began to fail then he broke down in a breakdown now she wears a long black veil and she stands out in the midnight in the moonlight all aglow she prays to carter stanley wont you please tell bill monroe rather be in some dark hollow or some dark deep shady grove than to be a bluegrass widow and she stands out in the midnight in the moonlight all aglow she prays to carter stanley wont you please tell bill monroe rather be in some dark hollow or some dark deep shady grove than to be a bluegrass widow","The Bluegrass Widow","1988"
