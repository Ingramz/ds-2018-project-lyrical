"Janie Frickie","from thirty thousand feet above the desert floor i see it there below a city with a legend the west texas city of el paso where long ago i heard a song about a texas cowboy and a girl and a little place called rosas where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl i dont recall who sang the song but i recall a story that i heard and as i look down on this city i remember each and every word the singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun to kill another cowboy then he had to leave el paso on the run el paso city by the rio grande the cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldnt stay he rode back just to die in that el paso sand el paso city by the rio grande i try not to let you cross my mind but still i find theres such a mystery in the song that i dont understand my mind is down there somewhere as i fly above the badlands of new mexico i cant explain why i should know the very trail he rode back to el paso can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time and does the mystery deepen cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold these wild and unexplained emotions that ive had so long but i have never told like everytime i fly up through the heavens and i see you there below i get the feeling sometime in another world i lived in el paso el paso city by the rio grande could it be that i could be the cowboy in the mystery that died there in that desert sand so long ago el paso city by the rio grande a voice tells me to go and seek another voice keeps telling me maybe death awaits me in el paso el paso city","Why Me","2007"
