yo yo yo no tengo escuela sin que soplara el viento aprendi a navegar barcos de vela mi rima encima de una cumbia como quiera impacta no sigo ninguna escuela porque soy autodidacta nunca segui las reglas con pistas de rap genericas como un cajon peruano escribi latinoamerica mi rap no sigue ordenes de ningun sargento hijo de puta yo cree mi propio movimiento que narra y sin garras te desgarra no creci escuchando a 2pac creci con violeta parra y cuando deletreo los educo sin pizarra con solo dos barras las rockeo sin guitarra no creo en dioses del rap mucho menos en reyes yo soy la fucking gravedad desafiando las leyes yo soy el orden pero cuando se desarregla todas mis lineas son curvas siempre rompo las reglas acostado bajo la sombra de una palma relajado compitiendo contra mi mismo porque no tengo a nadie al lado me gusta abusar de los raperos fresa les dejo la r en las nalgas impresa antes de bajarme esa cerveza facilmente los torturo solo les quito el instagram y vuelven a ser inseguros tu moda no creo que dure las quinceaneras que te siguen hoy ya no te seguiran cuando maduren mucha selfie y poco contenido se tardan mas en el vestuario que haciendo pruebas de sonido sus conciertos son todos iguales pocas rimas poca banda muchos fuegos artificiales no se me escapan cuando escribo son faciles de identificar porque se visten con colores llamativos a estos raperitos nunca les he visto la cara siempre les veo de espalda cuando los pongo en 4 y les subo la falda y me los follo por los dos hoyos sin apoyo los arroyo al estilo criollo los convierto en caldo de pollo la policia me busca por acoso sexual y por perverso porque como kase o soy un violador del verso y la goleo porque con las dos piernas pateo en el freestyleo desde el tiro libre la dunkeo y sin rodeo cuando me cabreo con mi palabreo pongo a hablar en arabe hasta los hebreos a veces le meto tan rapido que el alfabeto no lo veo a los del maleanteo los abofeteo como novela de abuela sin empleo mi lengua se tira acrobacias nunca antes vistas es malabarista todo un artista y como michael jackson hace el moonwalking por la pista no hay quien resista al residente cuando los baja caliente los pongo de rodillas literalmente como a los creyentes en el medio oriente arrodillate y reza soy un taliban rimando corto cabeza con mi destreza les quito el corazon con la boca y lo pongo en la mesa encima de pan de hamburguesa con mayonesa y sala japonesa y un poco de jugo de fresa me los desayuno mi lengua nunca se tropieza cuando se expresa los atraviesa con naturaleza mi sopa de letras empieza abran
