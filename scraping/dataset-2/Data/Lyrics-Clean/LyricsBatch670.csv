"Arlo Guthrie","you can get anything you want at alices restaurant you can get anything you want at alices restaurant walk right in its around the back just a half a mile from the railroad track you can get anything you want at alices restaurant this song is called alices restaurant its about alice and the restaurant but alices restaurant is not the name of the restaurant thats just the name of the song thats why i call the song alices restaurant now it all started two thanksgivings ago two years ago on thanksgiving when my friend and i went up to visit alice at the restaurant but alice doesnt live in the restaurant she lives in the church nearby the restaurant in the bell tower with her husband ray and facha the dog and livin in the bell tower like that they got a lot of room downstairs where the pews used to be and havin all that room seein as how they took out all the pews they decided that they didnt have to take out their garbage for a long time we got up here and found all the garbage in there and we decided that itd be a friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump so we took the half a ton of garbage put it in the back of a red vw microbus took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the city dump well we got there and there was a big sign and a chain across the dump sayin this dump is closed on thanksgiving and wed never heard of a dump closed on thanksgiving before and with tears in our eyes we drove off into the sunset lookin for another place to put the garbage we didnt find one till we came to a side road and off the side of the side road was another fifteen foot cliff and at the bottom of the cliff was another pile of garbage and we decided that one big pile was better than two little piles and rather than bring that one up we decided to throw ours down thats what we did drove back to the church had a thanksgiving dinner that couldnt be beat went to sleep and didnt get up until the next morning when we got a phone call from officer obie he said kid we found your name on a envelope at the bottom of a half a ton of garbage and i just wanted to know if you had any information about it and i said yes sir officer obie i cannot tell a lie i put that envelope under that garbage after speakin to obie for about forty five minutes on the telephone we finally arrived at the truth of the matter and he said that we had to go down and pick up the garbage and also had to go down and speak to him at the police officer station so we got in the red vw microbus with the shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the police officer station now friends there was only one of two things that obie couldve done at the police officer station and the first was that he couldve given us a medal for bein so brave and honest on the telephone which wasnt very likely and we didnt expect it and the other thing was that he couldve bawled us out and told us never to be seen drivin garbage around in the vicinity again which is what we expected but when we got to the police officer station there was a third possibility that we hadnt even counted upon and we was both immediately arrested handcuffed and i said obie i cant pick up the garbage with these here handcuffs on he said shut up kid and get in the back of the patrol car and thats what we did sat in the back of the patrol car and drove to the quote scene of the crime unquote i want to tell you bout the town of stockbridge massachusetts where this is happenin they got three stop signs two police officers and one police car but when we got to the scene of the crime there was five police officers and three police cars bein the biggest crime of the last fifty years and everybody wanted to get in the newspaper story about it and they was usin up all kinds of cop equipment that they had hangin around the police officer station they was takin plaster tire tracks footprints dog smellin prints and they took twenty seven 8 x 10 colored glossy photographs with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explainin what each one was to be used as evidence against us took pictures of the approach the getaway the northwest corner the southwest corner and thats not to mention the aerial photography after the ordeal we went back to the jail obie said he was gonna put us in a cell he said kid im gonna put you in a cell i want your wallet and your belt i said obie i can understand your wantin my wallet so i dont have any money to spend in the cell but what do you want my belt for and he said kid we dont want any hangins i said obie did you think i was gonna hang myself for litterin obie said he was makin sure and friends obie was cause he took out the toilet seat so i couldnt hit myself over the head and drown and he took out the toilet paper so i couldnt bend the bars roll the toilet paper out the window slide down the roll and have an escape obie was makin sure it was about four or five hours later that alice remember alice theres a song about alice alice came by and with a few nasty words to obie on the side bailed us out of jail and we went back to the church had another thanksgiving dinner that couldnt be beat and didnt get up until the next morning when we all had to go to court we walked in sat down obie came in with the twenty seven 8 times 10 colored glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one sat down man came in said all rise we all stood up and obie stood up with the twenty seven 8 times 10 colored glossy pictures and the judge walked in sat down with a seein eye dog and he sat down we sat down obie looked at the seein eye dog then at the twenty seven 8 x 10 colored glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one and looked at the seein eye dog and then at the twenty seven 8 x 10 colored glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each on and began to cry because obie came to the realization that it was a typical case of american blind justice and there wasnt nothin he could do about it and the judge wasnt gonna look at the twenty seven 8 by 10 colored glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explainin what each one was to be used as evidence against us and we was fined fifty dollars and had to pick up the garbage in the snow but thats not what im here to tell you about im here to talk about the draft they got a buildin down in new york city called
