"Opeth","the mist is sleeping on the water and winter is hiding in my heart thorns in my eyes are slowing me down i cant pass through to the other side she knows im the one who sought her but when we fall well fall so hard she holds a secret and wont show me how how to break the riddle in her eyes this is treason of the mind and soul death is no reason why you would go inside the ghost of love is laughing it mocks the footsteps where i go it tells me nothing has been lost it whispers youve seen darkness before in time the hurting will subside and longing is overthrown whats left is a void that grows inside and the echo of a failure this is treason of the mind and soul death is no reason why you would go have you ever had the feeling of a sorrow inside have you ever been the reason why a hope subsides have you ever seen the aftermath of giving up have we given up is it over have you given up is winter hiding in your heart","Voice of Treason","2014"
"Opeth","a beloved name inside my heart a fleeting glance became the start a missing word i am still awaiting a wretched deception i am creating","Persephone","2016"
"Opeth","and on the furthest day when you lay down discard your disarray and your rusted crown and face the wretched image of you and i no trust in what you say you are a dead poison seed stronger when you are away you have nothing that i need the rhyme has settled in the ghost of a sigh nothing now remains now you will leave me be sunrise into the moonlight a broken body lies in wait your prize won you the stark night and you made peace with your fate blind eyes sensitive only to white light reacting just a bit too late preying on insecurity a design of your schemes a true believer of purity must tend to what it means or allow its gospel to turn into a lie you forsake everything you feel in favor of despair immune and blind to everything that is real in your secret lair and cast away the captive heart that was thine and you will go and leave me be winter in your soul building a wasteland and you tread a thin ice neath your feet sneering and everyone you would shun collecting flowers to your wreath lifeline a river cuts deep in your cold hand it is changing when you try to breathe leave it all behind you there is comfort in giving up a seed in a barren soil might curl up into a coil flourish into something new give back what you thought was you and give way to all that is new leave it all behind you","Chrysalis","2016"
"Opeth","theres a sign in the rain every now and again it is a symbol of hope in the midst of a catastrophic episode in the hour of death theres a spiritual wealth when we dance through the rain and form the signs once again if even for a second i hear a voice on the air it has a warning to share dont believe what you see you cant perceive what you feel but if i do what im told and shun the spirit i hold im no longer a human and i will not shift with the sands the end of an era one starts anew you know the devil he lives in you the end of an era one starts anew you know the devil he lives in you there are moments of doubt when i dont know what to do and giving in is the only way out when theres too much shouting about how i should choose incapacitated im left behind in a sea of hatred i go blind a storm is coming i hide away in the years of need reason leads astray the end of an era one starts anew you know the devil he lives in you the end of an era one starts anew you know the devil he lives in you he lives in you he lives in you","Era","2016"
"Opeth","up until recently i have been alone leading a tranquil life but never at home something had changed and i turned to the wind that blew through me and told me how long how long silenced the voice of my heart now for years i was perplexed by a fleeting blank stare biding my time until courage had build up inside me then came clean or am i wrong i spend all my days contemplating my will for the weak shall inherit the earth when its still a government bid for my life i was sold as a cog in a machine i walk the line a fleeting glance again tells me everything took a chance in vain drown to a futile idea a pursuit of happiness as the storm rolls in an idol of helplessness paved the way and then gave in i met with my mother and i asked her why for ten years so more she would never reply suddenly she said we are all born to die gave me purpose freed me how simple it can be but its fading away from my mind theres another me waiting behind but its fading away from my mind theres another me waiting behind","A Fleeting Glance","2016"
"Opeth","the years went by with disquieting grace a past obsession sunk without a trace i moved into winter and found my home as my boiling blood had turned to chrome","Persephone (Slight Return)","2016"

"Opeth","i am a sinner and i worship evil blood is thinner but you will never know can you confess that you thrive in chaos youre a sorceress and your eye is on the lost but youre dying its in your eyes youre a charlatan you get everything you wish youre a harlot carry poison in your kiss beg forgiveness with a dagger in your hand sow your death seed and reap the dying lands but youre crying its only vice empty vessel drained of hope and none the lesser at the end of a rope have you ever hated like i know i still awaited the absence of lies watch your eager tongue attack me from behind riddle whispers bleak futile control like a twin sister adapting to a role youre a murderer bloodlust increase youre a harvester come close to spread disease and youre hiding i hear you cry","Sorceress","2016"
"Opeth","until i take my final breath in a year or even less i hope you will give me all your time and do not forget me down the line and i will never ask you if you will stay or if you will cry when i go away until i take my final breath in a year or even less i hope you will give me all your time and do not forget me down the line and i will never ask you if you will stay or if you will cry when i go away ice melting into the sea your river flowing back to me and when you take your final breath in many years from now no less i hope you feel a peace at heart dont be afraid to kiss the dark and dont ever wonder if i stayed my love for you can not die away","Sorceress 2","2016"
"Opeth","an afternoon walk through the park i keep to the shadows until its dark i am not educated nor free of sin i carry thoughts of giving in there is a void surrounding me no sound and in the black i can not see there is a chasm between you and me you have no face no body no words to speak there is a wickedness in me i cant seem to make it go away i am a spiritual leper but i can see a flock of believers gone astray theres eternal night in my gaze im cast out and i am not like you find my way on through the haze im liquefied in a strange brew an early morn walk through the park i look to the sun when it is cold and stark i blend with the crows of robot minds never a leader i am always behind a voice through the rain tells me im here a glance from a veil brings me to tears a voice through the rain tells me im here a glance from a veil brings me to tears a voice through the rain tells me im here a glance from a veil brings me to tears a voice through the rain tells me im here a glance from a veil brings me to tears","Strange Brew","2016"

"Opeth","when youre tired of waiting and time is not on your side when youre tired of hating me you no longer want to hide youre stuck to the failures of your life marred with the sorrows of your strife and time it waits for no one it heals them when you die and soon you are forgotten a whisper within a sigh when theres trouble admitting that you have been wrong all along when the words you have written down reads everything is gone youre stuck to the failures of your life marred with the sorrows of your strife and time it waits for no one it heals them when you die and soon you are forgotten a whisper within a sigh and time it waits for no one it heals them when you die and soon you are forgotten a whisper within a sigh when you smother your friendships and take much more than you need when you cant keep a secret to yourself and points to the source of the deed youre stuck to the failures of your life marred with the sorrows of your strife and you can never find the satisfaction when you cant outgrow your false distractions you know your soul is weighed on the silver scale of deceit and lies","Will o the Wisp","2016"
