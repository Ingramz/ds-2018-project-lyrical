"Don Braden","all or nothing at all half a love never appealed to me if your heart never could yield to me then id rather rather have nothing at all all or nothing at all if its love there is no in between why begin then cry for something that might have been no id rather rather have nothing at all but please dont bring your lips so close to my cheek dont smile or ill be lost beyond recall the kiss in your eyes the touch of your hand makes me weak and my heart may go dizzy and fall and if i fell i fell under the spell of your call i would be caught in the undertow so you see ive got to say no no all or nothing at all","All or Nothing at All","1999"
"Don Braden","over time ive been building my castle of love just for two though you never knew you were my reason ive gone much too far for you now to say that ive got to throw my castle away over dreams i have picked out a perfect come true though you never knew it was of you ive been dreaming the sandman has come from too far away for you to say come back some other day and though you dont believe that they do they do come true for did my dreams come true when i looked at you and maybe too if you would believe you too might be overjoyed over loved over me over hearts i have painfully turned every stone just to find i had found what ive searched to discover ive come much too far for me now to find the love that i sought can never be mine and though you dont believe that they do they do come true for did my dreams come true when i looked at you and maybe too if you would believe you too might be overjoyed over loved over me and though the odds say improbable what do they know for in romance all true love needs is a chance and maybe with a chance you will find you too like i overjoyed over loved over you over you","Overjoyed","2000"
"Don Braden","if you hear a song in blue like a flower crying for the dew that was my heart serenading you my prelude to a kiss if you hear a song that grows from my tender sentimental woes that was my heart trying to compose a prelude to a kiss though its just a simple melody with nothing fancy nothing much you could turn it to a symphony a shubert tune with a gershwin touch oh how my love song gently cries for the tenderness within your eyes my love is a prelude that never dies a prelude to a kiss though its just a simple melody with nothing fancy nothing much you could turn it to a symphony a shubert tune with a gershwin touch oh how my love song so gently cries for the tenderness within your eyes my love is a prelude that never dies a prelude to a kiss","Prelude to a Kiss","2001"
"Don Braden","the very thought of you makes my heart sing like an april breeze on the wings of spring and you appear in all your splendor my one and only love the shadows fall and spread their mystic charms in the hush of night while youre in my arms i feel your lips so warm and tender my one and only love the touch of your hand is like heaven a heaven that ive never known the blush on your cheek whenever i speak tells me that you are my own you fill my eager heart with such desire evry kiss you give sets my soul on fire i give myself in sweet surrender my one and only love","My One and Only Love","2002"
"Don Braden","the night is like a lovely tune beware my foolish heart how white the ever constant moon take care my foolish heart theres a line between love and fascination thats hard to see how many names such as this for they both have the very same sensation when youre locked in the magic of a kiss her lips are much too close to mine beware my foolish heart but should our eager lips combine then let the fire start for this time it isnt fascination or a dream that will fade and fall apart its love this time its love my foolish heart","My Foolish Heart","2008"
"Don Braden","once i had a secret love that lived within the heart of me all too soon my secret love became impatient to be free so i told a friendly star the way that dreamers often do just how wonderful you are and why im so in love with you now i shout it from the highest hills even told the golden daffodils at last my hearts an open door and my secret loves no secret anymore","Secret Love","2008"
