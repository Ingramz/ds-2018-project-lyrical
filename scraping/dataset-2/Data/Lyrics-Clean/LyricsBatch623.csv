"Lou Reed","take me for what i am a star newly emerging long simmering explodes inside the self is reeling in the pocket of the heart in the rushing of the blood in the muscle of my sex in the mindful mindless love i accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling at 5 am the moon and the sun sit set before my window light glances off the blue glass we set right before the window and you who accept in your soul and your head what was misunderstood what was thought of with dread a new self is born the other self dead i accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling a soul singer stands on the stage the spotlight shows him sweating he sinks to one knee seems to cry the horn are unrelenting but as the drums beats he finds himself growing hard in the microphones face he sees her face growing large and the swelling crescendo no longer retards i accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling as the twilight sunburst gleams as the chromium moon it sets as i lose all my regrets and set the twilight reeling i accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling","Set the Twilight Reeling","1999"
