"Shane Koyczan","used to anticipate the sign of the coming day and all through winters decay you just mark the way we worry what peopled say if we up and walked away i swore we had a place to stay stay thats what mothers say when their sons and daughters go away they say stay my mother said go so i wasnt there the night she fell out of her chair so frustrated that she amputated her own legs or rather tried to with a steak knife her life leaking out on the white floor blossoming like roses in the snow her relationship was an anthem composed of words like gotta go so we went and sent our regards on postcards from all the places that wed been with stories about all the things wed seen thats how it was with you and i why say goodbye when we could still write and then we took your hands but we shouldve practiced our goodbyes because then i took your eyes and i was somewhere in the middle of nowhere watching the sun rise over a stop sign faced down the center line of a highway filled with sudden turns for the worse coming back home cause i gotta play nurse gotta figure out with pill alleviates which pain which part of your brain is being used for a boxing bag as your body became a never ending game of freeze tag taking place in an empty playground i was left looking for your limbs at a lost and found and i couldnt set you free so we just sat there our heads bent towards each other like flowers in the small hours of the morning while light wandered in like a warning that time is passing and you ride a little home with it bit by bit every day and all i could say is if i could i would write you some way out of this but my gift is useless and you said no write me a poem to make me happy over the hill and gone and id never been that far some boy along the way taught me to play guitar and you said that youd read to me if i fell asleep rock me awake again promise me but you make such beautiful words i wrote move pen move write me a bedroom where cures make love to our cancers but my mother just motions to a bottle full of answers and says help me go now i know something of how a piano must feel when it looks at the fireplace to see sheet music being used for kindling smoke signaling the end of some song that i thought it would take too long to learn so i just sit here watching you burn away all those notes that never had a chance to play to hear the music of what you had to say but i count out the pills just to see if i can do it and i cant even get halfway through it before i turn back into your son and say stay i need something to lean against i think thats okay butterflies you read to me they all flew away and im saddened by the thought and sometimes i think too much and though im happy right here you know that im really not its distracting i could hook up to my heart to your ears and let my tears be your morphine drip and maybe its easier to let you slip away than it is to say goodbye so i hold my breath because in the countdown to death the question of why melts into when how much time do we have left because if i knew what i know now then move pen move write me a mountain because headstones are not big enough none of this is stop it write me a poem to make me happy i swear write this stay she smiles and says gotta go i know goodbye over the years it seems that agings just not for me though i ache just below the knees and it flows to my heart and all through the hearts i need its not how it ought to be youre falling away from me and its just not right falling away from me its not right but you make such beautiful words now its trying oh how its tragic but you make such beautiful words","Tragic Turn of Events/Move Pen Move",""
