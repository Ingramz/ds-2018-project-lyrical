"Ani DiFranco","coming of age during the plague of reagan and bush watching capitalism gun down democracy it had this funny effect on me i guess i am cancer i am hiv and im down at the blue jesus blue cross hospital just lookin up from my pillow feeling blessed and the mighty multinationals have monopolized the oxygen so its as easy as breathing for us all to participate yes theyre buying and selling off shares of air and you know its all around you but its hard to point and say there so you just sit on your hands and quietly contemplate your next bold move the next thing youre gonna need to prove to yourself what a waste of thumbs that are imposable to make machines that are disposable and sell them to seagulls flying in circles around one big right wing yes the left wing was broken long ago by the slingshot of cointelpro and now its so hard to have faith in anything especially your next bold move or the next thing youre gonna need to prove to yourself you want to track each trickle back to its source and then scream up the faucet til your face is hoarse cause youre surrounded by a worlds worth of things you just cant excuse but youve got the hard cough of a chain smoker and youre at the arctic circle playing strip poker and its getting colder and colder every time you lose so go ahead make your next bold move tell us whats the next thing youre gonna need to prove to yourself","Your Next Bold Move","2001"
"Ani DiFranco","yes us people are just poems were ninety percent metaphor with a leanness of meaning approaching hyper distillation and once upon a time we were moonshine rushing down the throat of a giraffe yes rushing down the long hallway despite what the p a announcement says yes rushing down the long hall down the long stairs in a building so tall that it will always be there yes its part of a pair there on the bow of noahs ark the most prestigious couple just kickin back parked against a perfectly blue sky on a morning beatific in its indian summer breeze on the day that america fell to its knees after strutting around for a century without saying thank you or please and the shock was subsonic and the smoke was deafening between the setup and the punch line cause we were all on time for work that day we all boarded that plane for to fly and then while the fires were raging we all climbed up on the window sill and then we all held hands and jumped into the sky and every borough looked up when it heard the first blast and then every dumb action movie was summarily surpassed and the exodus uptown by foot and motorcar looked more like war than anything ive seen so far so far so far so fierce and ingenious a poetic specter so far gone that every jackass newscaster was struck dumb and stumbling over oh my god and this is unbelievable and on and on and ill tell you what while were at it you can keep the pentagon keep the propaganda keep each and every tv thats been trying to convince me to participate in some prep school punks plan to perpetuate retribution perpetuate retribution even as the blue toxic smoke of our lesson in retribution is still hanging in the air and theres ash on our shoes and theres ash in our hair and theres a fine silt on every mantle from hells kitchen to brooklyn and the streets are full of stories sudden twists and near misses and soon every open bar is crammed to the rafters with tales of narrowly averted disasters and the whiskey is flowin like never before as all over the country folks just shake their heads and pour so heres a toast to all the folks that live in palestine afghanistan iraq el salvador heres a toast to the folks living on the pine ridge reservation under the stone cold gaze of mt rushmore heres a toast to all those nurses and doctors who daily provide women with a choice who stand down a threat the size of oklahoma city just to listen to a young womans voice heres a toast to all the folks on death row right now awaiting the executioners guillotine who are shackled there with dread and can only escape into their heads to find peace in the form of a dream peace in the form of a dream cause take away our playstations and we are a third world nation under the thumb of some blue blood royal son who stole the oval office and that phony election i mean it dont take a weatherman to look around and see the weather jeb said hed deliver florida folks and boy did he ever and we hold these truths to be self evident number one george w bush is not president number two america is not a true democracy number three the media is not fooling me cause i am a poem heeding hyper distillation ive got no room for a lie so verbose im looking out over my whole human family and im raising my glass in a toast heres to our last drink of fossil fuels may we vow to get off of this sauce shoo away the swarms of commuter planes and find that train ticket we lost cause once upon a time the line followed the river and peeked into all the backyards and the laundry was waving the graffiti was teasing us from brick walls and bridges we were rolling over ridges through valleys under stars i dream of touring like duke ellington in my own railroad car i dream of waiting on the tall blond wooden benches in a grand station aglow with grace and then standing out on the platform and feeling the air on my face give back the night its distant whistle give the darkness back its soul give the big oil companies the finger finally and relearn how to rock n roll yes the lessons are all around us and the truth is waiting there so its time to pick through the rubble clean the streets and clear the air get our government to pull its big dick out of the sand of someone elses desert put it back in its pants and quit the hypocritical chants of freedom forever cause when one lone phone rang in two thousand and one at ten after nine on nine one one which is the number we all called when that lone phone rang right off the wall right off our desk and down the long hall down the long stairs in a building so tall that the whole world turned just to watch it fall and while were at it remember the first time around the bomb the ryder truck the parking garage the princess that didnt even feel the pea remember joking around in our apartment on avenue d can you imagine how many paper coffee cups would have to change their design following a fantastical reversal of the new york skyline it was a joke at the time and that was just a few years ago so let the record show that the fbi was all over that case that the plot was obvious and in everybodys face and scoping that scene religiously the cia or is it kgb committing countless crimes against humanity with this kind of eventuality as its excuse for abuse after expensive abuse and it didnt have a clue look another window to see through way up here on the hundredth and fourth floor look another key another door ten percent literal ninety percent metaphor three thousand some poems disguised as people on an almost too perfect day must be more than pawns in some assholes passion play so now its your job and its my job to make it that way to make sure they didnt die in vain ssh baby listen hear the train","Self Evident","2002"
