"Scarub","its wishful thinking its always wishful thinking uh huh its wishful thinking its always wishful thinking and uh chorus i used to know this girl as fly as saturdays and every time she smiled my way like honey to me i would hold my heart as well as my hopes back for fear of how she would have reacted if i was to express how i was attracted to her spectacular bosoms and vacular amenities and every time i would see her ever so beautiful figure walking the earth it would just confuse me making me woozy but i kept my mouth shut i figured putting myself in such a position of vulnerability would just give her the power to either lose me or abuse me so in the dark i stood skylarking i would ponder on what if but the what ifs would have been solved if i wasnt so chicken shit to get involved in these matters of the heart but thats all in the past and shes gone leaving me gasping while asking i wonder if ill ever have another chance wonder if ill have another dance a change in my circumstance to romance from wishful thinking it was a day like this when we met in 1993 she came up to me whispering something like sunshine while i was in line at the festival which couldnt compare to the festivities of her beauty i moved our conversation from name into hobby hobby into visions visions to envisioning the two of us meeting up again if she would just pick the time and place the way our eyes embraced sublime troubles bits and based in an ideal song i looked into her face and saw my future was less than perfect placement our worries were kept in the basement either that or the attic there would be no static in our living room my mind mapped out the blueprints consuming each others thoughts in the dining room romance would be placed in the bedroom illuminated with joy and perfume tribulations would be hung in the kids room furnished with laughter after our lives were situated and financially elevated our house would be decorated in colours and feelings ive only seen in dreams but was never able to describe i felt all of this but didnt know how to subscribe to her interests you know how first impressions are catalogues that come with no index appendix or bibliographies just a table of contents for us to guess at choose a chapter and hopefully it works for you we agreed that our time shared was pleasurable and that we should rendez vous i attached the idea of exchanging numbers so again i could see her she smiled sunbeam so warm i was blinded by her glare meanwhile mesmerized by the magnificent mana she seemed to bear then said she would be back at the festival tomorrow and to meet right here like right here in this particular spot chorus now i had expected a no show kept on checking the time on my wrist match then felt a elbow nudge me from the back when i turned around and she was top notch smelling like butterscoth when trying to speak i was too shocked all blocked up in my voice box i just stood there and smiled she took my hand manoeuvred me through the crowd i hung on like a child thats a security blanket for dear life we rounded the bin where she took me into her booth she was a vendor visual artist a poet who loved to work with the youth said what attracted her to me was my aura seemed to bear truthfulness in a world full of filthiness and hearts swallowed up into emptiness not in the exact words but i said the same we sat there all day in the shade talking boredom never came i told her about my music i said i wanted to use it to touch use it to travel around the world sharing my views on such and such and finally to clutch a point in time where i could say that i was happy own a business have a wife and some children to call me pappy nodding her head she smirked and said she knew our ideas would work and again not in the exact words but i said the same evening quickly arrived and i had to go it was the last day of the festival smiling she said she was glad i came a pen was pulled i supplied the paper numbers were exchanged we both stood up and showed love in the form of a hug and went our separate ways i remember them vividly in my memory those yesterdays chorus she held delightful conversations over the phone with a mouthful of words that when were said made you feel like you were worth something more than just flesh and bone taking up space and time our discussions raced the mind forever building healing exchanging ideas drilling to the core of what we were here for how to communicate with ancestors and why we as people deserved more from equal rights revolutionary fights to spiritual insight she even shot over to the house and gave me a cooking lesson one night it was nothing fancy rice and beans seasoned with a side order of plantainels the table was lit with candles we sat juxtaposed and stood out the windows to gaze at the stars i said lets make a wish on that reddish one she was like fool thats mars then mapped out all the celestial bodies from the little dipper up to the quasars and finally picked one we closed our eyes and made a wish but i substituted my wish for hope and it still wasnt enough to anchor us down you see hope holds just a little bit more weight than a wish and my wish turned hope then swish and my time was too short on the rebound the clock countdown was to my disadvantage and im not the type to come with full court pressure so my games in her eyes i was tucked away and forgotten and all my plottin to win this girl too small to be measured and so now all i have to treasure is my wishful thinking","Wishful Thinking","2001"
