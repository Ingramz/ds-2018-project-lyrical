"Regie Hamm","so many preachers so many churches and denominations got their opinions and their documents and statements and beliefs and sometimes theres a miscommunication and we complicate the truth and convolute the story but as far as i recall i do believe it all comes down to a man dying on a cross saving the world rising from the dead doing what he said he would do loving everyone he saw when its said and done it all comes down to a man dying on a cross saving the world it isnt a secret and maybe im being simple minded but its about jesus and a way a truth a life that can change a heart and a soul forever and we need to be reminded its the power of the blood that brings us to redemption we can rise above the fall and the reason for it all all the people beneath the steeple are just reaching for the truth that can save a helpless soul we wrestle with the mystery in the teaching but the news is all good i think that we should remember one thing","Saving the World","1999"
