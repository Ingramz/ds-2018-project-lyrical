"Don't Look Down","just another day far away from being myself cant explain my situation but i think im someone else sick of all your stories the lying has affected me when i look in the mirror nothing looks back at me just another day goes by that you look the other way just another day goes by that i see you fade away just another day and i dont know what to do let me sit here by myself thinkin how to make it through just the same old story i get left behind these thoughts run through my head will they never die just another day goes by that you look the other way just another day goes by that i see you fade away just another day that im getting over you the wall you built up lies i finally see through this is your last story the last one you tell me and when i look at the mirror i stare back at me just another day goes by that you look the other way just another day goes by that i see you fade away just another day goes by that you look the other way just another day goes by that i see you fade away","Fade","2002"
"Don't You Wanna Know Herr","and now the purple dusk of twilight time steals across the meadows of my heart high up in the sky the little stars climb always reminding me that were apart you wander down the lane and far away leaving me a song that will not die love is now the stardust of yesterday the music of the years gone by sometimes i wonder how i spend the lonely nights dreaming of a song the melody haunts my reverie and i am once again with you when our love was new and each kiss an inspiration but that was long ago and now my consolation is in the stardust of a song besides the garden wall when stars are bright you are in my arms the nightingale tells his fairytale of paradise where roses grew though i dream in vain in my heart it will remain my stardust melody the memory of loves refrain","Stardust","2000"
