hospital where it comes alive again the paramedics walk backwards like an irish dance put the wounded man back in the ambulance the ambulances engine turns back on and its lights flash as it plays his favorite song the guy goes back to the exact spot where they found him and the medics and and all the passers by go back where they came from till eventually no one surrounds him and the blood pours up him rather than down him the man then falls upwards back on his feet stumbles towards a dark figure on the other side of the street he walks into the blade that cut his belly then he holds his neck which was bleeding already he removes his hand so you can see the cut and as the knife undoes the slice it closes back up he unsays the words he said which were what the fuck and unscreams the scream from the first initial cut then the blood from he severely severed ear crawls back up his cheek and slowly disappears as the knife wielding silhouette unhacks it from the rear puts the knife away after reattaching the ear then walks backwards thought the bushes where hes disregarded nature whos the guy on the bench im reading his paper takes the snail he stepped on back from its creator only to be killed again when i fast forward this shit later back in his house now back in his bed he un listens to a cd and un bops his head takes the cd out the player and puts it back in its case which has my name on the cover along with my face fast forward theres been a murder and the police know whos done it not lookin for a motive coz they dont know why he done it sure enough it dont take that long for them to find a reason and they publicly state it on tv that evening a couple of months later this shit gets banned like it was me who put that switch in his hand and told him to kill that man

and tell that shit in reverse the hirst brings the corpse back to the morgue the guy from the morgue undresses the corpse embalming fluid goes back out the blood goes back in body goes back to hospital where it comes alive again the paramedics walk backwards like an irish dance put the wounded man back in the ambulance the ambulances engine turns back on and its lights flash as it plays his favorite song the guy goes back to the exact spot where they found him and the medics and and all the passers by go back where they came from till eventually no one surrounds him and the blood pours up him rather than down him the man then falls upwards back on his feet stumbles towards a dark figure on the other side of the street he walks into the blade that cut his belly then he holds his neck which was bleeding already he removes his hand so you can see the cut and as the knife undoes the slice it closes back up he unsays the words he said which were what the fuck and unscreams the scream from the first initial cut then the blood from he severely severed ear crawls back up his cheek and slowly disappears as the knife wielding silhouette unhacks it from the rear puts the knife away after reattaching the ear then walks backwards thought the bushes where hes disregarded nature whos the guy on the bench im reading his paper takes the snail he stepped on back from its creator only to be killed again when i fast forward this shit later back in his house now back in his bed he un listens to a cd and un bops his head takes the cd out the player and puts it back in its case which has my name on the cover along with my face fast forward theres been a murder and the police know whos done it not lookin for a motive coz they dont know why he done it sure enough it dont take that long for them to find a reason and they publicly state it on tv that evening a couple of months later this shit gets banned like it was me who put that switch in his hand and told him to kill that man like this whole song was just some kinda sickly devised plan to hurt some poor cunt i dont even know and ive never met before in my life the words whoever said the pen is mightier than the sword was right and you better think twice before you step to me and pick a fight","Sick 2 Def [Acoustic]","2006"
