cause you thought lil wayne was weezy but weezy is dwayne i was watching t v the other day right got this white guy on there talking about black guys talking about how young black guys are targeted targeted by who america you see one in every hundred americans are locked up one in every nine black americans are locked up and see what the white guy was trying to stress was that the money we spend on sending a mothafucka to jail a young mothafucka to jail would be less to send his or her young ass to college see and another thing the white guy was stressing was that our jails are populated with drug dealers you know crack cocaine yea stuff like that meaning due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine police are only i dont want to say only right but shit only logic by riding around in the hood all day and not in the suburbs because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood and you know the other thing is mostly found in you know where im going but why bring a mothafucka to jail if its not gon stand up in court cause this drug aint that drug you know level three level four drug shit like that i guess its all a misunderstanding i sit back and think you know us young mothafuckas you know that 1 in 9 we probably only selling the crack cocaine because we in the hood and its not like in the suburbs we dont have what you have why i really dont wanna know the answer i guess we just misunderstood huh you know we dont have room in the jail now for the real mothafuckas the real criminals sex offenders rapists serial killers dont get scared dont get scared i know you saw one them sex offenders papers dont trip he live right on the end of yo block mhm yea that nigga live right down the street from you sex offender on the level three drug convicted ex con yea check em out watch you got you got a daughter son what you got ha ha yea you know what thats the good weed you know what i have a fucking daughter you understand me and why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me aint the reason i live next door to him meaning he didnt rap his way to my fucking neighborhood he sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood you move him out bring him to jail for life and then you move in with a sex offender ha ha hey give me a paper ha ha is that a misunderstanding because i didnt understand it another thing let me take my glasses off cause i wanna see the reaction on there faces when i say this ha ha this is why i dont respect you and nobody like ya see youre the type that gets off on getting on other people thats not good no homo rather un human i should say i mean giving the fact that humanity were a good humanity rather to me is helping one another no matter your color or race but this guy and people like him theyd rather speculate before they informate if thats a word ha ha ha you know spec before check anyways meaning id much rather you talk to me first and see if you can lend an opinion before you link one just my thought of good humanity mr sharpton hold on i aint finished with you man na fuck that shit mhm hold on um mr sharp ton and anyone like you you dont know me so if your not going to try to then what you say or think about me are what ever i do is totally casper the friendly ghost to me and it doesnt make you a good person to criticize before you improvise doesnt necessarily make you a bad person either but the characteristics for heavenly into bads way haha but since i am human i am good and bad as well but i try my hardest to stay good threes other things i do and say may be bad or just not to good but i do try so with that said i dont vote you i mean your only human good or bad but i also dont respect you and i dont care if thats good or bad you see you are no mlk you are no jesse jackson you are nobody to me your just another don king with a perm haha just a little more political and that just means youre a little un human then use humans and now let me be human and say fuck al sharpton and anyone like him fuck if you understand me i love being misunderstood ha ha why cause i live in the suburbs but i come from the hood bring the hook

i dont give a f if you see me im just a soul whose intentions are good oh lord please dont let me be misunderstood whats understood aint gotta be explained so for those who understand meet dwayne for eight and a half months i gave ms cita pain now its young money baby keep the change my mama say f em and we the same so hello mothaf a you got some sheets to change and aint it funny how people change like easter sunday you know church fit then outfit bright pink and green chest look house lit bright pinky rings but that aint about this what you bout b excuse my french emotion in my passion but i wear my heart on my sleeve like its the new fashion what are you asking if i dont have the answer its probably on the web like im a damn tarantula but i know you dont understand cause you thought lil wayne was weezy but weezy is dwayne i was watching t v the other day right got this white guy on there talking about black guys talking about how young black guys are targeted targeted by who america you see one in every hundred americans are locked up one in every nine black americans are locked up and see what the white guy was trying to stress was that the money we spend on sending a mothaf a to jail a young mothaf a to jail would be less to send his or her young a to college see and another thing the white guy was stressing was that our jails are populated with drug dealers you know crack cocaine stuff like that meaning due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine police are only i dont want to say only right but s only logic by riding around in the hood all day and not in the suburbs because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood and you know the other thing is mostly found in you know where im going but why bring a mothaf a to jail if its not gon stand up in court cause this drug aint that drug you know level 3 level 4 drug s like that i guess its all a misunderstanding i sit back and think you know us young mothaf as you know that 1 in 9 we probably only selling the crack cocaine because we in the hood and its not like in the suburbs we dont have what you have why i really dont wanna know the answer i guess we just misunderstood huh you know we dont have room in the jail now for the real mothaf as the real criminals sex offenders rapists serial killers dont get scared dont get scared i know you saw one them sex offenders papers dont trip he live right on the end of yo block mhm yea that n live right down the street from you sex offender on the level three drug convicted ex con yea check em out watch you got you got a daughter son what you got ha ha yea you know what thats the good weed you know what i have a f ing daughter you understand me and why the f would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me aint the reason i live next door to him meaning he didnt rap his way to my f ing neighborhood he sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood you move him out bring him to jail for life and then you move in with a sex offender ha ha hey give me a paper ha ha is that a misunderstanding because i didnt understand it another thing let me take my glasses off cause i wanna see the reaction on there faces when i say this ha ha this is why i dont respect you and nobody like ya see youre the type that gets off on getting on other people thats not good no homo rather un human i should say i mean giving the fact that humanity were a good humanity rather to me is helping one another no matter your color or race but this guy and people like him theyd rather speculate before they informate if thats a word ha ha ha you know spec before check anyways meaning id much rather you talk to me first and see if you can lend an opinion before you link one just my thought of good humanity mr sharpton hold on i aint finished with you man na f that s hm hold on um mr sharp ton and anyone like you you dont know me so if your not going to try to then what you say or think about me are what ever i do is totally casper the friendly ghost to me and it doesnt make you a good person to criticize before you improvise doesnt necessarily make you a bad person either but the characteristics for heavenly into bads way ha ha but since i am human i am good and bad as well but i try my hardest to stay good threes other things i do and say may be bad or just not to good but i do try so with that said i dont vote you i mean your only human good or bad but i also dont respect you and i dont care if thats good or bad you see you are no m l k you are no jesse jackson you are nobody to me your just another don king with a perm ha ha just a little more political and that just means youre a little un human then use humans and now let me be human and say f al sharpton and anyone like him f if you understand me i love being misunderstood ha ha why cause i live in the suburbs but i come from the hood bring the hook in","Dontgetit","2008"
