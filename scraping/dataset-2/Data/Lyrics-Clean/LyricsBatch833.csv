"Pee Wee Russell Quartet","if you hear a song in blue like a flower crying for the dew that was my heart serenading you my prelude to a kiss if you hear a song that grows from my tender sentimental woes that was my heart trying to compose a prelude to a kiss though its just a simple melody with nothing fancy nothing much you could turn it to a symphony a shubert tune with a gershwin touch oh how my love song gently cries for the tenderness within your eyes my love is a prelude that never dies a prelude to a kiss though its just a simple melody with nothing fancy nothing much you could turn it to a symphony a shubert tune with a gershwin touch oh how my love song so gently cries for the tenderness within your eyes my love is a prelude that never dies a prelude to a kiss","Prelude to a Kiss","1965"
