about in the past when you were no more than a babe your father brought his young wife and you to this cottage they were a lovely couple but not lovely neighbors you see your mother was with child and she developed an unusual appetite she admired my beautiful garden and she told your father that what she wanted more than anything in the world was greens greens nothing but greens parsley peppers cabbages and celery asparagus and watercress and fiddleferns and lettuce he said all right but it wasnt quite cause i caught him in the autumn in my garden one night he was robbing me raping me rooting through my rutabaga raiding my arugula and ripping up the rampion my champion my favorite i should have laid a spell on him right there i could have turned him into stone or a dog or a chair but i let him have the rampion id lots to spare in return however i said fair is fair you can let me have the baby that your wife will bear and well call it square i had a brother no but you had a sister where is she shes mine now and youll never find her small price to pay for what else your father stole from me it cost me my youth my beauty my mother warned me she would punish me with the curse of ugliness if i ever lost any of them lost what the beans beans the special beans id let him go i didnt know hed stolen my beans i was watching him crawl back over the wall then bang crash a lightning flash well thats another story never mind anyway at last the big day came and i made my claim oh dont take away the baby they shrieked and screeched but i did and i hid her where shell never be reached and your father cried and your mother died when for extra measure i admit it was a pleasure i said sorry im still not mollified and i laid a little spell on them you too son that your family tree would always be a barren one how could you do that and when your mother died your father deserted you your father was no father so why should you be so theres no more fuss and theres no more scenes and my garden thrives you should see my nectarines but im telling you the same i tell kings and queens dont ever never ever mess around with my greens especially the beans yeah but why do

second album in higher than a motherfucka drunker than a motherfucka with my boys and im thinking damn man 5 years ago we were dead broke chilling in cleveland everyday and the next thing you know people are calling us about record deals and you know the crazy part is ashleigh rented this white nissan altima for me and slim so we could drive out to new york i think she had to some work some shit or something like that so she couldnt go so we were gonna go out there and see what these labels were talking about and im driving us there but my licenses suspended so i tell slim im like yo i gotta pull up before we get to new york and switch so you can drive in case we get pulled over cause we got pulled over the last time we went there but you know he had a license so it made sense for him to drive so cut to like 7 and a half hours later i pull over in this emergency lane and right as im opening the door to switch with slim boom this fucking car going full speed on the highway swerves off the road and smashed into us yo i swear to god i woke up half my bodys laying outside the car in a ditch like 15 20 feet away from where we just were the car was totaled the windows were smashed it was cold as fuck it was raining outside but we were we were actually okay i mean my boy had to go the hospital you know the ambulance came and shit he ended up being alright but our meetings with the record label started at 2 and we didnt have no car and now we were stuck in a fucking hospital in new jersey so this dude that i ended up partnering with later on his names james mcmillan he comes and gets us to these meetings and shit somehow someway i dont know if it was just because we just got into a crazy car crash and couldve died a couple of hours ago but im in there and like you know im not feeling this shit man im not feeling this record label shit and a we drove back to cleveland now im back in ashleighs moms basement im thinking about life you know im on a shit ton of vicodin cause the doctors at the hospital you know gave us something cause we got into that car accident and ashleigh runs downstairs and shes like yo yo kells kells youre not gonna believe who wants to talk to you right now im like who shes like hes gonna call you in 30 seconds now i guess when i was in new york i had made some kinda noise cause this dude named byron who ended up becoming my manager later on took this video i had called chip off the block over to bad boy and showed harve pierre and harve pierre went and showed that vid to a guy named puff so i answer my phone depressed down fucked up on vicodin and i hear please hold i have mister sean combs for you i said god damn lifes about to change man i felt it and sometimes thats all it takes its just that
