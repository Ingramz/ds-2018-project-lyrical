Sam Butera,"On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I cant wait to get on the road again

On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again
And I can't wait to get on the road again

On the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way, is on the road again

Just cant wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I cant wait to get on the road again",On the Road Again,1996
Sam Butera,"Unforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more
Unforgettable in every way
And forever more, that's how you'll stay
That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Unforgettable,1996
Sam Butera,"There never was a gal I could love, like I love my Josephine
She's a flirt, she's a scamp, she's the vampiest vamp I've ever seen
It seems to me she's always flirting with the fellows passing by
But when I say she winks, then she tells me she thinks
There's a cinder in her eye
I believe it would be better if I'd leave her and forget
Everybody says it would be wise
But each time that I go out to dance with somebody else
I find myself dancing with tears in my eyes
For there's nobody quite so nice who can be quite so mean 
As my gal, what a gal, Josephine
 
There never was a gal I could love, like I love my Josephine
She's a flirt, she's a scamp, she's the vampiest vamp I've ever seen
It seems to me she's always flirting with the fellows passing by
But when I say she winks, then she tells me she thinks
There's a cinder in her eye
I believe it would be better if I'd leave her and forget
Everybody says it would be wise
But each time that I go out to dance with somebody else
I find myself dancing with tears in my eyes
For there's nobody quite so nice who can be quite so mean 
As my gal, what a gal, Josephine
",Josephine,1998
Sam Butera,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1998
Sam Butera,"Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

Wake up in the mornin' fix you somethin' to eat,
'fore I go to work I even brush your teeth
Get home in the evenin' and you're still in bed
Got yourself a rag tied 'round you're head.

Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

I'm tellin' you baby you'd better change your ways
I'm tellin' you baby I mean what I say
Last time tellin you to stop that jive
Gonna find yourself outside

Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

Last time tellin' you baby you'd better change your ways
Last time tellin' you baby I mean what I say
Last time tellin you to stop that jive
Gonna find yourself outside

Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you",Sick and Tired,1998
Sam Butera,"There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

I'm going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in my garden
I'm going to pick that rose 
And watch her as she grows in my garden

Sam Butera,"Oh! They say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune,
One that they could croon 
As only they can.

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro.
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began:

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues.

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail,
And they played that 
As part of the blues.

From a whippoorwill out on a hill,
They took a new note,
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note.

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it,
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Be Mine (Little Baby),1999
Sam Butera,"There's a boy that's in our band
And how he blows that horn
Finest since you're born
When he starts you're gone
They all call him ""Hot Lips"" for
He blows real red-hot notes
And ev'rybody on the floor just floats
(That's what they say)
 
He's got hot lips when he plays Jazz
He draws out steps like no one has
You're on your toes and shake your shoes
Boy, how he goes when he plays Blues
I watch the crowd until he's through
He can be proud they're ""cuckoo,"" too
His music's rare you must declare
The boy is there with two hot lips
 
He's got hot lips when he plays Jazz
He draws out steps, like no one has
You're on your toes, and shake your shoes
Boy, how he goes when he plays Blues
I watch the crowd until he's through
He can be proud they're ""cuckoo,"" too
His music's rare you must declare
The boy is there with two hot lips
 
Heard him play the other night
And old man Oscar Clive who is eighty five
Sure as you're alive
Got so frisky when he started out to do his stuff
Was told to sit right down for being rough
(And then he said)
 
He's got hot lips when he plays Jazz
He draws out steps, like no one has
You're on your toes, and shake your shoes
Boy, how he goes when he plays Blues
I watch the crowd until he's through
He can be proud they're ""cuckoo,"" too
His music's rare you must declare
The boy is there with two hot lips
",Hot Lips,1999
Sam Butera,"You've heard all about your raggy melody
Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through
There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band
You've heard of the tisket and tasket it's true
But give a little listen to this will you?
 
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
That's a funny little bit of melody
It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
 
Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing
It's ragtime but it still can swing
It ain't a turkeytrot or a shimmey onestep
But when grandma danced to it
She thought she was hep
It still is a ditty 
I'm sure you will find
Will keep a runnin' 'round and around your mind
 
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da

Sam Butera,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,1999
Sam Butera,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way,1999

I need your honey love

I want it, I want it when the lights are low
I want it, I want it just before you go
I want it, I want it because I love you so
Have a little of mercy and give some honey love

Now throw your arms around me
Pretend that you're lovey-dove
Now you squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze
Squeeze, squeeze, ooh, squeeze
That's a honey love

I'm gonna get it, get it in the morning sun
I'm gonna get it, get it when the day is done
I'm gonna get it, get it 'cause it's so much fun
I'm gonna get me some honey love

Yes, I love it, I love it 'cause it feels so fine

Sam Butera,"I have often walked down this street before
But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before
All at once am I several stories high
Knowing I'm on the street where you live

Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

And oh, the towering feeling just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling that any second you may suddenly appear

People stop and stare, they don't bother me
For there's nowhere else on earth that I would rather be
Let the time go by, I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live",On the Street Where You Live,1999
Sam Butera,"When ever we kiss,
I worry and wonder.
Your lips may be near,
but where is your heart?

It's always like this,
I worry and wonder.
You're close to me here,
but where is your heart?

It's a sad thing to realize 
that you've a heart that never melts.
When we kiss, do you close your eyes,
pretending that I'm someone else?

You must break the spell,
this cloud that I'm under.
So please won't you tell, darling,
where is your heart?
",The Song from Moulin Rouge (Where Is Your Heart?),1999
Sam Butera,"Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose

When you kiss me, Heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose

When you press me to your heart
And in a world apart
A world where roses bloom

And when you speak 
Angels sing from above
Every day words 
Seems to turn into love songs

Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be 
La vie en rose",La Vie en Rose,1999
Sam Butera,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine

Same old tingle that I feel inside
And then the elevator starts it ride
Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide

I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name and I'm a flame
Flame, flame of desire
That only your kiss (put out the fire)

For you're the lover I have waiting for
Your the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love

In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love

I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name and I'm a flame
Flame, flame of desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

For you are the lover I have waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in

Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Ev'rybody's got the fever
that is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night

And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, Julie baby, you're my flame

Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever, I'm afire
Fever, yea I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said Daddy-o don't you dare

He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight

Oh daddy, won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade

They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle

What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn",Fever,2009
Sam Butera,"Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me
Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me

Dispenser man, if you please
Serve my chick a mess of calories

Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me

Slip back the lid, scoop everything in sight
Make it a rainbow of red, brown and white
Chocolate chip and everything that's nice
Tutti-frutti once and spumoni twice

Banana split for my baby
And a glass of plain water for me

Spray the whipped cream for at least an hour
Pile it as high as the Eiffel Tower
Load it with nuts, about sixteen tons
Top it with a pizza just for fun

Banana split for my baby
And a glass of plain water for me
Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me

Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me

Stack her up with crazy goo
'Cause that's the stuff she likes to wade right through

Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me

Now add the cherries the kind she loves to munch
Skip one banana, use the whole darn bunch
Drown it in fudge, six or seven cans
Give her two spoons, she'll eat it with both hands

Banana split for my baby
And a glass of plain water for me

Separate checks, it must be
Charge the split to her, the water to me

Oh the banana split's for my baby
And the glass of plain water's for me
Ain't got no money
The glass of plain water's for me

Sam Butera & the Witnesses,"I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere.",A Foggy Day,

And you were the only boy

Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine

Same old tingle that I feel inside

Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide

I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name and I'm a flame
Flame, flame of desire
That only your kiss (put out the fire)

For you're the lover I have waiting for
Your the mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go
Round and round I go

'Cause that's the stuff she likes to wade right through

Banana split for my baby
A glass of plain water for me

Now add the cherries the kind she loves to munch
Skip one banana, use the whole darn bunch
Drown it in fudge, six or seven cans
Give her two spoons, she'll eat it with both hands

Banana split for my baby
And a glass of plain water for me

Separate checks, it must be
Charge the split to her, the water to me

Oh the banana split's for my baby
And the glass of plain water's for me
Ain't got no money
The glass of plain water's for me

Came and went, hindbells spent, b-b-b-b-bent

Sam Cooke,"Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day

Are still around us

That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1963

When he don't know his way around

We were more than sweethearts,

Everybody knows you left me,

To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?

Describe the day you played Berlin
We rehearsed and then we walked about
We ate bratwurst and sauerkraut
That night at ten o’ three

Were you inside the portrait gallery
From ten o’clock to ten o’ four
Was when we did the show encore

Hmm, Frog we've got our doubts
Can you confirm your whereabouts
My alibi is watertight
The audience saw me sing all night

Monsieur we know you did the crime
I was on stage that whole time
Ask who sang Rainbow Connection

Thank you Kermit, no more questions
Hello, I think it’s time for good cop, romantic cop

Miss Piggy, you could end up locked inside
Now’s your chance to save your hide
Gentlemen, I did not know
It’s a crime to steal the show

Tell us how the art was taken
If you want to save your bacon
I haven’t seen your missing art
All I've stolen is audience hearts

We can give you a plea deal
All you have to do is squeal
I’m not a thief, I don’t know how
All I've ever taken is a bow

We’ll catch the swine that did this job
Give up the pig puns, creep
Go jump in a lake, that’s my suggestion
Thank you Piggy, no more questions

I think she likes me
I don’t think your puns are helping the investigation
You know, I think they did it
No they didn't
Yes they did, and we can pin it

If they did, how did they do it
If they didn't, how did they didn't
If they didn't then it’s easy, ’cause they simply didn't do it
If they did it, then I knew it, but we've nothing that can prove it

Oh, excuse me
Uh
Bring in the purple guy with the shnozz
Do you remember what you did
On the night you played Madrid?

I was hit by a raging bull
And rushed off stage to the hospital
Gonzo, what do you know
About the sculpture theft at Madrid’s Prado
I never saw the stolen busts
I spent the night in bed concussed

The truth Gonzo, the clock is tickin’
If you don’t believe me, ask the chicken
Camilla was there, she’ll co-operate
Madam, are you willing to corroborate

Bawk bawk begawk, begawk gawk gawk
Will someone get this chicken out of here
Calm down Camilla, it’s a routine inspection
Thank you Gonzo, no more questions
Let’s go from the start
What do you know about the stolen art

I didn't know there was a plan
Your accusation is far out man
The chances of us committing a crime
Are less than .009

Shern de shern de herf
Sher de chicky en de farney hug

To help with our investigation
Can you do a full translation

What the chef just said to you
Was schnoop do schnnop do schnook
It’s not Swedish

Argh
Wank wank wank
I can do an Elvis impression

Thank you Muppet's,no more questions
They didn't
No, they didn't
There’s no way they did the crime
They couldn't they’re too stupid
They’re not criminal masterminds

We do not know who did it, but we know who didn't do it
So we know who didn't do it yes we know who didn't do it
They’re incapable of being culpable",Interrogation Song,2014

So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,1999
Sam Hinton,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

And we don’t got the spirits, at least we could condone it
Order sake homey, I be sipping Thai Ku
And you get the wrong number if I don’t like you

Say I’m the man, tell me why I gotta lie too?
Anybody I’m the best, girl let me advise you
Why? Because I’m feeling invincible
Junior high school I had a crush on the principal
I guess I was turned on by the leadership

The good girls at home sleeping, while I'm out creeping 'til the sun comes up
Ooh I’ve got my phone faced down, and my hair combed back,
Riding round getting good at the game
Saying the wrong things right, chasing midtown girls holding hands and forgetting their names

Sam Hunt,"Snap backs and Levi jeans,
P.B.R. and burnt CDs
Running for the grass on the hot concrete
Still working on our summer feet

Cheap gas and ready ice,
Trunk music and headlight fights
Dodging the smoke from a riverbank fire
A pretty girl and a pickup line like
""Hey what's your name, you know smoke follows beauty, baby""

We stayed up all night long
Made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water
In the middle of the night
Like oh oh oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in
Stompin' on the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it (Raised on it)
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it

Car wash at the custom tent
Sticky quarters and pine tree scent
The only sign that we ever got stuck
Is the muddy chain in the back of the truck

5-1's with a 20 on top
Three guard at the barber shop
Duckin' from your ex at the 4-way stop
Turn the music down when you're passing the cops

We stayed up all night long
Made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Ropes swinging into the water

Like oh oh oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in
Stompin' on the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it (Raised on it)
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it

Mama's prayers and daddy's speech
Front porch philosophies
A little too young and dumb to see
Just what it all meant to me

(Oh oh oh oh oh) Breaking hearts and curfews

(Oh oh oh oh oh) Fireball headed for the parking lot

Sam Hunt,"I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves

Like they don't want me to know

For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, but she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road

It was a summer full of grease and changing parts, but when we
Finally got that thing to start

Breaking in a brand new record on an old back road
When that first slow love song came on

Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove

Sam Lakeman,"After the morning there comes an evening
And after the evening another day
And after a false love there comes a true love
I'd have you listen now to what I say

I swear my love is the finest young man
As fair as any the sun shines on
But how to save him, I do not know it
For he has got a sentence to be hung

As he was marching the streets of Derry
I own he marched up right manfully
Being much more like a commanding officer
Than a man to die upon the gallows tree

""What keeps my love so long in coming
Oh what detains her so long from me
Or does she think it a shame or scandal
To see me die upon the gallows tree""

He looked around and he saw her coming
And she was dressed all in woolen fine
The weary steed that my love was riding
It flew more swiftly than the wind

Come down, come down from that cruel gallows
I've got your pardon from the king
And I'll let them see that they dare not hang you
And I'll crown my love with a bunch of green",The Streets of Derry,2014
Sam Lakeman,"It being in the springtime and the small birds they were singing
Down by yon shady harbour I carelessly did stray
The thrushes they were warbling, the violets they were charming
To view fond lovers talking, a while I did delay

She said, my dear don't leave me all for another season
Though fortune does be pleasing I'll go along with you
I'll forsake friends and relations and bid this Irish Nation
And to the bonny Bann banks forever I'll bid adieu

He said, my dear don't grieve or yet annoy my patience
You know I love you dearly the more I'm going away
I'm going to a foreign nation to purchase a plantation
To comfort us hereafter all in America

Then after a short while a fortune does be pleasing
“Twill cause them for to smile at our late going away
We'll be happy as Queen Victoria, all in her greatest glory
We'll be drinking wine and porter, all in America

If you were in your bed lying and thinking on dying
The sight of the lovely Bann banks your sorrow you'd give o'er
Or if were down one hour, down in yon shady bower
Pleasure would surround you, you'd think on death no more

Then fare you well, sweet Craigie Hill, where often times I've roved
I never thought my childhood days I'd part you any more
Now we're sailing on the ocean for honour and promotion
And the bonny boats are sailing, way down by Doorin shore",Craigie Hill,2014
Sam Lakeman,"Last night I dreamed my head was in fever
Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star

I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star

The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star

Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star

I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star

I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star

Sam Lazar,"They say, Ruby you're like a  dream
Not always what you seem
And though my heart may break when I awake
Let it be so
I only know, Ruby, it's you
 
They say, Ruby you're like a song
You don't know right from wrong
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me
But from the start, who stole my heart?
Ruby, it's you
I hear your voice and I must come to you
I have no choice what else can I do? 
 
They say, Ruby you're like a flame
Into my life you came 
And though I should beware
Still I don't care you thrill me so

Sam Lee,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1988

He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,

One could not walk,

The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;

The whole world smiles with you,

Sam Lee,"Young man came from hunting faint, tired and weary
What does ail my Lord, my dearie?
Oh, brother dear, let my bed be made
For I feel the gripe of the woody nightshade

Men need a man would die as soon
Out of the light of a mage's moon
But it's not by bone, but yet by blade
Can break the magic that the devil made

And it's not my fire, but was forged in flame
Can drown the sorrows of a huntsman's pain

This young man he died fair soon
By the light of a hunter'e moon

Some people quietly reveal
In the manner of the meek
Some people shout the way they feel

While others hear another call

Everybody's got a seed to sow
let your heart of hearts
Take you down the road

With different feelings to evoke
Giving distinction to the role
Different players-different strokes

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

Pushed it through a horn

Long nights and Advil for the next day

The worst thing to happen to you, in the best way

A good girl, but you're scared that it's bad to do it

Welcome to my world, let me walk you through it
If you step inside the Matrix, ain't no dodgin' bullets
Ain't no fairy-tale, welcome to the darker side
Moon rocks, a glass of water, now she on a ride

To tell you I love you
You showed me what true friendship means

This life is rough

You shared your strength

And I want you to know

You help me to grow
I thank you

You were there, helped me make it through

Sam Milby,"*I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May

I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

I've got so much honey
The bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees

I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Ooooh...

I don't need no money, fortune or fame
I've got all the riches, baby
One man can claim

I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl (my girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl (my girl)

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May

Hey, Hey, Hey
Hey, Hey, Hey

Sam Milby,"Only you
Can do make all this world seem right
Only you
Can do make the darkness bright
Only you and you alone
Can feel me like you do
And do fill my heart with love for only you

Only you
Can do make all this change in me
For it's true
You are my destiny
When you hold my hand I understand
The magic that you do,
You're my dream come true
My one and only you

Only you
Can do make all this change in me

Sam Moore,"Coming to you, on a dusty road
Good loving, I got a truck load
And when you get it, you got something
So don't worry, 'cause I'm coming

I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man

Got what I got, the hard way
and I'll make better, each and every day
So honey, hey, don't you fret
'cause you ain't seen nothing yet

I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man

I was brought up, on a side street
Learned how to love, before I could eat
Hey, I was educated, from good, good stock
When I start loving I just can't stop

I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man

Grab the rope, and I'll pull you in
Give you hope, and be your only boyfriend
Ya, ya ya ya!

Sam Moore,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree

Sam Moore,"Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world",Rainy Night in Georgia,1994
