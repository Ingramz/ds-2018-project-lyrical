Ciara,"Come enjoy the life
Baby, take a ride
I just wanna vibe with you, you
Baby, you and I can have a good time
Tell me what you like
Oo, oo

Now, listen
I've been single for a while now
And I've been kind of lonely
But I'm looking for somebody to talk to
Love me, someone who can hold me
Is that you?

I'm looking for somebody I can call boo
Looking for the only one that I can give my all to
Tell me if it's you, you, you
What you wanna do, do, do?
Make your move
You can be my teacher
I'll do homework
You can give me extra credit, baby
I'll do more work
What you wanna do, do, do?
Now it's me and you, you, you
The mood

This mood is so right
It feels so right
You can be my prince
My knight
You can be my Superman
Save me, here I am

'Cause, baby
There's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy
There's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy

You and me together
Picture perfect
I'll spend all my money all my time
Because you're worth it
It's just me and you, you, you
What you wanna do, do, do?
Make a move
Call me mama, spoil you like a baby
Thinking about you, dreaming about you
Got me going crazy
What you wanna do, do, do?
Now it's me and you, you, you
The mood, yeah

This mood is so right
It feels so right
You can be my prince
My knight
You can be my Superman
Save me, here I am

'Cause, baby
There's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy
There's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy

I mean everything that I say
From the bottom of my heart
I will never, never, ever hurt you
I open my heart

Open my heart
Give it to you
Tell the whole world that I'm in love with you
Whatever you want
Baby, I'll do
I know I don't want nobody else but you

'Cause, baby
There's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy
There's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy",Promise [Main],2006

I feel it, it's in me tonight
I see this tonight, I'm pulling up
I see him, he's walking out
He gives me the eye, and he's a thug
Today I'm 21
I'm legal hey, and I'm free to run
That's the one I met this morning
Pulling me to the floor wanna get to know me

[Bridge]
I'm ready to have fun-lets bang the thing up
But you gotta be prepared to get your weight up
See I'm off the chain since I came up
In the ATL is where it came from

[Chorus]
Bang it up boy goin' bang it up
I'm full grown now you can go tear it up (bang it up)
Bang it up boy goin' bang it up
Last one I had on the floor couldn't do enough (bang it up)
Bang it up boy goin' bang it up (bang it up)
Bang it up boy goin' bang it up (bang it up)
Don't talk about it boy be about it
If you got it we can see about it shorty what's up

Wait a minute, no he didn't
Y'all the DJ tried to slow it up
Oh my bad, he didn't
All he did was switched it up

See that, now you see that
Cause this brother might make me start acting up
That might make me start showing a side of me
That ain't nobody here seen before

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

I see you out on the floor
Actin' like you want more-never seen me before
You like it-you know it don?t ya
You said you wanna know-what's taking me so long
Since you've been patient- boy, you've got the right to?

Ciara,"You know, it's been a while since I felt like this
The last time was high school
But this feeling I think he's so cute
I want to tell him so bad-but I can't
C.R.U.S.H.
Yeah I got one really bad
This is how he makes me feel

He puts the beat in my heart
Every time I see him, thoughts are getting deeper
And I knew from the start yeah, from the ""Hi"" and ""Nice to meet ya""
I was blinded by he's features.
Girls said ""You're wrong"", but I said
She said ""Ci your in love"", but I said

C is for your confidence, boy I love the cool in you
R is for rumors they make, I wish that they were true
U, you put a smile on my face, you're unforgettable
S is for your sexiness
H I thought I had it
I gotta crush on you, I love me some you
A big crush on you, I love me some you
A big crush

He knows the right things to say hey
I can't help but pay attention to everything he says
He says he has fun with me
It's been a while since he could do this, tell me what does it mean?
My girls say ""you're gone"" but I said
They say ""Ci your in love"" but I say

C is for your confidence, boy I love the cool in you
R is for rumors they make, I wish that they were true
U, you put a smile on my face, you're unforgettable
S is for your sexiness
H I thought I had it
I gotta crush on you, I love me some you
A big crush on you, I love me some you
A big crush

I can't control how I'm feeling inside, I'm off the meter
He's always on my mind, been a while since I felt this way
I don't know what to say, when I see him
I get the chills when I look in his eyes, he's so beautiful
He's everything and more, when I see him every day
Hoping he feels the same, am, am-he's a keeper

C is for your confidence, boy I love the cool in you
R is for rumors they make, I wish that they were true
U, you put a smile on my face, you're unforgettable
S is for your sexiness
H I thought I had it
I gotta crush on you, I love me some you
A big crush on you, I love me some you

Ciara,"I'm focused, man

You should know this, man

Yes, one dose of me will have you addicted
To know me is to love me; I handle my business
Any city, any town; touch down, I do my thing
I'm a hustler, baby; I provide by any means
I'm a great conversationalist; you should know what I'm about
When you look at me, baby, you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley that's on
Out the headache and stress you done been through before

It's only been three months and I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on comin' back
My girlfriends telling me I don't know how to act
But I'm tellin' them, baby, bye, fall back
He's so good, and he knows how to love me
But so hood, and he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude, and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say:

That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Padding on his chest (uh-huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
Cause I am what he wants, his girl and I love it

I can't leave him alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone
I can't leave him alone
I tried that game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone

So when I had a good guy, he didn't do that much for me
Tried to be hard but that he could never be
Always tell me that no one could compare to me
But couldn't matter when other guy was starin' at me
Now the time plays back so everyone could look at me
From the A to hill up in Beverly
He's so fly that he knows how to carry me
First class, when they talk, we don't hear what they say

That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Padding on his chest (uh-huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
Cause I am what he wants, his girl and I love it

I can't leave him alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone
I can't leave him alone
I tried that game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone

The more I get, the more my ambition tells there's more
I'll move a A for that girl, I'll move ahead on that boy
Then I flip that (double up) kick back (cuddle up)
Ya friends try to confuse, but you know what
My intentions are good; I can't help it I'm hood
I wouldn't change if I could; you shouldn't tell me I should
Baby, you should take me as I am
And be happy you're my girl 'cause I'm happy I'm ya man

I can hear your call; it just takes one call
I'll come running, boy; I promise I will be there for you
All my heart, it belongs to you
I can't lose you, boy; I just can't leave you alone

I can't leave him alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone
I can't leave him alone
I tried that game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone

I can't leave him alone
I tried that good boy game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone
I can't leave him alone
I tried that game
But the dope boys turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that; I can't leave him alone",Can't Leave 'Em Alone,2006

Farewell
Hello, to the new me
The better me

That's right

21, and I've realized,
Everything you want's not meant to be.
21 then you qualify,
The stand up to responsibilities.
So I tried to prioritize
By deciding what I know is best for me.

And then there's always, love that tries to trip you up.
You try to catch yourself before you hit the ground, oh,
But nothings promised.
Friends are there to cheer you up,
To give you strength and build you up when you are down, oh,
So I set sail in motion

So long, farewell,
My life's moving forward.
My ship has sailed,
And I'm so glad it's over.
My heart mends well,
After all that I've been through
I found myself.

22, I hope that I'm,
With someone who truly cares for me.
If I'm not, I'll be alright,
I'll accept the time I know God has for me.
One day I'll be the perfect wife.
If That's my destiny (yeah)
And I won't be afraid to try
Though there's always

Love that tries to trip you up
But then someone who sweep you off the ground, oh
But nothings promised.
I'm not gonna give it up
Just because the last one let me down, oh

Taking care of my needs.
Life isn't guaranteed,
It's time to start living.
It wont always be the same,
Can't be afraid of change.
You wanna have your way,
Demand till you're satisfied
You lower your self esteem,
You gotta live your dream.
It's all about confidence,
So let them know that you can stand up.
You never try,
Learn to express you mind.
Sometimes you gotta fight,
It's your life so don't you give up.

Don't wanna be this way
But I'm hoping you can change
The way that I feel
(ooooo)you see
I trusted him with everything
Never held back anything
Thought we'd be 2gether for the rest of our lives
So suddenly he took his love away
And made it hard to trust again (oooo)

I know I been holding back
But he really hurt me bad
I don't wanna take my past

I'm not tryna hold you back
Really hope you understand

When I think of what he did to me

Gotta leave those things behind

Whatever's yours
You call it ours send flowers
With love you keep me showered
But so did my x-man at first
You see what started out so simple
All flew out the window
There I go comparing you to him again
It keeps holding me down (i gotta let it go)
I wanna give love a chance (but you may never know)
Baby you can be the the one for me
Yes the only one for me

To many mistakes in love I've made
I can't come with all this baggage

Close that chapter, close that book
Faith in love is all it ever took
That's why I never gave up and never gave in
'Cause I know true love is waitin' for me again

I know I been holding back

I'm a hustler baby I provide by any means
I'm a great conservationist, you should know what I'm about
When you look at me baby you should see a way out
Out the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley that's on
Out the headache an stress you done been through before

It's only been three months an I already got it bad
So hood that I keep on coming back
My girlfriend's telling me I don't know how to act
But I'm telling them baby bye fall back
He's so good an he knows how to love me
But so hood an he's so heavy in the streets
He's my dude and you better get used to things
And I don't care what you say about me
They say

That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Tatted on his chest (uh huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)
'cause I am what he wants his girl and I love it

So when I had a good guy he didn't do that much for me
Tried to be hard but that he could never be
Always tell me that no one could compare to me
But couldn't handle it when other guy was staring at me
Now the top lays back so everyone could look at me
From the A to hill up in Beverly
He's so fly that he knows how to carry me
First class when they talk we don't hear what they say

That he does it with the best, runs it in the west
Tatted on his chest (uh huh)
I like it (so what), I like it
And they say (that he's gonna hurt me)
Just wait and see (but they don't know me)

I tried that good boy game
But the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone
I can't leave 'em alone
I tried that game
But the dope boy's turning me on
It's just that he know what I want
So bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone

The more I get the more my ambition tells there more
I'll move an A for that girl I'll move ahead on that boy
Then I flip that (double up) kick back (cuddle up)
Your friends try to confuse but you know what
My intentions are good, I can't help it I'm hood
I wouldn't change if I could, you shouldn't tell me I should
Baby you should take me as I am
An be happy you're my girl 'cause I'm happy I'm your man

If he gets caught, it just takes one call
I'll come running, boy I promise I will be there for you
All my heart it belongs to you
I can't lose you, boy I just can't leave you alone

Everybody to the floor, why' 'cause this beat is sick, yeah
It's time to rock, uh, that's what it is

And the only way to play is with this promise ring

Sometimes a girl needs to know that she's
Appreciated for all the things she does
With some sorta token of love
'Cause without it her young heart won't know

And right then to my surprise, he
Pulled out a small velvet box, pink ribbon tied
I'm wondering what's inside
He opened it and then he replied

He said, I promise not to hurt you, I promise not to lie
I promise to befriend you and defend you with my life
I promise you forever, I promise you today, he said
Would you wear my promise ring' I said yes

If ya break ya promise we breakin' up
Got a couple things that I want
Walks in the park and sweet things

It was good to know I'm who he chose
It was your heart he felt now it shows, now it shows

You know when you see me floss
No way it's gon' get lost, I'll never take this off
I'm older and they call me by your name
I'll wear it on a chain, because I can hear you say

I promise to befriend you and defend you with my life
I promise you forever, I promise you today, he said
Would you wear my promise ring' I said yes

I can't feel face, tryin; to focus but my mind ain't right
I remember the party, the DJ, my homies, my man and me
But the rest of it's blurry,
Something I did made my baby go away

Got the same clothes on today
That I had on yesterday
What did I do, what I say

Lemme hear you make some noise

They say Ciara got the moves
Ciara got them curves

Now check that bobble on my finger so right, so right
Got the windows tinted but its catchin' the light, the light
Speakers thumpin' hard to that Tupac and 50 track
They runnin' to the corner yellin' who dat, who dat
(Run it back!)
On my shoe game, girl I'm a fool, a fool
Down to my Giuseppe's and the rims on my Rover too
Turned 22, nothin' smaller than 22's
Platinum on the plaque, I got two of 'em back to back
Run that back

Hello, hello
Talkin' bout that fly shit
Somethin' you can ride wit
Did you hear me?

And I know that I wasn't in the picture
Tried to paint it, looking perfect
And it never worked for the both of us
I'mma let you know, now I'll let you go

You should fly, for the first time in a long time
Just fly, let you go, let you go
Let you fly, for the first time in a long time
Just fly, let you go, let you go, oh

When I was at your house
I was sad, I was down
Tried to fix what we had
Didn't work, wasn't sure

And I know that I wasn't in the picture
Tried to paint it, looking perfect
And it never worked for the both of us
I'mma let you know, now I'll let you go

You should fly, for the first time in a long time
Just fly, let you go, let you go
Let you fly, for the first time in a long time
Just fly, let you go, let you go, oh

You should fly, for the first time in your own life
Just fly, let your real ambitions go
And fly, you should fly, for the first time in a long time
Just fly, fly, fly, fly",Fly,2015

Cried words I didn't know I knew
A lit a light, you still didn't see me
I swore I shine my way to you

Kiss me, hold me, touch me, tease me
You make love and you not easy
If only you could see
Could see what you do to me
I ain't second to nobody
Baby you should understand, it's
Either them or me

'Cause I'm not gonna be your one and only
Just when I'm the only one around
Your one and only
Just when I'm the only one
The only one around

Why do I, do I still want you (do I still want you)
After all of the things you do
I know you won't be committed to me
Tell me why I choose to stay
There ain't no one but myself to blame, oh

Kiss me, hold me, touch me, tease me
You make love and you not easy

Oh, as I went home on Monday night
As drunk as drunk could be
I saw a horse outside the door
Where my old horse should be
Well, I called me wife and I said to her
""Will you kindly tell to me
Who owns that horse outside the door
Where my old horse should be?"" 

Ay, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool
Still you cannot see
That's a lovely sow that my mother sent to me
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more
But a saddle on a sow, sure, I never saw before

And as I went home on Tuesday night
As drunk as drunk could be
I saw a coat behind the door 
Where my old coat should be
Well, I called me wife and I said to her
""Will you kindly tell to me
Who owns that coat behind the door
Where my old coat should be?""

Ay, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool
Still you cannot see
That's a woolen blanket that me mother sent to me
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more
But buttons on a blanket, sure, I never saw before

And as I went home on Wednesday night
As drunk as drunk could be
I saw a pipe upon the chair
Where my old pipe should be
Well, I called my wife and I said to her
""Will you kindly tell to me
Who owns that pipe upon the chair 
Where my old pipe should be?""

Ay, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool
Still you cannot see
That's a lovely tin-whistle, that me mother sent to me
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more
But tobacco in a tin-whistle, sure, I never saw before

And I went home on Thursday nigh
As drunk as drunk could be
I saw two boots beneath the bed
Where my old boots should be
Well, I called me wife and I said to her
""Will you kindly tell to me
Who owns them boots beneath the bed 
Where my old boots should be?""

Ay, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool
Still you cannot see
They're two lovely geranium pots me mother sent to me
Well, it's many a day I've traveled, a hundred miles or more
But laces in geranium pots I never saw before

And as I came home on Friday night
As drunk as drunk could be
I saw a head upon the bed
Where my old head should be
Well, I called my wife and I said to her
""Will you kindly tell to me
Who owns that head upon the bed
Where my old head should be?""

Ay, you're drunk, you're drunk you silly old fool

Ciarán Bourke,"As I was a goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
Saying ""Stand and deliver"" for he were a bold deceiver

[Chorus]
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy

[Chorus]

I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
But Jenny blew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter

[Chorus]

And 't was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken

[Chorus]

There's some take delight in the carriages a rolling
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
but I take delight in the juice of the barley
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early

[Chorus]

And if anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenney
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny

A grande ilusão do carnaval

Que o vento vai levando pelo are 
Voa tão leve 
Mas tem a vida breve 
Precisa que haja vento sem parar

É como esta noite

Ah, meu coração que nunca amou
Não merece ser amado

Vai meu coração ouve a razão
Usa só sinceridade

Far from your tranquil altitude

So high my heart can't bear the strain

Only to cause me pain

Aware of things your heart alone was meant to see

Don't fight the moon, the stars above and don't fight me

The third day in Milano
I was sitting in a chair
The point of my high heel was stepping on a man's shadow
The scent of his cappuccino was carried on the wind of Milano

It's a sliver of glass,
It is life, it's the sun,
It is night, it is death,
It's a trap, it's a gun

The oak when it blooms,
A fox in the brush,
A knot in the wood,
The song of a thrush

The wood of the wind,
A cliff, a fall,
A scratch, a lump,
It is nothing at all

It's the end of the slope,
It's a beam, it's a void,
It's a hunch, it's a hope

It's the end of the strain,
The joy in your heart

The foot, the ground,
The flesh and the bone,
The beat of the road,
A slingshot's stone

A fish, a flash,
A silvery glow,
A fight, a bet,
The range of a bow

The bed of the well,
The end of the line,
The dismay in the face,
It's a loss, it's a find

A spear, a spike,
A point, a nail,
A drip, a drop,

The shot of a gun

It's a cold, it's the mumps

The body in bed,
And the car that got stuck,
It's the mud, it's the mud

A flight, a wing,
A hawk, a quail,

and a cut in your toe

A point, a grain,
A bee, a bite,
A blink, a buzzard,
A sudden stroke of night

A pin, a needle,
A sting, a pain,
A snail, a riddle,
A wasp, a stain

A pass in the mountains,
A horse and a mule,
In the distance the shelves
rode three shadows of blue

And the riverbank talks
of the waters of March,
It's the promise of life
in your heart, in your heart

Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight

You, preacher man don't tell me
Heaven is under the earth
You a duppy and you don't know
What life is really worth

It's not all that glitter is gold
And half the story has never been told
So now we see the light
We gonna stand up for your rights

Come on, get up, stand up, brother
Stand up for your rights
Come on, get up, stand up, sisters
Don't give up the fight

Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight

'Cause you know most people think
A great God will come from the skies
And take away every little thing
And left everybody dry

But if you know what life is worth
Then you would look for yours on earth
And now we see the light
We gonna stand up for our rights

Come on, get up, stand up, don't make them push you 'round
Stand up for your rights
Come on brothers, get up, stand up
Be brave now, don't give up the fight

I say, get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Don't let them hold you down, get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight

We're sick and tired of this game of technology
Humbly asking Jesus for His mercy
We know, we know and we understand
Almighty Jah is a living man

You fool some people sometimes
But you can't fool all the people all the time
And now we see the light
We gonna stand up for our rights

Come on, get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Come on brothers, get up, stand up
I said, don't give up the fight
