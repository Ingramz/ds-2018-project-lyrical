The Grassmasters,"There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

So goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams

Where danger is double and pleasures are few, 
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.
It's a-many a man I have seen in my day, 
Who lived just to labor his whole life away. 
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard his wine, 
A man will have lust for the lure of the mines.

My body will blacken and turn into coal. 
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home, 
And pity the miner a-diggin' my bones.

Far away in a land that is fair.
Happy landings to you, Amelia Earhart
Farewell, first lady of the air.

Although the fuel within the tanks was low.
But they'd land on Howland Island to refuel her monoplane,
Then on their trip around the world they'd go.

The signal weak, but still her voice was brave.
Oh, in shark-infested waters her plane went down that night
In the blue Pacific to a watery grave.

Well, now you have heard my story of that awful tragedy,
We pray that she might fly home safe again.

We'll ne'er forget Amelia and her plane. Chorus

Said it, and it was true
But I can't have both of them
Don't know what to do

I see all kinds of sorrow
Wish I only loved one
Look out, here comes tomorrow
Oh, how I wish tomorrow would never come

I see all kinds of sorrow
Wish I only loved one
Look out, here comes tomorrow
Ohm how I wish tomorrow would never come

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He knows that they're the fools

Oh",The Fool on the Hill,
The Groovin' Strings and Things,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,
The Grouch,"Castin' my fears into the fire
The blue smoke arose
Time to get it movin' I suppose
Why the enchantment responds to Minister Earth

Plain existence
Follow these sentence structures
Fine art
In clothes his majesty stepped into the summit

My point has registered
One-thousand-nine-hundred-and-ninety-seven Legend Earth years to present
Passed beyond the heavens too many
Of a caliber emcees who rock well, tell it

Intelligence while we skip the hate
Trailin' off into the sunset
To test 'coherentness'
But comin' hell a fresh

While the rest seem effortless
Attempts imagine this
No wish, no storm, no wand, no spell
Magical times without a hail enhancin' the bliss
That you hear while you keepin' this in fear

[Chorus: x 2]
Magical times, we movin' on enchantment
Of musical minds, we be the strong lastin'
Everlastin'


Tell me, can you feel the magic?
We have it bottled and stored
Movin' forward with our swords made of tongue
All aboard, time to hear the ocean's roar

Collect the potion for the sky through which we soar
Has no walls
No boundaries
We fall through the atmosphere freely

See me with a tape in hand made from nothing really
But it includes my soul and my whole take on life
You can nod your head and make the magic shine bright
You don't need X-ray vision or a super power to be

The initial fee is seven, but after that it's free
It's like a tree, and I go deeper than what you see on the surface
Servicin' all; relax, quit feelin' nervous
Stand up tall, face the music

Take advantage, go 'head and use it
Profusion with the rest, and I feel the (unknown) just stupid
I have trooped with many groups through this land of the enchanted
Waiting for my turn to have my wishes granted

[Chorus: x 2]

At the beginning of this weakness was the foolish and the ultimate hope lost
Wanting to turn iron into gold to roll the Earth off
Of the same axis, to rotate throughout the gate
Causin' ripples of tide

And distortion of space-time continuum
I'm doin' somethin' also would hurt
So prepare for the work of a king
Minus perk I'm a jerk
Your far thought two and two upset to just rest on the pillow of death
And just rest

[Chorus]

Eclipse 427 beats plus magical speech
I hope you reach
The top
And Murs, you better not stop

Side-O.P., cast some spells lyrically
Big Shotz, it appears to me you have the magic
Arata and Asop, yeah, they have it

Eligh, makin' fools careers look tragic
Gonna bag it up and take it home
We got that shit sewn fit-formed to my palms
So everyone just sit calm

And it'll be over in a few
Mystic Journeymen, that's fam
I thought you knew
We all magic

Brad, Jeff, Leslie and my momma
We all magic
Even Bizarro's magic

The Grouch,"[Grouch] 
Every man's blood boils
When turmoil or life foils his plans
I've soiled my hands puttin' work in
Tryna keep from hurtin', cause fools be irkin' the fuck outta me
Now what do I gotta be, the epitome of nice?
Biterally precise when I talk
And assuming when I walk I never let the chip show
Cause people try and push it and they want to test my wits
So, I'm defensive, intense with my brain waves
And that's offensive, I sense so the pain stays close
Most don't depressurize
When I've had it up to where you can see it in my eyes
Realize there's no sanity
Hella profanity and a sort fuse to light
I snort and use the mic like a weapon
Effectin' any section I step in
Got 'em checkin' for the vibe that I'm protectin'

[Asop]
Who takes the time to look around?
That which surrounds makes the sound of compromise
Damn, they try to size up to such plateau's they'll never touch
Always talkin' about nothin', when you catch 'em, they always hush
Not much to be said, not enough to be heard when the words become absurd
When a voice of a gangsta starts to emanate from the 'burbs
Now anybody, everybody can try to rock a party
With that bump in your trunk, always drunk with your motions
With no devotion, collects an ocean of funds
In the worst way, idiots they stay this way
Me hella 'noid like a homophobic stuck in the middle of a gay parade
With no way to escape the confines of one's mind
A mental prison, a prism of thought
A crystalis of anger created by the action of strangers
A dangerous way to live your life the these days
Thinkin' he hella fresh though
A male emcee acting like a lesbo
Making one's life so stressful
That's why I escape with these with the ease of a hiatus in Fresno

[PSC]
A rusty nail in the foot
A cavity in the tooth
My threshold, the pressure build up, to me I'm aloof
And no proof of a cracking point
Mood swings like primates
Gorilla in the mist type range, I see all states
I King Kong shit, rip down the house structure
Like Empire State, the power will surely crush you 
As a pun on a radio edit, or nasty soda
I'm colder in the heart when the camel back breaks
No one seen the true beast, release him and danger follows
Like sequels to horror flicks, there's no tomorrow
No sun will come out, no Annie, no Daddy Warbucks
The Hard Knock Life begins when tempers flare up
An enemy will show no mercy, take it from Percy
And stop at No Limit until the bullshit's ended

[Eligh]
Rage, trapped in a cage
Wrapped in a page, you never change
Severed off from the vain
Not enough blood to complain
Rage enters the brain
Now it's a pain you can't maintain
Leaving friendships slain, always the other one to blame
Never to be the same, rage is just a game played
To someone less it runs deep on an unseen plain
Peep the problems of the average man when he's insane
Losing personality replaced by the devil's frame
Madness, uncanny love for the fact his life is lived in sadness
Can't handle the Silence so The Lambs get reprimanded
For the underhanded, under kept raging thunderclap
You're wondering ""What's that?""
It's the wrath of rage-aholics

[BFAP]
People playing games with my mind
Playing games every time that I find 
Confined to a world, disillusion mind
I'm losing my patience, losing time
Wasting my patience, you wasting time
Not facing who you are
Enraged in cages, enslaved in graves
We lay, relay, we play 
Beating on drums till the warrior battle comes
Native son chasing the moon in smoke filled rooms
Chasing hell to it's doom, boom
Like losing a check on payday
Holding a grip, it's stressful
It's not your fault, it never is
Whatever, I watch the fake, clever moves you make
Earthquake, alcohol makes a fire go crazy

At night you alone getting zoned
To the S, the you, the N, SPOT
Lighting shine from Oakland caught in a world of
Imagination can't be wastin' time
Drama can't be facin' climb on your honor
Don't lock me away I'm a gona
Cut that shit like benihana 'cause I ain't no chicken
Or no shrimp, I'm a large piranha 
With my ? steak
No matter what's on the menu, lasagna
Ain't gonna be comin' out my side
Runnin' from a homicide
If you want to ride why you still talking
Caught up in your pocket shit when you should be walkin
Yo back ain't worth my life
If you caught up in the hype
Livin' life with a genocide knife
You trippin'

Moments like this I want to see your bump your fist
Put a smile on your face don't be a chump and diss

Hit you like you're born again
Now sound the horn again it's on
The song to make you move on

Can't stay outside open the blind
Use your retina focus in
Live for the moment open it

Showin' signs like you heard it before
But for sure you'll drink my wallet dry
Then roll your eyes when I'm broke
That's why nope I got a girl now
You shall never be in my world like that no more
Get in war runnin' after runnin' 'cause you stop
Poundin' your business to hit the shores of the freak show
With a tense smellin' of indole and wine
The bearded lady who rhymes
Everybody rhyme now
Throw in the towel
You rhyme like a battle movement
I growl to move them
That's how I lose them

Kick snares and bass
Rules to the face
Race you to the finish but I'm takin' first place
Shakin' walls makin' presence known
Mackin' in the tackin'
Stackin' til its gone or on you know
Whether a navigator limo or a bucket fuck it
My whole life it's a demo
So learn where's Vern 
Who cares who stares
That's the payoff so layoff the shit talk
I can do anything
I can do anything
Pennies bring dollars my rappin' it cause hollers
Were all scholars 'cause I said so, shit
Makin' up a moment like this

After the fact moment passes
When you have no clarity
Maneuver passes carefully
One dead a time faithfully
Acin' a ho, successful
Watch where all the rest go
When its really time let go
They gotta keep it goin' strong
The water know when it's past rate
Through the darkness I'm a passer
In this moment I'm a master
Of momentum
In my cerebellum and my soul of plaster
Build universal housing for the time being

The Grouch & Eligh,"I'm the verbal-spit Smith & Wesson
I unload with sick spit
The quick wit could split a split-second
Bomb with a lit wick expression
You here a tick tick then you testin'
My saliva and spit can split thread into fiber and bits
So trust me, I'm as live as it gets
Everybody claiming they the best and they head the throne
Since B.I.G is gone, if you ask me, they ""Dead Wrong""
My flow is hotter than the flash from the click
When the hammer slaps the bullet on the ass from the clip
You wind up in a room full of my dogs
I'll have you feeling like a fire hydrant in a room full of dogs
So come, come now, get pissed on, shitted on
Tough talk turns to, ""Can't we all just get along""
You get blazed when the mic's off, shot when it's on
You probably ducked when they laid the gun shot in your song
My gun stutters when it speaks to you
Utter shit to repeat to you
Nothing the clip, then give a speech to you
Me and Premier, we kind of the same in ways
We both speak with our hands in dangerous ways
Rap now is a circus of clowns
A whole lot of lip from cliques I'd probably rap circles around
I'm the next best to reach a peak formerly known
As the best keep secret, I guess that I just leaked it

I provide the gun clapping a round of applause after your show
We can go toe-to-toe cause they calling you hot
Stepping around all your punches like, ""That's all you got?""
Everyday I'm meeting somebody and all of they peeps
Quick to shake a nigga's hand and show me all of they teeth
And these bitches I be patting they asses
They be all dumb and googly-eyed looking at me, batting they lashes
Rappers think Detroit niggas not as down as them
Or since I'm down with Slim that I sound like him
Quick to judge me and tell me that my hook might sell
And say faggot shit to me like I look like L
My advice quit talking it's over
I was knocking niggas out when you was knocking sticks off of their shoulders
I got dirt done in my past, I know y'all sweat
I got regrets older than some of you so called vets
Niggas say I found God with the flow
Bring the police to the studio and bring the bomb squad to the show
Ain't a nigga touching mines
When you listen to my shit - you don't chew, you don't breathe
You'll miss a fucking line

Up the 13 steps of the gallows walked the condemned man
And time passes very quickly when death is near
After having completed the first step, the condemned man knew there were but 12 left
Before he would meet death and his soul would leave his body
And after having completed the 13 steps the condemned man was met by a giant cloaked figure
And with a quick flick of the wrist the man was dead
And his soul left his body and went down down down
To a place we laughingly refer to as hell
But none of us will ever go there because we're all far too groovy
The man's body was left to rot on the gallows
And a great multitude of black birds came and picked the man's corpse apart
Piece by piece
Limb by limb
Until nothing remained
And his blood melted into the ground below

The gallows was made from a tree created by God
The man's blood dripped into the ground which was created by God
Even the giant cloaked figure which was the man's own end was created by God
Even the man's soul which went down was created by God
Even the black birds which picked the man's corpse apart were created by God
And where was God?

In Flanders Fields the poppies grow
Between the crosses row on row
To mark the dead

To Flanders Fields the hippies go
To smoke the poppies there below

and the genie in the bottle let me down,
I was raised on Cain, in the name of the Father and the Mother

On a windswept coast with the Black Knight falling 
I was heard to be calling that my ship and all its crew were going down,
As the sun ran slowly by a childhood rivulet a jeweled King summoned me, 
commanding that I run and tell the town,
Saw you, saw me, run quickly now,
Run and hide away,
Run and hide today.

In a room in a castle full of faceless lovers 
I was cut and bleeding and the image in the mirror struck me down,
I was chased and beaten by a well-drilled team of little men 
breathing colors and abandoned in a coffin in the ground,
As a pale young virgin made a meal of a martyr 
she was hailed as Holy by the only ones who stood and held their ground,
When a bright Mona Lisa with the eyes of a tiger read a new proclamation 
I was stricken from her list and never found,
Saw you, saw me, run quickly now,
Run and hide away,
Run and hide today.

Disappear like sunlight in the evening,
And they may not ever be explained.

The Guess Who,"Yeah, State vs. Kirk Jones, Judge Battle now residing 
Got a case of armed robbery that ended up in violence 
Maximum sentence, life in jail's what you're facin' 
Prosecution set it with your opening statement

Your honor, before we get started
I'd like to give my condolences to the family of the dearly departed 
Tyrone survived by his mother Barbara
His two year old daughter T'want to 
And the baby's mamma Sandra 
[He's a murderer! That animal killed my baby's father!]

Order in the court!

I'm sorry for the outburst your honor 
I have an original copy of the police report 
January the 4th the day that Kirk Jones got caught
The forensic report states there was a gun in the car 
And gunpowder residue on Mr. Jones' right arm 
Baliff, could you please pass this report to Judge Battle 
Mr. Fitzpatrick there's a few questions I'd like to ask you 
You said you was outside the store in Manhattan 
So could you please tell this court what you saw happened 

Yeah he killed Tyrone 
I saw everything, the argument, how son drawed, hose and everything 
The worst shit I saw in my life 
I want to testify I swear before God it was Kirk Jones, no lie 

Did you see that man in court today?
Do you think that you could point him out?

Yes that's him right there 

Are you sure?

Yeah without a doubt 
Same nigga that took my Pumas but I ain't hold no grudge 
Remembered his foul ass when I saw the blood 

You stated you had a run in with Kirk Jones before 
In your opinion is he the type that would rob a jewelry store?

Your honor, objection!
His opinion should be stricken from the record!

Objection sustained, prosecution next question 

I'd like to call my next eyewitness Mr. Paul Dejour 
Paul could tell us what happened inside the store?
(Scarred for life)
Yeah, it was about 20 past, I saw the S class 
Pull up in the reflection in the mirror in the store glass 
And quicker that you could say, nigga kiss my ass 
He hopped out of the passenger side wit a black ski mask 
I saw somebody run up in the store and order us on the floor 
Yo I swore I was a goner for sure 
He tried to snatch Tyrone's bracelet 
It just appraised to the twenty grand and Tyrone wouldn't let him take it 

Is that the moment when he shot him?
(Scarred for life)
Yeah man that's when he popped him 
I was so scared I laid there, played possum 
He started to blast this way, 'til the gat was empty 
He took the gun handle and broke the glass display 
He emptied all of the trays and ran out the store
And I watched Tyrone bleed to death on the floor 
I can't remember no more, that's all that... 

Okay, okay calm down 
I have no further questions your honor 

Court is now in session, now gettin' back to business 
Pat Haley for defense please call your first witness 

Yeah aight your honor, I call up Henry Lace
He's the witness that I'm cross examinin' for the case 

Yeah I testify your honor, it was death by dishonor 
It was a crime committed, I swear to you I know who did it 
It happened so fast, I didn't see a lot of it 
But I know for a fact he stuck a gun to his esophagus 

Wait, wait, wait objection your honor, his statement's preposterous 
There was no weapons found, no sign of no hostages 
Remember Mr. Henry Lace you under oath [yeah I know]
You lyin' in the stand to get him fryin' in the pan 
Now where was you the night you claim he shot Tyrone 
You and holmes had beef before Kirk got home 
Was you mad because he came home bangin' your chick [what you talkin' 'bout?]
Got your boys out the hood now they slangin' and shit 
I know you mad that's why you in court, turnin' on him 
Kirk cold blooded killer wit no burner on him 
Come on you don't believe he murdered Tyrone 
I believe you wasn't there you just heard it by phone 

Man you crazy man I was right there... (Yeah right... I read your rapsheet...
calm down, calm down, chill, chill, Kirk, Kirk...) 

No he wasn't! He's lyin! Fuck you you liar!
Man fuck that he's lyin he wasn't even there man!
(He killed Tyrone man! Fuck that!) No I didn't! 
Man he's lyin' man! He's lyin' 

Order in the court now I'm warning you defense 
Tell your client take it down, matter fact 'proach the bench 
Counsel in my chambers so that we can situate 
Let the jury be excused so they can go deliberate...

Yo man, Mr. Haley what kind of defense is this man!
What you doin' man?! She gon' fuckin' hang me man!
No! Sh-she's got it in for me I'm tellin' you man!
You promised you'd get me off man!

In the case of the State vs. Kirk Jones you heard it 
Both sides testified and the jury reached a verdict 
Guilty! All counts from theft to murder one 
(Huh? Wha-wha-what?! Guilty?!] 
By the time you gettin' out you gon' have a grandson 

Fuck you bitch I'll see you in hell bitch!
Fuck that!! Fuck that!! Fuck, get off me! Fuck you Pat Haley!!
(What?! Get him out of my courtroom!!)
Fuck the judge, fuck everybody!! 
(Baliff, baliff remove him from my courtroom...)
Fuck this shit!! I hope you all burn in hell!!!
You're gonna die bitch!! Fuck you!!!

You will spend the rest of your life in jail for this!
You will be held for contempt of court, and anything else I can find that....",State Vs Kirk Jones,2000

Just to have me a drink and look around
I went back with Deacon's daughter

Everything gonna be alright
And the sun's gonna shine tonight
Everybody gonna come my way
And we'll understand it all one day

He was drinking red liquor from the floorboard
Said he used to have a daughter
Now he don't want to think about it any more

We went flying down a two lane

She went down in yellow water
Now it's all in the world I can think about

Seem plush as down
And ripe enough for the luxor dream

How fluids will arrive
As if by call or schedule
Resume through the morning tide
Where entry is by seaweed gate
And plan the plan of dreams
To lose oneself in reverb
In all that is and all that seems

So ladies, fish, and gentlemen
Here's my angled dream
To see me in the blue sky bag
And meet me by the sea

To claim me back from the dead
The creatures back from vertigo
They fear to fall but haven't fell
Will reclaim tries and try again

The oyster boys are swimming now
Hear them chatter on the tide
Of the lost and language lost
Hear them chatter on the tide

And so do i
We understand, we understand
But fright is real
And so am i

So ladies, fish, and gentlemen

To see me in the blue sky bag
And meet me by the sea

Opens on the bay
An instant shape of mercury
Lost and then retained
An instant is an eyelash
Caught on the tide
Imaginos!
Below this bay
And then besides...

The oyster boys are swimming now
One deal is what we made
Forest keys and whirlwind cold
Green keys too and keys of gold
Even locks that won't explode
When the skies become a scroll
Having lost it's interest
See that's the deal we made
Just to join the oyster cult

And play tunes on it's belfry

Ten fingers have I to play them again
In decimal chains called mimicry
Whose notes will never, never fly
Until they quit those timely tunes
And enter that system from outside

The Guitar Orchestra of the State of Imaginos,"Cornwall and the harbor
Where witches went mad more than once and
Until this day
In dreams at least
The lighthouse at lost Christabel
Squat and hugely tilts
Upon the strand where granddad's house was built
And having stood the test of time
The starry gale the bloody tide
Grandad's house though gaped with hooks
And filled with books
Could stand no more until
A certain prophecy
Once read - now stood
Before the world fulfilled

Now of these books in granddad's keep
Some of them were new but mostly they were old
And the oldest was a scroll
A prophecy that read
When the riddle begins
The story will end

August the first 1892
And in the guise of destiny
Grandad quit Cornwall
I'm a captain of a ship
My ship is charmed, and called Plutonia.

Stories on land, storms at sea
'tween 1892 and '93
When grandad sailed for Mexico

Ships charmed and ordinary
Sailed the glidepath to the sun
And when the sun proved false
As it always does
Some of them would be lost
And some would sail back home
It was no star
But a magna of illusion
I mean by that
The mirror found
In the chamber of jade grown like a seed
Deep within the ground


The mirror found
By one man
So on and off again
He sailed the Europe's rim
On and off, off and on
Until his time had come

Through tears and smiles
The last domain
The rods of broken crystal
On and off, and off again
Until his time had come
Late to the story that had been
But early to the riddle not yet begun

August the first 1893
The charmed ship Plutonia
Sailed like a ray into Cornwall
And none too soon it seems

That night the captain's granddaughter
Would celebrate her birthday
I've come a long way, said the captain
From lost Christabel this night
Accompanied by my dog familiar
To blast your rafters with my surprise!
Granddaughter, it's a foreign mirror
Taken from the jungle by crime!

Stories on land, storms at sea
'tween 1892 and '93
When grandad sailed for Mexico

When tables collapse
And floors have filled
And the party's over, it's all over
Sea-dogs and rockers will dwell on doom
I've warped the stuff of ground
What seems to be is not
Behind closed eyes

More dark than night then

I broke down at the side of the road
Stranded at the outskirts and sun's creepin' up

Baby's in the backseat
Still fast asleep
Dreamin' of better days
I don't want to call you but you're all I have to turn to

What do you say
When it's all gone away
Baby I didn't mean to hurt you
The truth spoke in whispers will tear you apart
No matter how hard you resist it
It never rains when you want it to

You humble me lord
Humble me lord
I'm on my knees empty
You humble me lord
You humble me lord
So please please please forgive me

Baby Teresa, she's got your eyes
I see you all the time
When she asks about her daddy
I never know what to say

Heard you kicked the bottle
And helped to build the church
You carry an honest wage
Is it true you have someone keeping you company

What do you say
When it's all gone away
Baby I didn't mean to hurt you

I ever did see
Was lightning from the top of a cloud
Moving through the dark a million miles an hour
With somewhere to be

So why does it seem
Like a picture
Hanging up on someone else's wall

You want to be loved, but you probably can't make it anyway. 

Now the ground is cold and there's no fire around. 
An absence of fire and you're just cold. And I've seen this dog in my sleep. 
He chases my father too, when he dreams between the sheets. 
But, we all think it's time for you to quit. Take a last swig of that Cabernet. 

But, I tell you my friend I won't forget you. 
And the world's not clean, but they get mad when you're dirty.

And as the cockpit burned, her hair filled with sparks, but when the glass exploded in, everything went dark.

The Handsome Family,"There once was a poodle who thought he was a cowboy, 
But he lived in a cage the size of his thumb
And, though his white horse was a box of toothpicks, 
He galloped around until hit by a car
Sometimes I flap my arms like a hummingbird just to remind myself I'll never fly
Sometimes I burn my arms with cigarettes just to pretend I won't scream when I die
Sometimes I can't wait to come down with cancer
At least then I'll get to watch tv all day
And on my deathbed I'll get all the answers even if all my questions are taken away

Through parades and medals he felt no joy and took to his bed with a bottle of rum. 
The queen she arrived in her motorcade to give the good 
Dutch boy a commemorative pen, but he watched as the milkmaids all withered and grayed

The Handsome Family,"You are crouched before the fire
In a state park by the highway
And through the heavy pine trees
Ten-ton trucks go groaning by

Like the screams of your Aunt Barbara
Who went crazy in the '70's
Wrote poems to Jimmy Carter
But forgot to feed her kids

But, it's the first time you're together
Since he got out of the hospital
Raccoons in the darkness
Drag off your hot dog buns

But, you're happy just to lie there
In your plastic tent from Wal-Mart
Like sticks and fallen dead leaves
To feed the fire of the world

Because which is more important
To comfort an old woman
Or see visions of the heavens
In the stumps of fallen trees?

Albert Einstein trembled
When he saw that time was water
Seeping through the rafters
To put out this burning world

Next morning you're at Waffle House
Toast and eggs and hash browns
Truckers chain-smoke Camels
Over plastic cups of juice

And you remember how he cried
When they strapped him to the stretcher
Convinced his arms were burning
With electricity from heaven

You remember how he told you
That black holes were like Jesus
And the crucifix was a battery
that filled the air with fire",Lake Geneva,1996

Can't swim a full circle, 
The water's too cold
Burnt out cars in my fingers, 
Conveyor belts flow, right angles and steam whistles, 
Nothing can grow
A big-antlered deer stepping into the road, 
A beautiful woman with her head in the stove
The skyscrapers crumble heavy with rats
The wind's full of beer cans and whiffle ball bats
This fish in my stomach wears a full length mink, 
But his teeth float in sherry in a jar by the sink
He's the withered remains of Rin Tin Tin taking his new Cadillac out for a spin

Bury me here in the silvery mist
Bury me here with the spiders and fish

Tree sap slowly seeps
And the sunrise never come

The Handsome Family,"The Cathedral in Cologne looks like a spaceship
Like the hand of God falling from the sky
A thousand stone-carved saints hang like icicles
But icicles don't take hundred years to die

And everyone who ever worked on this Cathedral
Or even spent a moment walking by
Everyone of us is swept away like breadcrumbs
What comfort does it bring, soaring towers left behind

There's a fiberglass castle in Wisconsin
Where kids race go-karts around a moat
Once we went up there in December
When every water slide and fudge shop was closed

Hoping to feel love under the icicles
All we did was drink in an empty bar
But stumbling drunk we crawled back to our motel room
And I fell against you and felt your beating heart

And the moon shone hazy through the pines
But there were lounge chairs thrown into the empty pool
And a dog chained to a tree barking at the sky",Cathedrals,1998

Just like a blue gill, hook through its mouth

Cry for the dead deer surrounded by crows
You call me softly down in the dark
Down where the red worms circle like sharks
Down, down in the ground

Two lovers lay in the weeds
Safe in the net of their sweaty arms
Safe from the wind in the trees

My love, said the boy, you're the clear blue sky
You're the air I gulp to breathe
I feel you rushing through my vein
Like the wind rushing through the trees

My love, said the girl, you're my secret pearl
You're a string of tiny glass beads
You're a burning star I keep in a jar
Safe from the wind in the trees

Down in the valley of hollow logs
Two lovers lay back in the weeds
Listening to the howl of hunting dogs
And the wind howling through the trees

Then insects ran for the underbrush
As the wind fills the air with dead leaves
And every stone moved closer to dust
As the wind tore through the trees

So the young girl pierced her lily-white breast
Her blood poured over dark weeds
A silver dagger through her burning heart
Cold as the wind in the trees

So the boy picked up the bloody knife
And stove it through the chest
Farewell, farewell to the wind and the trees
I'll die with the one I love best",Down in the Valley of Hollow Logs,1998
The Handsome Family,"Last night I went out walking
Out on the edge of town
Not going no place special
Only wandering around

I came upon a river
I thought about what you said
And couldn't stop it flowing
And running through my head

You said that I've been changing
And never seemed to laugh
But I can't recall the last time you smiled
And it's tearing me in half

I want to run and tell you the thoughts that are in my head
But I don't think that you'd believe
A single word I said

The river's water runs so cool
It calms my burning skin
It takes away my aching thoughts
And cleanses all my sin

So let it flow on, take me down
To sleep that quiet sleep
And roll my body back to you
My love you may always keep",Last Night I Went Out Walking,1998
The Handsome Family,"My ghost drives around with a bag of dead fish
Falling neutrinos drift through the trees
He staggers and reels, runs up credit card bills

But I'm not going far till the Haldol kicks in

Legs wrapped around each other
My cheek against my sister's
We were born like tangled vine

We lived along the river
Where the black clouds never lingered
The sunlight spread like honey
In my sister's tiny hands

But while picking sour apples
In the wild waving grasses
Sister stumbled in the brier
And was bitten by a snake

Every creature casts a shadow under the sun's golden finger
But when the sun sinks past the waving grass
Some shadows are dragged along

Alone, I took to drinking bottles of cheap whiskey
And staggering through the back woods
Killing snakes with a sharpened stick

But still I heard her laughing
In those wild waving grasses
Still her tiny hands went splashing at the river's sparkling shore

So I took my rusty gas can
And an old iron shovel
I set the woods to burning
And choked the river up with stones

But when the sun sinks past the waving grass

Died from a blister on his toe
After walking all day through the first winter's snow

And he felt himself soaring up through falling snow
And the sky was a woman's arms

They spotted a sleeping swan
On the banks of a muddy stream
And they stormed it with rock still it collapsed in the reeds

Once I kissed your apple lips

Under creaking birch trees I would wait for you

The Handsome Family,"Chicago is where the woman downstairs
Starved herself to death last summer
Her boyfriend Ted ate hot dogs and wept
With the gray rats out on the fire escape

In a thrift store chair I drank cases of beer
And dreamed of laying down on the L tracks
The trains roared by under smoke-gray skies
Lake Michigan rose and fell like a bird

And when the wind screamed up Ashland Avenue
The corner bars were full by noon
And the old stew bums sliding down their stools
Ate boiled eggs and fed beer to the dogs

The woman downstairs lost all her hair
And wore a beret in the laundry room
I borrowed her soap and bought her a Coke
But she left it on a dryer

She died in June weighing eighty two
Her boyfriend went back to New York
The cops wandered through her dusty rooms
One of them stole her TV

Ate boiled eggs and fed beer to the dogs",The Woman Downstairs,1998

I sat there shaking in an empty lot 
Full of broken glass and weeds
Then past me in the darkness

In the air, in the air, someday I will live in the air

Whose skin smelled just like falling snow
One day she drove us off the road into a dead field of corn

I watched as the black ants crawled through his hands

A white bird sat sleeping on the broken pay phone
And up came a black beetle dragging off a green fly
Underneath a parked car and then out of sight

And I felt a dark eye turn its gaze upon me
As if the earth, the earth could see

A dark eye, a dark eye, a dark eye fell on me

In that parking lot where a prairie once grew
And through the tall grass, the buffalo flew
I heard something crying way down below
Where the sewer lines snake around Indian bones

In that parking lot, cars baked in the sun
And somewhere down the road, the pop of a gun
I watched a red ant crawl up my shin
And I felt so sad until it bit my skin

Outside cars are honking, flashing lights on the bridge
They're pulling a car out from the bottom of the frozen lake

A woman drove her Saturn into the black water
Killed herself and her two kids, strapped in the backseat
She'd lost her job and didn't want her kids to be poor

The diner is noisy, black coffee and sugar, baskets of dinner rolls
Outside the crowd is growing, waiting by the draw bridge
Hoping to see the dead ones face

In the booth next to me
There are two old women eating liver and onions
And they're laughing to loud and banging the table top
But then I see that they're deaf

I don't know why they're laughing
Maybe the worlds much nicer when you can't hear the cars
They make me feel better like I'm drunk on a plane
And have forgotten I'm afraid to fly

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

The Hank Mobley Quintet,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",That's All,1957

So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away

His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Where they love a gal by the cut o' her clothes
And I'll stand out

Or skirts that I've homespun
But I'll love ya' longer, stronger where

My bones denounce the buckboard bounce
And the cactus hurts my toes

In high silk hose and peek-a-boo clothes

The Harmonicats,"Frosty the Snowman was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the Snowman is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow but the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the Snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me, come on

Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Oh Frosty the Snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there, all around the square
Sayin', ""Catch me if you can!""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, ""Stop!""

Hey, Frosty the Snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye, sayin', ""Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day""

Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

The Harmonicats,"Hey, Dave, 'twas the night before Christmas we'll go!
Hi, boys, here I go!

'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
One, two, three, four, no, Dave, don't we wanna hear some more!

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had settled our heads for a long winter's nap,
When out on the lawn there a rose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.

Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon outside was shining on the snow
When the look will right on the ground below,
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More faster than eagles the reindeer came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;

""Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On Cupid! On, Donder and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my hand, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.

His eyes, how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His cute little mouth was just like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;

He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook, like a bowlful of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
""Merry Christmas to all, and good-night.""",The Night Before Christmas,1995

Comet and Cupid and Donder and Blitzen,
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose,
And if you ever saw it,
You would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names;
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas Eve,
Santa came to say:
""Rudolph, with your nose so bright,
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him,
As they shouted out with glee,
""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,
You'll go down in history!""",Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,1995

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I want to know it's more than love at first sight,

Can't seem to find somebody to care.
I'm on a lonely road that leads me nowhere,

And all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day;
I'm hoping to discover
A certain kind of lover--

To keep me warm when Mondays are cold,

With a crown made of tinsel
And glass beads on a wire

The Hawklords,"In case of sonic attack on your district, follow these rules
If you are making love it is imperative
To bring all bodies to orgasm simultaneously

Do not waste time blocking your ears
Do not waste time seeking a sound proofed shelter
Try to get as far away from the sonic source as possible

Do not panic, do not panic, do not panic
Do not panic, do not panic, do not panic

Use your wheels it is what they are for
Do not attempt to use your own limbs
Small babies should be placed inside the special cocoons
And should be left, if possible, in shelters

If no wheels are available metal, metal, metal, metal
Metal, metal, metal, metal
Not organic limbs should be employed whenever practical

Remember, remember, remember, remember
In the case of sonic attack survival means
Every man for himself, himself, himself, himself, himself, himself
Statistically more people survive if they think
Only of themselves, only of themselves, only of themselves

Do not attempt to rescue friends, relatives, loved ones
You have only a few seconds to escape
Use those seconds sensibly or you will inevitably die

Do not panic, do not panic
Think only of yourself, think only of yourself
Think only of yourself, think only of yourself

These are the first signs of sonic attack
You will notice small objects such as ornaments oscillating
You will notice [Inaudible]
You will hear a distant hissing in your ears

You will feel dizzy, you will feel the need to vomit
[Inaudible]
[Inaudible]

[Inaudible]
[Inaudible]
You may be subject to fits of hysterical shouting or even laughter

These are all sign of imminent sonic destruction
Your only protection is flight
If you are less than ten years old
Remain in your shelter and use your cocoon

If I remember you can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else
You can help no one else, no one else

The Hawklords,"I would've liked you to have been deep frozen too
And waiting still as fresh in your flesh for my
Return to earth
But your father refused to sign the forms to freeze you
Let's see you'd be about 60 now, and long dead
By the time I return to earth
My time held dreams were full of you as you were
When I left, still underage
Your android replica is playing up again
It's no joke
When she comes she moans another's name
But that's the spirit of the age, that's the
Spirit of the age
I am a clone, I am not alone
Every fiber of my flesh and bone is identical to
The others
Everything I say is in the same tone as my test
Tube brother's voice
And there's no choice between us, if you had ever
Seen us you'd rejoice in your uniqueness
And consider every weakness something special of
Your own
Being a clone I have no flaws to identify
Even this doggerel that pours from my pen
Has just been written by another twenty
Telepathic men
Word for word it says
""Oh, for the wings of any bird other than a
Battery hen""

I swear I'll come out of this, out of this.
You're losing your mind
No hope in sight
Promise you out of this.

Like the wind in the trees,
A cool summer breeze,
Like the curls in your hair,
Everyone stares at
The hole in the wall,
It's all in your head.
There's a memory there,
All through night.
Tried being cruel,
It's just not in me, it's just not in you.
Oh, tried being cruel,
It's just not in me, it's just not in you.
It's just not in me.

Now that we've come to the end
Find that we're right where we began

Now that we've come to the end
Find that we're right where we began

Now that we've come to the end
Find that we're right where we began

Now that we've come to the end
Find that we're right where we began

Tried being cruel,
It's just not in me, it's just not in you.
Oh, tried being cruel,
It's just not in me, it's just not in you.
Oh, tried being cruel,
It's just not in me, it's just not in you.
Oh, tried being cruel,
It's just not in me, it's just not in you.
It's just not in me.",Cruel,2013
The Head and the Heart,"It's a long way to the other room
While I'm grading papers and tying shoes
You never had much to lose
So I'm blaming you for these hopeless blues

What's to say when the kids are gone?
I've made up the beds and been left alone
You look at me, as cold as a stone
There's no way to write what's been done wrong

You left me a fool
So what to do?

Hold me down if I'm running off
They say it gets better, baby, soon enough
So I'll shut my mouth and I'll steal my heart
I still feel like a girl, thinking when we started, but

I want to feel the fire again, with you or anybody else
I want to feel the fear again, with you or anybody else
So what to do? What to do?",Fire/Fear,2013
The Head and the Heart,"So now I know
People want a story
Want an end with glory
And a wave of their flag

Well as far as I can tell
The homecoming heroes
Get put in the headlines
And back off they go

And I won’t stand for anything more
Tried our hand even though we were poor
We’ve put in the time
Casting our lines off shore

Yes some things I dread
I duck into alleys
I avoid the rallies
It’s a choice of my own

And I won’t stand for anything more
Tried our hand even though we were poor
We’ve put in the time
Casting our lines off shore

And I’m sorry but I find no glory in that
I just want you off my back
And there’s not a word in my head floating around
You won’t pick your part and put down

And I won’t stand for anything more
Tried our hand even though we were poor
We’ve put in the time
Casting our lines off shore
We’ve put in the time
Casting our lines

And I’m sorry but I find no glory in that
I just want you off my back
And there’s not a word in my head floating around
You won’t pick your part and put down

So get out of my head
Get out of my head
Get out of my head",Homecoming Heroes,2013
The Head and the Heart,"Came to the cold just to see you
Standing there in expectation
Pulling coat and blue eyes staring
Oh, this vision does me good.

In the city we don't know yet
Across the bridges not yet burned
Where the ice won't let us further
Wind our way down through the woods.
Take me to the attic ladder
In the barn with broken floors
With your boots of spanish leather
And my hat knit out of yarn
And my hat knit out of yarn.

You are in the seat beside me
You are in my dreams at night
You are in grandmother's wisdom
You are in grandfather's charm.

Show me your trees in the orchard
With the music on their branches
Keep them from the mouths of creatures
Who intend for them no good.
Take me out past the wind break
Speak the thing you could not utter,
When we'll howl and moon will cower
At the magic of the word.

Oh, oh.

Darling this is when I met you.
For the third time not the last
Not the last time we are learning
Who we are and what we were.

You are in the seat beside me
You are in my dreams at night
You are in grandmother's wisdom
You are in grandfather's charm.",Josh McBride,2013

There's no such thing as God
There's no such this as you
There's no such thing as us

I never thought I'd leave that place

I never meant to do
Lord help me right all of the wrongs that I have done
You know I've done a few

The Head and the Heart,"Well the ink in my plan went dry long before your smile
And the pages have always been blink like the trees in the wild
But the wind, yes the wind keeps pushing you and me
Time in time, I know when it’s time to leave

If the memories we make, will never been lost, no
And the look on your face, we both knew the cost
But the wind, yes the wind keeps howling

I put in the pictures, you put in the time
You put all those memories so deep inside my mind
Now the wind, yes the wind keeps pushing you and me
And time in time, I know when it’s time to leave

And the memories we’ve made, will never be lost, no
And the look on your face, we both knew the cost
But the wind, yes the wind keeps howling

Even if it was a mistake, I can’t forget your face
Even if it was just a day,
You won’t forget the one who’s making you shake

Kinda lost my way you see
Kinda lost my way you see
Kinda lost my way you see
Kinda lost my way you see
Even if it was a mistake, I can’t forget your face
Even if it was just a day,
You won’t forget the man who’s making you shake
Who’s making you shake, you shake

You shake
Ah, making you shake",Shake,2013
