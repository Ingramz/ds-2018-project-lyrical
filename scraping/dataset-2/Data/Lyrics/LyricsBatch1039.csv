Stan Kenton,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1995
Stan Kenton,"Someone told someone and someone told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much
Since everyone spread the story 
With his own little personal touch
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream 
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
",Do Nothin' Till You Hear from Me [Master Take],1995
Stan Kenton,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Stan Kenton,"Taking stock of what I have and what I haven't
What do I find? The things I got will keep me satisfied
Checking up on what I have and what I haven't
What do I find? A healthy balance on the credit side

Got no diamonds, got no pearls
Still I think I'm a lucky girl
I've got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
Got no mansion, got no yacht
Still I'm happy with what I've got
I've got the sun in the morning and the moon at night

Sunshine gives me a lovely day
Moonlight gives me the Milky Way
Got no check books, got no banks
Still I'd like to express my thanks
I've got the sun in the morning and the moon at night
And with the sun in the morning and the moon in the evening
I'm all right

Stan Kenton,"I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love!
I've got a song that I sing

I can make the rain go, anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love
Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so and so, if I should ever let go

Stan Kenton,"Peg o'my heart
I love you, don't let us part
I love you, I always knew it would be you
Since I heard your lilting laughter
It's your Irish heart I'm after
Peg o'my heart
Your glances make my heart say ""How's chances?""
Come, be my own, come make your home in my heart
",Peg O' My Heart,1995
Stan Kenton,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way,1995

Stan Kenton,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love

Stan Kenton,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1996
Stan Kenton,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Stan Kenton,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

Filled with despair

Stan Kenton,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night

Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Stan Kenton,"I make a date for gown, 
you can bet your life it rains. 
Tried to give a party 
But the guy upstairs complains. 
Guess I'll go through life 
catching colds and missing trains. 
Everything happens to me. 

I never miss a thing 
I've had the measles and the mumps. 
And everytime I play an ace 
My partner always trumps. 
Guess I'm just a fool 
who never looks before he jumps. 
everything happens to me. 

At first I thought that you would end this jinx for me. 
And love would turn the trick to end despair. 
Now I just cant fool this head that thinks for me. 
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air. 
Well I've telegraphed and phoned. 
Sent an air mail special too. 
Your answer was goodbye. 
There was even postage due.

And it had to be with you.

You look grand sitting in the moonlight
Oh I'm in love there's no mistaking, can't you see my heart is breaking
Must you go on this lovely June night

It's a pity to say goodnight because I never saw stars so bright 
But if you gotta go home, you gotta go home, give me a goodnight kiss
It's a pity to say farewell because the man in the moon won't tell 
But if you gotta go home,you gotta go home give me a goodnight kiss.

Stan Kenton,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Stan Kenton,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down

Stan Kenton,"Our waltz is music fashioned in heaven,
Angels composed it for us to dance to.
Our waltz is moonlight trembling with kisses,
Each note a heartbeat throbbing with love.

Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone
Our waltz will play on.

Simply because you're near me.

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

So sweet, cool and so fair

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

There was still some stardust on my sleeve!

And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,

There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

I can't explain the silver rain that found me,
Or was that a moonlit veil?
The music of the universe around me,
Or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,
Suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night?
It's still a thrill I don't quite believe;
But after you were gone
There was still some stardust on my sleeve!

And we may see the meadow in December,
Icy white and crystalline.
But oh, my darlin', always I'll remember

I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

At dawning the whistle blows

You hear him sing his plaintive little strain)

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

All these kids today have gone to hell and all that government paperwork
Caught up with me, had to hire a beancounter for an outrageous fee. And I

Thing heard was that all things considered, he really couldn't complain.
So if you're a loser in life and your gun's out of ammo, just remember
This story about Bert and the piano. 'Cause if you can7t string the bow
And you're clean out of resin, someone may have planned for you a music

I wish I was in Tijuana
Eating barbecued iguana
I'd take requests on the telephone
I'm on a wavelength far from home
I feel a hot wind on my shoulder
I dial it in from south of the border
I hear the talking of the DJ
Can't understand just what does he say?

You are my only confidant
And my only friend
Together we will share everything
Until the very end

There's no one here who shares my views
Or sees the way I can see
But there's just one thing that you'll understand
You'll have to even up with me
At the end of the line (x2)



I've bet it all before
But not everything I own
There are some things that you can't buy or steal
Or learn to leave alone

I toss the dice and skin the cat
And I always pay the fine
So we'll settle up even-steven
When we reach the end of the line

To fly or fall to the news of it all
There's no dark destiny
Fate will receive what our love will believe
'til we reach the end of the line

And replace it now with a look of stern regard

When no one sees you there?
Does your head start to shrink? do your eyes bug out?
Do you wonder what's cheatin' and what's playin' fair?

Gotta clear it out
So let's drink up, it's past two
Girl, don't push 'em out
They can walk out on their own
How many times I gotta tell you, bob,
You gotta drink up and go home
I don't run a business
Just to talk to you all day

Clear out the backroom, sue
Stack up the chairs
Who broke this glass?
No one really cares
Go take the trash out
And vacuum the stairs
What do I
Pay you for?
And don't forget to sweep up
The glass off the floor


Once I had plans
To fix up this place
A room where you could go to
And meet people with taste
They'd talk and they'd laugh
And forget the rat race
And I'd be just like one of those guys
With the moustache and face

Hey, I'm really sorry I blew up then

Let me just pass on one thing

Stan Ridgway,"I work for the newspapers
Any news is good news I always say
But I don't write no daily column
Talk  is cheap and so is my pay.

And when my work days over
I pocket five or ten from the tray
And then I start up again at five am
I stack 'em up just to throw 'em away.

Now lately I've been thinking	
What would the world do without the news 
You wouldn't know when wars were started
Or when they ended,  win or lose.

It probably be a better world to live in
But the question would be who's?
And what side your on or who's right or wrong 
You'd never have to choose.

Some times late at night 
I get to see the streets like no one else can
There's a lot of things going on here
That even newspapers don't  understand.

Some people got too much money
Some  rob  with a gun or a ballpoint pen
Maybe I'll get me a big black cape
And then they'll be running from me,
Looking over their shoulder for me.

Was on the front just yesterday

Stan Ridgway,"I was a PFC on a search patrol huntin' Charlie down
It was in the jungle wars of '65
My weapon jammed and I got stuck way out and all alone
And I could hear the enemy movin' in close outside
Just then I heard a twig snap and I grabbed my empty gun
And I dug in scared while I counted down my fate
And then a big marine, a giant with a pair of friendly eyes
Appeared there at my shoulder and said ""Wait!""
When he came in close beside me he said ""Don't worry, son, I'm here""
""If Charlie wants to tangle now they'll have two to dodge""
I said ""Well, thanks a lot"", I told him my name and asked him his
And he said ""The boys just call me Camouflage""

Whoa Camouflage, things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage, I was awfully glad to see this big marine

Well, I was gonna ask him where he came from
When we heard the bullets fly
Comin' through the brush and all around our ears
And then I saw that big marine light a fire in his eye
And it was strange, but suddenly I forgot my fears

Well we fought all night and side by side, we took our battle stance
And I wondered how the bullets missed this man
'Cause they seemed to go right through him just as if he wasn't there
And in the mornin' we both took a chance and ran
And it was here the river bank when the ambush came on top of us
And I'd thought it was the end and we were had
Then a bullet with my name on it came buzzin' through a bush
And that big marine, he just swat it with his hands
Just like it was a fly!

Whoa Camouflage, things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage, this was an awfully strange marine

And I knew there was something weird about him
'Cause when I turned around he was pullin' a big palm tree
Right up out of the ground
And swattin' those charlies with it from here to kingdom come

When he led me out of danger, I saw my camp and waved goodbye
But he just winked at me from the jungle and then was gone
And when I got back to my HQ I told 'em about my night
And the battle I'd spent with a big marine named Camouflage
When I said his name a soldier gulped and the medic took my arm
And led me to a green tent on the right
He said ""You may be tellin' true boy, but this here is Camouflage""
""And he's been right here since he passed away last night""
""In fact he's been here all week long""
""But before he went he said 'semper fi' and said his only wish""
""Was to save a young marine caught in a barrage""
""So here, take his dog tag son, I know, he'd want you to have it now""
And we both said a prayer for a big marine named Camouflage

Whoa Camouflage, things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage, this was an awfully BIG marine

So, next time, you're in a jungle fight
And you feel a presence near
Or hear a voice that in your mind will lodge
Just be thankful that you're not alone
And you've got some company from a big marine
The boys call Camouflage

Whoa Camouflage, things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage, this was an awfully BIG marine

Workin' cars part time every week
I met 'em both at a drag race
They both dressed pretty snappy that day

While Pete just looked the other way
Now no one can say what your future will hold
Or what your life will have in store
We went home that night
Pete passed out on the couch
And then Peg pulled me down on the floor
Well, I know she knew what she was doing
Forbidden fruit, but what the hell, I bit
That's all it took, my fate was sealed
That night the flame was lit
And every night when the lights go out
Pete drinks his booze and then he passes out
And I hear a footstep outside my door
And then I remember what I started working here for

""Don't worry, now Pete's asleep and I've got a certain plan
You know everything is in my name,"" she said,
""and anyway I love you so very much.

Depart from me this moment
I told her with my voice
She said but I don't wish to
Said I but you've got no choice

I beg you sir, she pleaded
From the corner of her mouth
I will secretly accept you
And together we'll fly south

Came runnin' across the field

And commanding her to yield

Has a swinging door?

Stan Ridgway,"In a time between two wars
When a slip could get you killed
A man appeared with a master plan
And they called him Wild Bill

He talked you 'round in circles
When he was done, yeah, you knew less
And he started up the company one
From what was left of the O.S.S. two

[Chorus:]
Wild Bill, Wild Bill
The secrets that he'd hold
Wild Bill, Wild Bill
He slept out in the cold

Now he was there in '45
When the good war had wound down
The enemy had all been caught
But some could not be found

The price of information
Sometimes takes a sacrifice
A secret traded for a life
But someone pays the price

[Chorus]

The world was on fire for Bill
He had to take control
The enemy was close at hand
The tanks were told to hold

But deep inside Bill's massive head
A master plan did bloom
Buy the information out
By sellin' a brand new tune

On a new blue mercedes in an underground parking lot
Rich people got the money, we got nothin' but these big swingin' balls between our legs

Standin' in the schoolyard, he knew there was trouble when he heard the shots ring out
Turnin' towards the corner he could hear the car approaching and someone shout
From the side window, there's a flash, and he could feel the bullet go deep into his back
And as he fell to the ground, the last thing he said was small fries, and a big mac

Round the south bay near the airport, in a back garage behind a convenience store
There's a meeting going on with some people who ain't gonna take it anymore

It was in the jungle wars of '65
My weapon jammed and I got stuck way out and all alone
And I could hear the enemy movin' in close outside
Just then I heard a twig snap and I grabbed my empty gun
And I dug in scared while I counted down my fate
And then a big Marine, a giant with a pair of friendly eyes
Appeared there at my shoulder and said wait

When he came in close beside me he said,
""Don't worry, son, I'm here,
If Charlie wants to tangle now he'll have two to dodge.""
I said, well thanks a lot
I told him my name and asked him his
And he said, ""The boys just call me Camouflage.""

Whoa Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage
I was awfully glad to see this big Marine

Well I was gonna ask him where he came from
When we heard the bullets fly
Coming through the brush
And all around our ears

It was then I saw this big Marine light a fire in his eye
And it was strange but suddenly I forgot my fears

Well, we fought all night side by side we took our battle stance
And I wondered how the bullets missed this man
'Cause they seemed to go right through him
Just as if he wasn't there
And in the mornin' we both took a chance and ran

And it was near the river bank when the ambush came on top of us
And I'd thought it was the end and we were had
Then a bullet with my name on it came buzzin' through a bush
And that big Marine he just swatted it with his hand
Just like it was a fly

Whoa Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage
This was an awfully strange Marine

And I knew there was something weird about him
'Cause when I turned around he was pullin' a big palm tree
Right up out of the ground
And swattin' those Charlies with it from here to Kingdom Come

When he led me out of danger
I saw my camp and waved goodbye
He just winked at me from the jungle and then was gone
And when I got back to my HQ, I told 'em about my night
And the battle I'd spent with a big Marine named Camouflage

When I said his name a soldier gulped
And a medic took my arm
And led me to a green tent on the right
He said, ""You may be tellin' the truth boy,
But this here is Camouflage,
And he's been right here since he passed away last night""
In fact, he's been here all week long

But before he went he said, ""Semper Fi,""
And said his only wish
Was to save a young marine caught in a barrage
So here, take his dog tag, son,
I know he'd want you to have it now.""
And we both said a prayer for a big Marine named Camouflage

Whoa Camouflage

Where a grey old man looked him up and down and said

Harshly awakened by the sound of six rounds of light-caliber rifle fire
Followed minutes later by the booming of nine rounds from a heavier rifle
But you can't close off the wilderness
He heard the snick of a rifle bolt
And found himself peering down the muzzle
Of a weapon held by a drunken liquor store owner
""there's a conflict,"" he said, ""there's a conflict
Between land and people
The people have to go
They've come all the way out here to make mining claims
To do automobile body work
To gamble
Take pictures
To not have to do laundry
To own a mini-bike
Have their own cb radios and air conditioning
Good plumbing for sure
And to sell time/life books and to work in a deli
To have a little chili every morning
And maybe... maybe to own their own gas stations again
And take drugs
Have some crazy sex
But above all, above all, to have a fair shake
To get a piece of the rock and a slice of the pie
And spit out of the window of your car and not have the wind blow it back in your face""


Now, from the high timberline to the deserts dry
Who'll risk dangling on some hangman's tree
To stake their claims on these prarie plains
While they say this lunch is not had for free?
Just like the spokes of a wheel
Who'll spin 'round with the rest
They'll hear the drums and the brush of steel
And I'll hear the call of the west, call of the west
(yippie-yi-yo, yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay, yippie-yi-yo-ohh-ohh)
I'll hear the call of the west, call of the west
(yippie-yi-yo, yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay, yippie-yi-yo-ohh-ohh)
I'll hear the call of the west, call of the west

Stan Ridgway,"Love is a burnin' thing
And it makes a fiery ring
I was bound by wild desire
I fell into a ring of fire

I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down, down, down, and the flames got higher
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down, down, down, and the flames got higher
And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

I fell into a burnin' ring of fire
I went down, down, down, and the flames got higher

No, that's alright, miss, I'll hold it right here

Stan Rogers,"It was just like strapping 'em on and starting again,
Coaching these kids to the top, and calling them men.
I was a third round pick in the NHL
And that's three years of living in hell,
And going up flying, and going home dying.

My life was over the boards and playing the game,
And every day checking the papers and finding my name.
My dad would go crazy when the scouts would call;
He'd tell me that I'd have it all
Ninety nine of us trying, only one of us flying.

And every kid over the boards listens for the sound;
The roar of the crowd is their ticket for finally leaving this town
To be just one more hopeful in the Junior A,
Dreaming of that miracle play,
And going up flying, going home dying.

I tell them to think of the play and not of the fame.
If they've got any future at all, it's not in the game.
'Cause they'll be crippled and starting all over again
Selling on commissions and remembering
When they were flying, remembering dying.

Stan Rogers,"Sun is rising high, burning into the day,
I will say goodbye, I'll be going away,
Brush away my doubts, what tomorrow will hold,
Feeling fine for now, going down the road

To a city to sing, about the trees and the wind,
'Bout the hills in spring, and the rivers that bend,
The rocky deep pass, and the poppies and ponies,
Running through the grass, up and down the road

In the dark they sit and they hollar for more,
White smoke in a wisp, from here to the door,
Their admission they paid, for the stories they're told,
Of a clear new day, hold me down on the road

And talked about walls,
And I've sung about your withering pain,
Shattered your temples,
And I've brought on your fall,

My last dollar, I pinched it 'til it hollered and bought me some wine.

He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought
He got nothin to eat, no shoes on his feet
She even left his clothes, out in the street

As we dream by the fire

Une porte dérobée

Est-ce qu'ils redoivent encore toutes nos pensées?
Comme des lettres à la nuit envoyées
Savent-ils qu'ils vivent en moi à tout jamais
Ceux que j'aimais...

Où s'en vont tous ceux qu'on aime quand ils nous ont quittés
Y-aurait-il une autre scène que celle que l'on connaît
Un lumineux jardin
pour ceux qui sont loin
Ou n'est ce que que la chimère
D'un éternel refrain

Est-ce qu'ils reçoivent encore toutes nos pensées?
Comme des lettres à la nuit envoyées
Savent-ils qu'ils vivent en moi à tout jamais
Ceux que j'aimais

Chantent t'ils sur le sable
Ou ne sont ils que la rêverie
Des hommes inconsolables

Stanislas,"J'aimerais être une chanson, 
Pour tourner dans sa tête, 
Lire les pensées secrètes, 
Qui dorment sous son front.

Un petit air de rien
Entré par une oreille
Qui jusqu'au cœur se fraye
Le plus court des chemins.

J'aimerais être un refrain,
Pour lever ses défenses,
Et qu'en toute innocence,
Elle m'invite dans son bain.

Mais je ne suis qu'un voisin,
Du temps que je dépense.
Je chanterai je pense
Même si ça ne sert à rien.

J'aimerais être une chanson,
De celles qui vous accrochent,
Petit ruban de scotch,
Collé à ses talons.

Une mélodie légère,
Qui partout l'accompagne,
La quitte puis la rejoigne,
Dans un même courant d'air.

J'aimerais être un refrain,
Pour lever ses défenses,
Et qu'en toute innocence,
Elle m'invite dans son bain.

Mais je ne suis qu'un gredin,
Qui court après la chance,
Le cœur dans tous les sens,
Le piano à la main.

J'aimerais être une chanson
Pour traîner sur ces lèvres,
Et sur son rouge à lèvres,
Patiner en chausson

Une poésie mineure,
Qu'on fredonne sans fin
Sans savoir d'où elle vient
Ni le nom de l'auteur.

J'aimerais être un refrain,
Pour vivre dans sa bouche,
Et que nue sous sa douche,
Elle me chante le matin.

Mais je ne suis qu'un vaurien,
Un signe sur la garance,
Une cigale une absence,
Trois notes dans un coin.

J'aimerais être un refrain,
Pour vivre dans sa bouche,
Et que nue sous sa douche,
Elle me chante le matin.

Et que nue sous sa douche,
Elle me chante le matin.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.

And all that I have I'll give my all to you;

And all this love is waiting for you.

Just like two newlyweds should be.

Stanley Black,"Underneath the lantern, by the barrack gate,
Darling I remember the way you used to wait.
'Twas there that you whispered tenderly,
That you loved me, You'd always be,
My Lili of the lamplight, My own Lili Marlene.

Time would come for roll call, Time for us to part,
Darling I'd caress you and press you to my heart,
And there 'neath that far off lantern light,
I'd hold you tight, We'd kiss good-night,
My Lili of the lamplight, My own Lili Marlene.

Orders came for sailing somewhere over there,
All confined to barracks was more than I could bear;
I knew you were waiting in the street,
I heard your feet, But could not meet,
My Lili of the lamplight, My own Lili Marlene.

Resting in a billet, just behind the line,
Even tho'we're parted, your lips are close to mine.
You wait where that lantern softly gleams.
Your sweet face seems to haunt my dreams.
My Lili of the lamplight, My own Lili Marlene.

Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

Stanley Black,"Romance, a play boy who is born each spring
To teach the nightingale to sing
A very pretty song: ""I love you"".

Romance, a legend on an old brocade,
A prince who tells a country maid: ""I love you"".

Now where this whimsy comes from, I don't know;
For when it comes it's just about to go.

Romance, a flower that will bloom awhile
With sunshine from a lover's smile,
That lover's tears bedew! Ah!

Yet, when I seek this beauty,
Flower of youth's first dawning,
I find a prosy work-a-day world
Stretching and yawning!

Love is locked up in cages,
Kept for a poet's pages;
Life and adventure
Don't seem to be paying attention to me!

And so I dream of fair Romance
And let my fancies weave pretty stories.
And tho' I know they are not so,
I like to go wand'ring amid their wistful glories.

My princes become what I mold them,
And they stay for the breath of a sigh!
I open my arms to enfold them,
And they're gone like a breeze rushing by.

This greeting really mattered
This welcome is grand but I'm really concerned
I like your attention
But this I have to mention
You're playing with fire and you're apt to get burned

There's a girl in Tennessee
Who's sorry she met up with me
Can't go back to Tennessee
I'm a bad, bad man

There's a girl in Omaha
But I ran faster than her pa
Can't go back to Omaha
I'm a bad, bad man

There's a girl in Wyoming
And they're combing Wyoming
To find the man in white
Who was out with her that night

There's a girl in Arkansas
The sheriff is her brother-in-law
Can't go back to Arkansas
I'm a bad, bad man

You're making too much fuss
For we don't give a tinker's cuss
We've been out, yes, each of us
With a bad, bad man

We've been chasing up and down
That other show has just left town
And the one who played the clown
Was a bad, bad man

You may love us and leave us
But the parting won't grieve us
We'll turn the other cheek
When the minstrels come next week

When the show folks come to call
A girl may slip but she won't fall
We'll give some but won't give all
To a bad, bad man

For years I have yearned to
Play towns I could return to
And ""this may be it"" from the way that you speak
I'm glad you're not frightened
The atmosphere has brightened
And now let's make plans for a wonderful week

Monday when my show is done
I'll teach you how to shoot a gun
You may find it lots of fun
With a bad, bad man

Tuesday there's no matinee
But I'll be in my tent all day
You can come around and play
With a bad, bad man

Send your mothers on Wednesday
Because Wednesday's old hens' day
But Thursday is sublime
I'll have lots of open time

Friday night will be the test
If Saturday you're still my guest
Sunday you can come and rest
With a bad, bad man

I'm enlightened but frightened
Tho' my interest you've heightened
It might turn out to be
That you're much too much for me

So I'll go back to my tent
And someday when you're old and bent
Think of hours you might have spent

So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You,2015
Stanley Black Orchestra,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When,2017

Stanley Clarke,"Sometime ago I had a dream
It was happy, it was lasting, it was free
And now in life, oh, can't you see
How we can make that dream into reality?

Oh, the music, it was playing
Oh, the firelight, it was dancing
All the children they were singing
All the people they were loving

Sometime ago I had a dream
It was happy, it was lasting, it was free
And now in life, oh, can't you see
How we can make that dream into reality?

Oh, the morning sun, it was soft and cool
Oh, the evening breeze, it was warm and gold
All together life had started to unfold
Sometime ago

",Sometime Ago/La Fiesta,1972
Stanley Clarke,"Look around you my people
If you look then you will see
How to love, life is paradise all together
What game shall we play today?

Man just wants to be happy
Cast off things that shouldn't be
Set him free, life is paradise all together
What game shall we play today?

There's a way you can find it
It's within you, can't you see
Find the truth, it's not impossible all together
What game shall we play today?

Here we are all together
Free to have and do and be
What we see, for the first time all together
What game shall we play today?",What Game Shall We Play Today?,1972
Stanley Clarke,"[Chorus 1:]
We're sailing ships across the desert
And fading in the Arabian sun
You're stallion stands to watch the sun set
The women scream as the camels run
To find a mirage cool oasis
And lie beneath the palms and the sky
And spend the night a silver moon set
The rising sun in the eagles eye
[Chorus 2:]
The heat of a dusky lady, Born on the sand
Burnin' with desert fire, Cooling the man
Endless is the blowing desert
And in the shipwreck some may be lost
Too hot the sand too deep the oceans
It's just surviving whatever the cost

Stanley Clarke,"I Up on the wire
I like to climb and play with the sky
The people far below
The air is clear
And I can perceive
The whole world is shining
Life is sublime
And when you dare to go up in the air and leave the earth far behind you
As I step and dip and leap into a space beyond
Up high
Just for a moment
Alive
And so afraid but alive
As I push against the sky and my heart has broken free


II Fear turns to joy
When you can race the edge of the sky
And life's intense and strong
It's not so long
Before you will run
Beyond your horizons
Up on the wire
The line is thin and you must bow and surf against the sky so precisely
But the sky seems to go on as far as you can see
Up high
Just for this moment
Alive
And so afraid but alive
As the wire disappears
And you've finally broken free

Solo

III As I step and dip and leap into a place beyond
Up high
Just for this moment

And I can perceive
The whole world is shining
Life is sublime
And when you dare to go up in the air and leave the earth so precisely
As I step and dip and leap into a place beyond
Up high

Alive
And so afraid but alive
As I dip against the sky and my heart has broken free

Stanley Clarke,"I hear music
Mighty fine music
The murmur of the morning breeze up there
The rattle of the milkman on the stair

Sure that's music
Mighty fine music
The singing of the sparrow in the sky
The perking of the coffee right nearby

That's my baby's melody
When you my angel holding me

I hear music
Mighty fine music
And anytime I think my world is wrong
I get me out of bed and sing this song

That's my favorite melody
When you ma angel holding me

Stanley Clarke,"I want to stay here
But I ain't worthy
You are to descent to understand
For when I see him
He hypnotizes me
When he takes hold of me
With his hard hand

Someday, I know he's comin' back
To call me
He's gonna handle me and hold me so
It's gonna be like dyin', Porgy
Deep inside me,
But when he calls I have to go

I love you Porgy
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
And drive me mad
If I can stay here, and you would keep me

Stanley Clarke,"Once I was a sentimental thing
Throw my heart away each spring
Now a spring romance
Hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to winter
All I've got to show's a splinter
For my little fling

Spring, this year has got me feeling like a horse
That never left the post
I lay in my room
Starring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most

Morning kiss wakes trees and flower
And to them my life
To drink a toast I walk in the park
Just to kill those lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most

All afternoon
Those birds tweet-a-tweet I know their tune
This is love this is it
Heard it before
And I know the score
And I decide that love is a bore
Love seem sure around the new year
Now it's April

Love is just a ghost
Spring arrived on time
But what became of you, dear
Spring can really hang you up the most
Spring can really hang you up the most

Spring is here
There's no mistaken
Robins build their nest from coast to coast
My heart tries the same
So they won't hear it breaking
Spring can really hang you up the most

College boys are riding somewhere
Tender passion there it grows
But I'm on the shelf with last years easter bonnet
Spring can really hang you up the most

Love came my way
I'm holding the last
We had our day
Now that's all in the past
Spring came along
A season of song
For love's sweet promise
But something went wrong
Doctor's once prescribed a tonic
Sulfur and molasses was the dose
Didn't help me a bit
My condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most

All alone, the party's over
Winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying
For snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most",Spring Can Really Hang You up the Most,1982
