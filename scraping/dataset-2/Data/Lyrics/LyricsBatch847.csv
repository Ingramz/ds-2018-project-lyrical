Phil Moore,"I hadn't anyone till you,
I was a lonely one 'til you,
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me,
Now I see

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away,
I waited for that lucky day

Phil Moore & His Orchestra,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Want you to know it really is pleasin'

Oh, why can't you behave?
After all the things you told me,
And the promises that you gave,
Oh, why can't you behave?

Why, why, why can't you be good?

I was faithful and true but what good will it do

And do, do just as you should?

Yes you had the right touch but I was askin' too much
Won't you turn that new leaf over,
So your baby can be your slave?
Oh, why can't you behave?

Where we two can go and try settling down.

Life isn't long enough baby, but I can love you as long as I live. 

Maybe I can't give you diamonds and things like I want to,
But I can promise you, baby, I'm gonna want to as long as I live. 

I never cared, but now I'm scared, I won't live long enough.
That's why I wear my rubbers when it rains and eat an apple every 
day then see the doctor anyway. 

What if I can't live to love you as long as I want to.
Long as I promise you, baby, I'm gonna love you as long I live. 

I'll even wear long underwear, when winter breezes blow
I'm gonna take good care of me because, a sneeze or two might mean the flu,

Exchanging glances
Wandering the night, 
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through

Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away

And ever since that night 
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night

Before the throne of God

As the faithful throng wave their palms
From every tribe and nation

CHORUS:
Salvation belongs to our God
And to the One who's on the throne
Salvation belongs to the Lamb
To our God and to the Lamb alone

Amen, praise and glory
Wisdom, honor, strength, and power
Be to our God forever and ever
In this eternal glorious hour

They will never thirst again
Neither will they hunger
For the Lamb will be their Shepherd
For the kingdom of this world's become
The kingdom of our Christ
And God will wipe away the tears
From each and every eye

Phil Naish,"I know your deeds, I've seen your service
I recognize the reputation of your lives
But I know you live near Satan's shadow
And I have seen your faithful struggles to survive

And to the one who overcomes I'll give the manna
He'll have a pure white stone with his own secret name
She will possess the morning star in all its splendor
All this and more for them because they overcame
All this and more for them because they overcame

So just hold on, do not grow weary
For I am he who searches hearts and minds
Behold I'm standing at the door and I am knocking
And the one who hears and opens it will find

That the one who overcomes will rule the nations
On the throne he'll sit beside me dressed in white
She will become a column in God's holy temple
They will all eat freely from the Tree of Life
They will all eat freely from the Tree of Life

We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you

Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""

Love comes as a surprise
And it's too late
It's just too late to stay
Too late to stay

We'll always be together
However far it seems
(Love never ends)
We'll always be together
Together in Electric Dreams

Because the friendship that you gave
Has taught me to be brave
No matter where I go I'll never find a better prize
(Find a better prize)
Though you're miles and miles away
I see you every day I don't have to try
I just close my eyes, I close my eyes

We'll always be together
However far it seems
(Love never ends)
We'll always be together

Walk thru the meadows and the mountains and the sand

Walk thru the valleys and the rivers and the plains

Walk thru the sun and walk thru the rain


Here is a land full of power and glory

Beauty that words cannot recall

Oh her power shall rest on the strength of her freedom

Her glory shall rest on us all (on us all)

From Colorado, Kansas, and the Carolinas too

Virginia and Alaska, from the old to the new

Texas and Ohio and the California shore

Tell me, who could ask for more?

Yet she's only as rich as the poorest of her poor

Only as free as the padlocked prison door

Only as strong as our love for this land

Only as tall as we stand

A man of deep sorrow, but also a man of deep pride.

And the vision of my Celia make dreams to dream upon
Each hour is a day filled with memories.
Oh, when will Celia come to me?

I wake each morning and I watch the sun arise
Wonder if my Celia sleeps, wonder if she cries
If hate must be my prison lock, love must be the key
Oh, when will Celia come to me?

They kept my Celia through the war, they keep her from me still.

There were young men armed with knives and guns, young men armed with hateAnd Lou Marsh stepped between them and died there in his tracks                  
For one man is no army when the city turns its back	Now the streets are empty, now the streets are dark
So keep an eye on shadows and never pass the park
For the city is a jungle when the law is out of sight 
And death lurks in El Barrio with the orphans of the night

For he learned the prayers of distant men will never right the wrongs
His church became an alley and his pulpit was the street
He made his congregation from the boys he used to meet

There were two gangs approaching in spanish Harlem town
The smell of blood was in the air, the challenge was laid down
He felt their blinding hatred, and he tried to save their lives
And the answer that they gave him was their fists and feet and knives

Will his memory still linger on, in those he tried to save?

I wonder who knows how many have died

Look over the leaders with the blood on their hands.

Phil Ochs,"n Portsmouth town on the eastern shore
Where many a fine ship was born.
The Thresher was built
 And the Thresher was launched
And the crew of the Thresher was sworn.
  
She was shaped like a tear
She was built like a shark
She was made to run fast and free.
And the builders shook their hands
And the builders shared their wine,
And thought that they had mastered the sea.
Yes, she'll always run silent
And she'll always run deep
Though the ocean has no pity
   
Though the waves will never weep
They'll never weep.
And they marvelled at her speed
marvelled at her depth
marvelled at her deadly design.
And they sailed to every land
And they sailed to every port
Just to see what faults they could find.
Then they put her on the land
For nine months to stand
And they worked on her from stem to stern.
But they could never see
It was their coffin to be
For the sea was waiting for their return.

Yes, she'll always run silent
And she'll always run deep
Though the ocean has no pity
And the waves will never weep
They'll never weep.

On a cold Wednesday morn
They put her her out to sea
When the waves they were nine feet high.
And they dove beneath the waves
And they dove to their graves
And they never said a last goodbye.
And its deeper and deeper
And deeper they dove
Just to see what their ship could stand.
But the hull gave a moan
And the hull gave a groan
And they plunged to the deepest darkest sand.

Now she lies in the depths
Of the darkened ocean floor
Covered by the waters cold and still.
Oh can't you see the wrong
She was a death ship all along
Died before she had a chance to kill.

And she´ll never run silent,
And she´ll never run deep,
For the ocean had no pity
And the waves, they never weep,
They never weep.

I thought that I would stop awhile,
Take a vacation, Southern style.
Got some Southern hospitality,
Down there in a Southern hospital.

Welcome, if you're White, my friend.

Doin' some hard travelin',
From hydrants a-plenty!

Well, a pack of dogs was standin' by,
I walked up to them and I said ""Hi.""
Well, I asked one dog what they all were doin';
He walked up to me and started chewin' -- 
It was a black dog,
Seems ev'rybody down there is prejudiced!

Well, I said, ""There must be some man around,
There can't be only you dogs in town.""
They said, ""Sure, we have Old Bull Connor,
There he goes, walkin' yonder,
Throwin' some raw meat to the Mayor,
Feedin' bones to the City Council!""

He's blocking our kids from our schools,
Standin' in the doorway, crackin' jokes,
Gettin' re-elected!""

With sovereign dogs and sovereign hate.

Where we drove through the hills of west virginia.

And the orange sun was falling on the southern border line,
As the shadows of the night were now returning.
And we knew the mountains followed us and watched us from behind,
When we drove from the hills of west virginia.

Phil Ochs,"Have you seen the iron lady's charms
Legs of steel, leather on her arms
Takin' on a man to die
A life for a life, an eye for an eye
And that's the iron lady in the chair

Stop the murder, deter the crimes away
Only killing shows killing doesn't pay
Yes, that's the kind of law it takes
Even though we make mistakes
And sometimes send the wrong man to the chair

In the death row waiting for their turn
No time to change, not a chance to learn
Waiting for someone to call, say it's over after all
They won't have to face the justice of the chair

Just before they serve him one last meal
Shave his head, oh, they ask him how he feels
Then the warden comes to say goodbye
Reporters come to watch him die
Watch him as he's strapped into the chair

And the chaplain, he reads the final prayer
Be brave my son, the Lord is waiting there
Oh, murder is so wrong you see
Both the Bible and the courts agree
That the state's allowed to murder in the chair

In the courtroom, watch the balance of the scales
If the price is right, there's time for more appeals
The strings are pulled, the switch is stayed
The finest lawyers fees are paid
And a rich man's never died upon the chair

Have you seen the iron lady's charms
Legs of steel, leather on her arms
Takin' on a man to die
A life for a life, an eye for an eye
And that's the iron lady in the chair

That was the president and that was the man.

I still can see him smiling there and waving at the crowd
As he drove through the music of the band
And never even knowing no more time would be allowed
Not for the president and not for the man.

Here's a memory to share, here's a memory to save
Of the sudden early ending of command
Yet a part of you and a part of me is buried in his grave
That was the president and that was the man.

It's not only for the leader that the sorrow hits so hard
There are greater things I'll never understand
How a man so filled with life, even death was caught off guard.
That was the president and that was the man.

Every thing he might have done and all he could have been
Was proven by the troubled traitors hand
For what other death could wound the hearts of so many men
That was the president and that was the man.

Yes, the glory that was lincoln's never died when he was slain
It's been carried over time and time again
And to the list of honor you may add another name
That was the president and that was the man.
That was the president and that was the man.

Here is an older version of the song, supplied by cody gillespie-lynch

On a south pacific ocean, on a south pacific shore,
A legend was written on the sand,
For a man of peace was born in the middle of a war,
That was the president, and that was the man.

With the wisdom of the old and the vision of the young,
A challenge was given to the land,
And our dreams of peace were spoken with a gifted, golden tongue,
That was the president, and that was the man.

When the freedom revolution gave a rumble and a roar,
The world was shown on which side he would stand,
For the first time in a hundred years he opened up the door,
That was the president, and that was the man.

When a hungry world was searching for a way to feed it's own,
The peace corps was offered as his plan,
And now these seeds of knowledge go wherever winds have blown,
That was the president, and that was the man.

Everything he might've done and all he could've been,
Was proven by the tainted traitor's hand,
For what other death could wound the hearts of so many men,
That was the president, and that was the man.

No end to all the sorrow and the hours we shall grieve,
So deep was the fire of his brand,
And still I can remember, and still I can't believe,
That was the president, and that was the man.

Yes, the glory that was lincoln's never died when he was slain,
That glory shown with roosevelt again,
And to this list of honor you may list another name,
For these were the presidents, and these were the men.

Phil Ochs,"Joe Hill come over from Sweden shores
Looking for some work to do
And the Statue of Liberty waved him by
As Joe come a sailing through, Joe Hill
As Joe come a sailing through.
Oh his clothes were coarse and his hopes were high
As he headed for the promised land
And it took a few weeks on the out-of-work streets
Before he began to understand
Before he began to understand
And Joe got hired by a bowery bar
sweeping up the saloon
As his rag would sail over the barroom rail
Sounded like he whistled on a tune
You could almost hear him whistling on a tune
And Joe rolled on from job to job
From the docks to the railroad line
And no matter how hungry the hand that wrote
In his letters he was always doing fine
In his letters he was always doing fine
Oh, the years went by like the sun goin' down
slowly turn the page
And when Joe looked back at the sweat upon his tracks
He had nothing to show but his age
He had nothing to show but his age
So he headed out for the California shore
There things were just as bad
So he joined the Industrial Workers of the World
'Cause, The union was the only friend he had
'Cause, The union was the only friend he had
Now the strikes were bloody and the strikes were black
as hard as they were long
In the dark of night Joe would stay awake and write 
In the morning he would raise them with a song
In the morning he would raise them with a song
And he wrote his words to the tunes of the day
To be passed along the union vine
And the strikes were led and the songs were spread
And Joe Hill was always on the line
Yes Joe Hill was always on the line
Now in Salt Lake City a murder was made
There was hardly a clue to find
Oh, the proof was poor, but the sheriff was sure
Joe was the killer of the crime
That Joe was the killer of the crime
Joe raised his hands but they shot him down
he had nothing but guilt to give
It's a doctor I need and they left him to bleed
He made it 'cause he had the will to live
Yes, He made it 'cause he had the will to live
Then the trial was held in a building of wood
And there the killer would be named
And the days weighed more than the cold copper ore
Cause he feared that he was being framed
Cause he found out that he was being framed
Oh, strange are the ways of western law
Strange are the ways of fate
For the government crawled to the mine owner's call
That the judge was appointed by the state
Yes, The judge was appointed by the state
Oh, Utah justice can be had
But not for a union man
And Joe was warned by summer early morn
That there'd be one less singer in the land
There'd be one less singer in the land
Now William Spry was Governor Spry
And a life was his to hold
On the last appeal, fell a governor's tear
May the lord have mercy on your soul
May the lord have mercy on your soul
Even President Wilson held up the day
But even he would fail
For nobody heard the soul searching words
Of the soul in the Salt Lake City jail
Of the soul in the Salt Lake City jail
For 36 years he lived out his days
And he more than played his part
For his songs that he made, he was carefully paid
With a rifle bullet buried in his heart
With a rifle bullet buried in his heart
Yes, they lined Joe Hill up against the wall
Blindfold over his eyes
It's the life of a rebel that he chose to live
It's the death of a rebel that he died
It's the death of a rebel that he died
Now some say Joe was guilty as charged
And some say he wasn't even there
And I guess nobody will ever know
'Cause the court records all disappeared
'Cause the court records all disappeared
Say wherever you go in this fair land
In every union hall
In the dusty dark these words are marked
In between all the cracks upon the wall
In between all the cracks upon the wall
It's the very last line that Joe Will wrote
When he knew that his days were through
""Boys, this is my last and final will
Good luck to all of you
Good luck to all of you""",Joe Hill,1968
Phil Ochs,"My life was once a joy to me,
Never knowing, I was growing, everyday.
My life was once a toy to me,
And I wound it and I found it ran away.
So I raced through the night
with a face at my feet, like a god I would write,
All the melodies were sweet, and the women were white.
It was easy to survive, my life was so alive.
My life was once a flag to me
And I waved it and behaved like I was told.
My life was once a drag to me
And I loudly, and I proudly, lost control
I was drawn by a dream
I was loved by a lie, every serf on the scene
Begged me to buy.
But I slipped through the scheme
So lucky to fail
My life was not for sale.
My life is now a myth to me
Like the drifter, with his laughter in the dawn.
My life is now a death to me
So I'll mold it and I'll hold it till I'm born
So I turned to the land
Where I'm so out of place
Throw a curse on the plan
In return for the grace
To know where I stand
Take everything I own
Take your tap from my phone
And leave my life alone
My life alone.",My Life,1969
Phil Ochs,"Every morning at the dawn dust is in the air
Karen rises early, runs brushes through her hair
Then she buys the paper, I lay on my back
Then she feeds the monkey, then she feeds the cat

Surrounded by a cemetery
If you get tired come up for some tea
With Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, and me
Frances is the next to rise
Powders up her nose

To sing the latest song

But David fights with Susan
Nobody gets along

It's time to make a call
Judy has a barbecue
Play the volleyball
In the evening When the sun goes down
The streets are all aglow

We walk out on the hillside
City shines below
We sit down for our supper
The news begins to play
Walter he is speechless
Eric speaks cliches
Andy plays a cricket game

Phil Ochs,"Went to a party the other night, everybody was there
Thought that I would have some fun as I started up the stair.
Somebody tried to ruin it when he won a raffle prize,
Tried to shake and shock us right before our eyes.
While we danced, while we were dancing
Who was the fool throw the basket in the pool?
It was filled with the finest cheeses filled with imported wine,
Wish that I had won it, and I wish that it were mine
I know some wino lives outside of town
How would gladly cut your throat if he could drink it down
While we danced, while we were dancing
Who was the fool throw the basket in the pool?
If I had found out who he was, if I'd have found his face,
Next time we have a party gonna find out his name.
I've been on the ocean swimming know poroise led the way,
It wasn't worth the matter and it wasn't worth the pay. 
We were there, go right on dancing
Who was the fool throw the basket in the pool?
How can I go swimming now my world is laid to waste?
It was the worst of manners and it was the worst of taste
Why can't we be left alone? Think that it was a crime
If everyone was groovy we could all have a real good time.
We could dance, go right on dancing
Who was the fool throw the basket in the pool?",Basket in the Pool,1970
Phil Ochs,"Creek was running by the road
And the Buckeye sun was a-shinin'
I rode my bike down Alum Creek Drive
When I was a boy in Ohio
The English teacher he didn't care
He challenged us to checkers
And once in a while we'd swap a joke
When I was a boy in Ohio
Once I was caught playing hooky from school
They found me home in the evening
I confessed I had been to the movie show
When I was a boy in Ohio
We would wait for the summer to come
For swimmin' and pickin' berries
But now a freeway covers the field 
Where I used to be so happy
I remember the Burger Boy
Where the girls would shine like the engines
And the radio was always loud
When I was a boy in Ohio
Spanish teacher she tried to help
She was much too pretty
So I just stared at the back of her legs
When I was a boy in Ohio
It was 3.2 beer at the honky tonk bar
Where they said the girls were easy
But somehow I never found me one
When I was a boy in Ohio
Soon I was grown and I had to leave
And I've been all over the country
But I don't believe I've had more fun
Than when I was a boy in Ohio",Boy in Ohio,1970

Growin' in the fields of grain, Jim Dean of Indiana
His mother died when he was a boy, his father was a stranger
Marcus Winslow took him in, nobody seemed to want him
The hired man sang like a storm, sometimes he'd beat him
'Cause he would never do the chores, he was lost in dreaming
He never seemed to find a play with the flatlands and the farmers
So he had to leave one day, he said to be an actor
Once he'd come back to the farm with starlets from the stages
They locked themselves inside his room, the people turned their faces
A neighbor ran from the movie house, chickens they were scattered
He swore he saw upon the screen, Jim Dean of Indiana
He played a boy without a home, torn with no tomorrow
Reaching out to touch someone, a stranger in the shadow
The Winslows left for the movie town, they drove across the country
They hoped that he would stay around and they hoped he would be friendly
He talked to them for half an hour but he was busy racing
He left for the Grapevine Road,  they left for Indiana
Then Marcus heard on the radio that a movie star was dying
He turned the tuner way down low, so Ortense could go on sleeping
It was not until they reached the farm where the hired man was waiting

When Marshalls faced an angry mob to send one man to school
His name was Jimmy Meredith
the tide he helped to turn
For he chose to stay on that terrible day
The land was soon to learn
There was blood, red blood, on their hands,
Yellow dirt on their clothes
What they thought they were doing,
Only god and the devil knows
There was hate, cold hate, in their hearts,
Shot from their souls like a gun
And as they threw their stones and bricks,
They screamed, ""see what you have done!""
The governor made a promise he would keep the trouble down
But when the mob got ugly no troopers could be found
And men were filled with hate and fear,
They screamed into the night
The rebel flag waved in the air
The symbol of state's rights
There was blood, red blood, on their hands,
Yellow dirt on their clothes
What they thought they were doing,
Only god and the devil knows
There was hate, cold hate, in their hearts,
Shot from their souls like a gun
And as they threw their stones and bricks,
They screamed, ""see what you have done!""
Gas was fired into the mob after each attack
And though the gas was running low, they never fired back
And when the smoke had cleared and the fury felt its pain
Two men were dead and a hundred bled
The south had risen again
So listen Mr Barnet, and Mr Walker, too
The times are changing mighty fast, they'll roll right over you
But someday you'll head for the south, to the southern tip of hell
And it's hot down there, white-hot down there
Let's hear your rebel yell!
There was blood, red blood, on their hands,
Yellow dirt on their clothes
What they thought they were doing,
Only god and the devil knows
There was hate, cold hate, in their hearts,
Shot from their souls like a gun
And as they threw their stones and bricks,
They screamed, ""see what you have done!""
""See what you have done!""",Ballad of Oxford (Jimmy Meredith),1987
Phil Ochs,"I'm just a city boy
Born and bred
It's a city life I've led
My pasture was a street
I've never climbed a tree
But that's all right with me
'Cause I'm a city boy
I'm just a city boy
Born and raised
From these rooftops I have gazed
Where the grass was made of steel
I've never plowed a field
Until the pavement starts to peel
I'll be a city boy
I'm just a city boy
Born and grown
That's all I've ever known
Where the lights would greet the dawn
There's a factory for a farm
Sure the city has its charm
When you're a city boy",City Boy,1987
Phil Ochs,"Just across the railroad tracks
On the far side of the town
All the people there are black
And they live in colored town
Colored town

Speeding cars down the highway run
They never stop to look around
One place that the highway shuns
And that place is colored town
Colored town

On the sidewalk children play
In the gutters watch them clown
White world is so far away
So far away from colored town
Colored town

The owners of the local stores
Owners of the local ground
They're walking on a finer floor
Skin's too white for colored town
Colored town

In the early of the day
For the white homes they are bound
As a janitor, as a maid
They leave their place in colored town
Colored town

Come the evening, come the wine
Come the dancing music sound
Liquor knows no color line
Not even down in colored town
Colored town

A prison with no prison guards
Where no padlocks can be found
A jail without cells and bars
But you'll never escape from colored town
Colored town

Come let's open all the doors
From Birmingham to Harlem's ground
from Jackson to Chicago's shores
Let's take a look at colored town
Colored town
Come take a look at colored town

Phil Ochs,"When the river of rebellion overflows, I'll be there
When the seed of discontent plants and grows, I'll be there
Watching for the sun through the dark and rainy storm
Searching for the keys to the dungeons old and worn
Let me tell you, I'll be there

When the shadow of the tyrant falls and sweeps across the land
When men would steal from others with paper in their hand
When people search for answers and the answers never come
When their troubles would be over if they thought and fought as one
Let me tell you, I'll be there

Whispering of yesterday has grown into a roar
Winds of freedom blowing out of every distant shore
When the time is ready and the call is loud and clear
Let me tell you, I'll be there

When the thunder of oppression roars and crackles, I'll be there
When those who would be free are wearing shackles, I'll be there
For the day is gonna come when they'll throw away their chains
Lift their heads and raise their arms for the struggle that remains
And let me tell you, I'll be there

It feeds on my hunger and tears on my time
And I'm tired,
Yes, I'm tired
Every face on the street is as cold the air
As hard as the pavement moves 'neath my feet
And I'm tired,
Yes, I'm tired
Sometimes I stop and ask to myself
Oh why should I be so alone
It comes and it goes
and nobody knows
For they're blind with a pain all their own
So I start out again with a smile on my face

Phil Ochs,"Christmas shoppers shopping on a neon city street
Another Christmas dollar for another Christmas treat
There's satin on the pretty dolls that make the children glow
While a boy walking ragged in the cold Kentucky snow
No, they don't have Christmas in Kentucky
There's no holly on a West Virginia door
For the trees don't twinkle when you're hungry
And the Jingle Bells don't jingle when you're poor
There's lots of toys for children when then Christmas time is near
But the present for the miners is a stocking full of beer
In the dark hills of Kentucky there's one gift that may be found
The coal dust of forgotten days that's lying on the ground
No, they don't have Christmas in Kentucky
There's no holly on a West Virginia door
For the trees don't twinkle when you're hungry
And the Jingle Bells don't jingle when you're poor
Let's drink a toast to Congress and a toast to Santa Claus
and a toast to all the speeches that bring the loud applause
There's not enough to give, no, there's not enough to share
So let's drown the sounds of sorrow with a hearty Christmas cheer
No, they don't have Christmas in Kentucky
There's no holly on a West Virginia door
For the trees don't twinkle when you're hungry
And the Jingle Bells don't jingle when you're poor
Have a merry, merry Christmas and a happy new year's day
For now's a time of plenty, and plenty's here to stay
But if you knew what Christmas was, I think that you would find
That Christ is spending Christmas in the cold Kentucky mine
No, they don't have Christmas in Kentucky

Soldiers, disillusioned, come home from the war
Sarcastic students tell them not to fight no more
And they argue through the night
Black is black and white is white
Walk away both knowing they are right

Smoke dreams of escaping souls are drifting by
Dull the pain of living as they slowly die
Smiles change into a sneer
washed away by whiskey tears
In the quicksand of their mind they disappear
Still nobody's buying flowers from the flower lady

Feeble, aged, people almost to their knees
Complain about the present using memories
Never found their pot of gold
Wrinkled hands pound weary holes
Each line screams out you're old, you're old, you're old
But nobody's buying flowers from the flower lady

And the flower lady hobbles home without a sale
Tattered shreds of petals leave a fading trail
Not a pause to hold a rose
Even she no longer knows
The lamp goes out the evening now is closed
And nobody's buying flowers from the flower lady",Flower Lady,1988

At the end of the early British war
The young land started growing
The young blood started flowing

But I ain't marchin' anymore
For I've killed my share of Indians
In a thousand different fights
I was there at the Little Big Horn
I heard many men lying
I saw many more dying

It's always the old to lead us to the war
It's always the young to fall

Tell me is it worth it all
For I stole California from the Mexican land
Fought in the bloody Civil War
Yes I even killed my brother
And so many others

For I marched to the battles of the German trench
In a war that was bound to end all wars
Oh I must have killed a million men
And now they want me back again
But I ain't marchin' anymore

For I flew the final mission in the Japanese sky
Set off the mighty mushroom roar
When I saw the cities burning
I knew that I was learning
That I ain't marchin' anymore

In the year of seventy-four
They crossed the San Juan Mountains
Growing hungry to the core.
Their guide was Alferd Packer
And they trusted him too long:
For his character was weak
And his appetite was strong.

    They called him a murderer, a cannibal, a thief;
    It just doesn't pay to eat anything but Government-inspected beef.

Along the Gunnison River
An Indian camp they spied.
An Indian chief approached them,
To stop them he did try.
He warned them of the danger
In the snow that lay around,
But the danger was in Packer,
For his hunger knew now bound.

    They called him a murderer, a cannibal, a thief;
    It just doesn't pay to eat anything but Government-inspected beef.

Two cold months went slowly by;
Packer came back alone.
""My comrades they all froze to death,
I'm starving,"" he did moan.
The Indian chief knew how he lied,
He spat upon the ground,
For Packer's belly hung out all over his belt:
He'd gained some thirty pounds.

    They called him a murderer, a cannibal, a thief;
    It just doesn't pay to eat anything but Government-inspected beef.

Well for nine long years he ran away
But finally he was tried.
He claimed he didn't kill them,
He only ate their hide.
That County had six dem-o-crats
Until that man arrived.
Well only one lives on today:
He ate the other five.

    They called him a murderer, a cannibal, a thief;
    It just doesn't pay to eat anything but Government-inspected beef.

Eighteen years he stayed in jail,
It was a dreadful fate,
For he suffered indigestion
Every time he ate.
Still, it's hard to blame this hungry guy
Who went searchin' for the mines,
For when he ate his friends
He'd never heard of Duncan Hines.

Oh, I'm just a typical American boy from a typical American town
I believe in God and Senator Dodd and a-keepin' old Castro down
And when it came my time to serve I knew ""better dead than red""
But when I got to my old draft board, buddy, this is what I said:

	CHORUS
	Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
	And I always carry a purse
	I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat, and my asthma's getting worse
	Yes, think of my career, my sweetheart dear, and my poor old invalid aunt
	Besides, I ain't no fool, I'm a-goin' to school
	And I'm working in a DEE-fense plant

I've got a dislocated disc and a wracked up back
I'm allergic to flowers and bugs
And when the bombshell hits, I get epileptic fits
And I'm addicted to a thousand drugs
I got the weakness woes, I can't touch my toes
I can hardly reach my knees
And if the enemy came close to me
I'd probably start to sneeze

	I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
	And I always carry a purse
	I got eyes like a bat, and my feet are flat, and my asthma's getting worse
	Yes, think of my career, my sweetheart dear, and my poor old invalid aunt
	Besides, I ain't no fool, I'm a-goin' to school
	And I'm working in a DEE-fense plant

Ooh, I hate Chou En Lai, and I hope he dies,
Onething you gotta see
That someone's gotta go over there
And that someone isn't me
So I wish you well, Sarge, give 'em Hell!
Kill me a thousand or so
And if you ever get a war without blood and gore
I'll be the first to go

	Yes, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen

For Underheath her borders, the devil draws no lines,
If you drag her muddy river, nameless bodies you will find.
whoa the fat trees of the forest have hid a thousand crimes,
the calender is lyin' when it reads the present time.
Whoa here's to the land you've torn out the heart of,
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of!

And here's to the people of Mississippi
Who say the folks up north, they just don't understand
And they tremble in their shadows at the thunder of the Klan
The sweating of their souls can't wash the blood from off their hands
They smile and shrug their shoulders at the murder of a man
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of

And here's to the schools of Mississippi
Where they're teaching all the children that they don't have to care
All the rudiments of hatred are present everywhere
And every single classroom is a factory of despair
There's nobody learning such a foreign word as fair
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of

And here's to the cops of Mississippi
They're chewing their tobacco as they lock the prison door
Their bellies bounce inside them when they knock you to the floor
No they don't like taking prisoners in their private little war
Behind their broken badges there are murderers and more
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of

And, here's to the judges of Mississippi
Who wear the robe of honor as they crawl into the court
They're guarding all the bastions of their phony legal fort
Oh, justice is a stranger when the prisoners report
When the black man stands accused the trial is always short
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of

And here's to the government of Mississippi
In the swamp of their bureaucracy they're always bogging down
And criminals are posing as the mayors of the towns
And they hope that no one sees the sights and no one hears the sounds
And the speeches of the governor are the ravings of a clown
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of

And here's to the laws of Mississippi
Congressmen will gather in a circus of delay
While the Constitution is drowning in an ocean of decay
Unwed mothers should be sterilized, I've even heard them say
Yes, corruption can be classic in the Mississippi way
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of

And here's to the churches of Mississippi
Where the cross, once made of silver, now is caked with rust
And the Sunday morning sermons pander to their lust
The fallen face of Jesus is choking in the dust
Heaven only knows in which God they can trust
Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of
Mississippi find yourself another country to be part of

Phil Ochs,"The wind was a torrent of darkness
Among the gusty trees
The moon was a ghostly galleon
Tossed upon cloudy seas
And the road was a ribbon of moonlight
Over the purple moor
And the highwayman came riding, riding, riding
Yes, the highwayman came riding
Up to the old inn door
Over the cobbles he clattered
And clashed in the darkened yard
And he tapped with his whip at the window
But all was locked and barred
So he whistled a tune to the window
And who should be waiting there
But the landlord's black eyed daughter
Bess the landlord's daughter
Plaiting a dark red love knot
Into her long black hair
One kiss, my bonny sweetheart
For I'm after a prize tonight
But I shall be back with the yellow gold
Before the morning light
Yet if they press me sharply
Harry me through the day
Oh, then look for me by moonlight
Watch for me by moonlight
And I'll come to thee by moonlight
Though Hell should bar the way
He did not come at the dawning
No, he did not come at the noon
And out of the tawny sunset
before the rise of the moon
When the road was a gypsy's ribbon
Looping the purple moor
Oh a redcoat troop came marching, marching, marching
King George's men came marching
Up to the old inn door
And they bound the landlord's daughter
with many a sniggering jest
And they bound the musket beside her
With the barrel beneath her breast
Now keep good watch and they kissed her
She heard the dead man say
""Oh look for me by moonlight
Watch for me by moonlight
And I'll come to thee by moonlight
Though Hell should bar the way""
Look for me by moonlight
Hoof beats ringing clear
Watch for me by moonlight
Were they deaf that they did not hear
For he rode on the gypsy highway
She breathed one final breath
Then her finger moved in the moonlight
Her musket shattered the moonlight
And it shattered her breast in the moonlight
And warned him with her death
Oh he turned; he spurred on to the west
He did not know who stood
Out with her black hair a flowing down
Drenched with her own red blood
Oh not 'til the dawn had he heard it
And his face grew gray to hear
How Bess the landlord's daughter
The landlord's black eyed daughter
Had watched for her love in the moonlight
And died in the darkness there
Back he spurred like a madman
Shrieking a curse to the sky
With the white road smoking behind him
And his rapier brandished high
Blood red were his spurs in the golden noon
Wine red his velvet coat
When they shot him down on the highway
Down like a dog on the highway
And he lay in his blood on the highway
With a bunch of lace at his throat
And still on a winter's night they say
When the wind is in the trees
When the moon is a ghostly galleon
Tossed upon cloudy seas
When the road is a ribbon of moonlight
Over the purple moor
Oh the highwayman comes riding, riding, riding
Yes the highwayman comes riding

Phil Ochs,"In a building of gold, with riches untold,
Lived the families on which the country was founded.
And the merchants of style, with their red velvet smiles,
Were there, for they also were hounded.

And the soft middle class crowded in to the last,
For the building was fully surrounded.
And the noise outside was the ringing of revolution.
Sadly they stared and sank in their chairs

And searched for a comforting notion.
And the rich silver walls looked ready to fall
As they shook in doubtful devotion.
The ice cubes would clink as they freshened their drinks,

Wet their minds in bitter emotion.
And they talked about the ringing of revolution.
We were hardly aware of the hardships they beared,
For our time was taken with treasure.

Oh, life was a game, and work was a shame,
And pain was prevented by pleasure.
The world, cold and grey, was so far away
In the distance only money could measure.

But their thoughts were broken by the ringing of revolution.
The clouds filled the room in darkening doom
As the crooked smoke rings were rising.
How long will it take, how can we escape

Someone asks, but no one's advising.
And the quivering floor responds to the roar,
In a shake no longer surprising.
As closer and closer comes the ringing of revolution.

Softly they moan, please leave us alone
As back and forth they are pacing.
And they cover their ears and try not to hear
With pillows of silk they're embracing.

And the crackling crowd is laughing out loud,
Peeking in at the target they're chasing.
Now trembling inside the ringing of revolution.
With compromise sway we give in half way

When we saw that rebellion was growing.
Now everything's lost as they kneel by the cross
Where the blood of christ is still flowing.
To late for their sorrow they've reached their tomorrow

And reaped the seed they were sowing.
Now harvested by the ringing of revolution.
In tattered tuxedos they faced the new heroes
And crawled about in confusion.

And they sheepishly grinned for their memoroes were dim
Of the decades of dark execution.
Hollow hands were raised; they stood there amazed
In the shattering of their illusions.

As the windows were smashed by the ringing of revolution.
Down on our knees we're begging you please,
We're sorry for the way you were driven.
There's no need to taunt just take what you want,

And we'll make amends, if we're living.
But away from the grounds the flames told the town
That only the dead are forgiven.

And they'll teach you law and order
If you dare to raise your hand
Spare the glove and spoil the man
Soldiers have their sorrow
The wretched have their rage
Pray for the aged
It's the dawn of another age
Of another age
Of another age
Thomas Paine and Jesse James are old friends
And Robin Hood is riding on the road again
We were born in a revolution and we died in a wasted war
It's gone that way before
The dogs are chasing chicken bones across the lawn
If that was an election, I'm a Viet Cong
So I pledge allegiance against the flag
and the (fall,flaw,cloth?) for which it stands
I'll raise/raze it if I can (Pledge allegiance to the land)
Soldier have their sorrow
The wretched have their rage
Pray for the aged
It's the dawn of another age
Of another age
Of another age
Of another age

Phil Ochs,"And the night comes again to the circle studded sky
The stars settle slowly, in lonliness they lie
'Till the universe expodes as a falling star is raised
Planets are paralyzed, mountains are amazed
But they all glow brighter from the briliance of the blaze
With the speed of insanity, then he dies.

In the green fields a turnin', a baby is born
His cries crease the wind and mingle with the morn
An assault upon the order, the changing of the guard
Chosen for a challenge that is hopelessly hard
And the only single sound is the sighing of the stars
But to the silence and distance they are sworn

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Images of innocence charge him go on
But the decadence of destiny is looking for a pawn
To a nightmare of knowledge he opens up the gate
And a blinding revelation is laid upon his plate
That beneath the greatest love is a hurricane of hate
And God help the critic of the dawn.

So he stands on the sea and shouts to the shore,
But the louder that he screams the longer he's ignored
For the wine of oblivion is drunk to the dregs
And the merchants of the masses almost have to be begged
'Till the giant is aware, someone's pulling at his leg,
And someone is tapping at the door.

To dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Then his message gathers meaning and it spreads across the land
The rewarding of his pain is the following of the man
But ignorance is everywhere and people have their way
Success is an enemy to the losers of the day
In the shadows of the churches, who knows what they pray
For blood is the language of the band.

The Spanish bulls are beaten; the crowd is soon beguiled,
The matador is beautiful, a symphony of style
Excitement is estatic, passion places bets
Gracefully he bows to ovations that he gets
But the hands that are applauding are slippery with sweat
And saliva is falling from their smiles

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Then this overflow of life is crushed into a liar
The gentle soul is ripped apart and tossed into the fire.
First a smile of rejection at the nearness of the night
Truth becomes a tragedy limping from the light
All the heavens are horrified, they stagger from the sight
As the cross is trembling with desire.

They say they can't believe it, it's a sacreligious shame
Now, who would want to hurt such a hero of the game?
But you know I predicted it; I knew he had to fall
How did it happen? I hope his suffering was small.
Tell me every detail, for I've got to know it all,
And do you have a picture of the pain?

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Time takes her toll and the memory fades
but his glory is broken, in the magic that he made.
Reality is ruined; it's the freeing from the fear
The drama is distorted, to what they want to hear
Swimming in their sorrow, in the twisting of a tear
As they wait for the new thrill parade.

Yes, the eyes of the rebel have been branded by the blind
To the safety of sterility, the threat has been refined
The child was created to the slaughterhouse he's led
So good to be alive when the eulogy is read
The climax of emotion, the worship of the dead
And the cycle of sacrifice unwinds.

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

And the night comes again to the circle studded sky

Phil Ochs,"Don't you think it's time that we were leaving?
For another chance, another place to start
Desperate ones that went across the ocean
And they wondered how it would all turn out.
If you have to beg or steal or borrow
Welcome to Los Angeles, City of Tomorrow
They landed on the coldest of the colonies
But still they wanted better than the rich
They built highways on the houses of the homesteads
It happened that way moving west.

And you watch them build the war machines right beside your home
And you tell me that you're ready to go marching to the war

Oh, I know you're set for fighting, but what are you fighting for? 

Before you pack your rifle and sail across the sea
Just think upon the southern part of the land that you call free
Oh, there's many kinds of slavery and we've found many more

Yes, I know you're set for fighting, but what are you fighting for? 

And before you walk out on your job and answer to the call
Just think about the millions who have no job at all
And the men who wait for handouts with their eyes upon the floor

I know you're set for fighting, but what are you fighting for? 

Turn on your TV, turn it on so loud
And watch the fool a smiling there and tell me that you're proud
And listen to your radio, the noise it starts to pour

Oh, I know you're set for fighting, but what are you fighting for? 

Read your morning papers, read every single line
And tell me if you can believe that simple world you find
Read every slanted word till your eyes are getting sore,

I know you're set for fighting, but what are you fighting for? 

And listen to your leaders, the ones that won the race
As they stand right there before you and lie into your face
If you ever try to buy them, you know what they stand for

I know you're set for fighting, but what are you fighting for? 


Put ragged clothes upon your back and sleep upon the ground
And tell police about your rights as they drag you down
And ask them as they lead you to some deserted door

Yes, I know you're set for fighting, but what are you fighting for?

But the hardest thing Ill ask you, if you will only try
Is take your children by their hands and look into their eyes
And there you'll see the answer you should have seen before

I'm going down a southern road
And if you never see me again
Remember that I had to go
Remember that I had to go

It's a short road back the other way
If the cops pull you over to the side of the road
You won't have nothing to say
No, you won't have nothing to say
There's a man waiting down in Mississippi
And he's waiting with a rifle in his hand
And he's looking down the road for an out-of-state car
And he thinks he's fighting for his land
Yes, he thinks he's fighting for his land
And he won't know the clothes I'm wearing
And he doesn't know the name that I own
But his gun is large and his hate is hard
And he knows I'm coming down the road
Yes, he knows I'm coming down the road
It's not for the glory that I'm leaving
It's not trouble that I'm looking for
But there's lots of good work calling me down
And The waiting won't do no more
No, The waiting won't do no more
Don't call me the brave one for going
No, don't pin a medal to my name
For even if there was any choice to make
I'd be going down just the same
I'd be going down just the same
For someone's got to go to Mississippi

The Hostess is enormous, she fills the room with perfume,
She meets the guests and smothers them with greetings.
And she asks ""how are you"" as she offers them a drink,
The Countess of the social grace, who never seems to blink.
And she promises to talk to you, if you promise not to think.
And my shoulders had to shrug, as I crawled beneath the rug
And retuned my piano.

The Beauty of the hour is blazing in the present,
She surrounds herself with those who would surrender.
Floating in the flattery she's a trophy-prize, caressed.
Protected by a pretty face, sometimes cursed, sometimes blessed.
And she's staring down their desires, while they're staring down her dress.
And my shoulders had to shrug, etc.

The egos shine like lightbulbs, so bright you cannot see them,
Blind each other blinder than a sandbox.
All the fury of an argument, holding back their yawns,
A challenge shakes the chandliers, the selfish swords are drawn.
To the loser go the hangups, to the victor go the hangers on.
And my shoulders had to shrug, etc.

They travel to the table, the host is served for supper,
And they pass each other for salt and pepper.
And the conversation sparkles as their wits are dipped in wine,
Dinosaurs on a diet, on each other they will dine.
Then they pick their teeth and they squelch a belch saying:
""Darling you tasted divine.""
And my shoulders had to shrug, etc.

The Wallflower is waiting, she hides behind composure.
She'd love to dance and prays that no one asks her.
Then she steals a glance at lovers while her fingers tease her hair.
And she marvels at the confidence of those who hide their fears.
Then her eyes are closed as she rides away with a foreign legionaire.
And my shoulders had to shrug, etc.

Romeo is reeling, counting notches on his thighbone,
Searching for one hundred and eleven.
And he's charming as a child as he leads them to the web,
Seducing queens and gypsy girls in the boudoir of his head.
Then he wraps himself with a tablecloth and pretends he is a bed.
And my shoulders had to shrug, etc.

The party must be over, even the Losers are leaving.
But just one doubt is nagging at my caustic mind:
So I snuck up close behind me and I gave myself a kiss,
And I led myself to the mirror to expose what I had missed.
There I saw a laughing maniac who was writing songs like this.
And my shoulders had to shrug, etc.",The Party,1996

Just across the way from Laos

But don't turn your back on your house boy
When they ring the gong, watch out for the Viet-Cong

He must have forgotten, we're only trainees
Them Commies never fight fair

Friends the very next day we trained some more
We burned some villages down to the floor
Yes we burned out the jungles far and wide
Made sure those red apes had no place left to hide
Threw all the people in relocation camps
Under lock and key, made damn sure they're free

Well I walked through the jungle and around the bend
Who should I meet but President Diem
Said you're fighting to keep Vietnam free

Over a million dollars a day
But it's worth it all, don't you see?

He did all the jobs that needed to be done
He always stood his ground when a smaller man would run

And This Land is Your Land, he wanted us to hear
And the risin'  of the unions will be sung about again
And the Deportees live on through the power of his pen

'Cause we love you

Images of innocence charge him go on
But the decadence of destiny is looking for a pawn
To a nightmare of knowledge he opens up the gate
And a blinding revelation is laid upon his plate
That beneath the greatest love is a hurricane of hate
And God help the critic of the dawn.

So he stands on the sea and shouts to the shore,
But the louder that he screams the longer he's ignored
For the wine of oblivion is drunk to the dregs
And the merchants of the masses almost have to be begged
'Till the giant is aware, someone's pulling at his leg,
And someone is tapping at the door.

To dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Then his message gathers meaning and it spreads accross the land
The rewarding of his pain is the following of the man
But ignorance is everywhere and people have their way
Success is an enemy to the losers of the day
In the shadows of the churches, who knows what they pray
For blood is the language of the band.

The Spanish bulls are beaten; the crowd is soon beguiled,
The matador is beautiful, a symphony of style
Excitement is estatic, passion places bets
Gracefully he bows to ovations that he gets
But the hands that are applauding are slippery with sweat
And saliva is falling from their smiles

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Then this overflow of life is crushed into a liar
The gentle soul is ripped apart and tossed into the fire.
First a smile of rejection at the nearness of the night
Truth becomes a tragedy limping from the light
All the (canons|heavens) are horrified, they stagger from the sight
As the cross is trembling with desire.

They say they can't believe it, it's a sacreligious shame
Now, who would want to hurt such a hero of the game?
But you know I predicted it; I knew he had to fall
How did it happen?  I hope his suffering was small.
Tell me every detail, I've got to know it all,
And do you have a picture of the pain?

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

Time takes her toll and the memory fades
but his glory is broken, in the magic that he made.
Reality is ruined; it's the freeing from the fear
The drama is distorted, to what they want to hear
Swimming in their sorrow, in the twisting of a tear
As they wait for a new thrill parade.

The eyes of the rebel have been branded by the blind
To the safety of sterility, the threat has been refined
The child was created to the slaughterhouse he's led
So good to be alive when the eulogy is read
The climax of emotion, the worship of the dead
And the cycle of sacrifice unwinds.

So dance dance dance
Teach us to be true
Come dance dance dance
'Cause we love you

And the night comes again to the circle studded sky
The stars settle slowly, in loneliness they lie
'Till the universe expodes as a falling star is raised
Planets are paralyzed, mountains are amazed
But they all glow brighter from the briliance of the blaze
With the speed of insanity, then he died.

Phil Ochs,"Lost in the valley of vaults/dolls/Oz(?)
Fell from the path, it was nobody's fault
That I was alone.
Time dripped from the trees

Left through the nail (I leapt through alamp/land/lap/laugh(?) (?))
I fell to my knees before the throne
And the crown was covered jewels, sparkling schools
The beautiful fauns/falls/(?)

The magnificent battle was fought
And Cinderella's soldier fish was caught
And the lady from the lake
Who helped me to escape

Led me to myself at last
Though I danced with the dolls in the doll house
The flower fled from my feet,
Tom Sawyer voice through the hole of the key,

Landed so gently.
Castles cover the cave,
I had no choice, the visions were brave
And the phantoms were friendly,

And Pirate Jenny was dancing for pennies,
The knucklebones tossed in a spin,
There were silver songs on her skin.
And she wasn't caring when the ship came in.

And the lady from the lake
Helped me to escape
Led me to myself at last,
Though I danced with the dolls in the doll house

My costume dropped to the floor,
Naked at last, I couldn't fight any-more,
And the service was rendered.
A poem fell from the wine, buried the past.

The future was mine and the present sur-rendered.
And the ballet master is beckoning faster,
The ballerina was posed, in the fragile beauty we froze.
Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go.

And the lady from the lake
Who helped me to escape
Left me with myself at last

Phil Ochs,"The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees,
The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,
The road was a ribbon of moonlight, over the purple moor,
And the highwayman came riding-
Riding-riding-
The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.

He'd a french cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,
A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin;
They fitted with never a wrinkle: his boots were up to the thigh!
And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,
His pistol butts a-twinkle,
His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.

Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard,
And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred;
He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there
But the landlord's black-eyed daughter,
Bess, the landlord's daughter,
Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.

And dark in the old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked
Where tim the ostler listened; his face was white and peaked;
His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay,
But he loved the landlord's daughter,
The landlord's red-lipped daughter,
Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say-

""one kiss, my bonny sweetheart, i'm after a prize to-night,
But i shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light;
Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day,
Then look for me by moonlight,
Watch for me by moonlight,
I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.""

He rose upright in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand,
But she loosened her hair i' the casement! his face burnt like a brand
As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast;
And he kissed its waves in the moonlight,
(oh, sweet black waves in the moonlight!)
Then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the west.

He did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon;
And out o' the tawny sunset, before the rise o' the moon,
When the road was a gipsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor,
A red-coat troop came marching-
Marching-marching-
King george's men came marching, up to the old inn-door.

They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead,
But they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed;
Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side!
There was death at every window;
And hell at one dark window;
For bess could see, through the casement, the road that he would ride.

They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest;
They bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast!
""now keep good watch!"" and they kissed her.
She heard the dead man say-
Look for me by moonlight;
Watch for me by moonlight;
I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way!

Iv
She twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good!
She writhed her hands till here fingers were wet with sweat or blood!
They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like
Years,
Till, now, on the stroke of midnight,
Cold, on the stroke of midnight,
The tip of one finger touched it! the trigger at least was hers!

V
The tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest!
Up, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast,
She would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again;
For the road lay bare in the moonlight;
Blank and bare in the moonlight;
And the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love's refrain.

Vi
Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! had they heard it? the horse-hoofs
Ringing clear;
Tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? were they deaf that they did
Not hear?
Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill,
The highwayman came riding,
Riding, riding!
The red-coats looked to their priming! she stood up strait and still!

Vii
Tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! tlot-tlot, in the echoing night
!
Nearer he came and nearer! her face was like a light!
Her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath,
Then her finger moved in the moonlight,
Her musket shattered the moonlight,
Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him-with her death.

Viii
He turned; he spurred to the west; he did not know who stood
Bowed, with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood!
Not till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear
How bess, the landlord's daughter,
The landlord's black-eyed daughter,
Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there.

Ix
Back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky,
With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!
Blood-red were his spurs i' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat,
When they shot him down on the highway,
Down like a dog on the highway,
And he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.

* * * * * *
X
And still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees,
When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas,
When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,
A highwayman comes riding-
Riding-riding-
A highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.

Xi
Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard,
And he taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred;
He whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there

And the Howard Johnson food is made of fear

And everyone's inviting

To bid farewell so I can knuckle to my knees
But I'll be back again no matter where I go
For it's only love that frees the fire for burning
Then I'll take you in my arms and tell you all I know
As I sing the early song of my returning

The weary world is waiting for ambition to be played
Now young and not afraid
I've got to challenge every chalice that I know
My eager ears are listening for the singing of the sign
Deeper are the lines
Upon the face that finds reflections in the road
Yes, I'll be back again no matter where I go
For it's only love that frees the fire for burning
Then I'll take you in my arms and tell you all I know
As I sing the changing song of my returning

My drifting days prepare me to do battle with the night
A phantom of the fight
I've got conquer all the courage of my fears
The answer lies in limbo(?) and the harvest will be hard
But sacred are the scars
That leave their mark on the fast disolving years
Yes, I'll be back again no matter where I go
For it's only love that frees the fire for burning
Then I'll take you in my arms and tell you all I know
As I sing the growing song of my returning

Time must have her victory
It's that I've always known
But I won or lost alone
And when a voice calls out ""there's someone you must meet""
With every strength remaining
I will suffer one more scene
I'll gather all my dreams
And with my final breath
I'll lay them at your feet.

Phil Ochs,"Who's that coming down the road
A sailor from the sea
He looks a lot like me
I'd know him anywhere, had to stare 

Feathers at his fingertips
A halo 'round his spine
He must have lost his mind
He should be put away, right away

In the corner of the night
He handed me his waterpipe
His eyes were searching deep inside my head
Here's what he said

Sorry I can't stop and talk now
I'm in kind of a hurry anyhow
But I'll send you a tape from California
New York city has exploded and it's crashed upon my head

I dove beneath the bed
Fighting, biting nails, turning pale
The landlord's at my window
And the burglar's at my door

I can't take it anymore
I guess I'll have to fly, it's worth a try
Someone's banging on the wall
But there's no party to recall

The singer of the shadows of his soul
So he's been told
Sorry I can't stop and talk now
I'm in kind of a hurry anyhow

But I'll send you a tape from California
From the mirror of my mantle to the velvet on my bed
Trapped upon a stolen stage, a Barrymore at best(?)
My rhymes are all repeating, ballads growing blind

Words have turned to water, the women turned to wine
The draft board is debating if they'd like to take my life
I'd sooner take a wife and have raise a child or two
Wouldn't you?

Peace has turned to poison
The flag has blown a fuse
Even courage is confused
And now all the brave are in the grave

Century is bending(?)
Have a very happy ending
To the victor go the ashes of the spoil
Seeds in the soil

Sorry I can't stop and talk now
I'm in kind of a hurry anyhow
But I'll send you a tape from California
The flower-power fuller brush man

Is farming out his friends
I stabbed him with my stem
And then I tapped his toes with my rose
He crawled around inside himself

Now he's crawling after me
Dropping acid in my tea
He wants to save his soul
Rock and roll

One of us must understand
It's not the drug that makes the man
Then a poster of a movie star walked by
He must have been high

Sorry I can't stop and talk now
I'm in kind of a hurry anyhow
But I'll send you a tape from California
Half the world is crazy and the other half is scared

Maddonas do the minuet for the naked millionaires
The anarchists are rising while we're racing for the moon
It doesn't take a seer to see that the scene is coming soon
So who's that coming down the road

A sailor from the sea
He looks a lot like me
I'd know him anywhere
Had to stare

A fire around his fingertips
A song around his spine
He must have found his mind
He should be put away

Anyway
Surrounded by the slaughter
Now I'm boarding(?) at the border
When the echoes of my ecstasy appear

Phil Ochs,"Over the ashes of blood marched the civilized soldiers,
Over the ruins of the french fortress of a failure
Over the silent screams of the dead and the dying
Saying please be reassured, we seek no wider war.
The treaties were signed, the country was split into sections
But growing numbers of prisons were built for protection
Rapidly filling with people who called for elections
But please be reassured, we seek no wider war.
Ngo Dinh diem was the puppet who danced for the power
The hero of hate who gambled on hell for his hour
Father of his country was stamped on the medals we showered
But please be reassured, we seek no wider war.
Machine gun bullets became the bloody baptizers
And the falcon copters don't care if someone's the wiser
But the boy in the swamp didn't know he was killed by advisers
So please be reassured, we seek no wider war.
And fires were spitting at forests in defoliation
While the people were pressed into camps not called concentration
And the greater the victory the greater the shame of the nation
But please be reassured, we seek no wider war.
While we were watching the prisoners were tested by torture
And vicious and violent gasses maintained the order
As the finest Washington minds found slogans for slaughter 
But please be reassured, we seek no wider war.
Then over the border came the bay of pigs planes of persuasion
All remaining honor went up in flames of invasion
But the shattered schools never learned that it's not escalation
But please be reassured, we seek no wider war.
We're teaching freedom for which they are yearning
While were dragging them down to the path of never returning
But, we'll condescend to talk while the cities are burning
But please be reassured, we seek no wider war.
And the evil is done in hopes that evil surrenders
But the deeds of the devil are burned too deep in the embers
And a world of hunger in vengeance will always remember

Phil Ochs,"In the fire blue forests, faded and forgotten
I crawled through the cotton fields, picking for cotton
The overseer sneered, his whipping was rotten
With ecstasy.

I'm child-like terror I tore out the tap roots
Cards of the lash were calling to follow suit
I dashed for the swamps, the hounds in hot pursuit
Jealously.

All through the night a figure of fright, as I hid my head
And the buried their nose in a cut of my cloths, now torn in shreds
And they never would leave until they believed that I was dead
But I'd never curse their names

Oh, who am I to blame
I know I'd do the same
Endlessly.
And all the high-born ladies

So lovely and so true,
Have been handed to the soldiers
When in Rome do as the Romans do.
Frail and afraid in the mists of the morning

The snakes and the spiders were sadly performing
The bark of the dogs kept up the warning
Inside the wood.
Sweating and swearing I crawled from the manger

The highway appeared to take me from danger
Is there anyone here who would pick up a stranger?
Oh I wish you could.
Then someone replied ""would you like a ride?""

""Come in"" he said.
We drove for a while, he gave me a smile and a piece of bread
The hammer was hard in the chrome of the car as I cracked his head
Then we took off in a spin

Oh I smashed his skull again
Oh thank you my good friend,
I feel so good.
And all the high-born ladies

So lovely and so true,
Have been handed to the soldiers
When in Rome do as the Romans do.
Late in the evening I came to the city

I fell to the sidewalks sighing for pity
A diamond was dropped from the hands of the pretty
To be so kind.
Cowards and corpses were busy competing

The rhymes of the riots were busy repeating
I raced to the corner and sped(?) from the speeding
To save my mind.
Latches and locks, companies of cops ran from the rain

There was silk in the stores for the whims of the whores
That shone with shame.
I asked for a light from a priest in the night
Then I fanned the flames.

And the traffic all stood still
To see if someone had been killed
I was glad to leave a thrill
So far behind.

And all the high-born ladies
So lovely and so true,
Have been handed to the soldiers
When in Rome do as the Romans do.

A monk and his mother were dancing so dandy
A topless nun was handing out candy
The beautiful bishop broke out the brandy
The kiss we crave.

They stuttered and stammered, would I feel like staying
We fell to our knees, feverishly praying
the salt in the salt-peter seemed to be saying
Be brave, be brave.

I reached reached for a robe, I preached and I probed
And I taught the tune.
And the greed for the gills was played to the hilt
As I promised doom

I toyed with their fears, until coins and tears filled the room
Then I took off down the road
Laughing madly like a toad
God bless every soulless soul

That would be saved.
And all the high-born ladies
So lovely and so true,
Have been handed to the soldiers

When in Rome do as the Romans do.
A chorus of children were passing the hours
I joined in their fun and gave them my flowers
Covered with kisses and showered with showers

That they repaid.
Taken and trusting, would I be their teacher?
She looked so appealing, I wanted to touch her
Just out of reach, unable to reach her

Their hands were raised.
Charmed by the chalk, the lessons were taught, inside the class
They studied the rules of the samurai schools, they had to pass
The room was adjourned, the lessons were learned,

I turned on the gas
And I watched them make their pleas
They passed the test with ease
I gave them their degrees,

They made the grade.
And all the high-born ladies
So lovely and so true,
Have been handed to the soldiers

When in Rome do as the Romans do.
Feeling my weakness, a coward for company
I joined the ranks of the hot and hungry
To teach what it means to have love for your country

We marched away.
We lowered our lives for the lines of a border
We danced with the mothers, played with the daughters
We followed our fantasies, following orders

It was child's play.
After the war the bullets were bored so we capped the game
With cynical smiles we put them on trial to place the blame
Now what kind of beast would love such a feast

Have you no shame?
So we hung the by the feet
Oh, we shot them in the street
Oh, the victory was sweet

on victory day.
And all the high-born ladies
So lovely and so true,
Have been handed to the soldiers

When in Rome do as the Romans do.
The bread and the circuses came to be nearing
The Saviour or somebody must be appearing
Pagans and pageants were all disappearing

Inside my head.
The stones on the statues were staring and stalling
Caesar and Cassius were cursing and calling
The empire had risen and now it was falling

Or so it seemed.
The crown and the cross seemed empty and lost in dark despair
And luminous lies, death in disguise were everywhere
The canvas was cold, the story was old, I said my prayers

Then I crowned him on the head
Oh, I blessed him as he bled
Oh At last, the king is dead
God save the queen.

And all the high-born ladies
So lovely and so true,
Have been handed to the soldiers
When in Rome do as the Romans do.

Now nothing remained for building or burning
The losing of lovers was all I was learning
A time for escape and a time for returning had come to me
Back through the ashes and back through the embers

Back through the roads and the ruins I remembered
My hands at my side I sadly surrendered
Do as you please.
The hero was home, proven and grown, I fell on the floor

Mad with romance they started to dance, their star was born
I bled like the rain, exploded in pain, then I screamed for more
Oh, make me feel sublime
Release me from my mind

Oh, Kill me one more time
And set me free.
And all the high-born ladies
So lovely and so true,

Have been handed to the soldiers

In Lincoln Park the dark was turning
I spied a fair young maiden and a flame was in her eyes
And on her face lay the steel blue skies
Of Lincoln Park, the dark was turning
Turning

They spread their sheets upon the ground just like a wandering tribe
And the wise men walked in their Robespierre robes
Through Lincoln Park the dark was turning
The towers trapped and trembling, and the boats were tossed about
When the fog rolled in and the gas rolled out
From Lincoln Park the dark was turning
Turning

Like wild horses freed at last we took the streets of wine
But I searched in vain for she stayed behind
In Lincoln Park the dark was turning
I'll go back to the city where I can be alone
And tell my friend she lies in stone

Phil Ochs,"Sit by my side, come as close as the air,
Share in a memory of gray;
Wander in my words, dream about the pictures
That I play of changes.

Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall
To brown and to yellow they fade.
And then they have to die, trapped within
The circle time parade of changes.

Scenes of my young years were warm in my mind,
Visions of shadows that shine.
'Til one day I returned and found they were the
Victims of the vines of changes.

The world's spinning madly, it drifts in the dark
Swings through a hollow of haze,
A race around the stars, a journey through
The universe ablaze with changes.

Moments of magic will glow in the night
All fears of the forest are gone
But when the morning breaks they're swept away by
Golden drops of dawn, of changes.

Passions will part to a strange melody.
As fires will sometimes burn cold.
Like petals in the wind, we're puppets to the silver
Strings of souls, of changes.

One last cup of wine we will pour
And I'll kiss you one more time, and leave you on

A sentire dentro il cuore un altro battito
E si perderà
Per un bacio dato già
Quella voglia di giocare con le bambole
Cambierà il sapore delle lacrime
Se promette e poi non ti telefona
E la vita sembrerà
Una nave già affondata per metà

E ti inventerai quella solita bugia

Quando insieme a lui
Fino all'alba resterai
Per scoprire dove nasce il primo brivido

E ti stringerà d'inverno dentro un cinema in città
E all'uscita della scuola tutti i giorni aspetterà
Ti regalerà dentro il cammino dell'età

Coi capelli un po' più corti quando lui ritornerà
Sarai pronta a far l'amore questa volta non soltanto per metà

Ci saranno crisi da difendere
Colpa di un'amica troppo stupida
E se lui non chiamerà
Il tuo orgoglio piangerà

Ti regalerà dentro il cammino dell'età
Due parole senza cuore quella storia finirà
E ti sentirai morire per le cose date già
Dove poggerai lo sguardo tutto gli assomiglierà
Ti regalerà dentro il cammino dell'età
Quella rabbia di sapere se stavolta ci sarà
Taglierai tutte le foto e strappando solo lui
Sarà come una vendetta contro chi ha strappato tutti i sogni tuoi

Proprio nel momento in cui non ci credevi più
Tornerà quel sole dentro l'anima
E darai colore un'altra volta al cielo blu
E potrai capire che la vita dà di più

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,1997

When I pursued, you played the game, I know
But if I keep my feeling strong, I'll find the song you sing
Though I can't tell, we're world's apart and in my heart it's clear

I was born to love you

Such a lovely face with a warm and tender smile
Though I want you so, somethin' deep inside keeps sayin'
(No, no, no)

Can my mind be playin' games?
Am I so betrayed that my heart and mind
Can never be the same again?

But it was Just my imagination,
once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo
 
Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah)
A cozy little home out in the country with two children maybe three.
I tell you I can visualize it all 
this couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems;
But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.

Phil Perry,"She's faced the hardest times
you could imagine
and many times her eyes fought back the tears
and when her youthful world 
was about to fall in
each time her slender shoulders
bore the weight of all her fears
and a sorrow no one hears
still rings in midnight silence, 
in her ears

Let her cry, for she's a lady
let her dream, for she's a child
let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower, 
growing wild

and if by chance I should hold her
let me hold her for a time
but if allowed just one possession
I would pick her from the garden, 
to be mine

Be careful how you touch her, 
for she'll awaken
and sleep's the only freedom that she knows
and when you walk into her eyes, 
you won't believe
the way she's always paying
for a debt she never owes
and a silent wind still blows
that only she can hear and so she goes

Let her cry, for she's a lady
let her dream, for she's a child

Listen to the wheels go clickety clack,
Over the bridge, around the bend,
Taking me for a ride.

Now we sit here in the passenger car,
And the freight car's next in line,
And way in back is the little caboose,
Rolling along behind.

And people stand by the railroad side,
And wave to us as we go by,
Over the bridge, around the bend,
Taking me for a ride.

The train is rolling down the track,
Listen to the wheels go clickety clack,
Over the bridge, around the bend,
Taking me for a ride.

Phil Rosenthal,"In the jungle, at the hour of midnight,
That's when the animals come out to play.

High in the treetops, creatures are swinging.
Chattering gaily, they seem to shout.
""Try and catch us -- we're way too nimble.""
It's the monkeys, dancing about.

Chorus

Now the large cats are joining the party.
First comes the cheetah, the fastest of all.
Next is the tiger, the lynx, then the leopard.
They prowl through the jungle and they give their call.

Chorus

Into the clearing, quiet and graceful
Comes a tall spotted creature and her baby calf.
Her legs are slender, her long neck is turning.
She towers above them all -- the tall giraffe.

Chorus

Slithering slowly, scales on their bodies.
Long and slender, they crawl on the ground.
Tongues a-darting, wiggling gaily,
The snakes join the party, but they don't make a sound.

Chorus

Into the clearing comes a large gray creature.
The ground is shaking as he starts to run
Round in a circle with his long trunk waving.
It's the elephant, joining the fun.

Chorus

Off in the shadows, still and quiet,
His long mane is flowing and he's standing tall.
When he's angry, he'll roar like thunder.
It's the lion and he's king of them all.

Chorus

Those come-what-may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails

With distingue traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah yes, I was wrong
Again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Stifling those who strive
So I'll live a lush life in some small dive

Of those whose lives are lonely too",Lush Life,1994

Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so

Phil Sheeran,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2000

Phil Silvers,"This is the strip polka
I adore this ?

There's a burlesque theater where the gang loves to go
To see queenie the cutie of the burlesque show
And the thrill of the evening is when out queenie skips
And the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off, take it off"", cries a voice from the rear
""Take it off, take it off"", soon it's all you can hear
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops and always just in time

She's as fresh and as wholesome as the flowers in May
And she hopes to retire to the farm someday
But you can't buy a farm until you're up in the chips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

""Take it off, take it off"", all the customers shout
""Down in front, down in front"", while the band beats it out
But she's always a lady even in pantomime
So she stops and always just in time

Queenie, queen of them all
Queenie, someday you'll fall
Someday church bells will chime
In strip polka time

Oh, she hates corny waltzes and she hates the gavotte
And there's one big advantage if the music's hot
It's a fast moving exit just in case something rips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

Drop around, take it in, it's the best in the west
""Take it off, take it off, take it off"", you can yell like the rest
Take her out when it's over, she's a peach when she's dressed
But she stops and always just in time, time, time

Queenie, queen of them all
Queenie, someday you'll fall
Someday church bells will chime
In strip polka time",Strip Polka,1999

Of a million little green fingers stretching to the sky

You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright,
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee

Phil Spector,"Hello, this is Phil Spector, it is so difficult at this time 
To say words that would express my feelings 
About the album to which you have just listened 
An album that has been in the planning for many, many months

First, let me thank all the people who worked so hard with me 
In the production of this album and in my endeavor and desire 
To bring something new and different to the music of Christmas 
And to the recording industry which is so much a part of my life

Of course, the biggest thanks goes to you 
For giving me the opportunity to relate my feelings 
Of Christmas through the music that I love

At this moment, I am very proud of all the artists 
And on behalf of all of them, The Crystals, The Ronettes 
Darlene Love, Bobby Soxx and the Blue Jeans, and myself

May we wish you the very merriest of Christmases 
And the happiest of New Years, and thank you so very much 
For letting us spend this Christmas with you

In the production of this album and in my endeavor and desire 
To bring something new and different to the music of Christmas 
And to the recording industry which is so much a part of my life

Of course, the biggest thanks goes to you 
For giving me the opportunity to relate my feelings 
Of Christmas through the music that I love

At this moment, I am very proud of all the artists 
And on behalf of all of them, The Crystals, The Ronettes 
Darlene Love, Bobby Soxx and the Blue Jeans, and myself

And the happiest of New Years, and thank you so very much

I guess I'll go through life

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair

Phil Sunkel,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1956

Only the best out the Likwit Crew out the west 
And we shine time after time writting lyri-gets 
On freshly buffed and waxed marble steps 
Defari got a stlye that's iller than Tourrettes 
Make you switch, make a bitch get undressed 
Make people in the club want to dance chest to chest 
Bruised falcon, strive for perfection like Malcolm 
Back the name wit potential, but now they know the outcome 
So now the ticket's weakened, I stay away from tricks

I want my gold plaque for this shit 
Soon as the stores get it (you get it) 
Focused Daily, Likwit activity 
Phil Da Agony causing you total tragedy 

My chest is burning from the Hennesy rock 
Yo I live to see the enemy drop

It's political, the way I smash down is pitiful 
Situation critical, barely breathin in a hospital 
Dead meat, we give it like professional athletes 
The elite wit a chick for everyday of the week 
I'm talking Monday through Sunday 
Models walkin up and down the runway 
I take a lethal role in the gunplay 
To finish wit flyin colors, Tha Alkaholik brothers 
Connected, respect it, ain't no choice but to love us 
It's not, east to west, I want the whole world behind me 
I got niggas in L.A. sayin ""Fuck Guiliani"" 

I'm hella-cocky on the mic, I fuck it up on jeep beats 
So while you rockin to this beat, the beat is rockin to me 
Foul-mouth CaTashTrophe, I knock heads since '93 
So when you come across my style, it's like you smacked into a tree 
I turn the heat up in this bitch, I make the women strip fast 
So no matter what you do you can't fuck wit Big Tash 
I came to kick your ass, quick fast, not to house you 
I want your homies saying ""Tash smacked the shit out you""

This that shit that's on your baby momma's Christmas list

Even though we underrated 
Yo, it's to the Ro, act a fool over flow 
I got the uncanny ability to cold rock a show 
I got fired from my job 'cause I was late to my shift 
'Cause I was drinkin a fifth, wit John Jingle Heimer Smith 
And here's another caper from the lyric landscaper 
I write flows wit two by fo's wit sand paper 
Now what is a MC if he can't flow 
Up next is E-Swift and my name is J-Ro 

We don't give a fuck if you down wit such and such 
You can still get touched, by the Likwit bumrush 
Better train hard before you face me 
You better off fightin Royce Gracey 
To get me out that ass you gotta mace me 
I make MCs want to tap out, before I blow they back out 
Likwit niggas winnin every bout 
Rippin MCs like cheap jeans 
Fuck your DJ and your mainstream production team

Smoke this blunt
Yo, everybody grab a seat, welcome to smoke fest '99

As you can see admission was free this smoke fest this year
All the weed you see is free, but the blunts cost sixty bucks baby
(sixty bucks? ? !!)

Catashtraphe, I shoot it through, dipped in twenty-four karats
If y'all niggas don't feel me, then I blame it on your parents
'cause tash fuck it up, don't twist it up wit luck
My style is cold like I bought it off the icecream truck
Listen here, tash be crashin niggas wit my beer
Tash be partied down as fuck swingin off the chandelier
Tash be here, tash be there
Tash be everywhere it's poppin
I'm here to let you know fuckin wit me's not an option
'cause tash is my name, tash'll start it wit a bang
Tash'll end it wit a *gun shots* that's not the same thing
Tash'll split your frame, tash swings like gold chains
I be rollin wit king t, and we all in the same game
But enough about catash, let's talk about some skrill
You know it's bout to pop if likwit crew is on the bill
You can ask my nigga phil how real this is, the weed

Higher soul but to please myself I gotta be composin that fly shit
And you notifying alkaholiks daily
So punk mufucker you better dub bitch
What do you need boy, rap and some my boys are still in the trap

I can be the player you wanna bust wit
Or nigga you don't even wanna go fuck wit
Or nup wit, you suck dick, so why you all up on my nuts quick
I hold the microphone and that's wit a vice grip
Really tightly, and I'm keepin the words crystal clear
So you gon' correct when you try to bite thee
Very nicely, aquemini my nigga, not a pisces
But I likely, gon' fetch a sack of that green stuff
While I write g, yeah yeah right

[dre]
Yeah, check this out yeah
Hard life, now picture this
A nigga in jail, rappin while his folk in the next cell
Tappin wit some spoons, we do rank the boom boom
Fresh off a planet wit sand dunes and maroon moons
Soakin wet wounds, titty tanglin tunes
Musty under arms, soul shlong charm
Bump off in the drums, rhythm on the one
Stankonious under smellin where I'm comin from son
The day you bone is when you start to die
The time in between us will mean the most, I toast my high
Shit gets so bad, I know it make you wanna cry
But suck it up, button up, go ahead and do your thing
For I'm already high

For chronic ironic, growin the hydroponic
We got it, robotic hits you on melodic tricks of sonic
Smoke fest, expandin your chest
Buddah bless best, for you to step back 'cause your lyrics are like cess weed
Yes indeed, the session you need to retrieve it
It's ten niggas in a circle smokin a spliff, believe it
Retrieve it, over the counter, can you conceive it
I give you doctor greenthumb digits, don't repeat it
The brew crew and the buddah masters together
Gettin you higher and fuckin you up that much faster
Six sacks, blunt leafs, pipes and bong-bowls
All be gettin smoked at the buddah head shows
Excuse me if it seems too complicated
The herb I hold is platinum while yours is nickel plated
Let me mash out, I'm breakin the stash out, the hash out
I roll into the studio and smoke my nigga tash out

Phil Turcio,"I can't take this situation
It's making me feel so blue
One moment you walked into my life
And now you're saying that we're through
I hear that you're in love now
Oh babe I don't know what to say
I can't believe that I still feel this way
I hear that you're in love now
Oh babe I don't know what to say
But before you decide that you won't be mine
You'd better put yourself in my place

You know the circle will come around
You're gonna put yourself in my place
When your lovers bring you down 
And there's no one else around
You're gonna put yourself in my place

There's no rhyme or reason
That keeps me playing along
I guess that I keep believing
Inside you, love will know right from wrong
I hear that you're in love now
Oh babe I don't know what to say
But before you decide that you won't be mine
You'd better put yourself in my place

You know the circle  will come around
You're gonna put yourself in my place

And there's no one else around
You're gonna put yourself in my place",Put Yourself in My Place,2005
Phil Tweed,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2008
Phil Upchurch,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,
Phil Upchurch,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so

You'd be so nice by the fire

Under an August moon shining above
You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise

Phil Upchurch,"Would you like to ride in my beautiful balloon?
Would you like to glide in my beautiful balloon?
We could float among the stars together, you and I

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon

The world's a nicer place in my beautiful balloon
It wears a nicer face in my beautiful balloon
We can sing a song and sail along the silver sky

For we can fly, we can fly
Up, up and away
My beautiful, my beautiful balloon

Suspended under a twilight canopy
We'll search the clouds for a star to guide us
If by some chance you find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hid us, keep the moon beside us

Love is waiting there in my beautiful balloon
Way up in the air in my beautiful balloon
If you'll hold my hand we'll chase your dream across the sky
For we can fly, we can fly

Phil Upchurch,"What goes up must come down
Spinning Wheel got to go 'round
Talkin' 'bout your troubles
It's a cryin' sin
Ride a painted pony
Let the Spinning Wheel spin
You got no money, you got no home
Spinning Wheel all alone
Talkin' 'bout your troubles and you
You never learn
Ride a painted pony
Let the Spinning Wheel turn
Did you find your directing sign 
On the straight and narrow highway
Would you mind a reflecting sign?
Just let it shine within your mind
And show you the colors that are real
Someone is waiting just for you
Spinning Wheel spinning true
Drop all you troubles by the river side",Spinning Wheel,1969
Phil Upchurch,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
