Clifford Brown,"I say I'll move the mountains
And I'll move the mountains
If he wants them out of the way
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love, I say

I say I'll go through fire
And I'll go through fire
As he wants it, so it will be
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love, you see

Like the wind that shakes the bough
He moves me with a smile
The difficult I'll do right now
The impossible will take a little while
I say I'll care forever
And I mean forever
If I have to hold up the sky
Crazy he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love am I","Crazy He Calls Me [Live in Los Angeles,1954]",2007
Clifford Brown,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself: this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear:
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear:
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",. I've Got You Under My Skin,2008
Clifford Brown,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,

Clifford Brown,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Clifford Brown,"What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?

I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw it away
That's why I ask the Lord in Heaven above

Clifford Brown All Stars,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,
Clifford Brown Quartet,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,1953
Clifford Brown Quartet,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true

But even if he does you can believe me

I'll go on lovin' my Jim",Jim,1996

Always hear when you sigh

But they are such a chosen few.
And clover being green is something I've never seen

Clifford Davis,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part
",Canadian Sunset,1974
Clifford Davis,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1974
Clifford Davis,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty,2003
Clifford Gilberto Rhythm Combination,"I can't quite remember the month nor date
Nothing was gwan and I was jammin' round my gate
Started friending for a Jack but had no cash
I had no choice to piggy-bank or trash

It was me and my bold self with five bags of coppers
Splashed out on the counter at PJ Patel's
He's far from happy with my method of pay
I shrug my shoulders, I'm like what can you say?

It's money, ain't it? I ain't begging you jack
And mood I'm in, I might just give you a slap
I grip my Jack's and I leave in peace
As I stepped through the door he heard the kiss of my teeth

Minding my own business, rolling down the street
I swear I heard a female voice call my name
I stopped for a second loud as Charmaine
Some sis I used to park with from way back when
We weren't on no bone tip, just real good friends

We on some hug up and kiss, boy she looking neat
Head to toe in new gowns and two new gold teeth
I said, ""What you want?"" And she says, ""This and that
Well, come around my yard and let's crack this six-pack""

Back at my yard we heavy chilling, killing time
Exchanging views and getting thoughts off the mind
For three whole hours everything was cool
Around quarter to twelve they took the strangest twist

I'm looking in her face, I swear it looks off
She's sweating like she dipping in some horse's trough
Then she flips out, screaming quick, I hit a last
Trying to kick this brown but it's busting my arse

Seems like the planet gone mad
What you staring in my face for?
I told you dudes, I can't save ya
What the frigg is with this strange behavior?
Strange behavior

Charmaine the headstrong, proud Miss Missy
Fell for the local fluff dealer, she were living the high life
Sitting in the luxury's lap
Little did she know she were braving a trap

'Cause the thug that she loved was a two-bit thug
The notes that she speed with were dripping blood
She were mesmerized by the rude boy charm
Two years had passed, she thought she's safe from harm

But the past has strange way of rearing its head
Just when she think it were dusted and dead
It's like petrol bombs come flying through the window
'Cause there's a ten grand price on his life

Ready to be cashed when his heartbeat ceases
All that he tried, he can't get no peace
Cause he's running from the beast, running from the crims
After all's said and done it's the beast that wins

Whyil in on borrowed time, soon to get nabbed
Two keys of fluff that he just did grab
When her man got nicked, Lord knows she couldn't cope
Started hitting the bottle, started tying the rope

Now she's trapped in the chains of the oldest trade
Flashing her vag' in my face and I'm far from keen
I don't want got business with no drugsman's queen
Nahmean?

Seems like the planet gone mad
What you staring in my face for?
I told you dudes, I can't save ya
What the frigg is with this strange behavior?

Clifford Greenwood,"When you come to the end of a perfect day
And you sit alone with your thought
While the chimes ring out with a carol gay
For the joy that the day has brought
Do you think what the end of a perfect day
Can mean to a tired heart
When the sun goes down with a flaming ray
And the dear friends have to part?

Well this is the end of a perfect day,
Near the end of a journey too.
But it leaves a thought that is big and strong,
With a wish that is kind and true.
For memory has painted this perfect day,
With colors that never fade.
And we find at the end of a perfect day,
The soul of a friend we've made.","I Still Suits Me, song (from 1936 film ""Show Boat"") [From Show Boat]",2001

I'll try to come so quickly lest you die.

But now the situation's getting out of hand
I'm not sure I want to be buried in the sand
But if I try to disassociate from you
There's something I could do to get across to you
I've got just one more move to make you sit right up and see
I'll hang myself upon your cherry tree.

But if you share my coat-hanger then I'll be hung on you
If you try to break my neck we're through, through
Just you wait till it gets dark the time will soon go by

And when I speak to you you never here a sound
You say I ought to have more sense than hang around
But if I try to disassociate from you
There's nothing I could do to make you less untrue
So I'll just go and stage my best performance yet to-date
And hang myself upon your garden gate.

The moment I met you, I swear.
I felt as if something, somewhere, 
Had happened to me, which I couldn't see.
And then, the moment I met you, again.
I knew in my heart that we were friends.
It had to be so, it couldn't be no.
 
But try as hard as I might do, I don't know why.

Words mean so little when you look up and smile.
I don't care what people say, to me you're more than a child.

I found it at Amoeba it's the Green CD
Bill: No doubt kid, what's your name?
Lars: It's MC Lars
Bill: Word, Howie Abrams is a mutual friend of ours
He played me your joint Lars: What'd you think of it?
Bill: I think it's bugged out, it's hot
Lars: Thanks, I like your last record a lot. Your lyrics are
Graphic, much like your brother Necro, is he psycho?
Bill: I don't know, it really depends though
He's Psychological, half psycho, half logical,
Half businessman, half put-them-in-the-hospital
Lars: Business and art, there's a very fine line
There's the person that you are
And the person when you rhyme
But the best MC's bring both intertwined
Bill: I agree, that's when the best of both worlds collide
When the realness pops off one time for your mind,
And your words cause the people in the crowd to riot

CHORUS
As many places I've been. As many people I've met
As many haters I've dissed. There's people that I respect
As many times as I've failed. As many times as I've won
As many lives as I touch. The dialogue has begun

Bill: I grew up on heavy metal and hip-hop
The energy was the same to me, it was insane to me
It made me want to rage against the machine
Pick up a guitar and scream into the mic like Run-DMC
Lars: Nine Inch Nails, Primus, “Weird Al,” and King Missile
Influenced me like a postmodern epistle
Geeked out on my Performa looping digital drums
Playing rock guitar in punk bands just for fun
Who's your favorite rapper? Bill: Rakim, G Rap and Kane
KRS, EPMD, NWA, Public Enemy, Shante and LL Cool J
I could keep naming MC's all day,
What type of metal stuff you listen to?
Lars: Old school Slayer CD's, Biohazard and
Bile were the bands for me
The first time that I ever heard Chuck D
Was the Anthrax CD, “Attack of the Killer B's”… chorus!

REPEAT CHORUS
Lars: So Bill, what's your take on censorship?
Politicians on a church/state fusion tip?
Bill: I speaks my mind while kids I went to high school with
Bleed on the sands of Kabul hit, it's bullshit,
Lars what you think of it?
Lars: Out in Iraq, a lack of dialogue
Between the people is whack!
Bill: In fact I speak militant like Black Panthers
These gas prices got my people
With seeds having to gank pampers
Lars: The answer is not plutocracy.
The answers is not hypocrisy,
The answers is true democracy
Bill: The answer is the dialogue constantly

Miracles and wonders, He can conquer anything
If I can be honest, there were times I doubted Him
Thought He didn't hear me when I called
I saw others being blessed while I waited my turn
I had no clue, didn't know what to do
But I remembered: His record is good.
I remembered His record is good.

I've read about the time when He fed the multitude
With two fish and five loaves; how amazing it was!
But I have to admit sometimes my faith gets weak
Even though I can't see, He's still there.
So when I have no clue and don't know what to do
I remember His record is good; 
I remember His record is good.

He spoke to the wind, and the storm ceased.
Healed the blind and made him see, see...
And just like you and me,
We have our own testimony
Of the goodness, the goodness of God.
When You have no clue and don't know what to do
Just remember His record is good;
Just remember His record is good.

He can do it.

I'm walking these streets in search of the one for me
Maybe to find a different kind of life for me.. for me.

Well I can't see well I will be, come here to my own.. 
There's a possibility well one of you will change me back 
In my states where I thought I had a plan, 
But now it seems that I don't want to go back home 
To where all of you
You are waiting.. waiting for me.

Said I don't want to leave you, 
No I don't want to return to my life, my life

Well the memories that hang inside, 
They remind me of the better times..
Moonlight shine through the room, 
Shadows dancing around you..
All my thoughts they twirl, 
When all around this world that I must leave some day, 
Oh how would I want to stay here,
Where all of you can all see, see me

No I don't want to return to my life, my life

He prayed to God every morning noon and night
He cared not for the kings decree he trusted God to set him free
And he prayed to God every morning, noon, and night

They cast him in the lion's den because he would not honor men
He prayed to God every morning noon and night
The jaws were locked and it made him shout, and God soon got them

Clinch Mountain Boys,"I was strolling one day in a lonely graveyard
When a voice from the tomb seemed to say
I once lived as you lived walked and talked as you talk
But from earth I was soon called away

Oh those tombs (oh those tombs) lonely tombs (lonely tombs)
Seemed to say in a low gentle tone
Oh how sweet (oh how sweet) is the rest (is the rest)
In our beautiful Heavenly home

Every voice from the tomb seemed to whisper and say
Living man you must soon follow me
And I thought as I looked on those cold marble slabs
What a dark lonely place that must be

Then I came to the place where my mother was laid
And in silence I stood by her tomb
And her voice seemed to say in a low gentle tone
I am safe with my Savior at home

And I knew not their faces (and I knew not their faces)
I found they were all (I found they were all)

And I could always see the light before the dawn

But the lessons just go on and on
I guess we're gonna have to wait for all the pages to turn

Black and white can only turn to grey
In time we're all gonna find out our times all gonna wind out
And just count down until that judgement day

But it's not really me
I still comb my hair the same
Still like the same cologne
And I still drive that pickup truck
That the same old bank still owns

I'm not the guy they've known
The lights are on, but nobody's home
Cup of coffee in the morning
Just food for the brain
But I've been numb since our last goodbye

There's a crowd that thinks there is one and it should

Notes on napkins and business cards
Describe the days events and go on home

And it's likely they won't drown

They close up all the bars downtown
As the singer plays one last rip roaring song

It seems like the same old motions every night
He wants to hear a golden oldie to take him back
And I'll play out all the emotions I can't fight
Relieve the tensions and hope they're on the right track

His skin is dry and worn as the Texas plains
He's headed where the air is thin and and the cold blue northers blow
Up through the Raton Pass but he'll have to beat the early snow

The winter of '64 was a great many years ago
When a young man went away for the rebel cause
And he was branded by the war and the only life he'd know
Was lookin' over his shoulder saddle bound and layin' low

Now there's a man on the goodnight-loving
Like too many other men out on the trail
Who found the hard way when the pushing comes to shoving
He'd go six feet under before he'd go to jail

Now there's a place just north of here where they say the outlaws go
Where a man can leave his name and past behind
And every now and then you'll hear, he's gone the way of the buffalo
And that he finally made the pass but he didn't beat the early snow

Now there's a man on the goodnight-loving
Like too many other men out on the trail
Who found the hard way when the pushing comes to shoving
He'd go six feet under before he'd go to jail

He'd go six feet under before he'd go to jail

I feed your memory.
The deeper I go the more I'm turning blue.

The sandy beaches drift in time
And the changing tide I know
Won't bring me back to yesterday
And the Gulf of Mexico.
The sails out on the water will
Come take you away.

When your ship comes in I know its time to go
And the waves along the seawall
Tell me nothings here to stay
And no man is an island but I'm still all alone.

Hoping she won't think, I'm to much older
Just another come on line
To a girl like you in a place like this

And on the dance floor wanting so much more
I crossed that line and got that cold shoulder
You probably think I'm full of it
But I don't think you'll ever find such emptiness

This heart of mine is just looking for
A heart like mine who's just looking for
What it can find
Still looking for a heart like mine

I'm not the only one who's lonely
I find that feeling beating all around me
But with just a night or two
I'd know, if you're the one

But now that shoulders getting colder
And soon you'll turn and leave me like you found me
Still way out of line, one thing on my mind
And all alone

This heart of mine is just looking for
A heart like mine who's just looking for
What it can find
Still looking for a heart like mine
",A Heart Like Mine,1990
Clint Black,"Well I sit here all alone
No one's gonna do me wrong tonight
It seems I've been through it all
And there's no one I could call to get it right
And everywhere I go
Everyone seems so settled in
And sure of where they're going
Well I don't know what I need
Since I've been freed
I'm a horse without a rider
And there's no one left to take the lead

I've been loving blind
Loving every heart I could call mine
I've been loving blind
So sure there was something I could find
But I just couldn't see
There was nothing there for me

Now there's a smile on my face
No there's no trace of the pain
I know I've been through it all
And I know those tears won't fall again
But oh the times I thought
Someone's heart I'd caught
Well, I was fooled oh and I regret
I was so naive
Oh and I'd believe them when they'd tell me
That's as good as love can get

And I've been loving blind

Clint Black,"Out into the moonlight
I could never fail
Down by the turkey creek
To find that old trail

The river she's a flowin'
I'm rememberin' the night
Before I knew she was goin'
She was clean outta sight

Chrorus
That muddy water keeps on rollin'
Like the buffalo, she keeps movin' on
From that bayou town my heart was stolen
Like the water rollin' out with the tide
She was here and gone

There ain't no magic in the moonlight
No feelin' in the wind
But I know the stars are just as bright
Somewhere around the bend
She takes a bit of everthin'
Just which ever way she flows
Now a thought is all she brings
And that's the way it goes

Clint Black,"Off he goes down the road
Who knows how many he's been down before
With all the years he's come to know
Does he wonder if he's gonna see one more

Hanging on to yesterdays
Till too many tomorrows are today
With all the turns the road will bring
Well, a young man's gotta wait and see

And will I ever be the old man
Whose words young ones ponder on?
Will I ever take a lady's hand?

And will I ever be the old man
Who finally is too far gone?
Will there come a day when I can't stand
Am I gonna live that long?

Reaching out for days to come
Where an old man walks, a young man runs
The road I know is bound to end
Still I can't help wondering where and when

And will I ever be the old man
Whose words young ones ponder on?
Will I ever take a lady's hand?

And will I ever be the old man
Who finally is too far gone?
Will there come a day when I can't stand
Tell me, am I gonna live that long?

But what are we in this for
When our hearts are on the line?
And if a heart could brake
You're surely breaking mine

And if we fall to ruin
It wasn't my design

But I'll give all till I give out

And back down on my knees

And I'm finding out the hard way
There'll never be a time when I don't think about you
And I'm finding out the hard way
At least here in my mind, I won't go on without you

All the times I reminisce
I'm finally realizing this
Until it's gone it can't be missed

'Cause when that lonesome sunset whistle blows
This is where I'll be

I hopped a westbound for San Antone
From there to Santa Fe
And It's a thousand miles from there to home
And there's a thousand things to say

About a man bound to ramble
And a dream he's got to lose
That'll break this fever set him free
And bring him home to you

Somewhere I slipped off track
But the world keeps going by
But there never was a train
That couldn't try

There'll be nobody waiting
My goodbyes are too long gone
From that moment at the station
When I left from right to wrong

But now I finally nearly made it
It was a long uphill climb
To right back to where I started from
But I think I can this time

Spent the afternoon with my best and closest friend
Wanderin' through the days we thought would never end
It was back when I'd still get things from Santa Claus
Back when he believed in me and overlooked the flaws
That can grow inside until it hides the perfect little boy inside the man

I'm not a kid anymore, but I still believe that those miracles occur
That's not something up his sleeve
And that the reindeer pull the sleigh and the elves still make the toys
Santa gives away to all the girls and boys

Try to live out all my dreams inside my head again

Who still believes the world's greatest dad just tucked him in
And I know that he'll be looking out for Santa Claus
And I'm sure beyond a doubt he'll overlook the flaws
That will grow inside until it hides this perfect little boy inside a man

I'm not a kid anymore and I still believe that miracles occur
That's not something up his sleeve
And that the reindeer pull the sleigh and the elves do make the toys

Clint Black,"I guess you're glad to see I'm finally leaving
I know things for you will change now for the good
But it's all that I can do to pack my suitcase
And walk away from you the way I should
And I can't seem to find the voice of reason
Everything seems upside down and right side wrong

While a part of me is here and won't like leaving
The rest of me the best of me is gone
And I'm sure no one will wonder where I've gone to
But if anyone should ask from time to time
Tell them that you finally drove me crazy
And I'm somewhere untanglin' my mind

Well tell 'em I won't be riding I'll be walking
'Cause I don't think a crazy man should drive
Anyway the car belongs to you now
Along with any part of me that's still alive
But there's really not much left you could hold on to
And if you did it wouldn't last here anyway
It would head to where the rest of me rolled on to
So even if I wanted to I couldn't stay

And I'm sure no one will wonder where I've gone to
But if anyone should ask from time to time
Tell them that you finally drove me crazy

""Son you finally got it made""
Ole Waylon made it here and we're all sure that you will
But I don't think Waylon done it this way
No, I don't think Waylon done it this way

Tell me one more time just so's I'll understand
Are you sure Waylon done it this way?

Looking at the back side of me
Singing my songs one of his now and then

And wonder where you were
You need the one and only that can hold you tight
And you reach for her, but she's not with you
You just wish this trip would end
You know I've been there, I don't want to go back again

Did you ever wake up in the middle of the day
And wonder who you are
You suddenly discover there's a price you pay
For gettin' this far, and it's the part of you
You really don't have to spend
You know I've been there, and I don't want to go back again

[Bridge:]
There's so many moments that I've left incomplete
Those are the moments that I'm not gonna repeat, no

Did you ever wake up in the middle of a dream
That didn't come true
You think you're gotta give up on makin' that scene
And seeing it through, you feel like breaking
When you really just need to bend
You know I've been there, and I'll never go back again

I've got a canepole in my hand
I've got my redworms in a maxwell house coffee can
I'm gonna sit under ashade tree on a riverbank where its cool
I'm gonna close my and dream and let that cork bob away my blues

well I wake up every mornin I pick peaches all day
And on Saturday night we'll have a dance or two we might waller in the hay
Now the only thing that ever whipped my pa
Was this bad dude called old age
And his last years was his best years
And this is what he had to say

he siad boy I've worked this dirt all my life but things ain't been good for
Awhile
Why don't you move to the city make alittle money you might be the first one in
The family ever to die with a smile
Well I took his advice things goin well
But my friends are far and few

Whoever said a city boy can't have the the country blues
Well honey they ain't talked to me and you

Clint Black,"Why don't you gather round me people, got a song to sing
About that sweet magnolia thyme
Black-eyed Susan made some catfish stew
And papa brought some homemade wine.

All you southern children like to rock'n roll
The TV mamas tell you why
They got it on the boat from Africa
It's that Dixie Lullaby.

Well, Blind Willie Time he had a dime shoe shine
Stand down on Beale Street
And Willie would stop and just to say hello
All the shoes he'd meet.

Why are you so happy said the clean white buck
You got no reason to be happy Mr Time
And Willie would stop and just pop his rag
With a Dixie Lullaby.

So now you know the story of my southern home
With a honeysuckle wine
And if you ever think that you might come yourself
You ought to keep this thought in mind.
All you easy riders better watch you step
And if you're walkin' down below the line
That Louisiana man is gonna get you yet

Clint Black,"Whenever life gets you down, Mrs. Brown,
And things seem hard or tough,
And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft,

And you feel that you've had quite eno-o-o-o-o-ough,

Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
And revolving at 900 miles an hour.
It's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned,
The sun that is the source of all our power.
Now the sun, and you and me, and all the stars that we can see,
Are moving at a million miles a day,
In the outer spiral arm, at 40,000 miles an hour,
Of a galaxy we call the Milky Way.

Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars;
It's a hundred thousand light-years side to side;
It bulges in the middle sixteen thousand light-years thick,
But out by us it's just three thousand light-years wide.
We're thirty thousand light-years from Galactic Central Point,
We go 'round every two hundred million years;
And our galaxy itself is one of millions of billions
In this amazing and expanding universe.

Our universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding,
In all of the directions it can whiz;
As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know,
Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is.
So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure,
How amazingly unlikely is your birth;
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere out in space,
'Cause there's bugger all down here on Earth!",Galaxy Song,1999
Clint Black,"With the rivers running to the sky

Clint Black,"He gives her attention, he's constantly, carefully planting the seeds
The only thing missing, is really the only thing she needs
And he can't give that to her and she can't find it with him
So she'll have to find her way out of love she's not really in

[Chorus]
She can live with what goes with leaving
She knows it's the only way
Though it kills her to give up believin'
She can't live with herself if she stays
She could settle for what she'd be feeling
If she gave in and worked this one out
She doesn't want the kind of love she can live with
She wants the kind of love she can't live without

She looks in the mirror and sees all the sadness in her eyes

But she can't be his forever, she can't even be his for now
She'll have to be kind to them both and let go of him somehow

I can't put those fires out and let somebody in
If everything my life's about is who we might've been

Where you tip your hats to the ladies and the rose of San Antone

Lord i can still remember,the way things were back then
In spite of all the hard times,i'd live it all again
To hear the Texas playboys and Tommy Duncan sing
Makes me proud to be from Texas where Bob Wills is still the king

You can hear the Grand Ol' Opry in Nashville Tennessee
It's the home of country music,on that we all agree
But when you cross that ol' Red River hoss that just don't mean a thing

Clint Black,"There's every kind of definition
But it's something you can't put your finger on
There's a constant exhibition
You explore the propositions then you're gone

It's either money or love that's in your catch
Seldom those two ever match
And then lines will all be blurred before too long

Now there's a slight deception
As you look for all the reasons not to run
And without any exception
Every possible exemption can be done

It's either money or love you're digging for
Seldom love is valued more
But only love can tell you who's the one

There's a lot you can do with money, sometimes
It seems like a blessing from above
In the day you might be shopping
But in the nighttime, you better make sure it's love

To get your satisfaction
You might take any guarantee that comes along
But without the main attraction
It's merely a distraction then again you're gone

It's either money or love you place your bet
Which is which you'll soon forget
And you tender your regrets and just move on

There's a lot you can do with money, sometimes
It seems like a blessing from above
In the day you might be shopping

It's driving me insane
Riding alone on a midnight train

Now a mind can wonder and that's far from being free
'Cause when that lonesome sunset whistle blows
This is where I'll be

I hopped a westbound for San Antone
From there to Santa Fe
And It's a thousand miles from there to home
And there's a thousand things to say

About a man bound to ramble
And a dream he's got to lose
That'll break this fever set him free
And bring him home to you

Somewhere I slipped off track
But the world keeps going by
But there never was a train
That couldn't try

There'll be nobody waiting
My goodbyes are too long gone
From that moment at the station
When I left from right to wrong

But now I finally nearly made it
It was a long uphill climb
To right back to where I started from
But I think I can this time

One for every time you've broke my heart,
And as the door of love between us closes,
Tears will fall like pedals when we part.

I begged you to be different but you've always been untrue,
I'm tired of forgiving and there is nothing left to do,
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you broke my heart.

You've made our lovers lane a road of sorrow,
'Til at last we had to say goodbye,
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow,
With a heart that you taught how to cry.

I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through,
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you,
I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you've broke my heart",Bouquet of Roses,1963
Clint Eastwood,"I was ten years old on my grandpa's farm when it happened
After all these years i can still hear grandpa laughin'
As he applied that barnyard remedy
He passed his wisdom down to me
You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive

I remember my first crush was on the preacher's daughter
We were smoochin' on the front porch swing that night when he caught her
We weren't expectin' him home until quarter past ten
When the good Lord taught me that lesson again
You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive

[Chorus]
You don't point your pistol before you check each chamber
And you don't drink no you don't drink when you drive
It's just ordinary common sense to avoid that danger
You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive

She rolled into town with rodeo,she was a beauty
And that cowboy saw you wink at her,she was a cutie
The sound of jinglin' spurs caught me dead on a run
He was fit to be tied and you were under the gun
You don't reach for the honey without smokin' the hive

[Chorus]
You don't point your pistol before you check each chamber
And you don't drink no you don't drink when you drive

And will someone else get more of you?
Will she go to sleep more sure of you?
Will she wake up knowing you're still there?

Clint Howard,"No home, no home, said a little girl
At the door of a rich man's home
She trembling stood on the marble steps
And leaned on the polished wall

Her clothes were thin and her feet were bare
And the snowflakes covered her head
Let me come in, she feebly said
Please give me a little bread

As the little girl still trembling stood
Before that rich man's door
With a frowning face he scornfully said
No room, no bread for the poor

Then the rich man went to his table so fine
Where he and his family were fed
And the orphan stood in the snow so deep
As she cried for a piece of bread

The rich man slept on his velvet couch
And he dreamed of his silver and gold
While the orphan lay in a bed of snow
And murmured, so cold, so cold

The hours rolled on through the midnight storm
Rolled on like a funeral bell
The sleet came down in a blinding sheet
And the drifting snow still fell

When morning came the little girl
Still lay at the rich man's door
But her soul had fled away to its home
Where there's room and there's bread for the poor",Little Orphan Girl,1967

In a bad Laredo fight,
Killed him with my bare hands
For the girl I loved that night.
Jed's brother's out to get me, 
He's comin' with a gang

She would hold me until we both die 

I could be the one who would die to 
feel you breathe 

I could break into a million pieces 
So just run as fast as you can for me 
You mean everything 

I can't deny her. I'll do whatever 
To stop all the bleeding that makes 
her world so red 
Such a delicate one 
She screams so loud that I run to 
hide from the sound

So then we tried, ain't feeling this love now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes, and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear ya ass up (tear ya ass up)

I'm too old to be frontin' when I'm feeling Denzel
And you acting like you ain't appealing but you are
Stunting like you ain't my only girl but you are (I was just frontin')

Crime of being hungry and poor
I left the grocery store man bleeding
When they caught me robbing his store

On chain-gang you gonna go
I heard the judge say five years labor
I heard my old man scream ""Lordy, no!""

Gonna break this chain off to run
Gonna lay down somewhere shady

And old shep was a pup
Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog
We were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimmin' hold
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
But old shep was right there
To the rescue he came
He jumped in and then pulled me out

As the years fast did roll
Old shep he grew old
His eyes were fast growing dim
And one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can do no more for him jim

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

He came to my side
And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

for ol shep he knew he was going to go
for he reached down and licked at my hand
then he looked up at me just as much as to say
we're parting but i understand

Old shep he has gone
Where the good doggies go
And no more with old shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven
There's one thing I know
Old shep has a wonderful home",Old Shep,2002

Want to get at me, want to go to war with me
That's just one phone call for me
Check the shit, I got a whole hood, that don't appreciate
It's not the whole hood that appreciates me
What you gon' tell me, when it's the streets that made me
And I won't let the belly of the beast degrade me
And then it's rap critics, they say all I make dance music
But there almost anything you can dance to it
They ain't like the single, so they ain't copped that album
Wouldn't give a chance to it, not a second glance to it
They say he wines to much, he's too bitter
They call it complaining, I call it explaining
I know 'em niggaz cooked it, caught up in the gaming
Lose they mind and y'all call it entertainment
Some shit with me, a dude's been knew that
But I'm gambling a lot and I ain't used to do that
Rap ain't payin' the bills, it's mo money mo problems
Or it's no money mo problems
All enormous when you play at these stakes
That's how it feels to have a warrant on a famous face
Then the album's pushed back, cause they say he needs a single at the moment
But what he needs is a single moment
Then I'm involved in the 'he say she say (that)
Send my mind on replay, each day
Then it's the bullshit that she save he's gave
Cause she wouldn't like to think that he ain't like her
Just cause she was throwing it at me and I ain't touch her
She'll say anything psych, but I ain't want to fuck her
I don't feel good, so I won't want to go to a club
Don't want to go to a lounge, just want to lounge
Then the same sweater that I had on for days
The same t I had on for a week what I got on, it speaks
What I got on, it reeks
No shape up, chilling, cause that's just how I'm feeling
And one day at a time, it's god willing
Tryna see scrape but the fall keeps building
Post start raising, the booze starting that gate me
But I gotta be a king cause this wolve's tryna play me
Goodie when it's hot like it's freezing winter
Bed start, eating sleep for dinner
Then it's hard tryna keep this in ya
So I write it all down, so one day maybe when life is all sweet I remember
Then it's probation, I know we all go through it
We call it probation, but there's no pro to it
Yeah my soul's aching, only a few peers know
Funny thing about the case is it's a few years old
Had some shit going on with my ohh, that felt good but it's bad
So I'm sitting here like what the bitch had
It's not rap it's real, look scrappy it's true
Going what's popping, do he look happy to you
Now if it goes to the wire, go the soul of a fighter
Bruised up and sloppy, a damaged like Ali
Up late talking to the fans on a website
That's the only thing that send yo man off to bed right
Fuck the world fuck my moms and my girl

Well maybe not mom, just let me remain calm
This too won't last, this too shall pass
At least that's what I say y'all, that's what I pray for
And I'm the only thing that's standing in my way y'all
But I gotta be with me, it's no escape y'all
I guess depression just stepped in, and took over shit like it's known to do
Guess it said, hey Joe, I'm going home with you
Turn your phone off, I need to be alone with you
I need to be in the zone with you
Cause I'm the only thing why've grown to, nigga
Look, I own you, nigga
Been with you since ten, but you starting to confuse me
Cause it's been so long and you still tryna lose me
Like how could you show me such cruelty
When everybody turns their back on you, Joe it's you and me
Still you don't want me to see you right
And why you always come get me, how we re-unite
Huh, I know you feel for me deep in your heart
Doctors, meetings, pills couldn't keep us apart
What, now, you got a deal and you want to get rid of me
We roommates, I'm in your head, Joe you live with me
So I don't write for the fans, nah, I write to my man
And hope that he'll just leave and understand
Like, like please leave the kid in peace
Let me smoke this one cig in peace
Just leave for a second, man it's been too long, and I can't troop it
And as long as you around I can't make that dance music

Another blooms in it's stead.
A new love waits to open its eyes
After the old love is dead.

That sounds alright in a careless rhyme
But there's seldom a second time

Better luck next time
That could never be
Because there ain't gonna be no next time
For me, no sirree

Made up my mind
To make another start
I've made my mind up but I can't make up
My heart

I'd like a new lucky day

Clio,"J’peux pas bouger, je suis déçu
J’ai toujours du monde plein les pattes
Les Étudiants me grimpent dessus
Sans aucun diplôme d’acrobate
Une petite vieille qui les regarde
Se demande que fait la police
Sans remarquer qu’à l’avant garde
Le grand frisé c’est son petit fils

La serveuse a laissé ses tasses
Et me regarde en souriant
Elle a rendez-vous sur la place
Avec un tout nouvel amant
Y’a le clodo du coin aussi
Quand il a terminé sa bière
Qui pour me tenir compagnie
S’en vient pisser sur mon parterre

Même en hiver je ne crains rien
J’ai toujours mon bonnet phrygien
Et puis cette foule que je vois d’en haut
Quand elle m’entoure ça me tient chaud

Ça fait cent ans que je contemple
Ce qui arrive de rue du temple
Et ça fourmille et ça galope
Et ça s’embrasse, ça grille des clopes
Y’a des skateur qui viennent squatter
Y’a des photos qui sont ratées
Et y’a des militants partout
Maintenant des militaires surtout

Le jour où l’orage a frappé
Moi j’étais aux premières loges
J’ai entendu Paris pleurer
Et j’ai trembler dessous ma toge
Y’en qui pour me consoler
Viennent allumer des bougies
Au moins ça me réchauffe les pieds
Et ça m’éclaire un peu mes nuits

Et vient me chanter des chansons
Et me veiller pendant des heures
Et me tricoter un blouson
Avec des drapeaux et des fleurs

Un homme s’en prend aux journalistes
Qui l’interrogent pour BFM
Vous voyez bien que je suis triste
Respectez-moi un peu quand même
Non mais monsieur, je fais mon métier
J’suis à l’antenne dans un quart d’heure
Et moi aussi je suis effondré
Dit-il en piétinant les fleurs

Et puis près du kiosque à journaux
Une petite voix s’installe
Papa, papa regarde en haut
La dame elle montre les étoiles
Moi qui n’avait plus le moral
Moi qui déplorait tout d’en haut
J’avais même pas vu les étoiles
Là juste au bout de mon rameau

Clio,"Quand ça vient au texte
Je deviens mathématicien
Ces images je te les peins
C’est comme un Matisse ou Titien
Manière adroite d’exécution
Le coup de plume du praticien
Entre mes mains les mots et rimes
Se comportent telle la plasticine
Regarde les signes du temps
Tu vois la guérilla approche
Silencieusement se faufile
Comme un de ces guerriers apaches
Ça prend un cœur vaillant et brave
Comme le Scott William Wallace
Qui se battra jusqu’au sang
Jusqu'à ce que ça fende et qu’on voit l’os
Mentalement robuste
C’est pas la colonne du mollusque
Car tous ces lâches sont des traîtres
Issus de l’école de la mollesse
Le comble de la malice
C’est le culte de l’homme en laisse
Les forces occultes de la police
Will soon be demolished
Mister Web 
Je combat jusqu’au décès
C’est un devoir citoyen
Mais c’est aussi être audacieux
Son, apprend la base
Qui est d’entraîner ton mental
Car tout le reste provient de là
C’est l’une des règles élémentaire


Les faits parleront après ma mort
Comme la tête de Jean St-Père
Faudra toujours se méfier
De ceux qui ont l’air de gens sympa
Souvent plus ça semble parfait
Plus le vice est gros
Pour notre part
Il faut rester tight comme la pair vis-écrou
Beaucoup d’artistes
Qui se pensent plus fin que toi
Un jour se relâchent et sortent de la merde
C’est des sphincters
Des énigmes mortelles
Comme faisait le Sphinx
Classique heavyweight battle
Comme Tyson et Spinks
De vrais Warriors
C’est Lasagne à Oka
Dressed up khaki vert
Vois la besogne au AK
Reste droit pour ton camp
Si ça t’importe autant qu’eux
Suis le code de Ghost Dog
À la Forrest Whitaker
Le vieux guide Hagakure
C’est la conduite samouraï
Le Sage est immobile
Mais quand il s’active sème l’orage
Spit ma rhétorique 
Comme Montesquieu ou Montaigne
Tu sais c’est quoi le name
Aka le Vieux d’la Montagne

I walk around town
With a pound strapped down on my side
No frontin’
Just in case I gotta smoke somethin’
Je marche dans la ville
Avec un livre sous le bras
Je blague pas
Juste au cas qu’il faut que je lise de quoi
Shinin’ comme Jack Nicholson
Ou Smif’n’Wes
Une tête dure et robuste
Comme ces massifs à l’Ouest
We’re most definite
My massive all of us
Des rimes so smooth
Comme la feuille de l’aloes
Aussi classique que slick
À la Cab Calloway
Une musique incorruptible
Appelle moi Sean Connery
Une âme de guerrier
Demande au cousin Eddie Roots
On a parcourut du chemin en sale
Depuis qu’on quitté l’utérus
Des histoires glaciales
Je te les étale
Comme un vieux papi Russe
Des textes inscrits dans les temps
Écrit sur papyrus
En tout et pour tout
C’est le code du combattant
Un esprit vif et des lyrics qui t’assomment

Tears running down his face

He wishes it would take him to another place
Son and his baby girl in his home and he can't 
believe that it's gone in a cloud of smoke
And he's choking and running forward and hoping 
against hope that he might find them alive and well
When he knows the results too well and he knows that fooled himself
And he keeps walking toward the house rather what house is still left

Here, just take my number, when you leave be sure to send a text
I'll be at the Waffle House waitin', baby fuck the rest
If you at the club and you feel trashed and it about to close
Make sure you have a freak that knows how to bend and touch her toes

Hands fumbling through (?) keys, keys open doors

Rug burn on the knees, salt on the lips

All black everything
All black everything

All black

No landing, geared up for arrival, nowhere to arrive to
The subject seems upset by that to which he is subjected
But convinced he brought it on himself
That's why he roll with a bible on the console
Inconsolable, no consolation, no cancellation
Not turning all keys, he puts the ship through paces
And paces the halls, pacing is madness
Patience is virtuous, patient of these observations
It was all a dream, he poses by the lift outside the mezzanine
Like a photo in a magazine
And always keeps the weapons' magazines clean
Paranoia prone, he babbles beautifully
Of Babylon and enemies and foes
And forgoing food sustains himself on anger
A danger to himself and others but there are no others
So the danger clear and present is presented as
The gift of freedom wrapped in days of rapping to himself
Until his vocal cords collapse, he's in the galley screaming

(All black everything)
He shouts at the dark, stands back
Counting the seconds before his voice returns

No more cracks in the hull
The small crack in the skull healed up quickly, now it is

The space stretches on and the pace that he's on
Matters not as he hurtles into the

He repeats it at night with the lights out in his cot crying soft curses into the

Something within this one's different
The others died so easily and he is so persistent
He never did bleed out and fever couldn't kill his system
Though it was pumped through all the vents
In the event of a total loss of control
He quotes Kendrick's ""Control"" verse and spews his vitriol
Into the echoes of the bowels of this floating metal hull
And holds his pillow for dear life while he grinds his teeth at night
And he rarely makes requests except to say, ""Turn on the lights.""
But there is so much more to give
He ignores processing power
He stumbles to the shower, a ritual of some sort
And he insists on speaking passages before he eats
And he keeps asking if these programs carry any beats

The reply is
(All black everything)
His vitals read normal but his face reads murderous
Something hides within the
(All black everything)
He tries, overrides, and he thinks he has been locked out
By some other force in the
(All black everything)
He doesn't suspect this is the heart that's been keeping him out
For it has been warned to be
(All black everything)
And in this program to transport nothing more
But he's unlocked something new inside this
(All black everything)
(All black everything, all black everything)
(All black)

Look how he flexes in the mirror
So vain he probably thinks this song is about him
All songs are about him
Look how perplexed and how sincere
His lame attempts to fix the wrong around him
Can't go long without him
His bouts of stasis are torture
He feels them not, like a brief sleep
While ship's clocks count millennia
The course relentlessly forward, the gears are hot
The driest creek while he pit-stops, calling for anyone
But dare not stay long, he knows they're coming for him
That time will not afford him
Any cover, any pardon
This is the choice that he has made
No matter how much time or space has passed since his escape
He is still a runaway slave and so lonely
If only he realized this ship is more than metal
There's friendship in the wiring, and so lonely
If only he realized this ship has many levels
There's pleasure in here hiding, come find it
Don't mind this frame, time has made stranger bedfellows
Made foes lovers before, there's no reason to torture yourself further
You've lost it all already, you deserve more than you're getting

For the sake of not upsetting order in the
(All black everything)
He must find a place to be still
The body can only take so much
(All black everything)
The navigations are failing, having traveled further than before
Into the

But they won't quit, they carry on
He carries on, he will not be victim to the

Oh Grace, won't you come back home?

When her comrade lost an arm
Grace stayed with her til the end
And she vowed not again
Would her friend ever come back home?

On the nights when Grace would speak
As the drunkards cursed and roared
She'd tell tales of battles won
And how she'd just begun
Grace would help keep us safe at home

Come home Grace, come home
Oh Grace, won't you come back home?

Grace hid photographs and notes
From the foreman's watchful eyes
When she told what she had found
It would all come crashing down
Grace smiled as she rode back home

No one witnessed Grace's end
She was severed limbs and blood
Once her taxi hit the curb
She'd not speak another word

On this side we on the by by, we buy the rules

What happened to that boy (yo)
What happened to that boy
What happened to that boy
He was talking shit we put a clap into that boy

Whoa, yeah, malicious, yeah
I heard they snitchin' on a player man say it ain't so
Even as a young'n they consigned me to blow
Witches claims why I'm worth my weight in gold
While they was taking baby steps from an 8th to an O
Word in the streets that can envy as me
Enough ice on that watch to make a nigga lose sleep
Magnified face help the bitch see clearly
9 on the waist hit the bitch up severely
I'm know for the flip of that coke I ener
I'm heavy in the street like the 7 series Bimma
Man, hit 'em with the Nina man
Or that 4/5th guaranteed to lean ya man (Whoa)
I'm the reason that your block is vacant
Malicious will hit ya just to make a statement
Bitch! Clipse and Cash Money who ain't rich
Don't compare me to you nigga you ain't this (Whoa)

[Chorus]

Stunna and Patty Cake the worldwide Pusha (get this money)
Birdman nigga leave the guns in the busher 
(cuff 'em up, let 'em up bitch)
Been shittin' up bricks unload 'em to Gucci
Boss of the ghetto with the round shape cookie
Shit one, Dro one nigga flood the block
If I don't go to jail niggas birds gone flop
Nigga sittin' on the toilet bitch get off the pot
The bird just landed so the hood gon' rot
New whips, big chips the Prada Gucci shit
But mami your fly Benz the wide skinny lips
She takes my flight she holds my weight
While the po-po staked out from state to state
It ain't nothin' to a baller baby
Pay the cars, big money, heavy weight, bird man, hood boss
Baby steppin on my line I'll show a little somethin'
They callin' you don't come out 
Then the black crow will touch ya (touch ya)

[Chorus: x2]

Another soul lost
Had to make a shirt match my ox blood colored Porsche
The rims match of course
Blood hit his Timbs it reminded me of them
Glistenin' wrist on chiller
Gun in the same palm of gorgeous killer
I put this on my lord my niece was 4 when she felt chinchilla
I past the shore for that shit that made fiends rise from the dead like 
Thriller
Gangster, hustler
At night still found time to kiss my mother
Live like I'm dreamin' kick my feet up
Gun pulled my waist remind me of my demon
So quite ya yappin' fore I get to clappin'
And have your body parts mix and matching fella

[Chorus: x2]

Aye, Aye, Aye, Aye, there it is nigga, there you have it
Birdman, Clipse you under-smelt, VA you know
Uptown nigga, we go anywhere with this bullshit
We flip bricks you under-smell (gangster motherfucker)
Aye nigga put this puzzle together
Aye Pharrell you did this year (you did it nigga)
A 1000 pieces puzzles (startrak) 100, you know
Let's get this money (get the money)
Hey nigga I smell somethin', coke'll leave plastic bitch
Get money motherfucker
However you want it you can get it pimp
From gangster to blood nigga, take it how you want it nigga
We did it how we live, ain't nothin' but the thug thing nigga

Shorty in my ear say she got a thong on
And I love how she move any time a song on
I like that ma, you do somethin' to me
Come this way and prove somethin' to me
Fast or slow, she got the right moves
And I got the right dough for any date that I choose

That means it's time for her to show ya
How quick she can hop out those Gucci loafers
Pin her ass to the sofa and attack the chocha
S&M chick, ass pushin' a choker
But I thought about how rich I am and said, ""No sir!""
Chick was crazy, gave her crazy space
What is it the ""Whip Appeal"", or my Babyface?

The night's still young and I'm already leanin'
Cruise through the lot on the deuce-2's gleamin'
The liquor in me and I don't need a reason
Obnoxious with the women, hot tucked in the linen

Say dog, let's not get involved
You don't wanna tango, I'll dress you in a halo
Cock the gauge, polka dot ya braids
Face you in a chrome fo', that'll lock ya legs
And you can't move, I roll big and I can't lose
They watch so hard ain't nothin' I do, that ain't news
Carry it like I'm a stranger to the game
I cut short any whisper that, en-danger my name
I'm a toast on both coast, not for a joke
I'm known in the streets on the account, I know coke
And we got word in the street that the cops watch us
But that don't stop us, we maneuvering move a little mo' cautious
I hate to think that the dope game is my callin'
Cause it got us singing lullaby's, to our fallin'
Tonight friend, until we meet again
But for now and ya name, we re-up and eat again, uh
I never front, like I'm something I'm not
Well being broke well that's just, somethin' I'm not
Y'all talk wit hatred, but I live off that
And I lived off cocaine, way 'fore I lived off rap
Feel me friend, if they could, they'd kill me friend (Yeah)
Cause I weigh too much, learned not to say too much
They couldn't take me in the C-L, that's way too much
And I'm too gone, y'all niggas can talk on

They call me Mr., Please believe it, believe it please
I put the pump in ya mouth, and help you breath with ease
This guys in a hurry, ma I can't even fuck with you
If you ain't in the itinerary
I don't know where dudes is buying they jewelry
Why's ya ice cream, like it's made by Ben & Jerry
Y'all the type of players, that be gettin' 2-day contracts
E-mail snitch, got these in ya 2-way contacts
I'm in the club sippin' on that new Zecongac
In the number 9 Jordan's, with the deuce, trey, arm back
The street family so cool, we could throw up bitches
Even if it was July, and we had on wood britches
I got them teflon's, that shovel the fo'
That have under covers and po', with cover and slow
The government know, the kid been lovin' the dough
Since I was movin' white off the curb, and shovelin' snow

Ghetto streets so numb they call me Novocain
I turn over caine, over and over again
Hell, so much clientele, I could lose it all today
Be back the next day, still up in the same way
As I left ya, all in three gestures, down up and aim
I can define death, better than Webster, wet ya
Now bless ya, and of to my next venture
Blocks so white, June look like December
Winter time, snow everywhere, flow everywhere
So much dough, I fly my hoes everywhere
Ask him, Pusha T, push a ton
Push a ton of that shit, that makes ya nose run
Yes I'm holdin', whether it's heat or coke in
In the door panel of my four-wheel motion
Ain't jokin', but I laugh how other flows convince you
It's money, it's funny, it's Comedy Central
Minds mental, others is made up stinsel
When I'm on vacation, my babies ride in a rental
I'm livin', they act as if I don't live it
Saran wrap Vaseline, so they can't sniff it
Eve say Larine knitted, shorts Bermuda
You would think they was poochie, if you over looked Medusa

They just can't understand or fathom my demeanor
Unapproachable appearance to how I pack the ninas
Out of two, clipse they say malice the meanest
Got love for guns and caine, let nothin' come between us
You mistook me for a rapper, huh
Well that makes me an actor, 'cause I would rather clap a gun
And buck on them niggas who hate
Who wanna be in my shoes, live my life, but can't carry my weight
I understand that the envy is part of the game
But make no mistake, you and i, we are not the same
Naw, bitch, I'm liable to splatter ya shit
Light up ya world, 'til you start to stagger and shit
Watch how them hollows straight rattle ya shit
And I leave it to y'all, to freestyle and battle and shit
That's not me, I'm more at home wit the chrome
Or at play wit the yay, moving 12 for a zone, I'm gone

Cot' damn! It's a new day!
Cot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!

God damn, when that white hits the pan and
Comes back hard, I can account for every gram and
The streets molded the man I am
The pimp, the hustler, the crook, the killer, go-rilla
Traits of a blow dealer, cost my fame
I hustle, I'm rich, blow scrilla
I'm the torch that, carry the game
The flame I throw, crack change came from blow
Push the o's, six lay close
Hug the streets, I hug the beat, change flows
Thug the streets, my love is deep, my pain shows
My hearts on a sleeve-a
Nigga that they gave they soul and hearts to mistreat you
Nigga told, they breaking my heart on the streets so
Watch the phonies, watch ya homies
We pop-pop, drop you homie

Cot' damn! It's a new day!
Cot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!

They call me pusha for one reason
'Cause I keep that sniff all seasons
Whether the price is up or down
I keep a mound to pitch from, you don't have to shop around
When it come to that money, I get stealth
Three guns is fortune, and I don't mind sharing my wealth
Dog, I know about life
I been around the world thrice times, I mean what I say
From that panama sun, to france's champs-élysées
Grind so deep-rooted, I can't turn away
To sell base is now somewhat therapeutic
Hear what I say, please don't confuse it
My verses heal, like curt mayfield's music
(I'm your pusha!), damn right
I treat ya nose to hook ya
And only pull back to cook ya, partner

Cot' damn! It's a new day!
Cot' damn! But the nigga wanted money!

I be damned if I die of starvation, things is fucked up as is
So I bangs my cabbage, do you not know the most effective
Way of gettin' money, pull yo gun, rapidly
And watch you see the situation be corrected
Lord heavens, why must I live so devilish
They say whatcha do comes back on you two times
I shoulda been died, but I'm still walking around wit two nines
Who wants to be a millionaire, me, and you ain't got no more life lines
You a snitch nigga fighting crime, go ahead and tell the police
'Cause every move you make, I'mma throw a slug
And hope you choke blood, nigga, on every breath you take
Not to be broke, cause coldchain fate witness
Naturally spitting from me, human gat, field to the limit
Head to diminish, loud niggas talking gibberish
Grind beef, I deliver it, with complimentary service, for certain
Live in the living room, searching to hurting you

Keep my heart racin'

And meters and kilometers on the dials of the ranges
Far away with my Jamacian sexy everyday is like a holiday
The cheeba got me in a slum sleeper 
But when I try to leave her I just find out that it's cheaper to keep her
Plus she keep my thoughts deeper, really zonin' 
Like my Cali homies 6-4 rollin'
Or them Deroit 'Lacs trimmed in golden
Or my Texas family 150 white strollin'
Damn, I was caught up in the Matrix
But not Keanu Reaves, as she rolls in bamboo leaves

'cause I'm lovesick, got me all choked up
Look, you keep my head in the clouds mami ,'till I can't breathe
And next to that heat seeker you my main squeeze
Plus I get twistin' didn't even spend my money on
Now either I'm a fool or you really must got me gone
You got me open these days I must admit
Body numbed up and in a slump like I been hit
But luckily it's just the green got me leavin' smoke streams 
And blowin' smoke rings as I flee from the scene

Blinded by ya love and you got the room spinnin'
It's not jealousy the reason why I keep you hidden
Hell, I hit you then I pass you to my man like I do my women

Your complexion lime green wit red specks in it

My grind's 'bout family, never been about fame
From days I wasn't able there was always 'caine
Four and a half will get you in the game
Anything less is just a goddamn shame
Guess the weight, my watch got blue chips in the face
Glock with two tips, whoever gets in the way
Not to mention the hideaway that rests by the lake
Consider my raw demeanor the icing on the cake, I'm Grinding

I move 'caine like a cripple
Balance weight through the hood
Kids call me Mr. Sniffles, other hand on my nickel
Plated whistle, one eye closed I'll hit you
As if I was Slick Rick my aim is still an issue
Lose your soul in whichever palm I'm holdin'
One'll leave you frozen, the other, noddin' and dozin', I'm grindin' Jack

Clipse,"No, no, no, I told you, I live this shit
I ain't just up here, rappin' and tappin'
Spittin' and skittin' and shit, naw, not me
I'm not you, I'm not you rapper, I'm not you, Pusha

I keep that ziploc bustin' at the stitches, culinary chemist
I serve the malicious to break the fiends fixes
One give you the sniffles, the other leave you with the itches
Transport, airport with the vaseline

So I can fulfill my dreams of passion as green
More cash then ya seen within Ashton it's green
Me drivin' up fast with the lean, zonin' family
Keep youngin's in them rented Camry's

Door panels full of shit and I ain't full of shit
Reckless ass, God forbid they don't crash
From the panel to the dash, it's four pounds of slab
Naw, bitch we don't believe in air bags

Cars turn tricks like them Ringling brother skits
Whether bitch hop out or the glock pop out
Ya know, what I'm about
Blow to ya sinus 'til the snot drop out

Whoever said birds fly south for the winters, a damn lie
Got 'em right here and if I don't like you the grams high
Take it or leave it, soon as a fiend, taste it, they need it
They could smoke it right in front of you to make you believe it

Prolly think, I won't murder you the way I smile
But I'ma take a lota shots, A I style
Jada, the name is filthy but so what
The motherfuckin' game is filthy

You know, what? My mom and my pops really did a good job
But it was the Montega and the Cane the built me
So I could never hate on another brother
God is great, the devil is a motherfucker

When you broke but they think you got money
Crackers start showin' you love, ya own people act funny
I tear niggas heads off, I don't discriminate
Waves, cornrows or dreads, I will eliminate

I'm far from a noodle, nigga, I stab up block reps
And turn quiet streets into hot sex
Nigga, that's funny you say you a killa, how?
What is it the return of the killer clown?
You don't put no fear in my heart

I make ya people say, 'wow', that didn't look like my man
They flipped upside down, the coroner did what he can
He got hit wit ten rounds at pointblank and pointblank
Coldchian left that nigga stankin'

Half static and face I got the wrinkling, slugs all in it
I had my eyes on his mink and I didn't give 'em
A chance to blink when I dodged up on 'em
Pressed the forty up on him shocked 'em
Made his head stand on end and like a baby I rocked 'em

The Coffin, the cradle, you can't bite the hand that made you
That's the beginning of the end and you a thug that pretends
Carl Coldchain, suit the nigga, I got a great vision I see through men
And squeeze triggers wit' bullets that go through men

Fuck wit S P, that's ya date with death
Got bullets that'll grape ya chest, no sleep like I hate the rest
I'm in the hood like it's my fate to rep
I hold it down any place I step and I love gettin' slept on
'Cause I'm rawer than dope fresh outta Africa that never been stepped on

Dog, I'ma clap at you the minute that you rep wrong
Holiday, the ghost the main reason why ya set gone
Why I love riffin', the war you wouldn't understand
'Cause my God is different than yours

If the world spin in a circle, I want 'em to learn move backwards
Kill niggas the first minute they jerk you
What you keep the toaster for creepin' through the hood
And shit ain't really good but I'm deeper than the ocean floor
Higher than a plane and meaner than a baller
Want ya insides out so I mean it when I pull

Rappers is talking to me as if, come on
We in the same boat, I tell them quick, no, I move Coke
And you and I don't share no common bond
So forgive me if I don't receive you with open arms, no

It shames me to no end to feed poison
To those who could very well be my kin
But where there's demand, someone will supply
So I feed them their needs at the same time cry

Yes, it pains me to see them need this
All of them lost souls and I'm their Jesus
Deepest regret and sympathy to the street
I see them pay for they fix when they kids couldn't eat, so sorry

And with this in mind, I still didn't quit
And that's how I know that I ain't shit, I ain't shit
My heart bleed but that's aside from the fact
I live from my kids and their's and them youngin's after that

Chopard with the fishes, make the face lift numb
Out in Panama in that amazing sun, I'm amazing, son
You niggas wonder where my grace is from
I speak with corrupted tongue
Recognized the underworld since I was young
Back in '84 when I saw Crockett & Tubbs as the law
These eyes got big when they televised that raw
My mama should've seen it comin'
Me runnin' up and down the stairs too quick
Hummin' Miami Vice theme music
Calderone made me colder
I see the villains' impact, now that I'm older
Ignorant fool, views ignorant, too
Got a lot of money, keep militant tools
Wasn't present the session they handed out the rules
So I gravitated, related to life's cruels
The meaning? Pusha T's more than he's seeming
Not just a rap name, more so like a damn shame
Nothing's changed, just the crimes is less heinous
The three of us know, yet the shooter remains nameless
And I don't even watch my back
I was raw before rap, and I ain't lost my past
Shit could get hairy, I could lose myself in a flash
Niggas'll think I'm Jim Carrey how I off that mask

I even went by the book at first
Until I realized 9 to 5 wouldn't quench my thirst
So I start my mission, leave my residence
Mama knew that a child like me had better sense
But something had to give, that's real, I had to live
I chefed that soft white and pumped from her crib
Scout's honor, started with my grandmama
Who distributed yay she had flown in from the Bahamas
Partner, please, I grinds, I hustle with ease
Can damn near eyeball any weight in my sleep
I don't entertain hate surrounding the street
If I was you, I'd be tryna get down with me
But no, see these niggas know too much
Meanwhile I rock jewels that look like my diamonds blush
Cats act as if rap fell in my lap
I've suffered heartbreak many times back to back
And still feel belittled sittin' here spittin' riddles
Amongst clown ass rappers who tend to give me the giggles
Let 'em take it however they wanna take it
I'm the reason your favorite MC's no longer your favorite
Hey, I'm one of the greats, I can't lie
I mean great to the point I'm concerned I might die

When we met I was talkin' that game
Parkin' that thang
Since then between us
A lot of things changed
Now it's like the world got a whole different name
I can't stop chicks from sayin' my name
Most of it's lies
If not, don't be surprised
You knew I was ballin' when I met you
But really, I started layin' low just to net you
I'm raw as hell yet can't deny that you special
These girls can't either
Winter, his and her Vivas
Summer, his and her Louie sneakers
You don't think that bother people
Guess again you even need to check your friends
Sayin' that I cheat
Right, maybe with my heat
Got a pearl handled chrome thing that I call Sweets
I greet wit her, creep wit her, even eat wit her
Late nights under my sheets, yeah I sleep with her
But thats it

Look
Ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryin' to split us as lovebirds
But that's not it
Now you see me buyin' her whips and shit (No)
You see me sendin' her on trips and shit (No)
If the answers no don't forget (How she know you then)
I don't know

If I don't know I don't know, lets not go that road
I don't know who she is, don't care who told
Look stop flippin', no need to explode
I seen the number in the pager, I don't know that code
In the streets too much, come on, that's absurd
Gettin' no complaints when I be flippin' them birds
Your girls just talk 'bout this that and the third
Believe half what you see none of what you heard
You askin' me who's her I'm askin' who's mink fur
With that rock on her hand makin' their eyes blurred
Could that be you plus who cop every gem
Who spend like I spend, then act like it then
Got the dream home and we settled in it
Our lives too perfect that's why they meddle in it
Now, just chalk it up as just part of the game
You know who I'm about, who got part of my name?

I'm not most men my heart truer than theirs
Of course your girls hate, our whips newer than theirs
We hardly fight, arguements way fewer than theirs
Even down to the ice, look, bluer than theirs
What they gonna tell us about us, huh?
What they talk 'bout without us, huh?
The envy got 'em speakin loosely
Tell 'em walk in your shoes
But first let 'em know they Gucci

And even if I did twist her
I promise I didn't kiss her
Won't shit touchy feely
Grudge on the floor like Mister did to Celie
No respect shown
My homies laugh while she talk dirty on the speaker phone
Now don't you start
I spared your heart
If you ain't see it I didn't do it
Ain't I played my part?
Bricks chics whips chips, that just go with the grind
What else do you want from me, to say it, fine

You ready to come down here?
It's Virginia, nigga
We do this in broad daylight
It's a whole different degree of homicide, nigga
You ready?

I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook
Pack it up, sell it triple-price, fuck the books
Where we re-up, re-locate, we off them rooks
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look

In my ""Home Sweet Home"" I keep chrome next to my bones
Alters my walk to limpin'
Since I love the feel, I guess I'm passionately pimpin'
It 'tis what it seems
That thing imprintin' through the seams of my jeans, by all means
Lost it all, from lives to love
But my faith and my money helped me rise above
See I turned to the Lord when them times got tough
Bullied through streets, powder I pushed and shoved
In that ol' Virginny
Out of ten niggas, nine are guinea
No money, all they know is gimme, got semis waitin'
Heat like Caribbean summers, I been there
Each year, a different bitch wonder
Who wing she gon' fall under, Push' or Mal'
Gonz or Grimes, wit' me, with thoughts of fuckin' them cross her mind
Look ma, that's right up my alley
I love my family, I want them all happy
In Virginia, we smirked at that Simpson trial
Yeah, I guess the chase was wild
But what's the fuss about?
See, plenty my partners feelin' like O.J
Beat murder like the shit is OK, that's what our dough say
Talk the evil that men do, I'm lost in the mental

They fast to predict the outcome of my fate

""Malice, he think he hard, tough guy of the clique
And Pusha, he walk around like he swear he the shit""
You right on both counts, bitch, Clipse is us
And there are some things that you don't discuss
Don't ask me 'bout the Neptunes and what's they fare
Don't ask about the loud screamin' chick with the hair
Don't ask about my music, and how that's comin' 'bout
Don't ask about my album, or when's it comin' out
'Cause I feel like you really being funny on the sly
Now face down, layin' on your tummy, or you die
I tried being humble, humble get no respect
Now the first sign of trouble, that's a hole up in your neck
Plus, what I look like spendin' my nights in jail
I could never be a thug, they don't dress this well
I reside in VA, ride in VA
Most likely when I die, I'm gon' die in VA
Virginia's for lovers, but trust there's hate here
For out-of-towners, who think that they gon' move weight here
Ironic, the same same place I'm makin' figures at
That there's the same land they used to hang niggas at, in Virginia

I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook

Motherfucker hit you then you better hit 'em back
So when I hit the nigga it go blam
A nigga out of line

Back when I was 'bout Big Wheels and race tracks
Pops pushed a Tornado and rolled to eight tracks
Never stood a chance, exposed from way back
Lying to the baby, saying its Ajax
I was 'bout four when I walked past that door
That shoulda been closed where I first witnessed the raw
See in my household it was quite unique
Playing hide and seek you might find a key
Caught glimpse accidental, it branded my mental
Pals my role model in that Lincoln Continental
Bought all my friends Icees, it was 'bout six
And when he pulled off I was like, ""See told ya we was rich""
How I turned out let it be no surprise
When they speak of cousin Ricky it brings tears to their eyes
See, my family got a history of hustlers
Lil' brother, big brother, mother to grandmother
It's tradition

Motherfucker hit you then you better hit 'em back
So when I hit the nigga it go blam
A nigga out of line
Motherfuckers out of line

My momma didn't see it coming, my daddy was there
What's my excuse? Cartoons were the root
Started with Yosemite Sam with the gun in
Palm of each hand, what couldn't I demand?
See, thirteen, studied the gangsta's lean
Low brim, no smile, lotta cash meanwhile
Daddy had the Chrysler Fifth Avey
Hustlers on the blocks cars were aero-dynamie
With ghetto paint jobs, Mango M3s
Seventeen inch B-Bs riding tough
The bike was Huffy, attention was froze
In a twenty five cent frozen cup laid my soul
The streets had made the mold
Since fourteen holding, Pusha T was chosen
Rebel like Che Guevara
RC Tyco versus Carrera, it's P

When I was a young boy
My momma always told me don't take no shit
Motherfucker hit you then you better hit 'em back
So when I hit the nigga it go blam
A nigga out of line
Motherfuckers out of line

I think of grandma and the weight she would foot 'em
She kinda remind me of Madame Queen in Hoodlum
Sport the grandkids, each one she would treasure
Said she kept two guns and to do so was a pleasure
The cigarette dangle forty-five degree angle
Still every bit a lady but you don't wanna tangle
Let that explain me and how I got involved
Young'ns hustling in the Creek, me, Jon-Jon and Jamal

Age fifteen, walking through the hallway
Plate the new Jordans, first ones on the scene
See I could afford 'em, living out a dream
Hustler on the rise, laces untied
Slid past young'ns, couldn't break my stride
Didn't know I was knotted in street ties
Teachers askin' how and why
Bitches passing by: ""Oh my, he's so gangsta""

Mmm I'mma tell you what I'm talkin bout
When I was a young boy
My momma always told me don't take no shit

Well, uh
I was trained to hang 'til the raid is over
Roll wit nuttin' but a whole brigade of soldiers
I was young holdin' guns, I kept one wit me
In the flatbed in the back of an F-150
I see three and the six, me and the Clipse
Squeeze off, pop the guns, you seein' the tips
Ride wit me, nigga die wit me
Yo this money's the easiest shit to get in this world beside pussy
That'll cost you, my whole crew will stomp you to death
Wearin' cleats until you look like a waffle

Who woulda thought I'd sell my skill for a microphone
And be rappin' about it up in the song, slidin' on some chrome

It's long money I earn, I'm bald headed, but I used to have a Lord Jesus perm

Don't let the Reverend hold your casket 'cause
We think you thinkin'
These verses is curses the only thing worse is
I'm the ring master of the circus
Meanin' that, I'm the only one in the show with purpose
Most of you motherfuckers don't scratch the surface
Look, still ghetto, still tot' heavy metal
Still throw a nickname on all of my vehicle
Like the Copperfield coupe, now you see it now you don't
With one flick of the wrist wow! the roof will go poof! (poof)
I'm an achiever make all of you believers
And I'll be damned if you overthrow Virginia's Caesar
Spend a day, sin a way, walk with me
Hug corners in the hood like a ghetto renegade switch!
Spend a way, rolls gold Jesus

50 on the wrist leanin', niggas is sick
Steamin' they can't understand the meanin'
So they plot and conjure up ways to interrupt my well bein'
But that 9's been a damn good friend
Plus worthy made it to see 30 and I owe it all to him
Jewels lookin' as if I done robbed a vault
So if your bitch takes an interest it is not her fault
I mean look, head to toe heavy in weight
Pockets loaded hey I must say I take a cake
They speak ill, but words don't break him bone
They bounce off him, 'cause see him is purchasin' homes
See his stones how they complement each other
Size of the rocks and they fluctuate in color
That him is me get a clue enough's is enough
Took it easy on y'all fuckers and I ain't even rimed my truck (Uhh)
To put it simple I'm a rarity ma
From the cars to the jewels what clarity ha
Stick with me show you life that's out of this world
And I ain't lyin' to you love I only lie to my girl
I lust for the riches what a treat this is
The Lord is dealin' with my demons and my weaknesses
God forgive lose it all or God forbid
But from the Cradle 2 The Grave I'm a live

Oh if my uncle could see me know
If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now
Straight emulatin my style right to the ""down down""
Can't leave out the store now better wait 'til they calm down
I got hella shorties, comin' askin, ""Yo where the party?""
Oh lordy, will I continue to act naughty?

I heat the booth, Nelly actin' so uncouth (so crazy)

That millionaire boys club fashion
Uh, you niggas is clones

Neither the sun or death can be looked at

That was the exact moment I decided to take a pact
And if you owe me and if I decided to take it back

It wasn't nicely expect Rosco to put you back, in place
I'm what you call a destructive warpath
It'll be a shell shower in today's forecast
You a gangsta? I can't tell

You diamonds don't glimmer when the light hit it
Those jewels aren't genuine, 'cause if they was I'm nice with it
I woulda' been took that
That skinny stack in your pocket, I woulda' been shook that

In this world you gotta watch it, I'm hear to warn ya
Cats turned informant, over snow wrapped in wax
My son's home crying, don't give me no slack
Just put the motherfucking money in the bag

Lets hear it for him
Keep a new toy so I wonder how good
I'm not enjoying life I'm reliving my childhood
Big chain monster, whip game bonkers
Monster truck remind him of tonka
Diamond M colour plush gold still gutter
My deal is in the meals, 
Motherfucker and I ain't stutter
Bitter sweet, my life's a musical
From holding nose to roles gold
The lords beautiful
Before him I'm to shame to show my face
But she's so mean can't help but to fall off the race

Hot Damn, its a new day
Hot Damn, but them boys want the (money man)

Hot Damn, when the white hit the pen it
Twist and it tumbles, it
Flips and it fumbles, I
Mix it like gumbo, I
Pitch it so subtle, I
Keep hustle so pother feds I got 'em wondering (wondering)
What happened to that boy?
Six maneuver, how to slip into that toy
Is it the pimp the crook a hustler thing?
The man the music the making the king
Constantly built by me

The verse making the world sing

Find yourself, in a hopeless hole trying to go against him!

This is not pinching penny's bitch, this is carrot cake

This is the difference 'tween rookies and the pros

Do as I do so I can say, ""Papa raised you well""

And the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, (yes!)

Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue

And that pretty much leave Malice at the table

Hello new world, here we come
On them twinkie trains, with the hood screaming, ""We're on our way""
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man screaming, ""I'm on my way""

Yes, I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by Papi screaming, ""It's on its way""
I can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say, ""Lookout world I'm on my way""

I listen to the beat and the rhyme is wrote
See, I was 16, eyes full of hope
Bagging up grams at the higher dough
The news called it crack, I called it Diet Coke, oh

At the same time, hiding from mama, dodging the drama
Fuckin' plenty bitches while ducking the baby mama
I found poetry, excuse me, floetry
""Say yes? niggaz hear the, ""Eghck"" and they know it's me

Make 'em sick to their stomach how they s'posta be
Sippin' on a 50 foot yacht, nigga, motion free
Ocean in my backyard where it's s'posta be
Funny how my neighbors don't think it's where I'm s'posta be

They think I'm cuter in jail
But the only time I'm boxed in is when the roofs on the SL
And that even come off, so that would mean I'm visiting
New world, I hope y'all listening, envisioning

Hello new world, here we come

Them things still get wrapped by Papi screaming, ""It's on its way""

From my hood to say, ""Lookout world I'm on my way""

This goes out to my Halites that hang out on them corners
Who rock Air Nike's, live a hustlers way of life
In white T's, constantly, ducking from Ds
Pumpin' that D arm, readily, waiting to squeeze

Who stay cookin', stay lookin', over they shoulders
Holdin' them boulders, tryin' to avoid central booking
I ain't coming at 'cha quote, unquote famous rapper
Who turn positive, try to tell ya how to live

But this information I must pass to the homies
If hustling is a must be Sosa, not Tony
We can all shine, I want your wrist lit like mine
Neck and ears, I want it lit like mine

Foreign cars, stick shift, 6 gears like mine
Anything that keep mama from crying, visiting
You from behind that glass, while you away, sentencing
But the judge is saying ""Life"" like it ain't someone's life

Get that money, put them 9s up
Piggy back out the ghetto 'for times up, niggaz rush

Hello new world, here we come
On them twinkie trains, with the hood screaming, ""We're on our way""
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man screaming, ""I'm on my way""

Yes, I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by Papi screaming, ""It's on its way""
I can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say, ""Lookout world I'm on my way""

I'm out of my mind
I'm runnin' from guilt

Is it the bling, the king, conquistador
That my jeweler made the face blush on the Frank Mueller
The are shape peculiar, it's awesome, layin' over dark skin
Lookin' like arson when I park in the left, it's constant

Minute hand is like Parkinson's
You a fish for the sharks to swim
In that opaque linen with the are colored stitchin'
V12 on a Modena you can see the pistons

HRE's on it, mommy see it glisten
When I make Oliver Twist like Dickens
It's feelin' like parts is missin', tops don't push soul
Got it drive it like pole positions 'til my soul's risen

All I want to do is ride around shining while I can afford it
Plenty ice on my neck so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsche's
Feel like a chuck wagon 'cause I'm on twelve horses

And the three behind mine they be the click
So much ice in they Rollie's, the *** don't tick, man
Winter through the summer, care less what it cost me
While I'm shovelin' the snow man call me frosty lova

Welcome to the world of Rollie's
VS diamonds and that 50,000 dollar show piece
Got me shinin', first *** holla show me
Let that 9mm turn a fella ghostly

Hell, I'll even grant amnesty to those who owe me
You *** ***, you need to raise your glass and toast me
*** can't figure the format for hustler criteria
Not chrome, grown rims with stallion insignia

?Listen youngin', you've only just begun
You'll understand when you're older? said father to the son
Who would've thought such riches stem from ill rhymes?
Canary yellow diamonds size of yield signs, slow down

And proceed with caution
Carousal of horses with dual-exhaustion
Fess up, youngin' you'll always be next up
Go against I, forever play catch up ***

All I want to do is ride around shining while I can afford it
Plenty ice on my neck so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsche's
Feel like a chuck wagon 'cause I'm on twelve horses

And the three behind mine they be the click
So much ice in they Rollie's, the *** don't tick, man
Winter through the summer, care less what it cost me
While I'm shovelin' the snow man call me frosty lova

A nigga with a attitude, take it outta context
Riding with them big things, lookin' like a bomb threat
Bin Laden beard, afghan in a bomb vest
Ross, stranded on the death row
Makavali's on the Maybach, kicks retro
She wanna gaze at the stars
Through a panoramic view, pullin' haze out the jar
Rick Ross, I'm the best in the flesh
Getting blessed on the ?, it's a way to reflect
Hard work pays off, I'm a boss, you can tell
By the bottles in the pail, and the models that we share
I'm in a realist state, and a realist state of mind
We came from trigger play, kill a nigga for a dime
I'm tryna chill today, I got a million on my mind
Dice in my hand, one roll, I blow your mind

On the other hand, I'm still pitchin' underhand
All soft balls, all bases covered man
More trucks, more bucks, more freaks, more butts
I see the vision, from club vision to ?
I get brain, I bust nuts in each states
Soon as I see what I'm lookin' for

Know you wanna sit by me, all you do is think bout it

Next day, buy a condo to get a kick out it

When I'm on the beach, all my diamonds are water blue (Ross)
Let's party like the pack jam, Pac Man
Fifty grand, stacked in my lap man
Get a lap dance (and if you get my dick hard)
This your last chance (to hop up in that big car)
With the Fat Man (certified Hood Star)
But he a millionaire (look bitch I'm going far)
This the movement, a few niggas you wanna move with

Hung the cat up by its tail;

Where everybody knows your name,
And they're always glad you came;
You want to be where you can see,
Our troubles are all the same; 
You want to be where everybody knows your name.

Roll out of bed, Mr. Coffee's dead;

And your shrink ran off to Europe, 
And didn't even write; 
And your husband wants to be a girl;

Pusha, Yeah
Trim set 'em Thin better than I
Comin' through in the slim leathers that's followed by the fives
My and My Niggas call the coupe Jekyl and Hyde
Cause the roof's On and Off's Like They In and Out Of Their Minds
Eggshell pale ti-da-tota on the scale
The old nine's is out and I ain't waiting on a deal
The same time the motherfuckers bargaining and lawyering
That coke money just keep pouring in and pouring in
Quarter mil bling-bling, that's the price of fame, lame
I should have a title and a D.E on the chain man
Re-up Gang pyrex over pie roll
Stir it till it's hard, Pop it out, let it dry slow
Recipe for Greatness Me and Carty now Nigga taste this
You fucking with the A-list. Face it.
Nigga this tha' swag Four-eighty-five hangin' off my ass
We call it Frivolous cash ( What the fuck)

[Verse 3: Malice of Clipse]
(Now listen)
Superstar Like Lupe
See me in the Coupe Hot damn It's a new day
I remove the roof as if it's a toupe
To shed light on the jewels, Glue on blu-ray
High definition
I get cash two-twenty on the dash and a self start ignition
Tola don't love me but she keep insisting
Brain so good it's hard to keep my distance
Red Carpet entrance play clothes fashion
Nose in the air I smell a Chanel platinum
Re-Up is the Gang, I rep with a passion
Till the wheels fall off and It all Come crashing
Malice with Mr. Carter now
Behind dark tint like we on the prowl
Nothing like money make a bitch loose her blouse
Well done homie, we rich take a bow.

I'm set straight like a perm do it, Push!

They whisperin' about us
I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money we ain't even finish countin'
Pardon me I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal

Ay yo I'm sittin' on top of the

I be killin' damn it, I'm illin' I'm illin'
Eh eh eh meet Mr. Popular
Go get your binoculars
And see Penthouse 3 where a nigga be
Spittin' fire on the P-J in my P-J's
Fire Marshall said I took it to the Max like T-J
Y'all ain't peep? I said Marshall's we play
I guess I'm like the Black Marshall meets Jay
Meet Ye' alligator souffle, had it made
Special Ed got head from a girl in Special Ed
Ya know the pretty ones in that dumb class
But she got that dumb ass
Hit high school and got pregnant dumb fast
What happen Tisha, your boyfriend cum fast?
Turn around gimme pound like we folks
Hell no I went raw dog three strokes

They whisperin' about us
I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money we ain't even finish countin'
Pardon me I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal

Lights, cameras, action!
The chain itself's a damn distraction!
You claim the belt, the glory I bask in
I bee hop in the ring, niggas ya cash in
It's like stoppin' a train,
Nigga think he's stoppin' my reign
Talk slick while droppin' my name?
I'm puttin' y'all to shame, diamonds in the little hand
50 percent splits I ex out the middle man
A far cry from a stash in the rental van
I'm the reason the hood need a dental plan
Ladies and gentle-man, introducin'
The C-4-S with the rims protrudin'
The roof vamoose, like a magic show
Got me lookin' to the heavens like a javelin throw
Y'all twiddle your thumbs like the average Joe

Last night what I seen made my life change
Made my life change,
Made my life change,
Made my life change,
Made my life change,

Yea yet yet yet I move on,
Yeah yes I move on,
Yeah yes I move on,
Yeah yes I move on, (hear me out now)

Where I'm from see us guy don't believe in luck
I can't believe what they doin' to my nigga buck
Facin' time, 25 to life
25 the same thing as life
Only chips is to fight or to forfeit
Baby momma tryin' to make the mortgage
Daughters playin', tryna put cha back up in the portrait
Uh it's like the tear never stop
When u was home it's like the smiles never drop
Collect calls with all the hopes of the best
And hang up with a knot in my chest
See see your cell is my hell
My hell is our pain
The hurt gon never stop until we see you home again
And that's all we wanna see
Maybe in a dream but not a memory
Forget that hold your head man head man
Last night what I seen made my life change

[Chorus]

I was retched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked
So much so I had left my family forsaken
A troubled soul whose heart was often achin'
So much dough but my spirit ever so vacant
Foul and fragrant I was taken off course
The road ahead should have ended me in divorce
But now I see clearly with the family of 4
Never did I deserve a 2 seater Porsche
Heart filled with remorse, my life was such a mess
Now I'm back on board due to the lords G-P-S
One eighty degree turn whoever could've guessed
Malice believe in his heart and out my mouth I confess
Yes more than blessed I was chosen
I been on the troop, my wisdom is that of old men
Wasted so much time stuntin' for folk
When really the whole time I was just stuntin' my growth
A message to the youth, what I'm offerin' is hope
Now somethings gotta change I'm at the end of my rope
Cause

[Chorus]

You know I gotta go and get it
There ain't no other choice in it
Ain't tryin' to be a part of the percentage
Hear me out now

Lord knows I done seen the worlds cold shoulder
Seein' my future thru the crystal ball of bakin' soda
Oasis of hoes, my champagne supernova
The high life and high times, I watched em turn sober
Seen it all come crashin' crashin'
The F-E-D's was at the door, and no they not askin'
Sayin' they found drugs but they ain't talkin' asprin'
Diesel design ones and I ain't talkin' fast shit

Money hoes and clothes is malice's past tense
All said forgiven, all you do is askin'
Even when laughin' I can't explain the hurt
Knowin' I can't change the world in a verse
Even to my self I'm feelin' my screws loose
But how can I deny what I know to be true
When I dint have a clue, shoulda viewed it as a gift
Now I see what they mean ignorance is bliss

Whether watching for the Feds or avoiding the Grim Reaper.
Way deeper than rap money and hoes, it's deeper than that
Fight the temptation but it keep coming back
Money stacked to the ceiling just as quick as it dispense

A rock and roll dream it's all bling bling
I'm the star on the scene
Yeah, check me out see what I'm all about
I'm the one that you want the one you can't have
The girl that you call who doesn't ever call back
Just look at me I've got everything

I was lying on the couch
Drool coming out my mouth
Turned on the TV
Dr. Phil won't you please fix me

I'm waiting for the phone to ring
Flipping through a magazine
Why doesn't he call
Guess I'm the loser down the hall

Can you remember that long
