Rob Bochnik,"There's a light inside us all
It only shines as bright as we are
And you've fallen down so low
I'm really worried for you, I'm really worried

And even on our worst days
We were never quite like this
We've gone as far as we can go
Without crashing

At the heart of every fool
Cause they hope you're stupid too
And there's this lingering, this lingering feeling
That I'm missing something, I feel like I'm missing something

And even at your worst babe
You were never as bad as this
You've gone as far as you can go
Without dying",High Horses,2009
Rob Bochnik,"Forgive me, lover, for I have sinned
For I have done you wrong
For I have hurt beyond repair
And when tears occurred no I didn't care
Forgive me, lover, for I have sinned
For I have loved you wrong

But this estranged organ in my chest
Still beats for you
It will not rest, so
Meet me in our secret place
When the time has come

And rest your head in my lap and I'll
Beat you out of your own trap and I'll
Show you how much you have missed truth in
Time we were in right

Ah
Ah

So forgive me, lover, for I have sinned
For I have let you go

But you've been
Every now and then on my mind
You're every now and then on my mind 
You're every now and then on my mind
You're every now and then on my mind
You're every now and then on my mind
You're every now and then on my mind
You're every now and then on my mind
You're every now and then on my mind

You're on my mind
On my mind
On my mind 
On my mind 
On my mind 
On my mind 
On my mind 
On my mind 

On my mind
On my mind 
On my mind 
On my mind 
On my mind 
On my mind 
On my mind 
On my mind",I Have Loved You Wrong,2009
Rob Bochnik,"Use the truth
As a weapon
To beat up all your friends
Every chink in the armor
An excuse to cause offense
And the boys from the hallway
Calling out your name
And true love will,
Find them in the end

You are restless
I was somewhere less secure
So I went running to the road
And so now that the longest of places I was
I quit my rambling and come home

Cause maybe I was born to hold you in these arms
Maybe I was born to hold you in these arms

And your saints
And your mantra
And your things, to keep you calm
If you stay
With that asshole
Is gonna do you harm
As the voice singing loudly on the radio
Just for you
And good fortune
Will find him in the end

Maybe I was born to hold you in these arms
Maybe I was born to hold you in these arms
Maybe I was born to hold you in these arms
Maybe I was born to hold you in these arms",In These Arms,2009
Rob Bochnik,"In the time when your word was true
You gave your heart to the ones you knew
And at the dawn of every day
There was a light that you gave to me

You gave yourself to a love that conquers
Give everything to a love that conquers

And then you came and you came real close
You gave the heart what it wanted most
You took your time and you made it clear
Maybe time will erase some things

You ran away with a love that conquers
You ran away with a love that conquers

Too long in the shadows, too long in the dust
Gave yourself to a love that conquers",Love That Conquers,2009
Rob Bochnik,"I wanna sit you down and talk
I wanna pull back the veils
And find out what it is I've done wrong
I wanna tear these curtains down
I want you to meet me somewhere
Tonight in this old tourist town
And we'll go

Low rising
'Cause we've gotta come up
We've gotta come up
Low rising
'Cause there's no further for us to fall
Low rising
'Cause I fear we've had enough
Low rising
Oh, for the love of you

I wanna take you to the rock
I wanna jump right in
And see what that big ocean's got
I wanna turn this thing around
I wanna drink with you
All night, till we both fall down
Till we go

Low rising
'Cause we've gotta come up
We've gotta come up
Low rising
'Cause there's no further for us to fall
Low rising
And I fear we've had enough
Low rising
Oh, for the love of you

Low rising
'Cause we've gotta come up
We've gotta come up
Low rising
Til I fear we've had enough
Low rising
'Cause there's no further for us to fall

Oh, for the love of you

For the love of you
Low rising, low rising
I wanna sit you down and talk
I wanna sit you down and talk about it now",Low Rising,2009
Rob Bochnik,"Just before the rain came down
The sun came out at last
And as for all assumptions made
And questions never asked

I know we're not where I promised you we'd be by now
But maybe it's a question of who'd want it anyhow

Even now the rainbows seem closer to your hand
It doesn't know where to stop the measure of a man

Okay we're not what I promised you we would become
But maybe its a question of how much you really want

Had enough?
Had enough?
There's plenty more where that came from now

Your feeling bored,
Swallowed up
We got hours on you now

Just before the rain came down
The sun came out at last
And as for all assumptions made
And questions never asked

Okay, I'm not what I promised you I would become
I know, we're not what I promised you we'd be by now

Had enough?
Had enough?
There's plenty more where that came from now

Feeling bored
Swallowed up
We got hours on you now

Still on top
Crawling up
We got hours on you now",The Rain,2009
Rob Bochnik,"What you give
Or give out
Is the only thing
That really counts

Will you stay?
Here, stay around
And we'll both start
Working this out

But it's not just this
It's everything
You're so hard to reach
And impossible to really read
When your talking with
Two tongues in your mouth
And I wish you'd quit this muttering
Beneath your breath
It's killing me
You've not said nothing yet

Who's talking now?
Well I guess I'm starting to doubt
Are we lost here?
Are you keeping count?
Are you gonna just let me down?

Well your hearts not in it
It's everywhere
It's plain to see
You're still wondering
What's underneath
You're so curious
It's two strikes and you're out
And I'm tiring of this attitude
How you fall to pieces
Like you do
I can't believe you're still talking
With two tongues in your mouth
After all we've been around

Will you hear me out?
You're the only thing
That really counts",Two Tongues,2009
Rob Bochnik,"What's the verb to cut it off
To take a knife and hack away at it
You keep saying, well that's the last time
You'll pretend to, stand aside no matter what we did
I'm not playing, 

All in all then just enough to
Keep us sliding back to where we were

I'm not waiting
And that's the last time you'll get friends who
Will tell you that you walked away with it
When you barely scraped through

I'm tired of fighting she said
Your words just rattle my head
All joy escapes in the dark
And I can't make this make sense
Your words are lost to me now
I cannot take it I'm out
I'm stuck here kidding myself
You're out there caring somewhere

So what's the verb to
Kick it off to
Take the time and walk away from it
I'm not playing,
That'll never sit with us well
We're far too pious to get out of it
And we're on our way

I'm tired of fighting she said
Your words just rattle my head
All joy escaped in the dark
And I can't make this make sense
Your thoughts are lost to me now
I cannot take it I'm out
I'm stuck here killing myself
You're out there drinking somewhere

This time I've lost all my hope
I cannot take it no more
I'm stuck here killing myself
You're out there laughing somewhere

I'll tear my heart out no more
I'll burn this bridge till its gone
I'm stuck here killing myself
You're out there laughing somewhere
All joy is lost to me now
I cannot take it I'm out
I'm stuck here killing myself
And you're out there drinking somewhere

Running away won't change anything it only puts it off
Stuck here killing myself

Stand on the spot work out where you are and take it all from there
Running away won't change anything it only puts it off",The Verb,2009
Rob Brereton,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,1995
Rob Bruce,"Back in the days of knights in armor
There once lived a lovely charmer
Swimming in the Rhine
Her figure was divine

She had a yen for all the sailors
Fishermen and gobs and whalers
She had a most immoral eye
They called her Lorelei

She created quite a stir
And I want to be like her

I want to be like that gal on the river
Who sang her song to the ships passing by
She had the goods and how she could deliver
The Lorelei

She used to love in a strange kind of fashion
With lots of hey-ho-de-ho-hi-de-hi
And I can guarantee I`m full of passion
Like the Lorelei

I`m treacherous, yeah-yeah
Oh, I just can`t hold myself in check
I`m lecherous, yeah-yeah
I want to bite my initials on a sailor`s neck

Each affair has a kick and a wallop
For what they crave, I can always supply
I want to be just like that other trollop
The Lorelei

I want to be just like that other trollop
The Lorelei",Lorelei,2007
Rob Burger,"Do me wrong, do me right
Tell me lies, but hold me tight
Save your good-byes for the morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight
 
Say good-bye and say hello
Sure 'nough good to see you
But it's time to go
Don't say yes, but please
Don't say no
I don't want to be lonely tonight
 
Go away then, damn you
Go on and do as you please, yeah
You ain't gonna see me getting down on my knees
I'm undecided and your heart's been divided
You've been turning my world upside down
 
Do me wrong, do me right, right now baby
Go on and tell me lies, but hold me tight
Save your good-byes for the morning light, morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight
I don't want to be lonely tonight
No, no, I don't want to be lonely tonight
I don't want to be lonely tonight",Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight,2016
Rob Burger,"Well the sun is surely sinking down
But the moon is slowly rising
And this old world must still be spinning 'round
And I still love you

So close your eyes
You can close your eyes, it's all right
I don't know no love songs
And I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song
And you can sing this song
When I'm gone

Well it won't be long before another day
We're gonna have a good time
And no one's gonna take that time away
You can stay as long as you like

So close your eyes
You can close your eyes, it's all right
I don't know no love songs
And I can't sing the blues anymore
But I can sing this song

Rob Coombes,"Now that our lives have seen the light
Well the world lies twisted and weird
It's like our minds have taken flight
Pedalo rides up to the sun, oh yeah

Well, what you do is up to you
Take my hat and push on through
Well you can try to understand
I'm a rock'n'roll singer in a rock'n'roll band

Now that our eyes have seen the light
Well the road lies open and clear
It's like our minds have taken flight
Like the railroad down to the sea, oh yeah

Well, what you do is up to you
I'll take my hat and push on through
Well you can try to understand
I'm a rock'n'roll singer in a rock'n'roll band

Rob Crabtree,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1999
Rob Crosby,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while",Once in a While,1991
Rob Crosby,"I had a little angel in Caroline
Devil in her eye
She left tracks all over my heart
Thought I was gonna die
I picked myself up and shook off the dust
Took a little time to mend
Till she called me up on Saturday night 
I was head over heels again

Well, the trouble with love is you can't understand it
It comes and goes at the drop of a heart
Just when you think you've figured it out
It leaves you in the dark
You tell yourself that you've got to be crazy
Swear you're giving up 
Then you come right back and you do it all over again
You can't get enough--- that's the trouble with love

Half the time you're on cloud nine
Right where you belong
The rest of the time you're scratchin' you head
Wonderin' what went wrong

Well, the trouble with love is you can't understand it
It comes and goes at the drop of a heart
Just when you think you've figured it out
It leaves you in the dark
Oh you tell yourself that you've got to be crazy
Swear you're giving up 
And you come right back and you do it all over again
You can't get enough--- that's the trouble with love

That's the trouble with love.

Rob Crosby,"She walks to school with the lunch 
She packed
Nobody knows what she's
Holdin' back

Wearin' the same dress
She wore yesterday
She hides the bruises with linen
And lace

(Oh oh)

The teacher wonders but she
Doesn't ask
It's hard to see the pain
Behind the mask

Bearing the burden
Of a secret storm
Sometimes she wishes she was
Never born

[Chorus]
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where
She's loved
Concrete angel

Somebody cries in the middle 
Of the night
The neighbors hear, but they turn
Out the lights

A fragile soul caught in the hands
Of fate
When morning comes
It'll be too late

[Chorus]

A statue stands in a shaded place
An angel girl with an upturned face
A name is written on a polished rock
A broken heart that the world forgot

Rob Crow,"Mr. Wilson, don't have that attitude
You're kind of being rude
What about peace and love?
You need some flowers in your hair",Mr. Wilson,1997
Rob Crow,"Open up an old book to a part
And I can't remember if I
Read that far
But some things stay with me

Can't remember what time of day
To do certain things I'm supposed to
But some thing stay with me
Like the time that you said
You'd have my back for now and
Forever

What's that way you make
That soul bleed
Guts on the floor
Disembowled over you
Hall of mirrors, overtime
Just polish and a rag

What's your codec?
Eliminate the static cling
To the ceiling like a
Giant sticky hand
Never afraid to admit to
Love another man
Sick of the sight of me
Jedi Academy
Boring Fatality like a
Record with a blank sleeve

Why the same thing one more time?
Why depress me on my dime?
Want to see something that I've
Never seen before
Wanna see a monkey and
A clown do semifore

Something, somewhere
Someone, somehow
Same thing
Endless
A new letter spelling
Glitter Terror Palindrome
From the Desk of Never Been
There Naysay
Heaven doesn't matter
And you never ever go home

Calm the voices saying
""This thing"" to you
Meaning ""This thing from you""
Shouting ""That thing""

There is nothing
There is no rest
No sleep
Nothing in your mind

Rob Davis,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Rob de Nijs,"Je schuimt de straten af
En volgt het dievenspoor
Met schooiers en soldaten
Hun petten op een oor
Je tilt je rokken op
En lacht naar iedere man
Die in het donker wel durft
Wat overdag niet kan
En bij nacht
In de kroegen hier
Gaat je naam in het rond
Bij het blond schuimend bier
Ik ken ze een voor een
De heren van fatsoen
Ik zal ze nooit vergeten
Zoals ze jou wel doen
Hoe vaak heb jij zo'n kop
Bezopen, stom en geil
Niet aan je borst gedrukt
Je lijf nat van zijn kwijl
En bij nacht
In de kroegen hier
Gaat je naam in het rond
Bij het blond schuimend bier
Malle Babbe kom
Malle Babbe kom hier
Lekker stuk, malle meid
Lekker dier van plezier
Malle Babbe is rond
Malle Babbe is blond
Een zoen op je mond
Malle Babbe, je lekkere kont

Lalalalalala
Lalalalalala

En zondags in de kerk
Dan zit daar zo'n meneer
Stijf als een houten plank
Met spijkers in zijn kop
Te kijken in zijn bank
Een zwart lakens pak
Om zijn zondige lijf
Bang voor de duivel
En bang voor zijn wijf
En zuinig een cent
In het zakje doen
Zo koopt hij zijn ziel weer terug
En zijn fatsoen
En jij moet achteraan
In het donker ergens staan
Zoals het hoort
Maar eens dan komt de dag
Dan luiden ze de klok
Dan draag jij witte bloemen
En linten aan je rok
Wanneer we met elkaar
Gearmd de kerk uitgaan
Wat zullen ze dan kijken
Daar denk ik altijd aan
Als bij nacht
Malle Babbe kom",Malle Babbe,1989
Rob Dickinson,"With every breath you take
Life begins again
And every time you whisper
Death starts to descend
You're all alone until you close your eyes
And you can see the beauty in your life
It begins again again again again

We sat alone one night
And you were crying to me
A fear held me so tight my soul
Of what the future held
And what the world was bringing to me
This matter of the future in my head again

A vision came before me
Crystalline
And now I see it clearly
Two bright lights

Be just be
Hovering and wondering
Whispering in choral dreams
Of all the kings and all the queens
Presidents and vanities
All of you and all of me
All and all and everything
Be just be

I saw you standing in the sun today
We'd lived our lives and loved the truth
Our dreams came true for us just like you said
Now our souls can truly begin again again again again
Now you see me
Now you see me
Now you see me",Life Begins Again,2005
Rob Dickinson,"Never in my life
Have I felt so right
All I do
Is the truth

And I feel
And I feel
And I feel

As I walk outside tonight
With the stars as my guide
Knowing where to go
It's my Heart that tells me so

And I feel
And I feel
And I feel
Love is real
Love is real
Love is real
Love is real

And in time I found myself
With some stories and some wealth
A place for us to meet

Rob Diener,"No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me

Rob Dixon,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Rob Dougan,"You tell me I can't slow down
You tell me where I've got to be
I speed into the darkness
But I swear that I can't see a thing in front of me
You know it's true
I'm not driving anymore
I can't keep up with you
You're closing in behind me
I've got headlights in my eyes
Don't you get too close to me
Can't you see that we'll collide and end up casualties
There's just no room
I'm not driving anymore
I can't keep up with you
So leave me on my own
Run me down and race away from me
I've got nowhere to go to

You came right out of nowhere
Eyes wide and terrified
And I can't put my brakes on

And I can't choose
I'm not driving anymore
I can't keep up with you
Get me out of harm's way
Can't you see I'm paralyzed

I want to fade out gracefully
But you keep keeping me alive to face another day

Can't you see I'm through
I'm not driving anymore - I can't keep up with you
Tell me how long have I got (I want to end this earthly toil) - 'till this diet life expires
I want to go swimming in the soil and not come up for breath - sit in God's room
I'm not driving anymore - I can't keep up with you

Rob Dougan,"She thinks that I was born yesterday
She thinks that I go out with the tide and fade at the end of the day
She thinks my hairs aren't numbered
And when pricked I don't cry in pain
Just 'cause I smile like a child born yesterday
And she thinks that I was born in another age
She thinks that I get up with the sun and dream my life away
And she thinks that I'm going nowhere
'Cause I stay in one place

Rob Dougan,"I want to weave a musical spell
That leaves you unwell and thinking of me everyday
I want to play you a tune that leaves you marooned and troubled
Each time I'm away
Is there a melody - that could lead you to me - like a lullabied child led to sleep?
So for one moment in time, you'd find that you're mine
And softly I'd kiss you and weep

I want to write a simple song that's so frequently sung
That you call me to have the thing banned
Who's sound so endears that whole nations cheer and sigh
When you take my hand
Is there a melody - that could lead you to me - like a lullabied child led to sleep?
So for one moment in time you'd find that you're mine
And softly I'd kiss you and weep

God I'm a gambler that just wants to lose and be allowed to leave
I'm a traveler - with one last mile my journey is complete
I'm like a swallow that wants one long last look, before flying east
Last on my list - and then I quit - to kiss your lips and weep

I want to play a silver note that fills you with hope
And tames you to feed from my hand
A turquoise chord that invites you to soar
And fly...to a faraway land
A symphony that gently leads you to sit and be still with me
And grief doesn't frighten me
At its worst it delights me
'Cause I want to kiss you and weep

I'm a gambler that just wants to lose and be allowed to leave
I'm a traveler - with one last mile my journey is complete

You set me aside
And no tears were shed
You left me for dead

And I say, I won't stop, no, 'till Hell is your home
There's no where to hide, no, nowhere
You'll feel the cold of my gun at your head
You left me for dead

It's not like you stayed at my side
Or you called me a priest
You searched through my mouth
To check for gold teeth
You were pawning my shoes as I bled
You left me for, left me for, left me for dead

You kept takin' your time
Until you were certain I couldn't survive
Judas remained, you turned and fled
You left me for dead

And it didn't trouble your mind
It did not disturb you to see me decline
You turned out my lights, you put me to bed
You left me for dead

And I say, I won't rest my head until Hell is your home
You think that you're safe, but oh no
You'll feel the cold of my gun hit your head
You left me for dead

And you stay close to me, didn't stay by my side
I was choking in blood as the laugh filled your eyes
You were a bum for each word that you said
'Cause you left me for, left me for dead

But I don't want to search no more
There's nowhere to hide
So, why don't you come quietly, my love
I wanted to say,
To say that you sure proved the death of me
'Cause now I've reached a dead end
And I can't go back
But if I'm going down you'll come with me

Let the whole world fall away
And fall into my arms
Stay with me
I don't know how long we've got left
And so, I'm asking you to forgive me,

I learn as I go, to float far away
Into silence
And just watch your face, and find some kind of grace
In that quiet bliss
Can I stay and say nothing at all
At all

Where will we go when we get old
When the bustle and the noise get too frightening
When each and every angry word
Is banished to the past
That's when I think

We'll learn as we go, to float far away
Into silence
And I watch your face, and find patience and grace
In each line there
Wake each day, up from nothing at all
At all

And these words thay I say
They mean nothing at all
At all

Will you walk into the grave with me?
Will you leave this angry world
Soft and wistful
To sink into the dark, dank earth
And never reappear, would be blissful

To float far away, into eternal space
And God's silence
Where I watch your face, and find patience and grace
In each line there
Drift away, and end up nothing at all

At all
Fade away, and end up nothing at all

Wondering where you have been, Your lonely voice calls
across the starlit coast, Reaching out to be seen.

[Chorus:]
She cries your name,
three times again,
She cries your name,
How long can this love remain.

Cut beneath the surface screen of what we say and what we
seem, Is a trick to be seen, She keeps crying out your name,
But her scream sound the same, How fickle fate can be.

Birds that scream for territory can learn to sing
euphorically, Give him time an' he's real, And there's a

cold, Living out an ideal.

Pop, trunk and bang, yeah I'm still here mayne
Born and raised on the stead block, braids no dreadlocks
Married to the hood, me and Scenic Woods wedlock
Acres Homes my home, I'm a Northside veteran
Repping H-Town, smoking, sipping on some medicine
Ain't nobody better than the boss when I floss
It's Slim Thugga motherfucker, still breaking boys off

Got plenty cheese plenty carats man we looking like some caterers
And it's looking like you haters and you fakes is imitating us
Shaded up, braided up, and I bet that truck be bladed up
Bentley still crawling on fo's so they ain't fading us
In the hood I'm a grinder, wood on the vinyl
TV, VCR, I'm laid back with your mama

Phantom, Bentley, take ya pick, yeah I'm gettin' my shine on
I've sold 2 million records now my paper all swole now
The mayor of the city, top down when I roll now
H-town, home of the candy paint
Home of the 84's and vogues and the purple drank

Yeh this the city that's slow, the city that's thowed
The city where the boys flip the candy painted low
The city where they blow big killa and stayed blowed
Hustling ass D-boys got the game sewed
Where they sip that paint (sip that paint) and drip that paint (drip that paint)
And drop that top (drop that top) and grip that grain (hold up)

Where the gangtstas smoke water with drank stains on they shirt
We ride swangin', chops blades just to break boys off
From South Park to the Southwest and all the way to that north

From Denver Harbor to West Airport and all the way to Channelview
We steady bangin on this screw, it's chopping like kung fu
Hit me on the 8-3-2, it's Paul Wall, what it do baby (heheh, nahmtawkinbout?)

Blowin' down trees like a Category 5

Anytime he can't be found, we know just where to look:
 
Gone fishin', there's a sign upon his door
Gone fishin', he ain't workin' anymore
There's his hoe out in the sun where he left a row half done
He said ""hoein' ain't no fun"", he ain't got no ambition
Gone fishin' by a shady wady pool
I'm wishin' I could be that kinda fool

There's his hound dog by his side fleas are bitin' at his hide
He won't scratch 'em he's to tired he ain't got no ambition

Gone' fishin'. . .instead of jest awishin'
 
Gone fishin'. . . he don't worry 'bout no wars
Gone fishin'. . .left his wife to do the chores
Cows need milkin' in the barn but he jest don't give a darn
See his fishin' pole is gone he's on a secret mission
Gone fishin'. . .out where peace has never died
I'm wishin'. . .all the world was by his side

Rob Gardner,"You must have seen parties of Blockheads
With blotched and lagered skin
Blockheads with food particles in their teeth
What a horrible state they're in

They've got womanly breasts 
Under pale mauve vests
Shoes like dead pigs' noses
Cornflake packet jacket, 
Catalogue trousers
A mouth what never closes

You must have seen Blockheads 
In raucous teams
Dressed up after work
Who screw their poor old Eileens
Get sloshed and go berserk

Rotary accessory watches
Hire-purchase signet rings
A beauty to the bully boys
No lonely vestige clings

Why bother at all about Blockheads?
Why shouldn't they do as they please?
You know if it came to a brainy game
You could baffle a Blockhead with ease

How would you like one puffing 
And blowing in your ear hole?
Or pissing in your swimming pool?

Bigger brained Blockheads often acquire
Black and orange cars
Premature ejaculation drivers
Their soft-top's got roll bars

'Fill her up,' they say to Blockheads
'Go on, stick it where it hurts'
Their shapeless haircuts don't enhance
Their ghastly patterned shirts

Why bother at all about Blockheads?
Superior as you are
You're thoughtful and kind 
With a well-stocked mind
A Blockhead can't think very far

Imagine finding one in your laundry basket
Banging nails in your big black dog

Why bother at all about Blockheads?
Why should you care what they do?
'Cause after all is said and done
You're a Blockhead too

Rob Gardner,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he for me
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you?
And so all else above

In my suit and tie 
But I just couldn't bring myself 
To go inside 
So I sat alone 
In my truck across the street 
Watched that chauffeur smokin' cigarettes 
By that long white limousine 
I could just imagine 
What was goin' on in there 
Sunlight streamin' through the stained glass 
And those flowers in her hair 
And in less time than it takes a tear to fall 
Those bells rang loud as thunder 
As they opened up the doors 
Now I don't have to wonder anymore 
Laughin' and a cryin' 
Tossin' that bouquet 
And when you got in that limo 
I drove off the other way 
And I still don't know 
Why things happened like they did 
But I parked that old pickup 
On that lonesome river bridge 
I took your ring from my pocket 
And I held it one last time 
Watched that diamond sparkle 
I drew back and I let her fly 
And in less time than it takes to tear to fall 
Oh that old ring went under

Rob Halford,"From memories of 68 when the wizard shook the world
Metal came from foundries where the midlands sound unfurled
The bullring was a lonely place of concrete towers and steel
The coal mines and the industries were all I had to fell.

Something inside took hold of me, I really didn't know
But overtime it came to be, I knew which way to go
I drove around in search of what would make this all come true
From jazz and electricity and good old southern blues

Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell

In Henry's and in mother's where I'd go to bang my head
The feeling took a hold of me with every word I said
The voice was born and came alive from all I saw and heard
And now I knew my destiny, I had to spread the word.

I took the scream around the world
From London to L.A.
Unleashed in downtown Tokyo
Blew Godzilla away

Then on the sound and fury went from Sydney to Brazil
It sent the Russians crazy cause they never get their fill.

Of Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell
Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell

The stage and the lights and the amps are ablaze watch them burn
From all this insanity the Metal God's will return.

Shock waves attack relentlessly, intimidating force
So many bands surrounding you with evil from our source
It screams across the universe and slams you to the floor
This blitzkrieg psycho mania is coming on full roar
The world's a stage that's waiting for its bad ass to get kicked
And we're all on the road to hell and that's route 666

To steal your soul of purity and watch you waste away.

I am pure, I am right, I'm the God that makes you fight, yeah - hate.
I am life, I am death, I will steal your final breath, yeah - hate.

I prey upon your broken dreams your weakness gives me strength.
I'm laughing at your silent screams I'll crush you with my hate.

And face the fear that's here

it leaves you with no choice to carry on.

Resist me not surrender I'll no compassion call

I snap them and you cower down in fear
You spineless things that belly down to slither
To the end of the world you follow to be near

Mourn for us oppressed in fear
Chained and shackled we are bound
Freedom choked in dread we live
Since tyrant was enthroned

I listen not to sympathy whilst ruler of this land
Withdraw your feeble aches and moans
Or suffer smite from this my hand

My legions faithful unto death
I'll summon to my court
And as you perish each of you shall scream as you are sought

When the predator falls
Your fate will be called by his will

He can turn on a dime with his stare
Spins you around and he's taking you down
He don't care

Stay out of his way or you know you're gonna pay eating wall

Rob Halford,"We've taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart
From off I've seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes

With mankind in their command
In time they'd like to discover
How they can make their demand
Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways

Rob Halford,"The gold ran dry in '54 so with a broken hand
He packed his bags and headed south across the Rio Grande
The town was mean and brutal for a gringo filled with strife
He was about to end it all when some thing changed his life

A bullfight in the street went bad the beast made to escape
And in a feat of danger with his jacket as a cape
He stared into the eyes of death and bought it to his knees
A cry went up from in the crowd at last he felt appeased

Then all the people were screaming
Having the time of their lives
Some said they thought they were dreaming
But he was right there before their eyes

He had the crowd they cheering right in the palms of his hands
With one or two of them leering
At what they never could comprehend

Matador heart of the brave
Suit of life never to save
Matador in for the kill
Statuesque he's standing still

El Toro charged he danced with death
And every place he's go
The reputation lead the way through all of Mexico
The Greatest of the Greats they said
One never to be missed
But all good things come to an end
And so it was with his

A moments hesitation and he felt the gore go deep
His life flashed in slow motion as the crowd begin to weep
The country was in mourning as they buried him that day
But memories live for ever like the ghost of him they say

The people said he's The Greatest
Look at his flair and his style
No one can stand in his foot steps
Or follow him by a mile

The crowd was in such a frenzy
He had the air of a saint
Control was part of the fever
Together with such restraint

Matador graced by The Lord
Cheating death plunging the sword
Matador here to annul
With respect praise for the bull

There was a sense of dramatic
That in the blink of an eye
It could turn into traumatic
Would he be alive or die

He was the man of the hour
And master of his domain
He was bestowed and empowered
He had the key to each city he reigned

Rob Halford,"Water's leaking
From the creek above
Makes me shaky
Pacing in the flood

The water's leaking
Goin' down
In my tears
I am drowning
In my fears
Keep my head up
Don't fall in
Walk on water
I'll sink or swim

Down where it's clouding
Like I've never seen
Leaves me drowning

The water's leaking
Goin' down

Rob Halford,"We're not alone, we have a chance you see
Let's live the dreams we have in life
There's nothing left if you can't walk with me
You know we need to put it right

[Chorus]
We own the night
And whatever comes our way
Nothing will hold us back
When we love and we obey

When I'm with you, you give me all your strength
And with your love I carry on
Well we both know it takes the two of us
To face the truth don't need to run

[Chorus]

Let's take tonight
And forget about the day
Stand at the edge of life
Let the starts come out to play

You wait and see
Our light will grow and grow
Open eyes will realize
The ray of life to hold

Our world of calm
It sings right from the heart
Can you hear the storm of fear
Can't tear this love apart

If we don't leap for faith
How can we be free
We can't deny or say goodbye
We found our destiny

Don't leave me alone
I can't stand the thought of being here without you
My heart turns to stone
Look in my eyes, my words are true

But ships pass in the night
Hold me now, hold me now
Before my heart takes flight",We Own the Night,2017
Rob Halford,"You never know me
Cause I won't let you in
Not all I am
Is on the surface

Always concealing what
Is lying within
Ain't feelin' guilt
When there's no purpose

It's too late
To turn around
No tomorrow

Obvious truths are for
The dumb and the weak
Go on pretending in your fake world

Bring your insanity but don't ever speak
Your fucking life is like a circus

To turn around
No tomorrow

Blast round the earth
Validating with immortal strength
Courage of the brave

From the aftermath of dust and flames

Upon the searing light's reflected blade

Rob Henke,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2004

That thrills and delights me, oh no

Truth is in all that I tell

Was getting ready to come around

And make him think I plant for me

My parents live in the same small town

Taught the fear of Jesus in a small town

I cannot forget the people who love me

In the ground, Machine Gun.

Tired of being such small time, now.
Figured they'd kidnap a rich man's son, 
Make it in the world of crime.

Don't let her run you round.
Don't let the woman put you six feet 
In the ground, Machine Gun.

You'd better watch out Machine Gun Kelly, 
Careful of what you do, now.
If you keep listening to your old lady, 
Ain't no telling 
What'll happen to you, now, Machine Gun.

The government boys they came 
For Machine Gun, took the poor boy away.
Stuck him in a hole in Leavenworth prison 
Where he lived until his dying day.

Don't let her put you down.
Don't let a woman make you 
Out to be a clown, Machine Gun.

Are we all in great confusion, do we know the time or hour
When a terrible explosion may ring down upon our land
Leaving horrible destruction blotting out the works of man

Are you ready for that great atomic power?
Will you rise and meet your Savior in the end?
Will you shout or will you cry when the fire rains from on high?
Are you ready for that great atomic power?

There is one way to escape and be prepared to meet the Lord
Give your heart and soul to Jesus, He will be your shield and sword
He will surely stand beside and you'll never taste of death
For your soul will fly to safety and eternal peace and rest

There's an army who can conquer all the enemy's great bands
It's a regiment of Christians guided by the Savior's hand

I'm cold and I am chained
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed 
Into something real
I'm cold and I am shamed and bound
And broken on the floor 
And I can see the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins 
And now I don't care
I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can't touch

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,1986
Rob McConnell,"I hear music when I look at you;
A beautiful theme of ev'ry
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true,
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1986
Rob McConnell,"Must you dance every dance
With the same fortunate man?
You have danced with him since the music began
Won't you change partners and dance with me?
Must you dance quite so close
With your lips touching his face?
Can't you see I'm longing to be in his place?
Won't you change partners and dance with me?
Ask him to sit this one out and while you're alone
I'll tell the waiter to tell him he's wanted on the telephone
You've been locked in his arms
Ever since heaven knows when
Won't you change partners and then
You may never want to change partners again",Change Partners,1990

Rob McConnell,"Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?
I thought I found the gal I could trust, 
What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say,

Rob McConnell,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.

The revolution is here
Yeah, it's Common Sense, with DJ Premier
We gonna help y'all see clear
It's real hip-hop music, from the soul, y'all
Yeah, check it, yo

The perseverence of a rebel I drop heavier levels
It's unseen or heard, a king with words
Can't knock the hustle, but I've seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occurred
Some say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep
Through me, Muhammed will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes in ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
With cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear
Under the Fubu is a guru, that's untapped
Want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that

[Chorus]
""This is rap for real, something you feel""
""And you know, yes you know""
""Rap for the black people""
""Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy""

In front of two-inch glass and Arabs I order fries
Inspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes
I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies
Immortilized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music
My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it
Through my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions
More than money saved, I wanna save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit

[Chorus]

Somedays I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th, stopped by this little girl
She recited raps, I forgot where they was from
In 'em, she was saying how she made brothers cum
I start thinking, how many souls hip-hop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge one's perspective?
Though some of that shit y'all pop true it, I ain't relating
If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes, it's like

Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2003

Take a chance on happiness
Odds are on your better half 
You'll be glad you placed the bet 

Think it over - what's to lose? 
All the odds are in your favour
Play your cards right - no excuse
You know life is what you make it 

Scared to move case you get shortchanged
But nothing venture, baby - nothing gained 
Take a gamble with your heart 
Take a chance on happiness 

Toss a coin or turn a card 
Time to give those blues a rest
Play for keeps - bet your life
I see loving in your future 

You'll never know if you don't try 
Missionary or kama sutra? 
If there's room for you to improve
There's only one thing left for you to do 

Take a gamble with your heart
Take a chance on happiness 
Take the plunge - leap in the dark 
Put your instincts to the test

Take a chance on happiness

Take a gamble with your heart........",Happiness,2004

Don't be left behind

Won't forget the words from your father 
Believe in no other 
Don't ever give up the fight 
'Cause every single day 

Do you remember when 
No one was listening 
You could disappear and no one would notice 
Like a childhood dream 
You wanted everything 
You're still missing what you really wished for 

Now they know your name but, they don't know you. 
It's time to make a change in everything you do

My father will be pacing the floor 
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry 
Beautiful, please don't hurry

Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink 
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how 
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell 
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir 
Mind if I move a little closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried 
What's the sense in hurting my pride
I really can't stay 
Baby don't hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside

C'mon baby

I simply must go 
Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no 
Ooh baby, it's cold outside

I'm lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm 
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious 
Man, your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door 
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious 
Gosh your lips look delicious
Well maybe just a half a drink more 
Never such a blizzard before

I've got to go home 
Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your comb 
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand 
Your eyes are like starlight now
But don't you see 
How can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Making my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied 
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay 
Get over that old out
Ah, but it's cold outside

Baby it's cold outside

Brr its cold
It's cold out there

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Ah the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss good night
Oh how I'll hate going out in the storm

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say Are you married?
We'll say No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made

She smiles at him, he says, ""Hello""
They stand beneath the mistletoe
Embarrassed by the awkward circumstance 

He asks her if she'd like a drink
She says, ""I better not I think
Oh, what the heck, maybe just one glass""

They talk about, oh, this and that
He says, ""I like the way you laugh
And I'm so really glad you're here""

Then suddenly it's much too warm
She feels his hand against her arm
The season loves the reason for romance
It'll get you if you give it half a chance

The night goes on, the music plays
A moonlight Christmas serenade
A lovers' song that's meant for only two

And they don't even know it yet 
But this is one they'll not forget

The holiday where all their dreams came true
Across the floor he spins her around
Oh, could it be they've finally found
A love worth waiting for

Then in the tender yuletide bliss
They share an unexpected kiss
The season loves the reason for romance
It'll get you if you give it half a chance

Then suddenly the night is gone
It's late into an early morn
The season loves the reason for romance
It'll get you if you give it half a chance

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Standing there by the broken tree,
Her hands were all twisted, she was pointing at me.
I was damned by the light coming out of her eyes.
She spoke with a voice that disrupted the sky.
She said 'Walk on over yeah to the bit of shade,
I will wrap you in my arms and you'll know you've been saved'
Let me sign, let me sign, can't fight the devil so just let me sign.

I was out for a drink in a Soho bar
The air was smoked out liked a cheap cigar
She rose out of her seat like a painted ghost
She was the woman that I wanted the most
As she reached for my arm I gave her my hand
I said 'Lay me down easy let me understand'
Let me sign, let sign, can't fight the devil so just let me sign.

As I walked through the door she was still in my head
As I entered the room she was laid there in bed
She reached out for me all twisted in black
I was on my way down, never coming back

Smile and wave at you and ask you about your mother's

A fuzzy screen was all that we could see
Whitey came over with a hanger
And spent the game atop our T.V.

And when the lightning struck him
He let out a wicked, loud yell
But we just turned up the volume
And ignored the burning smell

But you stay so cool
My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem, Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove

And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh, it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Give me your heart, make it real or else forget about it

But I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio
You hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world, so soft and slow
It's turning you round and round

And if you said this life ain't good enough

Help me remember the face I forget
And the traps that I've sprung

I guess I've grown tired
It's just what's expected of me
To tear your heart
From the inside to the outside
You know I was wired
I just couldn't help it

I hurt you

I'm sorry for the screaming last night

That I've never seen
In the years that I've known you
Dear Joan
I'll pick up the pieces
But some traveled so far
They flew when I kicked them
Across the room

I know you believed when I said it was over
You stood by me patiently waiting and brooding
So deeply in love
With every face I've shown

I'm sorry for the screaming last night
And the nights before
I've wanted more from this

Twice I'm a fool
Three times I wrap my hands around your neck 
While you're sleeping

Don't walk out the doorway
Because if you did
I believe I could honestly kill you

Echoed softly on the sand

Lay your hand within my hand

Ever marching as to war

Just let me hold you so we both fall down

Fall on me
Tell me everything you want me to be

We were free like water
Flowing down
Under the warmth of the sun
Now it's cold, and we're scared
And we've both been shaken

Man, this doesn't need to be the end

Just let me hold you while you're falling apart
Just let me hold you so we both fall down

Fall in place

I don't wanna hear about love no more
I don't wanna talk about how I feel
I don't really wanna be me no more

Dress down now I look a little too
Boy next door
Maybe I should try to find a downtown whore
That'll make me look hardcore
I need you to tell me what to stand for

I've been looking for something
Something I've never seen
We're all looking for something
Something to be

Hey man
Play another one of those heartbreak songs
Tell another story how things go wrong
And they never get back
My pain is a platinum stack
Take that shit back
You don't wanna be me when it all goes wrong
You don't wanna see me with the houselights on
I'm a little too headstrong
Stand tall
I don't wanna get walked on

I can't stand what I'm starting to be
I can't stand the people that I'm starting to need
There's so much now
That can go wrong
And I don't need somebody

Wanna make you like an icon

I was drowning, you came and saved my life
Now you broke my heart, and it wasn't right

Of paradise, where roses grew

Dear Prudence let me see you smile
Dear Prudence like a little child
The clouds will be a daisy chain
So let me see you smile again
Dear Prudence won't you let me see you smile?",Dear Prudence,2013
Rob Wasserman,"Hear that whistle, it's ten o'clock.
Don't let go, Don't let go.
Come on, baby, it's time to rock,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
I'm so happy I got you here,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
Keeps me grinnin' from ear to ear.
Don't let go, Don't let go.
Oo-wee, This feelin's killin' me;
Ah shucks, I wouldn't stop for a million bucks.
I love you so, Just hold me tight.
Don't let go!

Thunder, lightening, wind and rain,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
Love is stormin' inside my brain,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
I'm so eager, I'm nearly dyin',
Don't let go, Don't let go.
You've been keepin' your lips from mine.
Oo-wee, This feelin's killin' me;
Ah shucks, I wouldn't stop for a million bucks.
I love you so, Just hold me tight.
Don't let go!

Hound dog barkin' up side the hill,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
Love is draggin' him thru the mill,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
If it wasn't for havin' you,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
I'd be barkin' and howlin' too.
Oo-wee, This feelin's killin' me;
Ah shucks, I wouldn't stop for a million bucks.
I love you so, Just hold me tight.
Don't let go!

One day, baby, you'll quit me yet,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
I'll be cryin' and soakin' wet,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
One thing, baby, I'll never stand,
Don't let go, Don't let go.
Your lips kissin' some other man.
Oo-wee, This feelin's killin' me;
Ah shucks, I wouldn't stop for a million bucks.
I love you so, Just hold me tight.
Don't let go!
Just hold me tight, Don't let go!",Don't Let Go,2013

She's on her own
Just barely seventeen
When she left home
Don't know where she's been
Or where she's going
She is the queen of make-believe
Evangeline

I still remember
This little girl
Black eyes just staring
At this mean old world
Went off to find
Some American dream
Train ticket in the pocket
In her new blue jeans

She went out dancing
On a Saturday night
Silk stockings and high heels
Looking fine and running wild
On Sunday morning
She's all alone
Head lying on the back stair
By the telephone

Rob Wasserman,"Just a song of Gomorrah, I wonder what they did there
Must've been a bad thing to get shot down for
I wonder how they blew it up or if they burned it down
Get out, get out Mr. Lot and don't you turn around.

Who gave you your orders, someone from the sky
I heard a voice inside my head in the desert wind so dry
I heard a voice tellin' me to flee the very same voice I always believe
Say a lot of trouble comin', but it don't have to come to you
I'm telling you so you can tell the rest what you've been through.

But don't you turn around, no, don't look after you
It's not your business how it's done, you're lucky to get through
You're a good upstanding man, a credit to the flock
But if you don't face straight ahead you could not take the shock
Blew the city off the man, left nothing there but fire
The wife of Lot got turned to salt, because she looked behind her.",Gomorrah,2013
Rob Wasserman,"Listen while you read!
Songwriters: Jimmy Cliff
They tell me of a pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
The day that you're born to when you die
They never seem to hear even your cry

As sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share of what's mine
Harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all
Harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all

The officers are tryin' to keep me down
Trying to drive me underground
Though they think they've got the battle won
I say, ""Forgive them, Lord, they know not what they've done""

As sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share of what's mine
Harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all
Harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all

I'll keep on fighting for the things I want
Though I know that when you're dead, you can't
Rather be a free man in my grave
Than living as a puppet or a slave

As the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share of what's mine
The harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all
Harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all

They tell me of a pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
The day that you're born to when you die
They never seem to hear even your cry

Then the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share of what's mine
The harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all
Harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all

The officers are tryin' to keep me down
Trying to drive me underground
Though they think they've got the battle won

I'm gonna get my share of what's mine

Harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all

And I'll keep on fighting for the things I want
Though I know that when you're dead, you can't
I'd rather be a free man in my grave
Than living as a puppet or a slave

As sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share of what's mine
The harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all
Harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all

You know, the harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all
Harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all
Harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all

How sweet it is to be loved by you
I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs and there you were
With sweet love and devotion
Deeply touching my emotions
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you

I close my eyes at night
And wonder what would I be without you in my life
Everything was just a bore
All the things I did seems I'd done'em before
But you brighten up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you

Rob Wasserman,"Maybe you'll wanna give me kisses sweet
But only for one night with no repeat.
And maybe you'll go away and never call,
And a taste of honey is worse that none at all.
Oh little girl!

In that case I don't want nobody
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion,
I second that emotion.
So, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion.

Maybe you'll think that love will tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around.
Or maybe you'll think that love will make us fools,
And so it makes you wise to break the rules.
Oh little girl!

In that case I don't want nobody
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion,
I second that emotion.
So, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion.

In that case I don't want nobody

Rob Wasserman,"They say everything can be replaced
They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here

I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say that every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall

I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
And all day long I hear him shouting so loud
Just crying out that he was framed

I see my light come shinin'
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
