Emilie Autumn,"Thank God I'm pretty
The occasional free drink
I never asked for
The occasional admission
To a seedy little bar
Invitation to a strangers car
I'm blessed
With the ability to rend
A grown man toung-tied
Which only means
That when its dark outside
I have to run and hide
Can't look behind me 
Thank God I'm pretty

Thank God I'm pretty
Evey skill I ever have
Will be in question
Every ill that I must suffer
Clearly brought on by myself
Though the cops would come
For someone else
I'm blessed
I'm truly privaleged
To look this good 
Without clothes on
Which only means
That when I sing
Your jerking off
And when I'm gone 
You won't remember
Thank God I'm pretty

Thank you God
Oh Lord
Thank you God
Oh oh

and when a gaggle of faces
Appears around me
I'ts lucky I hate
To be taken seriosly
I think my ego would fall
Right through the cracks 
In the floor
If I couldn't count on men 
To slap my ass anymore
I know my destiny such
That I'm all stocking and curl
So everybody thinks
That I'm a fucking suicide girl
Ohho

thank God I'm pretty
The occasional champane
I never asked for
The occasional admission
To a seedy little bar
Invitation to a strangers car
I'm blessed 
With the ability to rend
A grown man tongue-tied
Which only means 
That when it's dark outside
I have to run and hide
Can't look behind me
Thank God I'm pretty

Thank God
Thank God
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you God",Thank God I'm Pretty,2007
Emilie Autumn,"Dead is the new alive
Despair’s the new survival
A pointless point of view
Dead is the new alive
Despair’s the new survival
A pointless point of view

Give in, give in, give in, give in
You play the game, you never win
Give in, give in, give in, give in
You play the game, you never win

So take me now or take me never
Choose your fate, how else can we survive
Dead is the new alive
So say goodbye or say forever
Choose your fate, how else can we survive
Dead is the new alive

Dead is the new alive
Despair’s the new survival
A pointless point of view
Dead is the new alive
Despair’s the new survival
A pointless point of view

Give in, give in, give in, give in
You play the game, you never win
Give in, give in, give in, give in
You play the game, you never win

So take me now or take me never
Choose your fate, how else can we survive
Dead is the new alive
So say goodbye or say forever
Choose your fate, how else can we survive
Dead is the new alive

What is a day without a blessed night
And what is peace without a blessed fight
What is a day without a blessed night
And what is peace without a blessed, blessed, blessed fight

A quick taste of the poison
A quick twist of the knife
When the obsession with death
The obsession with death
Becomes a way of life

So take me now or take me never
Choose your fate, how else can we survive
Dead is the new alive
So say goodbye or say forever
Choose your fate, how else can we survive
Dead is the new alive

A quick taste of the poison
A quick twist of the knife
When the obsession with death
The obsession with death
Becomes a way of life

Dead is the new alive
Alive, alive, alive
Dead is the new alive
Alive, alive, alive

Dead is the new alive

Before you travel on.

Look down, look down that lonesome road

I don't why I was just looking for the sea

It's such a shame you're a boy
But when you are not a girl
Nobody buys you flowers

I'll buy you flowers

Sign your 'x' on the line

With some decorations bought at Tiffany

To a glave in the dark for which I have no work

And my heart was gone and undone and undone

To an ocean that lies between ? and dreams

Emilio Caceres,"You've heard all about your raggy melody
Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through
There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band
You've heard of the tisket and tasket it's true
But give a little listen to this will you?
 
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
That's a funny little bit of melody
It's so soothing and appealing to me
It goes Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da, Ja-Da
Jing, Jing, Jing
 
Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing
It's ragtime but it still can swing
It ain't a turkeytrot or a shimmey onestep
But when grandma danced to it
She thought she was hep
It still is a ditty 
I'm sure you will find
Will keep a runnin' 'round and around your mind

Tu ronca maldición maleva
Tu lágrima de ron me lleva
Hacia el hondo bajo fondo
Donde el barro se subleva

Ya sé, no me digas tenes razón
La vida es una herida absurda
Y es todo, todo tan fugaz
Que es una curda, nada más

No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente

Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función
Corriéndole un telón
Al corazón

Un poco de recuerdo y sinsabor
Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrame el ventanal, que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris
Tras el alcohol

Emilio Delgado,"Oh, who are the people in your neighborhood? 
In your neighborhood? 
In your neighborhood? 
Say, who are the people in your neighborhood? 
The people that you meet each day 

(a blue muppet, I believe, walks onstage) 
[Bob: Oh, hi there, little fella.] 
[Anything Muppet #1: Hello.] 
[Bob: Hey, listen, know who you could be if I gave you this little hat and this bag to go over your shoulder?] 
[Anything Muppet #1: I could be a laundry man.] 
[Bob: No, not a laundry man.] 
[Anything Muppet #1: How about Santa Claus?] 
[Bob: No no no, not Santa Claus.] 
[Anything Muppet #1: What's wrong with Santa Claus?] 
[Bob: There's nothing wrong with Santa Claus, but...] 
[Anything Muppet #1: Don't you like Christmas?] 
[Bob: Oh, I love Christmas. But you could be the postman.] 
[Anything Muppet #1: A postman, hmmmm ...] 
Oh, the postman always brings the mail 
Through rain or snow or sleet or hail 
I'll work and work the whole day through 
To get your letters safe to you 

Bob and Anything Muppet #1: 
'Cause a postman is a person in your neighborhood 
In your neighborhood 
He's in your neighborhood 
A postman is a person in your neighborhood 
A person that you meet each day 

[Anything Muppet #1: I'll see you around.] 
[Bob: Okay.] 
(AM#1 leaves, bumped into AM#2 as he enters) 
[Anything Muppet #2: Hey, watch it. Where ya goin'? To a fire?] 
[Bob: Hey, speaking of a fire.] 
[Anything Muppet #2: Fire! What fire? Help! Help!] 
[Bob: No, there's no fire at all. But do you know who you could be if I gave you this little shiny red hat?] 
[Anything Muppet #2: Yeah, Santa Claus.] 
[Bob: No, not Santa Claus.] 
[Anything Muppet #2: Little Red Riding Hood?] 
[Bob: No, no, no, not Red Riding Hood, you could be a fireman.] 
[Anything Muppet #2: A fireman? Holy smoke!] 
Oh, a fireman is brave it's said 
His engine is a shiny red 
If there's a fire anywhere about 
Well, I'll be sure to put it out 

Bob and Anything Muppet #2: 
'Cause a fireman is a person in your neighborhood 
In your neighborhood 
He's in your neighborhood 

Anything Muppet #1: 
And a postman is a person in your neighborhood 

All: 
Well, they're the people that you meet 
When you're walking down the street 
They're the people that you meet each day 

(additional verses from the book ""People In My Neighborhood"" Volume 7 of ""On My Way With Sesame Street"") 
(pic of Cookie Monster dressed in a chef hat and apron behind the counter of a bakery, muching cookies, natch) 
The baker is the one who makes 
Your bread and rolls and pies and cakes 
If you want something sweet to eat, go see 
The baker in the bakery 

(pic of Guy Smiley-like teacher in front of class holding a globe) 
A teacher works the whole day through 
To teach important things to you 
He'll teach you things you won't forget 
Like numbers and the alphabet 

(pic of Herry monster in red-white striped pants just like a barber's pole cutting the hair of Guy Smiley-like muppet) 
A barber has a great big chair 
You sit in it, he cuts your hair 
He'll snip and clip and never rest 
Until your haircut looks its best 

(pic of Prairie Dawn-like muppet driving a bus) 
The bus driver drives fast or slow 
To take you where you want to go 
When you get in and pay your fare 
She will drive you anywhere 

(pic of Telly wearing a dentist's uniform) 
A dentist cares for all your teeth 
The top ones and the ones beneath 
So if you have an aching tooth 
He'll fix it quick, and that's the truth 

(pic of female muppet in a doctor's uniform) 
The doctor makes you well real quick 
If by chance you're feeling sick 
She works and works the whole day long 
To help you feel well and strong 

(pic of blue adult male muppet in grocer's outfit) 
The grocer sells the things you eat 
Like bread and eggs, cheese and meat 
No matter what you're looking for 
You'll find it at the grocery store 

(pic of Grover working on a shoe with a hammer) 
The shoemaker is always there 
To take care of the shoes you wear 
With his hammer, nails, and glue 
He'll fix your shoes as good as new 

(pic of the back of Rodeo Rosie handing over a fringed vest to the drycleaner, a green adult male muppet) 
The cleaner is the one who knows 
How to clean and press your clothes 
He'll take a jacket, suit, or vest 
And clean it so you'll look your best 

(pic of Oscar The Grouch, naturally, driving a garbage truck) 
The trash collector works each day 
He'll always take your trash away 
He drives the biggest truck you've seen 
To keep the city streets all clean",People in Your Neighborhood (La Gente en Tu Barrio),1998

What you've always been looking for
That's how I feel about you
Everything that you do

True moments of passion never die
When I hold you in my arms
And hear to tenderly sigh

Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake
Our love is one of a kind
Make no mistake, make no mistake

Make no mistake, make no mistake

I don't know
Exactly what I was looking for
But once I held you I knew
Nobody else could ever do

Decisions we make may not all be real
But one thing I know for sure
Is that I love you so

Entre tus brazos de sed amor
Que bonito es, encontrarte al fin
Después de tanto tiempo solo 
Como es que todo se ve mejor contigo
Como es que nada parece igual
No puede ser amor, lo que siento en mí
Es mucho más de lo que imaginaba 
En un momento el corazon perdí
Sin darme cuenta todo te lo dí
Y en el pecho siento nueva vida
Donde mi corazón dormía 
Tú, tú robaste mi corazón
Qué puedo hacer?
Me siento presa de ti
Y no me quiero escapar de tu vida 
Tú, tú llegaste a mi corazón
con tu querer, 
con tu alma y tu ser
No te quiero perder, nunca nunca 
En un momento has cambiado todo, amigo
Lo que esperaba al fin llegó
Lo que en nadie más pude encontrar
Sin esperar, caí en mis manos
Como es que todo se ve mejor contigo
Como es que nada parece igual
No puede ser amor, lo que siento en mi
Es mucho más de lo que imaginaba

Yo se que te equivocaste 
Linda dimelo porfavor 
Anda ven y dilo tonta 
No agas mas grande el dolor 
Tonta si tu sabes que te quiero 
Tonta,que sin ti me desespero 
Inmadura tonta dimelo 
Tonta,si tu sabes que me gustas 
Pero sufro y no me gusta 

Tal vez yo tuve la culpa 
Por decirte que te amo 
Te crecio el egoismo 
Y volaste de mi lado 
Tal vez quieras jugar 
Pero no lo agas tu conmigo 
Anda ven vamos hablar o sigamos 
Siendo amigos 
Tonta si tu sabes que te quiero 
Tonta,que sin ti me desespero 
Inmadura tonta dimelo 
Tonta,si tu sabes que me gustas 
Pero sufro y no me gusta

Que sin ti me desespero

Emilio Pericoli,"Sometimes the world is a valley of heartaches and tears
And in the hustle and bustle, no sunshine appears
But you and I have our love always there to remind us
There is a way we can leave all the shadows behind us
Volare, oh, oh! Cantare, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Let's fly way up to the clouds, away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like birds of a feather a rainbow together we'll find

Emilio Rojas,"Cry first and laugh last
Television was on, we never had Dash
And the city was flooded with mad crack
'Cause they experiment on minorities like we lab rats
Priorities, it's fuck authority
A man that can stand on his own and show maturity
I ain't ever ask for a loan, I've been supportin' me
Takin' cash from hoes like a sorority
Oh yeah they comin' for your life
I'm comin' for your life
It's bonded, I'm livin' out of spite
You ain't bleed then it wasn't worth the fight
I'm givin' y'all bread and water, ah bread and water all they get
And it ain't shakin' no hands, so fuck your politics
This isn't makin' a ?, I burn a lot of bridges down
Then I played in the ash like fuck your following
All we ever wanted was good pussy and credit scores
Their own cars is better than all our rentals are
I'm sick of y'all, dudes switchin' and gettin' hot
Like Bruce Jenner and menopause
Ain't never told us detox the senators
I say they sent us to detox the criminals
So the minute that we pop his genitals
Emilio ain't gon' ever fall, I told y'all

Everybody pressin' charges, they ain't change where I'm from
It's no game, even Ndamukong Suh
Connect try to keep me out the loop
It's canine proof, all my birds in the coop
Niggas wanna see me in the cage, but why?
My lawyer gets surprised with the money I save
I'm low like Fetty Wap's left eye
I coulda sworn I saw Left Eye at Best Buy
Nike slippers, read the paper on the milk crates
Sippin' Arizona, I got stripes like a Zebra Cake
Believe me, fast money like a relay
Shopped in SoHo when Prince Street had replays
?, I love my heritage
And fuck the race, if you real you my relative
Why so sensitive?
The revolution will be tele-vized
Excuse the grammar, I'm a ghetto kid
My grandma still alive and all 11 kids
Only my father made it, let's reminisce another time
Bought a watch with these bars to kill time
Sick in the head, now that's an ill mind
Shine like a d-d-diamond ? young
I said one day I'd have a Lambo, not a Hyundai
I kill for these stacks like Jimmy Caan
Wait let a G win like the Padres
Let a G win like Tony's last name
Who played first base for San Diego
Had to break it down
Fuck the cops, we gotta triumph
Fight for Freddie right now, it's about to be more riots
They wanna kill the youth when they need more guidance
With more violence you can only expect more defiance
It's hard to be vocal when they shoot you up and choke you
Die unexpected if the wrong one approach you
Sharpton ain't doin' enough, where's all the leaders?
Breakin' the same laws, we follow how they teach us
I never seen a thug win a million with Regis
Or a single mother from the ghetto either
Fuck y'all

It's a small island in the Caribbean that we be in
Goes by the name of Puerto Rico

Nigga the champ is here, Cassius Clay in his prime
The Mike Tyson, Bruce Lee, Stephen Hawking of rhymes
Combined with Einstein's mind and then refined like it's wine
I write divine rhymes, I fill my time by feelin' these dimes
Fill my satisfaction with valid rappin' and Magnum wrappin'
Fact I haven't felt emotions that's potent since daddy's passin'
I'm the Marilyn Manson of ? relax in baths of acid
I got True Religion jeans, if I kill you it's act of passion
I'm a dragon from ?
Aptitude is ample to pass all the rap masters
Who master it, cracking ribs
Put you in the earth, what it's worth you can act natural
The pragmatical mathematical rappin' cannibal
Who fight with animals, Bronx nigga that has an attitude
You see my avenue is compatible with a battle room
I never sold crack, just wrote dope lines to hand to you
Package that, I got the Cadillac of flows
Cataracts these hoes cause I'm soundin' like platinum gold
You never see a ghost, that's what me and my dad was told
So now I'm pickin' up the torch while these labels haggle my soul
Y'all can suck the undercuts of my nuts while I take a shit
Only spend nights, I don't gotta know what patience is
All you niggas bitches, to exist you gotta take my rent
Blow your fuckin' head off clean bro, save the witness

Latino, I'm that and I'm proud
If you don't know us, let me tell you about
Niggas that slam their dominoes loud, let you see copy
Beef copy ox cutter make his cheep choppy
Cherry coco, peña drip 'til your teeth sloppy
Hustlers become connects when they need papis
Lease a Honda, Chevy on the back block
Runnin' routes with the bow bow in the stash box
When I speak it's chop yaow, I'm a New Yorican
Calderon on the phone, I'm in ? creepin'
Y'all hangin' on resorts to just chill
I'm in the caserios take a walk down the hill
One way in, one way out, where y'all all could get killed
Leave them niggas alone, that's how the officers feel
Nigga, my people, beach, 98 gettin' our tan on
Slippers walkin' on ?, hittin' the sand strong
But plan wrong, it will transform
Wet you then find a Jet Blue out to San Juan
We don't look for parties, the party's wherever we go
Turn the corner section to the 4th of Julio
Too much to fit in one 16
So let me cook like the festival on 1/16
Mean, my career's been like one sick dream
A nightmare, scary how I does this thing
You ain't elite, I'm made of deep
God thought he was stuntin' when he created me
Rap's Bobby Fischer, nigga please take a seat
I made you in three moves: ink, paper, beat
Y'all keep playin', nigga, we play for keeps
Stop claimin' to be what my eyes don't see though
Every verse I spit, you get an 'ay dios mio'
This time with my amigos, Latinos","Latino, Pt. 2",2015
Emilio Santiago,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand

I get misty just holding your hand
Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello

That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near
You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do

Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost

E também podem me intrigar e até sorrir e até chorar
E podem mesmo imaginar o que melhor lhes parecer

The sky wore a veil of gold and gray
At night it was the bright of the moon with me
Time was just floating

Then there was rain
This town's foundations are crumbling
To the ground comes a bit of a tumbling
And time just floated away
We can watch it and stay and we can listen

Oh, rainy day, come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

Then there was rain
And I spent the night with the Queen of Spain
My lonely little heart would've broke again
Times were vicious

Singing, deeper that the knife goes in the more you win
You win but with less than when you begin
Deeper that the knife goes in
Oooooooooooooooh

Ooh, rainy day come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
We're separated now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

For the childhood

Of conquest and kings on the throne

Look within your heart then ask,
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
Cause I love such elementary things,
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me.
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my childhood",Childhood [Theme From Free Willy 2],2008
Emily Bernstein,"He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fires deep in his eyes

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Don't let no one get you down
Keep movin' on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And create one family oh...

Emily Blunt,"Anything can happen in the woods
May I kiss you?
Any moment we could be crushed

Uh-

Don't feel rushed

This is ridiculous
What am I doing here?
I'm in the wrong story

Wait, wait wait, we can't do this!
You have a princess
Well, yes, I do
And I have a... a baker
Of course, you're right, how foolish

Foolishness can happen in the woods
Once again, please
-Um!
Let your hesitations be hushed
Any moment, big or small
Is a moment, after all
Seize the moment, skies may fall
Any moment

Ooh, this is not right!

Right and wrong don't matter in the woods
Only feelings
Let us meet the moment unblushed
Life is often so unpleasant
You must know that, as a peasant
Best to take the moment present
As a present for the moment",Any Moment,2014
Emily Blunt,"Sometimes people leave you
Halfway through the wood
Do not let it grieve you
No one leaves for good
You are not alone
No one is alone

Hold him to the light now
Let him see the glow
Things will be all right now
Tell him what you know

Once upon a time
(In a far-off kingdom there lay a small village at the edge of the woods)
Careful the things you say
Children will listen
Careful the things you do
Children will see
And learn

Guide them along the way
Children will glisten
Children will look to you
For which way to turn
To learn what to be
Careful before you say
""Listen to me""
Children will listen

Careful the wish you make
Wishes are children
Careful the path they take
Wishes come true
Not free

Careful the spell you cast
Not just on children
Sometimes the spell may last
Past what you can see
And turn against you

Careful the tale you tell
That is the spell
Children will listen","Finale/Children Will Listen, Pt. 1",2014
Emily Blunt,"You've changed
You're daring
You're different in the woods
More sure
More sharing
You're getting us through the woods
If you could see
You're not the man who started
And much more openhearted
Than I knew
You to be

It takes two
I thought one was enough
It's not true
It takes two of us
You came through
When the journey was rough
It took you
It took two of us
It takes care
It takes patience and fear and despair
To change
Though you swear
To change
Who can tell if you do
It takes two
It takes two

You've changed
You're thriving
There's something about the woods
Not just
Surviving
You're blossoming in the woods
At home I'd fear
We'd stay the same forever
And then out here
You're passionate
Charming
Considerate
Clever

It takes one
To begin, but then once you've begun
It takes two of you
It's no fun
But what needs to be done
You can do
When there's two of you
If I dare
It's because I'm becoming
Aware of us
As a pair of us
Each accepting a share
Of what's there

We've changed
We're strangers
I'm meeting you in the woods
Who minds
What dangers
I know we'll get past the woods
And once we're past
Let's hope the changes last
Beyond woods
Beyond witches and slippers and hoods
Just the two of us
Beyond lies
Safe at home with our beautiful prize
Just the few of us
It takes trust
It takes just
A bit more
And we're done
We want four
We had none
We've got three
We need one
It takes two",It Takes Two,2014
Emily Blunt,"What was that?

Was that me?
Was that him?
Did a prince really kiss me?
And kiss me?
And kiss me?
And did I kiss him back?

Was it wrong?
Am I mad?
Is that all?
Does he miss me?
Was he suddenly
Getting bored with me?

Wake up!
Stop dreaming
Stop prancing about the woods
It's not beseeming
What is it about the woods?

Back to life, back to sense
Back to child, back to husband
No one lives in the woods
There are vows, there are ties
There are needs, there are standards
There are shouldn'ts and shoulds

Why not both instead?
There's the answer, if you're clever
Have a child for warmth
And a baker for bread
And a prince for whatever
Never!
It's these woods

Face the facts, find the boy
Join the group, stop the giant
Just get out of these woods
Was that him?
Yes, it was
Was that me?
No, it wasn't
Just a trick of the woods

Just a moment
One peculiar passing moment
Must it all be either less or more?
Either plain or grand?
Is it always ""or?""
Is it never ""and?""
That's what woods are for
For those moments in the woods

Oh, if life were made of moments
Even now and then a bad one!
But if life were only moments
Then you'd never know you had one

First a witch, then a child
Then a prince, then a moment
Who can live in the woods?
And to get what you wish
Only just for a moment
These are dangerous woods

Let the moment go
Don't forget it for a moment, though
Just remembering you've had an ""and""
When you're back to ""or""
Makes the ""or"" mean more
Than it did before
Now I understand

And it's time to leave the woods",Moments in the Woods,2014

With simple naïve trust
Shielded from the many ways
That life's not fair or just

But then there comes a moment
A simple truth that you must face
If you depend on others
You'll never find your place

And as you take that first step
Upon a path that's all your own
You see it all so clearly
The best way to survive is all alone

Too sick to even care
I'll take a little walk

Took the fence and a lane
The bus then the train
Bought an Independent to make me look like

I'm a prodigy

Emily Browning,"I fried my head, I'm not a brunette
I'm a down and dusky blonde
I am living in a tree
When I lie in bed I see
Beyond my lover's head the moon, I hear the rain

I am conscious of my voice as a tool
It's more demure
Than your friend the singing queen
With her matinee good looks
She talks like talking from a book
I speak the language of my village, of my street

But I need a friend and I choose you
I tell you the way I feel
The truth is crushing like a heel
I will forget the kiss and feel if you will too

Tell me tales of punk rockin' girls
It's a dim and distant page
But I mostly blame my age
Please make allowances for me
I do not see

It's a drag that you're getting old
I love to think about the year
When we sobbed and then we cheered
The town deserted like a film
The sun was baking dust for fun
Trees were withering by the day
Your torso crushing me
Into the country and the tunnels and the fields

But I need a friend and I choose you
I tell you the way I feel
The truth is crushing like a heel
I will forget the kiss and feel if you will do

But I did not eat
And so the doctor came to me
He said a woman does not live
By the printed word
Forgive yourself and eat

Autumn sped along outside
Trick photography on speed
I was locked inside a room
They made a deal, they would control
The simple things like bodies
But I kept my soul

Because the fledgling soul awakes
And on the balcony she quakes
And she is waiting for the sign
And when the brother does not come
And when the sister's much to you, she chooses you",Down and Dusky Blonde,2014

The dawn will touch me in a way a boy could never touch

You have been warned, I'm warned to be contrary

I'll leave the chocolate hidden in the fridge
I'll play his messages
Analyze his intonation
Please stop me there, I'm even boring myself

I think of him when I'm doing the dishes
I think of him while looking in the sink
This ain't no play on words

I'd build it up and then I'd turn him down

And I know he's looking there for me.

I'll find my valentine,
Then I'll climb to the highest steeple
And tell the world he's mine.

Right here in this moment, I wish I could reach you

Too many like us, run out of the steeple
Guess you could say I lost some faith in people

Want every thought to be golden or fire
I could be made out of truth, not some liar
Want to be tempered, sick to be tested
To see it all clearly, whenever it's rested
Want every lesson, the lessons they teach me
Someone who knows where I am, whenever they reach me

Give me a season, show me some reason
Love me whenever it's out of season

Only know how to hound

She walked right into my mirror.
Said she's here to waste time, I said, â??That's fine.â??

Every thread, every hair rearranged to resemble you.
You could help her!

There are so many skirts under the table.
None of these long legs are mine.

Wish I were capable of lying sometimes.
Hide out and run when no one's looking.
Hide out.

Hell is asking to be loved.

Lay out a blanket, bring something to feed the birds

If I could go back, if I could reach that feeling again

I would not have let shit-talkers stop me
Failures whispers sad how hard she tries
Advance retreat, accept defeat so softly
Shrink inside to see through your camera's eyes

The greatness she has dreamed her acts have missed
Her labour, her passion, her pain
A rapture and pang, her glory and her curse;
And yet she cannot choose but labours on;
Her mighty heart forbids her to desist
(Her failure lives, her failure lives!)

For as long as the world lasts her failure lives
Astonishing and foiling Reason's gaze
A folly and a beauty unspeakable
A superb madness of the will to live
A superb madness of the will to live
(A superb madness of the will to live)

This is her being's law, its sole resource;
Though satisfaction never comes
(Never comes, never comes, never comes)
Her hungry will to lavish everywhere
Her many-imaged fictions of the Self
And thousand fashions of one Reality
(One reality, one reality, one reality, one reality)

Escape from the moment's prison of littleness
(She shuts eternity into an hour)
Almost
(almost)
She nears what never can be attained;
(So softly)
She shuts eternity into an hour

She serves no aim
But labours driven by a nameless Will
Her secret and impossible task
She serves no aim
But labours driven by a nameless Will
(So softly)

She follows her sublime irrational plan
Invents devices of her magic art
But even now she knows not what she has done
For all is wrought beneath a baffling mask
A semblance other than its hidden truth

The unfinished creation of a changing soul
In a body changing with the inhabitant
(So softly)
The unfinished creation of a changing soul
(The unfinished creation of a changing soul)
In a body changing with the inhabitant
(In a body changing with the inhabitant)
Insignificant her means, infinite her work
(Work, work , work, work, work)

On a great field of shapeless consciousness
A strange enthusiasm has moved her heart;
She hungers for heights, passions for the supreme
Hunts for the perfect word, the perfect shape
Leaps to the summit light
(Summit light, summit light, summit light)
And woos his large-eyed wandering thoughts to dwell
In figures of her million-impulsed Force
Woos his large-eyed wandering thoughts to dwell
In figures of her million-impulsed Force

I can find a piece of you
In each twist of time
In each twist of mind
That I find to think of you
I'm alive
It's so strange to be alive

When I go to sleep at night
And I'm scared and there's no light
And I know one day
I'll be in my grave
When I think that I'll lose you
I'm alive
It's so strange to be alive

Could we stay around
Like a big blue sea
That has been around
For some billions centuries?
'Cause I think I could do
With a trip with you
On The Big Blue Sea
For some billions centuries

It might take me two thousand years
Not to sing this song in tears
'Cause I feel so small
In this big black hole
And you're the one that makes me feel
I'm alive
It's so strange to be alive

Could we stay around
Like a big blue sea
That has been around
For some billions centuries?
'Cause I think I could do
With a trip with you
On The Big Blue Sea
For some billions centuries

But her daddy now is dead
And she wishes that she'd said
All these loving words
'Cause they only hurt
Now she knows that it's too late
And she's alive
It's so strange to be alive

Could we stay around
Like a big blue sea
That has been around

Emily Loizeau,"C'est le premier anniversaire de notre rencontre
Je t'ai fait un cadeau, non, c'est pas une montre
Tu te rappelles le village dans les Alpes, cet été?
Cette église incroyable, la vue sur la vallée?

Ca fait un an aujourd'hui que nous nous connaissons
Je t'ai fait un cadeau, non, c'est pas des bonbons
Ca se dévore, ça se visite, j'ai pensé aux enfants
Quand même pas un chalet?
Tu devines pas mon ange?

Une concession, une jolie concession
Dans le petit cimetière de Jasseron

C'est pas la plage de Sète
C'est pas non plus la Crète
C'est pas le Parthénon
Un genre de Panthéon
C'est pas Ure ni Ephèse
Je serai une belle Mère Lachaise
C'est pas le Taj Mahal
Putain, c'est pas banal

Une concession, une jolie concession
Dans le petit cimetière de Jasseron

Tu refuses l'amour éternel à nos petits corps
Mon amour, l'amour éternel, c'est avant la mort

Qu'une dalle en béton
On peut prendre un beau marbre
Faire un jardin d'hiver
pourquoi pas un salon

Deuxièmement ta colère tu devras maîtriser 
Et surtout ne jamais oublier quoi qu'il arrive,
Ne jamais se laisser tomber amoureux,

À l'horloge de ton cœur la grande aiguille des heures transpercera ta peau,
Explosera l'horloge, imploseront tes os,
La mécanique du cœur 
Sera brisée de nouveau.

Emily Loizeau,"It's a magical affair
We are carried in the air
In our dreams

And they take us by the hand
To the place where they stand
In our dreams

And they call us by our names
And they say we haven't changed
In our dreams

And we know that they don't lie
If they did they wouldn't cry
In our dreams

And we keep them in our heart
Only sleep keeps us apart
And the wind fills our sail
And the wind fills our sail

Sometimes they remain in silence
Sometimes they provoke the violence
Of our dreams

We are weak and they are strong
They can carry us along
In our dreams

And in everything they say
There's a rule that we obey
In our dreams

We cherish each an every word
And then we lose them and it hurts
But we know that they live
In our dreams

And we keep them in our heart
Only sleep keeps us apart
And the wind fills our sail
And the wind fills our sail

We are the sailors of the dark
We are the sailors of the dark

It's a magical affair
When they whisper in the air
In our dreams

And the stories that they tell
We don't know but we know well
In our dreams

And they call us by our names
And they say that we have changed
In our dreams

And we need to stay together
'Cause their words we have to gather
In our dreams

And we keep them in our heart
Only sleep keeps us apart
And the wind fills our sail

Emily Loizeau,"Te souviens-tu du pays des oiseaux?
Tu sais, celui où il fait toujours beau
On dit qu'il n'existe plus
On dit qu'il a disparu

Et dans mes songes, j'ai gravi des montagnes
A l'horizon, les rivières s'éloignent
Ils ont tué les oiseaux
Plus rien ne bouge, il fait chaud

Les orages ont balayé la plage
Il ne reste plus qu'un pays sauvage, sauvage

Les yeux perdus au fond des marécages
J'ai retrouvé le reflet d'un visage
Il avait quelque chose de toi
Mais il est mort, il est froid

Du bout des doigts je caresse la vase
Dieu qu'il était émouvant ce mirage
J'ai entendu le cri du vent
Et j'ai pleuré doucement

Les orages ont balayé la plage
Il ne reste plus qu'un pays sauvage, sauvage

Tout s'écroule, je suis la pierre qui roule
Et le château de sable qui périt sous la vague
Tout se casse, dis-moi ce qu'il se passe
Je le trouvais si beau notre pays là-haut

Te souviens-tu du pays des oiseaux?
Tu sais, celui où il fait toujours beau
On dit qu'il n'existe plus
On dit qu'il a disparu

Emily Loizeau,"The toad is standing on the water lily
La princesse ne veut pas l'embrasser

The princess thinks that he is so bizarre

Je trouve que ta peau n'a pas l'air très lisse
Pretty please I only need a kiss
Ta langue est si longue qu'elle attrape les mouches
Oh, je t'en prie, ne sois pas si farouche!

Il veut juste un petit bout
Un tout petit bout d'amour c'est tout

If you kiss me I will marry you

Kiss me please et puis je m'en vais
I'll close my eyes and I will kiss you once

And that I was a maiden Queen

Then the morn blushed rosy red. 
I dried my tears, and armed my fears 
With ten thousand shields and spears. 

Soon my Angel came again; 
I was armed, he came in vain
For the time of youth was fled, 
And gray hairs were on my head.

On your way.

So preciously
To remind me in the winter of the special week
We spent together in the spring.

But you have the sun in the south
And not the rain

And the big room where you go upstairs to be quiet.
I hope to come on the train next year.

Been gettin' ready for hours
Walk through the door gonna give you a kiss
But you turn your head to avoid my lips
And who's this girl that your with
Does this mean we're over over

I gave you my heart in a sweet love letter
But you gave it right back said I like her better

And shes walking around like the girl of your dreams
With her Angelina lips double zero jeans

Inside it feels like I'm broken
I say its okay happy valentines day

They're walking out the door and I wave goodbye
As soon as their gone I start to cry
Put my faith in the wrong guy its over over

And I feel fatal

He's a love abuser

You found someone

Tell me why I think about you
And tell me if you think about me
And tell me when you touch her
Is it really love or just another fantasy
And tell me does she make you laugh
And tell me does she make you move
And tell me does she get you take away your breath
Just tell me that it cant be true
What I found out about you

It feels like a nightmare
To see your hands in her hair
You seem happy ever after
I'm stuck in denial
I cant fake a smile
You play innocent
It so damn hurts
Slow down I want back whats mine
Can we rewind

Tell me why I think about you
And tell me if you think about me
And tell me when you touch her
Is it really love or just another fantasy
And tell me does she make you laugh
And tell me does she make you move
And tell me does she get you take away your breath
Just tell me that it cant be true
What I found out about you

So much for happy endings
So much for miracles
So much for trusting you it feels so typical
I miss you

We were picture perfect
Flawless on the surface
We were walking on a straight line

Tell me why I think about you
And tell me if you think about me
And tell me when you touch her
Is it really love or just another fantasy
And tell me does she make you laugh
And tell me does she make you scream
Tell me its over its only a dream
What I found out about you
Tell me its over its only a dream
And tell me does she get you take away your breath
Just tell me that it cant be true
What I found out about you
Tell me its over its only a dream
And tell me does she get you take away your breath
Just tell me that it cant be true

Emily Osment,"The city is sleeping, but I'm still awake
I'm dreaming, I'm thinking what happened today is it right?
I fold into the night
The flashbacks the pictures the letters and songs
The memories the heart that you carved on the wall
Its a shame, now that nothings the same

Now the bridges are burned and we're lost in the wind
Its time that we sink or swim

What about you
What about me
What about fairy tale endings
Were you just pretending to be
And I'm wondering
What if we tried
What if I cried
What if its better tomorrow
What if I followed your eyes
I'm wondering
What about me?

You said it, you meant it, you hung up the phone
The talking in circles it set it stone
You were gone, we were wrong all along
Now the past is the past and the bruises may fade
These scars are here to stay

What about you
What about me
What about fairy tale endings
Were you just pretending to be
I'm wondering
What if we tried
What if I cried
What if its better tomorrow
What if I followed your eyes
I'm wondering
What about me?

Stay away
You'll fade away
I'm not afraid anymore

What about you
What about me
What about fairy tale endings
Were you just pretending to be
I'm wondering
What if we tried
What if I cried
What if its better tomorrow
What if I followed your eyes

Are we moving too fast going too slow
Am I just afraid to make mistakes
I wanna keep it real now, dont make a sound
I wanna see it in your eyes
Are we gonna shake it up, or knock it down
But deep inside I know that we'll survive

Where it heads, now watch your heart beat beating

So don't stop when you get that feeling now, now
Tock tock, it's your heart beat beating

It's too danger, I'm playing unprepared
I try to hide it before I make a mistake

But when the truth is out, is out

Emily Pinkerton,"Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando

Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a Los 17,2012
Emily Rath,"Hey beautiful, remember your name?
Hey beautiful, that's what I used to say
We met out in the street under a street lamp
And you asked me if you could buy me a drink

We ended up in bed all week long
With photographs, lipstick and favorite songs
It was too late to look you in the eyes
And tell you I wasn't full of lies

I'll see you around, I'll see you downtown
I'll see you when the light comes across your face 
in the memories I can't erase, I'll see you around

Hey beautiful, are you happy now?
Did you find your prince and does he treat you like a lady?
I admit that I'm a bad boy to bring home
But it takes two to bring a house to the ground

I'll see you around, I'll see you downtown
I'll see you when the light comes across your face 
in the memories I can't erase
I'll see you around, I'll see you downtown
I'll see you when the light comes across your face 
in the memories I can't erase, I'll see you around

We were on and off, inside and out
Lost my voice when I screamed and shout
Back and forth, drunk and dry
Slamming doors and teary-eyed

Hey beautiful, do you remember your name?
Hey beautiful, do you still look the same? 
Do you think that love is a stupid game to play?
And when love is lost can you win anyway?

I'll see you around, I'll see you downtown
I'll see you when the light comes across your face 
in the memories I can't erase
I'll see you around, I'll see you downtown
I'll see you when the light comes across your face 
in the memories I can't erase

Emily Remler,"I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do? I thought about you

Makes the bee think of honey

Have you ever felt the gentle touch
And then a kiss, and then, and then
Find it's only your imagination again
Oh, well

Imagination is silly
You go around willy-nilly
For example, I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too

A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce

She ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley

Screaming she moans, ""I've just been made""
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
Says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in""

Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison""

Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
Saying, ""Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?""

Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""

Saving, ""The sun's not yellow it's chicken"" Chorus

Put jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves

With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

Where Ma Raney and Beethoven once unwrapped their bed roll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college

That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

You’re so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey, (Hey hey)
Hey Mickey (Hey, hey)

Oh, Mickey, you’re so fine (You’re so fine and you’re mine)
I’ll be yours till the end of time
'Cause you make me feel
Yeah, you make me feel
So shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time (Touched for the first time)

Like the one in me
That’s O.K.
Let’s see how you do it
Put up your dukes
Let’s get down to it

Hit me with your best shot
Why don’t you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away

Na na na come on
Na na na na na, come on, come on, come on

'Cause I may be bad but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it

Sex baby,
Let’s talk about you and me
Let’s talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be
Let’s talk about sex (Alright)
Let’s talk about sex (A little bit, a little bit)
Let’s talk about sex, baby

Baby, all through the night, I’ll make love to you,
Like you want me too

(And I) And I guess it’s just the woman in you,
That brings out the man in me
I know I can’t help myself
You’re all in the world to me

It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time
It feels like the first time

It’s going down fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me collab creations bump, like acne
No doubt, I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch, a dog couldn’t catch me, straight up
Tell me who could stop when Dre making moves, attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers (Shorty get down)

Good Lord
Baby got them open up all over town
Strictly biz she don’t play around
Cover much ground got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way

Emily Saxe,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,

Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

And by her bed she puts the phone
And every morning after that
She takes the phone and puts it back

He's got a wife back home and three kids up and grown
But these are things that go unsaid
He might call her from the road just in time to say hello
And goodbye again

She keeps his picture tucked away
She thinks she'll have it framed one day
And maybe he'll come see it there
Hanging by her rocking chair

In a corner of her room on a Sunday afternoon
When all the world is dull and gray
She might close her eyes and sit, rocking gently for a bit
Till all the bad thoughts go away

Back when children played their games
London Bridge and Jesse James
She captured flags, she bounced the ball
And every time, she beat them all

And now she comes home to a cat in a three-room walk-up flat
And plays a game of solitaire
Well she made a fist last night, and she broke the hallway light
And the pieces scattered everywhere

Beg and cheat until they trust me
Drag them down to be damned with me
Laugh at them as they forgive me

The rake at the gates of hell tonight

I wish that they could walk forever
On the earth alone unfettered
Until they pray for consummation
Until they beg for sweat damnation
Then I'll come and bring them water
Bring them hope, bring them laughter
Raise their hopes both sad and sunken
Slash them up as they lie there drunken
Push them down into the foul mud
Until they choke up on their own blood
Drag them out before their last breath

Emily Zuzik,"Here I am alone, this empty room
No sun is living here
I hear the muffled conversation
Of the neighbor, through the wall

A strand of light hangs on the window
But I can't help myself
I'm in love with this isolation

The city shimmers, our life the low hum
And all that glitters may be gone
And the sun walks in the sky light
In the spaces, when it starts

Raining in and slowly the low hum
A low hum

Like a tourist in some strange hotel
No time for worrying, 
My little safety, so I will live

Here I am, alone, this empty room
No sun is living here
I'll be making conversation
In the spaces ?

And I can't help myself

It's no secret, 
Everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, 
Bitch so what, 
That's about as far as your body goes
We'll be friends, 
I'll call you again, 
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kind of car I'll be in, 
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that, 
Neither do i, 
I don't want to flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride,

There goes another lawsuit, 
Leave handprints all across you,

You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have, 
Ooh girl that's too damn bad, 
Don't touch what you can't grab,

Eminem,"I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, mu'fucka'
Cause all the bullshit, it made me strong, mu'fucka'

Pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah
Bitch, I'm a pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone

Uh, I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

So I could pick the world up
And drop it on yo fuckin' head, haha
Bitch, I'm a pick the world up
And I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah
And I could die now, rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone (I'm gone)

It hurts, but I never show,
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream ""Fuck 'em all""

Man, it feels like these walls are closing in
This roof is caving in, up its time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes, got 'em crooked, boy
This crooked mind of mine got 'em all
Shook and scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time and I
Came up from behind
And pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim but the game
Ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'm a make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'm a fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody!
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah! prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up
This stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, incredible
Hope you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dawg
I'll split your cabbage and lettuce  and olives
I'll fuckin'

Pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'm a pick the world up and I'm a drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, Rebirth motherfucker

If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him

Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out

For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub

With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal

It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I never say, oh, it’s impossible
'Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal

Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in the verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Show ‘em what I done thought that was the worse, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through is your purse
Yeah, I don't try like Captain, I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
'Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone till' I find myself
Inside the realm where the unknown and boldly go
In the waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am

When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
When you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put a spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you raise
Never take back what you say
If you stay trapped in your brain, engage in this fueled cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists to his bones
Show Biggie who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Yeah I picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it off like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

And find yourself your glory, free the ignoring person

Got a fuckin’ mouth with no shut-up valve
Can't even cut the power to it, when it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
'Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject I don't know how to shut up about
'Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfucking tongue to tie, I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield, I'ma knife this will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face it, each challenge waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is delegation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
An accusation, I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
Your legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Managed to prove who the best man is
Surveil it, all cards be the only ones left standing
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw
'Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
'Cause I am

My music is soothin but it's also been proven
That it can put you in the mood to jump outta ya car while it's movin
You've been waitin on this moment, my sermon
Is like a omen, I'm servin, I'm Erick Sermon
I saw the window was open and I jumped through it
My shit if you don't get pumped to it
I quit, here's my rhyme book go head and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it, rummage ya find somethin
You can use to jump someone and roll up bumpin
I'm constantly coppin over you, squatin, shit is gotten
To the point, where I'm ain't even writin no more I'm just jottin
This is chicken scratch
Shit is sickin, I've been kickin ass off bullshit, throw away rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap
You crazy? I've made beats for Jay-Z for free
Page me, you need a beat
You Canibus? then it's Dre's beat
You Kay Slay? the fee's waived
I stay beefin with JD to the day Dre two-ways me
That it's ok to stop blazin him
Oops I put it out I apologize now is too late G

You are now about to witness the strength
Of Aftermath straight out the mothafuckin streets of Compton
Put your hands together for Game bitch
Hahahaha
Yeah mothafuckas
Compton's back on the mothafuckin map
Aftermath in that ass bitch
Game let's go

Me and Marshall ain't start shit they listen to our shit
They talk shit about us but that shit is foul when
I'm tryna feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But its hard when they hate us and think 'Em a racist
They say shit but fuck them
Shady one of the greatest like Biggie n' Pac was
We saw the throne was empty and decided to chase it
Me, him and 50 racin' this rap shit is basic I followed that Jay shit
Thinkin what I wanna say, step in the booth in one take and
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits
Then spit that classical LA, NWA shit
The media is bullshit now we can't even say bitch
They accusin Michael of touchin kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him, had a couple of face lifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin' I can taste this swear to God I ain't racin'
Put the clip in and wast 'em before I go out on that fake shit
I'm so sick and tired this black shit this white shit
So I sit here and write shit, Em they ain't gon' like this

So they callin us
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
This day the game won't ever be the same
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same its changing
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power

Only Dre can, judge me for the mistakes I'm making
If I'm faking, I'm Clay Aiken
You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame, you're tame
Bitch you're mild sauce, you ain't ready to make that flame switch
You'll end up in the same situation, same shit
Different day, just with different gangstas in your face
Which- way do you wanna face when your brains hit pavement
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits waving in my face
Looking for answers, rap sensation Eminem battles to ward off accusations
That he had somebody blasted
The Mask of Jason was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wasting too much time
Me no kiss ass, and if that's the case, then we ain't going

So they callin us
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
This day the game won't ever be the same
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same its changing
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power

Low get Dre on the phone quick
Tell him Em' just killed me on my own shit
I'm walking through 8 mile, startin' to get home sick
I'mma do Shady numbers, I'm ridin' my own dick
Yeah the chrome sick, the window's tinted
If Eminem is anybody armor under the Pendleton
These niggas is killing it take a minute to listen
Turn down my Jimi Hendrix, I'll throw your demo out the window
For tellin me its hot when its not and you got what you got
From them rocks on the block, you can stop tellin Dre you got shot
With a Glock that don't phase me
I'm crazy why the fuck you think I'm rhyming with Shady ?
I don't care if the radio don't play me
I say what I say when I feel like I'm feelin today
And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets
I can't even take my son to cop them G-Unit sneaks

So I'm gone bitch

So they callin us
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
This day the game won't ever be the same
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
The game just isn't the same its changing

You're now about to witness the power",We Ain't,
Eminem,"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, you feel weak
And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up

But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse.

Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me (Underneath me, I)

I will not fall
I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me",'Till I Collapse [Instrumental],

And I'ma always be here for you no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we going to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's taking a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell? Da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinking - it's kind of late to go swimming
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you acting bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eating
Dinner while you were sweeping and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us, and when we ride! Just you and I!

See honey: there's a place called ""heaven"" and a place called ""hell""
A place called ""prison"" and a place called ""jail""
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nahhh)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say mama was real, real bad
She was being mean to dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit trying to climb out!
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Da-da change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde: me and my daughter

Just the two of us, and when we ride! Just you and I!

Wake up, sweepyhead we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screaming in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee! (woosh!)
There goes mama, splashing in the water
No more fighting with dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you wuv her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Eminem,"What would it take to push a man,
Far enough to put somethin material over a human life?
What would drive someone completely over the edge
To do some shit like that? the green and gold.

I done filled my lungs up
With so much of this crack smoke
My necks bloated, my techs loaded,
I'm flat broke, and I'm pissed off,
Mad at the world I've had it with girls
And I'm frustrated, ran to the bus stop,
Just made it and hopped on 
Ready to drop bombs on the first person who had a nice suit and a watch on
I spot JOHN a white collar worker
In clean cut, walked up to em
He was like what? whatchu mean what? you know what time it is man
At your next stop gimme that Rolex watch with that diamond wrist band.
Got his green and his gold dashed it climbed in his van to steal it and seen
A man holdin' a nine and then
Shot him from the bottom up
Stole his keys, put em inside the ignition and got em stuck, 
Hopped out to flee on my feet, 
Fucked around, forgot that I left my ID on the seat",Green and Gold,1998

Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in junior high, this kid said
""Just you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die""
I looked at my watch it was one twenty
""I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?""
He said, ""Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse""
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Something told me, ""Try to fake a stomach ache, it works""
I screamed, ""Ow! My appendix feel like they could burst!

Way before my baby daughter Hailey
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him, ""We shouldn't beef""
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, ""You gonna die honky!""
The principal walked in and started helping him stomp me
I made them think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools
""This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back bully! Now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home later that same day
Started reading the comics, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was trying to read
I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', ""What are you on, drugs??
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug!"" (Stop!)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, ""Look bitch, what have you done?""
""Oh my God, I'm sorry son"" ""Shut up you cunt!""
I said, ""Fuck it!"" took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall
Full of plaques, hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'mma let my dough freeze, ho please
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies
Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said motherfuck the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see
Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep

With a Walkman on
When I caught a guy
Give me an awkward eye
And I strangled him up in the parking lot
With his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hopping out with two broken legs
Trying to walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'mma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs

With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out

What you think I sold 'em all, cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath

Back when Cube, was rolling with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was banging with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business; but sometimes
The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'mma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit'chu
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just being real wit'chu
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then I got these fake-ass niggas I first drew with
Claiming that they non-violent, talkin like they
Spit venom in interviews, speaking on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speaking your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em

I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions

So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you

Never come down! Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates

(The fuck!) I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg
I got your motherfucking back (right?) just know this shit

Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch
I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed whose throat is it?
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is

Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people (Hi!) Then drop her off on the corner
At the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
And they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for trying to talk like ""The Chronic"" was lost product
That's for even thinking of having them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, ""I Just Don't Give a Fuck,"" and see who means it!

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting

Breakin' so many friggin' needles I wonder if they inject

Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold

Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old. (Give me a kiss!)
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play (Shit!)
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?  (Uh huh!)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there

Man fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail
Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
(What the fuck!)
(Grady!)

Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off?
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitches head off!
Wait!  What if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What? She tripped? Fell?  Landed on his dick?)
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay!  Thought about it, still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say? (What's wrong?)
(Didn't think I'd remember?)
I'ma kill you motherfucker!
Uh-ah!  Temper temper!

Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that, aw fuck it

Yo, Slim Shady (Yo, Royce 5'9"")
Y'all wanna make a movie? (What, what?)
We got the film right here

Yeah, I'm one of them pretty rappers
Buck if I really have to, I really slap you
King of Detroit, who they naming the city after
Scandalous partners whose grammar hammers the hard shit
Into your heart with content, yo, who wanna start with?
Expert, Bad & Evil is coming soon
MC's get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb
This shit is written, in my eyes I'm the illest MC spittin'
Leaving all of you cats shitting kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggas be cocking pistols
Shot and split you, fuck splitting the profits with you
Six percent of y'all niggas is just pretend
Cliques with clits, pussy niggas stink with dicks
Niggas act bully and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggas packing semi
Speak darts; yo, you get paid?
Rhyming about it is the sweet part
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
5'9"", a street nigga with deep feeling
I keep illing, my steez willing to keep killing
Fuck rap! A lot of y'all all is just acts
Trust that, you rhyme all wack on rough tracks
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
And I'ma spit thunder, stick to my guns
Niggas is finished before they gimmicks; one-hit wonders
What? Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls
I'm a pitbull, I'm just dog, I'm just raw
Split y'all, holler, ""It's on!"", then I diss y'all
All of y'all niggas get pissed on claiming you pissed off

Y'all want drama? Wanna make a scary movie?
Rappers coming in with their team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hittin', directing and starring in it

The one man on the planet
That'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin'
Any man plannin' to battle will get snatched outta his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standin'
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this – and you better inhale!
‘Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
Came home in a frenzy
Pushing a ten speed, screaming to Aunt Peg
With three spokes sticking outta my pant leg
Fuck a headache! Give me a migraine, damn it, I like pain
You should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowing you wack
You act up and I'm throwing you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwing you back up them
If they don't like the track, fuck 'em! The rap struck 'em
Harder than getting hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'ma climb the Empire State Building
And get to the last step and still have half left

That my mother did it but the bitch won't admit it was her 
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months 
And said, ""I'm ready now bitch - ain't you feelin these kicks cunt?"" 
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell 
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell 
I'm sick of these sperm cells with syphillis germs 
And I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns 
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach 
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it

Than a maniac Saudi Arabian 
A highly combustible head, spazmatic 
Strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed 
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition 
I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician 
High speed, IV full of thai weed 
Lookin Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese 
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians 
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins 
I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends 
On if I keep on killin my girlfriends

And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed 
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say 
I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play 
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day 
Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH) 
Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin 
Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine

""It's probably AIDS!"" Forget it then

That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim Fast (Who me?)
Yeah bitch you so big
You walked into Big Panties and stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin' (rar!)
It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
Grabbed that bitch by her hair
Drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop

I don't know why this world keep turning (as the world turns)
Round and round
(These are the days of our lives)
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
(These are the things we must go through day by day)

We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsiders, and we suing the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a two in The Source
Hypochondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blonds be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pale of garbage
Its almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said ""What up, its nice to meet ya""
I'd like to treat ya to a bagel and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month
But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no phillies, or no papers
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So gimme all your money
And don't try nothin' funny
'Cause you know your stinkin' ass is too fat to try to outrun me
I went to grab my gun
That's when her ass put it on me
Wit' an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors
Started causin' a scene
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank god I was smokin' crack all day
And doped up off coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I want to kill her
But so I gotta catch her first
Ran threw alleys, parkin' lots, and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in
And shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
That's when I seen the bedroom door shut
I know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked!
You might as well come out now
She said ""Come in, its unlocked!""
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn
She said ""Come her big boy, lets get acquainted""
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg, ""No, please let go""
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Den den den den den den, go go gadget dick!
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted, ""Now bitch, let's see who gets the best!""
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death (Ah! ah!)

Come here bitch!
Come here!
Take this motherfuckin' dick!
Bitch, come here!

I don't know why this world keep turning
(And as we go along)
Round and round
(Throughout the days of our lives)
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
(We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday)
I don't know why this world keep turning
(That we must go through)
Round and round

Eminem,"I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts 
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon 
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over 
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em 
Quickest damn gun slingers I've ever seen 
Got murdered in cold blood 
That ol' saloon there was their lil' home away from home 
They say the ghosts of bad and evil still live in that tavern 
And on a quiet night 
You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da 5'9\""

I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet 
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat 
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph 
And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head 
Trapped him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed 
'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead 
Told him each one of his boys is dead 
I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said 

Who hard? Yo I done heard worse 
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other 
To see which one will swerve first 
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds 
That of a globe, on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil 
Intelligence level is 'hell-ier' than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto 
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist 
Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse 
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse 
And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis in the nations 
Collaborating, attemptin' to take over the earth 

'Cause this is what happens when bad meets evil 
We hit the trees til' we look like Vietnamese people 
He's evil, and I'm bad like Steve Seagal 
Above the law 'cause I don't agree with police either 
(shit, me neither) 
We ain't eager to be legal 
So please leave me wit' the keys to your Jeep Eagle 
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts 
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle 
Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain (He's insane) 
No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off 
'Cause I can't find a decent vein

The disaster wit' dreads 
I'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough 
To kill my soul after I'm dead 
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter 
'Cause I serve any stranger wit' money 
I spray a hundred, men until they joint chains 
While slippin' bullets at point blank range like they was punches 
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral 
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws 
Wit' my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass 
I'm blazin' MC's, at the same time amazin' MC's 
Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me 
From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough to cast a avalanche 
And bust 'til volcanoes erupt 

Hello? (Billy) 
'Ay-yo what's up (we're comin' to get you) 
Stop they know it's us! 

I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (uh-huh) 
I'm the one who burned your house down (oh) 
Well I'm out now (shit)
And this time I'm comin' back to blow your house up 
And I ain't gonna leave you a window to jump out of 
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms 
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms 
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave 
I'm a put air in a bag and charge people to breathe 

'Cause this is what happens when bad meets evil 
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people 
He's evil, and I'm bad like Steve Seagal 
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel 

(We'll be waitin') 
See you in hell 
Wall Street, 
Royce Da 5'9, Slim Shady 
See you in hell for the sequel (bye bye) 
Bad meets evil, what? ('Til next time)

And so that's the story when bad meets evil 
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county 
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens 
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did 
Got shot in the back comin' out of that ol' saloon 
But their spirits still live on to this day

A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in junior high, this kid said
""Just you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die""
I looked at my watch it was one twenty
""I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?""
He said, ""Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse""
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Something told me, ""Try to fake a stomach ache, it works""
I screamed, ""Ow! My appendix feel like they could burst!
Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse!""
""What's the matter?"" ""I don't know, my leg, it hurts!""
""Leg?! I thought you said it was your tummy?""
""Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee!""
""Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over

Way before my baby daughter Hailey
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him, ""We shouldn't beef""
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, ""You gonna die honky!""
The principal walked in and started helping him stomp me
I made them think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools
""This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back bully! Now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home later that same day
Started reading the comics, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was trying to read
I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', ""What are you on, drugs??
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug!"" (Stop!)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, ""Look bitch, what have you done?""
""Oh my God, I'm sorry son"" ""Shut up you cunt!""
I said, ""Fuck it!"" took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

My favorite color is red, like the blood shed
In Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish-kabob
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so
Shit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind I can't find it
I freestylin' ever verse that I spit

That's why I write songs where I die at the end
'Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck

I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
And yell out loud, ""All of y'all, get the hell out now""
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up y'all, I'm sorry
I'm bored out of my gourd
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot the the floorboard of my Ford
I guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Just one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
Fell like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage

I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness monster, peace out
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out 'til I started bustin'

Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol then ate it with a dipstick

Fed up with life and the way things are going
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play
(Shit is mine, I gotta do this, gotta do this)

Alright, stop! (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience

That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs

And smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink

What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
In front of your optical to slow you down

And every time you think you gotten past it
It's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies, with secret identities
And disguises, to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
They want to come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin'

Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire

Tired of not working at G-M, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol P-M

If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john

If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass
For the whole world to kiss
You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
Know what I'm sayin'?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
Know what I'm sayin'?
Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?
Just fed up

And check out the man he goes by the name of er

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-eighty, you Little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The Proof is in the puddin', just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman

Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'

'Cause I just don't give a fuck!

I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milk bone
I'm Everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up dis you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll dis your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' the jewel, I'm flippin' the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a headrush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm about to burst this Tec at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, especially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they're flossin' in their Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave your ass mindless

And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
'Cause when we die we know we all goin' the same way
'Cause it's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
I'm comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today

Live half a life and throw the rest away

If it means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name

Holding 2 Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on em
And while you flaunt em I could be takin' em to shops to pawn em

Smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people
And drink and jump behind the wheel like it was still legal

So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date wit' Lauryn Hill

'Cause I stand out like a green hat wit a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist

Wit' your dead grandmother's corpse then throw it on your porch
Jumped into a chicken hawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat Fog Horn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm bout as normal as Norman Bates, wit' deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother are you there, I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head wit that shovel

And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled, it was still blue
I'll hang you until you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains (shh)

I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches!
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy

I be the F-R-O the double G
And check out the man he goes by the name of er

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-eighty, you Little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin' up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The Proof is in the puddin', just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman

'Cause I just don't give a fuck!

I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milk bone
I'm Everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up dis you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll dis your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' your dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' the jewel, I'm flippin' the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin' a headrush
Doin' too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death

And I can't change the way I am

‘Cause I still don't give a fuck

I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' a limo
Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, body-pierce with this
Livin' amok, never givin' a fuck
Give me the keys, I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in a cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab (Yeah!)
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn, and my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein' operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme

I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled, it was still blue
I'll hang you until you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains (shh)
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
‘Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm, and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match (Here, Momma, try 'em on)
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives

Yea yea yea Dr. Dre up in here y'all know what this is.
It's what y'all been waiting for Funk Master Flex, Big Kap,
Def Jam Records giving it to you baby.
Yo Eminem show these mother fuckers what time it is baby

I used to be a lonely man, only mad, until I got a million dollars, shit
Now if I only had some fucking hair I'd pull it, faster than a bullet
Out of Tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident

I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate the straight jacket it ain't latching, and can't lock it
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it

Before me, and just kept throwing they fucking self's at it
My head is aching, I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedation? (Come on!)
Anyway I got down with Dre (What up?) 

The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the street screaming, ""Fuck the Police""
When you still had your mother's fucking Nipple stuck in your teeth
(Fucking baby) Became a role model after Colorado

Now all they do is follow me around and holla Bravo!
Hell yea I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
Suck my dick, bitch
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I won't

'Cause you'll probably want to stand in his place
So put a sock in it, with your fake-ass Tupac image
You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative
(Want to Fight?) I'm probably the awkwardest alcoholic talking

Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumbling, mumbling
A bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'mm juss high on life

So why on earth would I need drugs, when I can fly on kites?

The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron (AHH!)
Psych I'm just joking, for christ sake
Don't get so bent out of shape 

'Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it, but I won't let it upset me
'Cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck its like to be so fed up

And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of it's own, sometimes I can't find it at home
It hides in the stove (Hello, where you at?)
Shit, talk about your brain being baked

My shit's still in the oven on 480 De-Grades
Hailey Jade, daddy loves you baby,
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter fuck you lady
You critics want to criticize but couldnt visualize

Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes
The neighborhood that I grew up in you could die for nothing
And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth

And shove his head in the fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say
Or change cause of the age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit

Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit
Hip Hop is universal now, it's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it

But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night get silent
Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge

I'll confess to every murder I committed since 3 years old

Fuck that, turn that shit off

Brought to you by the WOOOORRRLLLD FAMOUS Wake-Up Show!

[RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP!

[Tech N9NE]
When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin
Look around, your town is crumblin
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin MC's lipless
On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway & Tech heard me flow and its sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling ""Tech N9NE's filled""

[Eminem]
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit Withe-out
'cause why'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house, 
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch, bitch!""
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than flippin a convertible
Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway & Tech, two disk jokeys 
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject

[Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
'cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon

[Pharoahe Monch]
Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assualts in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, see now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution 
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

[Kool G Rap]
I sway the tech wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake-Up Show for those slept away
Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin like lead from out the heck-AK
Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decora'
Until the head of jake investigate

[Jayo Felony]
What? Sway can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
Tech can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do?
Rev can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
I can give it to you, Wha Wha Wha What What!

[Chino XL]
Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harassment like Tisha Camp-bell
You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a Withe cast on your leg
I'm Wake-Up Show reppin wit Sway & Tech

I'm Chino X, bring KRS in

De de de de de de da di day, KRS-One comin wit the Tech & Sway
Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway & a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect
Nevertheless I WRECK YOU, now you know what Sway & Tech do
I'll be back but for now just sackle!

You see me standin' outside of your buildin'
Screamin', ""Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children!"" (Hey, wait!)
I look at my life in a new light, fuck it
Give me two mics, I write songs for me, fuck what you like
You'll probably hear me rap half-hearted 
'Cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryna get my porno career started (hell yeah)
Every place and event, ""Been there, done that""
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went 
Want a deal? Study these five chapters
Lesson one, throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson two, face 'em and dis 'em (what up dog?)
Don't give em a demo, kidnap 'em (I want you to come with me)
And make 'em come to your basement and listen (you're gonna fuckin' check this out)
Lesson three, get a job at a label, switch demos with Canibus 
And put yours on the owner's table (here listen!)
Lesson four, know you heard this before
""Hey, let me get your number, I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!""
Don't act like a fan, you want to get signed?
Get the whitest A and R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson five, get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street
I ain't givin' you shit bitch, don't even bother askin' me (get away from me)
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin'
'Cause I'm always shittin' when I'm rappin' like Master P (uh)
Got a blow job from Paula Jones, and stuck it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones (ow!)
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah (It's all about me)
Gave Alyssa Milano syphilis, mono and gonorrhea (You're a dick)
And all three of my main girls said see-ya
'Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin' Aaliyah (what? Oh my God!)

So if I hurt your self-esteem 
And you get dissed too bad (Yo why you diss me?)

Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi Renee! (Oh hi!) I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway (what?) and drive away
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood drippin' from it, rippin' your stomach like a paper mache
You talk a lot of shit, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh 
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin' wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with 'Agent Orange'
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (here!)
The demon is here, steamin' this year
I rip Mystikal's voice box out, scream in his ear 
It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image, I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
""Yeah I don't think this guy is well"" I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail

I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin'
Lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nut-sack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin' to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Christopher
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat 
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beatin' your knees
And walkin' through South Central L.A., bleedin' in jeans (Am I a Blood or a Crip?)
Wakin' up the next day in breathin' machines
Flashin' back to being shot and repeatin' the scenes
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke

So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad

Want a deal? Study these five chapters
Lesson one, throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson two, face 'em and dis 'em (what up dog?)
Don't give em a demo, kidnap 'em (I want you to come with me)
And make 'em come to your basement and listen (you're gonna fuckin' check this out)
Lesson three, get a job at a label, switch demos with Canibus 
And put yours on the owner's table (here listen!)
Lesson four, know you heard this before
""Hey, let me get your number, I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!""
Don't act like a fan, you want to get signed?
Get the whitest A and R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson five, get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street
I ain't givin' you shit bitch, don't even bother askin' me (get away from me)
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin'
'Cause I'm always shittin' when I'm rappin' like Master P (uh)
Got a blow job from Paula Jones, and stuck it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones (ow!)
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah (It's all about me)
Gave Alyssa Milano syphilis, mono and gonorrhea (You're a dick)
And all three of my main girls said see-ya
'Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin' Aaliyah (what? Oh my God!)

You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had (A big dick!)
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
""I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad!""
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

What a wonderful day, I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi Renee! (Oh hi!) I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway (what?) and drive away
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood drippin' from it, rippin' your stomach like a paper mache
You talk a lot of shit, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh 
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin' wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with 'Agent Orange'
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (here!)
The demon is here, steamin' this year
I rip Mystikal's voice box out, scream in his ear 
It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image, I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
""Yeah I don't think this guy is well"" I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail

I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin'
Lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nut-sack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin' to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Christopher
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat 
While your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beatin' your knees
And walkin' through South Central L.A., bleedin' in jeans (Am I a Blood or a Crip?)
Wakin' up the next day in breathin' machines
Flashin' back to being shot and repeatin' the scenes
On how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke

So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
And when I rap about a fat bitch that you wished you had
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
""I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad""
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad
""He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad""
You know I just be sayin' that to get you mad

I know that makes you real mad, don't it? (uh-huh)

Ha ha, ride

All you see is the sun, reflectin' off of the gun
I'm ready for the showdown, that go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin' gold, waitin' for this drama to unfold
I got a {blunt} rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsters blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
But I'ma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said

You never met me, and you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name's Slim, you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm tellin' the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you

[Chorus]
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun, when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die

He was ""Shady,"" I seen by the look on his face
He said take ten paces {shit} I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My {shit} went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
(You need bullets, hurry up run!) {*imitating Slick Rick*}
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
(Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want)
I figured he was tellin' the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do, it's on you
(Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?)
The Chronic!
(Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two)
(And plus I know who's got it)
Who?
(Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two)
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle 
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun (Dre here's the plot)

This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's goin' around sayin' he took the game from us
[Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin']
But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission is to get him to stop layin' eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps

I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin' doors in, started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singin', it sounded like a ""G Thang,""
And a verse from ""Keep Their Heads Ringin""
I said ""It's Dre's Day,"" and started to spray
Against 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin' every which way

That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled

I know one thing; police wouldn't always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin me 
(can I get your autograph?)
The yellow cabs in the city would stop for me
I wouldn't need collateral to buy property
If I was white, wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
Security wouldn't follow me around the store
Like I'd steal something (maybe he might of stole something)
Because I'm black I rob and automatically assume I ain't got no job

Okay children quiet down, quiet down 
Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day 
His name is Mr. Shady 

Children quiet down please 
Brian don't throw that (Shut up!) 
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute 
While Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He's got aids!) 
Good luck Mr. Shady 
 
Hi there little boys and girls (fuck you!) 
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels 
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?) 
Say hi Bob! (""Hi Bob"") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom 
And he don't got a job, 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot 
But his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot 
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot 
And wait in the parkin' lot for waitresses off the clock 
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog 
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (ah!) 
And even if they escaped and they got the cops 
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge 
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job 
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk 
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off 
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker 
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka 
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a ""Dr."" 
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her 
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her 
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander 
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner 
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana, 
And what it might do to you 
So see if the squirrels want any, it's bad for you 
 
[Chorus] 
See children, drugs are bad (come on) 
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad (ask him man) 
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right) 
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will) 
So kids say no to drugs (that's right) 
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh) 
Then there's really nothin' else to say (sing along) 
Drugs are just bad, okay? 
 
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it? 
Fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?) 
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels? 
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world 
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it 
Kids two hits will probably drain all your spinal fluid 
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back 
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back 
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old 
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold 
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys 
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it 
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyper drive 
And his eyes roll back in his skull  
His back starts to, look like the McDonald's Arches 
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin' 
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him 
""Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"" 
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny 
So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money 
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over 
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga 
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac 
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you 
 
[Chorus] 
 
And last but not least, one of the most humongous 
Problems among young people today, is fungus 
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off, 
Bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it 
Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff 
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em.. 
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?) 
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair 
(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire 
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?) 
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms 
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus 
Ya tongue gets, all swoll' up like a cow's tongue (How come?) 
'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!) 
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact 
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!) 
But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D. 
They're gonna come for me and I'ma  have to grow a goatee 
And get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault 
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 
'Cause I'm bad for you 
 
[Chorus]

Come on children, clap along (Shut up!) 
Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!) 
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!) 
So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin' penis!) 
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! God dammit!)

You gettin' spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stoppin your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum iternally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock-block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'ma throw a head-butt so hard, I'll knock us both out

Eminem,"Pssh, man I need a lighter man

Right here

Yeahhh.. wha**up Slim?

What''s crackin?

Hit this s***

Ssshhit I almost hit this motherf***er today

Psh, is that right?

What is it with motherf***ers thinkin that..
Because we''re in the spotlight or whatever that..
They can do or say whatever they want to us
And that we won''t retaliate

Protect my motherf***in self, by ANY

MEANS, NECESSARY

Right?

'Cause you don''t know me, I don''t know you
So don''t approach me, I won''t approach you
And don''t insult me, I won''t insult you
Cause you don''t know what I will or I won''t do

'Cause you don''t know me, I don''t know you
So don''t approach me, I won''t approach you
And don''t insult me, I won''t insult you
Cause you don''t know what I will or I won''t do

Make no mistake, I''m the Golden State heavyweight
Bein underrated gave me time to create it
Can you relate? I renovate, straight out the gate
Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin but hate

Millionaires snatchin crumbs off my little son plate
Kidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face
No hoes, no clothes, no one showin up for my shows
You know how it goes; I might as well kick it at home

But my baby momma hate my guts and can''t stand me (yeah)
Packed up, moved out, started a new family
So all this strugglin for what, so I can blow up
Marry a slut but can''t watch my seed grow up?

F*** THAT, this the f***in thanks I get
For tryin to edutain a**holes and feed my b****
Yo I feel like my whole life is upside down (upside down)
'Cause you seein more support than I''m seein my child

It''s like..

... everyday I wake up, another drama
It''s a wonder I''m alive, survivin this karma
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her

Without these cameras in our faces like animals
For your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulence up theavenue
And catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
And what we do in private since they won''t let us put up afence

And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun
Whether it''s unloaded full or an un-registered one
No bullet, you''re so full of s***
This clip is so full it''ll spit if I don''t pull it

And don''t give me no bulls*** I''m not in the mood
I just got in a feud in some parkin lot with a dude
Over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over the s***
Don''t tell me bout the show business s***
I know what this is, b****

'Cause you don''t know me, I don''t know you
So don''t approach me, I won''t approach you
And don''t insult me, I won''t insult you
Cause you don''t know what I will or I won''t do

'Cause you don''t know me, I don''t know you
So don''t approach me, I won''t approach you
And don''t insult me, I won''t insult you
Cause you don''t know what I will or I won''t do

This ain''t business, this is personal B****
You don''t know Xzibit from s***, new school, cla** dismissed
I had a very F***ED UP day, I''m needin this fit
Shuttin motherf***ers up like they pleadin the 5th

Yo Em it''s time to get serious with it (yeah)
Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in theskillet
This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs
Ain''t no neighborhood that''s big enough to bang on us

Ain''t no love lost my n****z, relax yo''self
I''m about to snatch it all and start spreadin the wealth
To my n****z who never seen it I mean it when I holla
At the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones

Got, tons of ammo to crack your enamel
Changin your channel, you played like a f***in piano
Ridin slow through Cali like I''m ridin a camel
Millionaire motherf***ers with their brains in their flannels

I feel like, Tony Soprano, who do I trust now?
Just hit me on my tele'' n**** soon as I touch down
Spit lines to split spines just to get mine
Big behind b****es gettin dick to spit shine

Sniff lines of coke, that''s the only s*** that make you dope
B****-a** n**** that''s droppin the soap
Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip
And turn til you motherf***ers tell me the right s***

So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself
A front door with twelve locks
And have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
And everytime somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?

F*** that, I protect myself with these twelve shots
And one in the chamber, gun in the waist
And one in the ankle, waitin for someone to come to my place
Tryin to walk up and knock like these c***suckers are not

Gonna get a shotgun or a glock shoved in their face?
And it''s a disgrace Hailey can''t play with her toys
In the front yard without you drivin by honkin your horn
Screamin some s***, leanin out your windows, beepin n s***

Or pullin up in my drive like I won''t leap in your whip
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
So my address ends up on the internet again
So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin them

That if someone comes to my crib, I''ma shove a gun in theirribs
And reporters, blow it out of proportion
""Oh, now he''s pullin guns on his fans
Just for tryin to stand on his porch""

And I''m the bad guy, cause I don''t answer my door like ""Hey hi!
You guys wants some autographs? Okay, form a straight line!""
Sometimes I feel like loadin this rifle
And climbin the roof at night and hidin outside to snipe you

It''s not that I don''t like you..
.. it''s just that I''m not behind the mic
I''m a person who''s just like you",Don't Approach Me,2000

Tapin' bombs to the back of record companies
Blow 'em up if they ain't want me
The national guard, they scared to hunt me
I love beef, I got you hoes duckin' me
A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs with keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggas in hundred degree saunas
You can act a fool if ya wanna (biatch!)
It's this lyrical piranha
Strapped wit a grenade, in the pool with ya mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nothin' up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem
When I see 'em, you hoes endin' up in a fuckin' mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM
Pull in the garage while you screamin'
Keep the motor on then I'm leavin' (I'll shit on you!)

Bitch shut your fuckin' mouth
I'm a keep eatin' 'til Richard Simmons comes to my house
With a chain saw to cut me out (me out, me out!)
I'll fuck your wife, I had sex since I met her
Too busy fuckin' wit (your twelve year old) baby sitter (ha ha ha)
And all women ain't shit, only good for cookin', cleanin'
And sucking dick and that's it (I said it)
I was responsible for killin' John Candy
Got Jon Benet Ramsey in my '98 Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody; truly yours the idiotic Bizarre

My adolescent years weren't shit 'til what I do now
I never grew up I was born grown, and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
The more ignorant, the incident is, I fit in
Ignorin' the shit how borin' it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwin' a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
Its they who rapped me and say they can take me
Its they who legs I brake and make achy
Its they who mistake me and make me so angry
(I'll shit on you!) I'll spit on you
Start pissin' and do the opposite on you
You weren't listenin', I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spillin' my guts like chicken cordon blew and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album
Pull my pants downward

Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your teck, I'll beat you wit it across your chest

Yo it's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat ya peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in choke holds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
(hey, hey, hey!) I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
That's like D-Bo fightin' Peablo Bryson (I'll shit on you)
So what you hollerin' and yellin' about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fuckin' skeleton out
Niggas get hit wit a two piece; bling bling
Wit a poisonous sting, I'm such a violent thing

My disk slips and disconnects
'til I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
(C'mon, I'll shit on you!) Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
And spilling liters of blood like swimmin' pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too (*bullets spray*}
A lot of people say misogynistic which is true
I don't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet

I just flip 'em the bird and keep goin'
I don't take shit from no one

I'm a criminal!
'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal!

Eminem,"Yeah, haha, whoo, shit
(Aight, guess what? I ain't coming in yet
I'm come in a minute
Ayo, this is my love song, it goes like this)

Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark (fuckin' faggot!)
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women
Are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink, then in
A couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up
(Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me outta this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so)

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
'Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no""
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Schemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game, and every face looks the same
They've got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's got me standin' next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like, ""Yo, what the fuck we do?""
I gotta go, bitch, you know I got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run, these drugs are probably going
To catch up sooner or later, but fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit's stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm going to try to find some more

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
'Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no""
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?
Screw it! And what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow, you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Mar-a-ju-on-na is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
‘Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every mornin'
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lotta growing up to do
I still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out getting smashed

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
'Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no""
They won't let me ever let 'em go

I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen I was putting shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to, get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox (Mom! Mom!)
I used to give a, fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press I'm stressed
Too much stares two breasts, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (yes)
Grew up quick (no) was raised right

I take each individual degenerates head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
My name is Slim Shady

The sensational (Back is the incredible!)

""Slim for Pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs!""
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
""Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it""
Mind with no sense in it, fried to get so frenetic
Whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoke in 'em
With my windows tinted, with nine limos rented
Doin' lines of coke in 'em, with a bunch of guys hoppin' out
All high and indo-scented

'Cause (I'm) Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
'Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ah!)
So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez, and Puffy you know this!
I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
And have a son and a new brother at the same time

But there was nothing I could do or say to try to change it

After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow!

Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
""Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get Bizzy""
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for 10 million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it, bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter, your attorney Fred Gibson's a faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden I got ninety-some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off I walked to the news stand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help
Um, here, ""XXL! XXL!""
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Aww, fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

I wouldn’t say “fuckin’” for six minutes
Six minutes, Slim Shady, you’re on!

So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin’ these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I’m stuck with a crazy mom
Is she really on as much dope as you say she’s on?
Came home and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats
Sick, sick dreams of picnic scenes

Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No.""
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. we should be together too

Dear Mister ""I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans""
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you

Do you know what it feels like to be told to have a record shoved up your ass?
But I...
I'm gonna lose my fucking job over this
Do you know why Dre's record was so successful?
He's rapping about big-screen TV's, blunts, 40's and bitches
You're rapping about homosexuals and Vicodin

I can't sell this shit!

A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
So the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
It's just too late
'Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it (uh-huh) for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed will hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remy I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, ""Forgive me""
I'm snatchin' every penny, it gotta be that way, nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it

Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets

It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pitbull an abortion

Weed laced with somethin', nigga, pass that!

Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
'Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, 'cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth
And it's polluted; I cock it back, then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players, thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo

I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
(Special delivery) I sign to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin' niggas runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin' some ones
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

He's Shady (He's so crazy!)
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal
Makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right to say what I like?
And walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life, like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home, and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
That somewhere deep down there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here, I start some trouble everywhere that I go (That I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know ('Cause they know)
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door (The back door)
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44 (a .44)

And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat

Slim Shady does not give a fuck what you think
(Tell 'em to suck it)

If you don't like it  you can suck his fucking cock
(Tell 'em they kissed my ass)
Little did you know upon purchasing this album
You have just kissed his ass!
(Tell 'em I'm fed up)

Okay children quiet down, quiet down 
Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day 
His name is Mr. Shady 

Children quiet down please 
Brian don't throw that (Shut up!) 
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute 
While Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He's got aids!) 
Good luck Mr. Shady 
 
Hi there little boys and girls (fuck you!) 
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels 
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?) 
Say hi Bob! (""Hi Bob"") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom 
And he don't got a job, 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot 
But his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot 
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot 
And wait in the parkin' lot for waitresses off the clock 
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog 
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (ah!) 
And even if they escaped and they got the cops 
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge 
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job 
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk 
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off 
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker 
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka 
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a ""Dr."" 
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her 
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her 
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander 
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner 
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana, 
And what it might do to you 
So see if the squirrels want any, it's bad for you 
 
See children, drugs are bad (come on) 
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad (ask him man) 
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right) 
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will) 
So kids say no to drugs (that's right) 
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh) 
Then there's really nothin' else to say (sing along) 
Drugs are just bad, okay? 
 
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it? 
Fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?) 
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels? 
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world 
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it 
Kids two hits will probably drain all your spinal fluid 
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back 
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back 
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old 
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold 
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys 
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it 
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyper drive 
And his eyes roll back in his skull  
His back starts to, look like the McDonald's Arches 
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal barfin' 
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him 
""Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"" 
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny 
So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money 
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over 
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga 
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac 
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you 
 
See children, drugs are bad (come on) 
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dad (ask him man) 
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right) 
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will) 
So kids say no to drugs (that's right) 
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh) 
Then there's really nothin' else to say (sing along) 
Drugs are just bad, okay? 
  
And last but not least, one of the most humongous 
Problems among young people today, is fungus 
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off, 
Bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it 
Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff 
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em.. 
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?) 
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair 
(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire 
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?) 
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms 
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus 
Ya tongue gets, all swoll' up like a cow's tongue (How come?) 
'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!) 
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact 
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!) 
But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D. 
They're gonna come for me and I'ma  have to grow a goatee 
And get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault 
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 
'Cause I'm bad for you 

Come on children, clap along (Shut up!) 
Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!) 
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!) 
So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin' penis!) 
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! God dammit!)

May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though.""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

Ya tongue gets, all swoll' up like a cow's tongue (How come?) 
'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!) 
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact 
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!) 
But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D. 
They're gonna come for me and I'ma  have to grow a goatee 
And get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault 
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 
'Cause I'm bad for you 
 
[Chorus]

Come on children, clap along (Shut up!) 
Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!) 
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!) 
So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin' penis!) 
So there'll be more for me (Hippie! God dammit!)

Eminem,"My words are weapons, I use 'em to crush my opponents
My words are weapons, I never show no emotion
My words are weapons, I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin' to me

My words are weapons, I use 'em to crush my opponents
These words are weapons, I never did show no emotion
My words are weapons, I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin' to me
My words are like weaponry on a record

Yo, the rage I release on a page
Is like a demon unleashed in a cage
Lunatic, soon as I hit the stage
My mind is like a fuckin' stick of dynamite
Once I get behind the mic
It's like the wick is lit, you bitches die tonight

My nine is like a guidin' light at night, shinin' bright
My fuckin' grip is tighter than my wife's vagina, psych
These cock-suckin' cops got my Smith & Wesson
I guess it's time to pick a different weapon, man, the shit's depressin'
But Swift is getting me a new one for a Christmas present
(Come on Slim, let's go and teach this fuckin' bitch a lesson)

They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish
But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage
Shady stay creative, baby, hold your head up, don't you let up
One bit on these motherfuckin' suckers, you're a soldier, get up
Stand up for what you believe in, long as you breathin'
They jealous of you man, that's the only reason they beefin'

It's that Dirty Dozen renegade, you done pulled the pin out my grenade
.38s'll move your shit up out the way
You niggas won't forget about McVeigh, you got somethin' to say?
Let it out today or watch these bullets spray

From these ten black fingers huggin' these deadly millimeters
That'll make Jeff Dahmer's look like he caught a misdemeanor
See I'm dirty, so I ain't gotta buy a pistol cleaner
An official beater, don't let me see you with yo' heater

You gets whipped with it, tell them motherfuckers, Swift did it
You packin' somethin' special in your crib, then bitch get it
I'm physically fitted to run yo' digits, I'm hostile
With this Roscoe pointed up your nostrils

You get splitted and guess what, I'm blowin' up the hospital
And wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a hoe
I'm Hannibal Lector, the spinal cord disconnector
Findin whores to lock 'em up in motels to inject 'em

My words are weapons, I use 'em to crush my opponents
My words are weapons, I never show no emotion

I'm eatin' crews like I'm Hannibal
There's no way I can be the gay rapper
(Why not?)
I only fuck animals
Stupid trick got my dick startin' to itch
Went to my mother's grave site, called her a stupid bitch

One on one in this bloodsport, I'm in divorce court
Sold my bitch off a pack of Newports
(Your Honor)
Six times I been arrested, how would you feel
If you was a Jehovah witness that always got molested?
(It happens)

I'm smokin' dank, drinkin' drank
I can't have any kids 'cause I'm fuckin' shootin' blanks
Don't you know Bizarre don't give a fuck?
Nicole's a whore, I'm glad O.J. murdered the slut

Responsibility, I'm negligent
Bill Clinton's a fag, should be stabbed
Let Richard Simmons be the President
Call me a weirdo, call me Bizarre
While I stick it up yo' ass while you shittin' diarrhea

I'm disappointed in my dentist appointment
He only gave me the fuckin' gas for thirty minutes this mornin'
Went to the hospital to get a chest X-ray
Checked out the next day in a dress wit a sex change

I'm havin' a bad day
My fuckin' dad's gay, I hate fags, and I'm fuckin' mad 'cause I don't have AIDS
All I want to do is die
I tried suicide six times and couldn't even do it right

Collapsed, had a relapse and called three cabs
And had to be dragged back to rehab wit bloody kneecaps
Enrolled myself in a twelve-step program
Tripped on the first step and got pinned down in a chokeslam

Yes I'm in the flesh like hollow heads through your vest
No contest, M.E.-Eth Man's obsessed
With sex, drugs and rock and roll, new Tecs and calicos
Word has it we move mathematic on rappers
Who don't add up, you get broke, battered and slapped up
8 million stories in the nekkid call yo man Method
Straight guerrilla iller nigga kill a murder record
My verbal shooter does it to ya
The 16-bar Ruger, busting yo funky dope maneuvers
But I'm not ya Super Lover Cee, I'm the Super Sperm

10 out of 10 I'll be the, men of all men I mean the
Creme de la creme a schemer, sipping on 'Gnac and Zima
True Professional too (two) (DJ Clue!)
Now that Bush is president nigga we all through

It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
Why I keep on ducking under the bed when I hear thunder
Cause I ain't crazy, I say shit that's crazy to crazy people
To make 'em believe I'm crazy so they can relate to me
And maybe believe in Shady so they can be evil baby
I like that! I'm only as crazy as people made me
Believe me, they'd be just as many motherfucking murderers
And heroin users without Marilyn's music
But I figure I make my music I don't care if you use it
To murder somebody, I just wanna be there when you do it
Now the parents are suing cause little Darren is screwing
Karen and Susan cause I told him to do it on Clue's new shit
Now it's all ruined, the whole world is fucked up
Cause of me? Two 12-year old girls is knocked up
My attitude's 'fuck it' like Pac's was at one point
Wanna come join? Pick up a Glock and just point
Now everybody's killing everybody and everybody's bloody
And I'm just laughing like it's funny
Cause I don't really give a shit about no-motherfucking-body
I'm so motherfucking nutty, I don't give a fuck about nothing

I'll suck my own dick like if I had a rib removed
Vampire, sun go down, I'm still wilding
Bullets travel through the air in the night like Phil Collins
Rock City baby, knife through your throat 'til you're broke
Rise from the underground like sewer smoke
It's all shifty, I got all of my dogs with me
And they all rich, and still all of their palms itchy
We'll pump, rumble over birds jungle urge
Walking like we talking drunk while we stumble over words

It's just, Mr. Meth and DJ Clue
I ain't crazy, I just do what the beats say do

Eminem,"May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though.""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat

I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No.""
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose

But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning

And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you

Say that I'm foolish I only talk about jewels (bling bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothing, I made something doing
What I do through and through and
I give you the news, with a twist it's just his ghetto point-of-view
The renegade, you been afraid
I penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they
Pop toasters, and they live with they moms
Got dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggas crotched over
Mommy's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
No he's not around, now how that sound to ya, jot it down
I bring it through the ghetto without riding 'round
Hiding down ducking strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothing relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt

Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
'Cause see they call me a menace, and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Using his music to steer it, sharing his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're saying you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfucking drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fucking do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage!

Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat
Feelin' braver, durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan my pops left me
And often my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home

My demeanor, thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics
Raisin' my head to the sky, Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
As a monger of hate and Satan a scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie
While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful

Eminem,"Sometimes I just feel like
Quitting I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life
Sometimes I want to jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Something ain't right
Hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright
Drawing a blank like

Dah, dah, dah. dah
It ain't my fault
Great then I fall
My insides crawl
And I clam up
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I have just been ripped
So I must then get
Off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit
Yo, I'm going the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man
I'm a make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm going
Sorry, momma, I'm grown
I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

Walking these train tracks
Tryin' to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin' to chase rap
Gotta move ASAP
Get a new plan
Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV buries her nose in her pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother and dad
Ain't no telling what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep running from something I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset 'cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like a grew up but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't got a rep, my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man I'm just tryin' to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please, I'm beggin' you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homie wherever you are
Yo, I'm telling you dog I'm bailing this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own

You gotta live it to feel it
You didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is
Why it was and it still is
To be walking this borderline of Detroit's city limits
It's different and it's a certain significance
A certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You'd never seen, heard, smelled or met a real mc
Who's incredible or on the same pedestal as me
But yet still unsigned
Having a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunch line
When it comes crunch time
Where did my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't having to run with this little rabbits but fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet
I'm starting to doubt shit
I'm feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with
I live like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army trying to salvage an outfit
And it's cold
Trying to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battling mode
My defenses are so up
The one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
This city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I just feel like I'm being pulled apart
From each one of my limbs
By each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me want to jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not
What I'm doing, I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to u-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin' on next time I'll meet a new girl
I can not only play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat all I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur
I'm Eight Mile Road

If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?

Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better

The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortar
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da da dumb da dumb da da

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go

No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
See dishonor caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much
For me to want to say in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not
Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got

I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle, I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no humor in it no more, you know

Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening

And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes, but I'm only human
But I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'da killed him, shit I would've shot Kim and him both

Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm exercisin', to uplifting the foot stage 
This thing's the nicest, I keep telling you 
What the fuck this guy on the corner been selling you? 

I'm e-mailing you, at the wrong website 
Misspelling you, break you and put the fear of hell in you 
Escape above you, stuff the nurse in a purse 
Disperse like I added too many words in a verse 
Slim Shady, a perverted virgin at birth {or ""version of birth""} 
Driving off, leaving the murdered virgin at church 
The first person searching the earth for the motherfucker 
That pulled the plug when they shoulda alerted the surgeon first 
You don't curse and hit with your own words 
Leave me alone bitch! I get on my own nerves 
And if I don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up 
Then I'm takin' off both shoes and stickin' each middle toe up (fuck y'all!) 

If y'all got a bowl of hash better cash it 
Dollar signs flashin' I'ma take the last hit (""gimmie that"") 

And if you're spitting whack shit on the microphone 
I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'm gonna detach it 

So if you got a bowl of has better cash it 
Dollar signs flashin' I'ma take the last hit 

I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid 
Threw my baby's mother in a hatch-back and latched it 

Any disease out there I'm willing to catch it,
Slim Shady
All praises

Eminem,"The very best of game recordings
The finest in hip hop entertainment
Hello, I'm naughty
One of the sexy sexy game girls you all love to love
And I wanna welcome you to game tight
So, sit back, relax and get your groove on

The Bad
Yeah
The Evil
The Bad
Yeah
The Evil
Right, yo
Put em together

Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
Yo
I'm just fucking with you, cause I got nothing to do

I am bored!
I came in the diner with skateboarders, and placed orders
Ate hors d'oeuvres, and hit the waiter with plate warmers 
Let you inhale the glock smell, while I'm ripping your wallet off 

And slipping a Molotov in your Cocktail (take that)
Burning your contracts, punch your A&R in the face 
Smash his glasses and turn em to contacts
I'm on some shook shit, if it's missing I took it (whoops!)

Nurse look at this straitjacket, it's crooked!
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (FedEx)
So how do you describe someone, with a decapitated head 
When the rest of his body's still alive running?

Coming with five gunmen, waiting to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500 (what?) hide from it
For every hundred MC's rhyming about birds
Only about two-thirds'd really set it without words

Yo you ain't a thug, I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit, you would swear it's raining slugs (what?)
I'm the hottest shit in the industry (uh)
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defending me

You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up (what?)

I take it if you run your mouth, then you want to get sent up
Heat it up, you be leaking blood and spitting phlegm up
Now we rivals, cause of a small name or title
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and bible

Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
Yo
I'm just fucking with you, cause I got nothing to do

Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
Yo
I'm just fucking with you, cause I got nothing to do

Forget a chorus, my metaphors are so complicated 
It takes six minutes to get applause 
And by the time you all catch on, I'm a end your career 
And walk away with the whole floor so you have nothing to fall back on!

I'll throw you off of ten floors
Pull a fucking headache outta my head, and put it in yours (take this)
I'm indoors, waiting for disaster to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores

This bitch wanted to blow me, I said, ""It oughta happen
You swallow cum bitch?"" ""No, but I brought a napkin""
Getting skully while I'm autographing
Got my daughter laughing cause I sent her mother whitewater rafting

I'm not a fact, I'm a proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my you-haul screaming
""Wait, wait, wait, you ain't moving here!
Lorena Bobbitt, c'mere, want a souvenir?

I've been high as fuck, since I was a juvi-neer
Juvenile? Same difference, I need some 'caine 
'Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up the seven slain infants
(Oh my God!) Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'

Walking in swamp water with an M-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places (what?)

Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, icing my fame, blowing your hand off
Dancing with the Devil leading, I won't die, I'm never leaving (what?)
I pledge allegiance to forever breathing

Street niggas with nuts, what? My meat's bigger (what?)
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a deathwish, thinking I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace

For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil (what?)
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through em, put the heat to em
Be careful you might get what you ask for

Yo if it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
Yo
I'm just fucking with you, cause I got nothing to do

If it wasn't for your whip, I'd have nothing to strip
If it wasn't for a wrist, I'd have nothing to slit
If it wasn't for the shrooms, I'd have nothing to chew
Yo
I'm just fucking with you, cause I got nothing to do

I'll shit on you, da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you, da da, da da, da da
I'll shit on you, da da, da da, da da

I'll shit on you! I will shit on you
I'll shit on you! Girl you know, its true
I'll shit on you! Bitch or man, its true
I'll shit on you! I will shit on you

I remain fatter than gluttony
Tapin' bombs to the back of record companies
Blow 'em up if they ain't want me
The national guard, they scared to hunt me
I love beef, I got you hoes duckin' me
A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs with keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggas in hundred degree saunas
You can act a fool if ya wanna (biatch!)
It's this lyrical piranha
Strapped wit a grenade, in the pool with ya mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nothin' up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem
When I see 'em, you hoes endin' up in a fuckin' mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold BM
Pull in the garage while you screamin'
Keep the motor on then I'm leavin' (I'll shit on you!)
I'll shit on you!

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!

Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you!

I'm a alcoholic, with the fuckin' toilet
Pass the hot dogs (Bizarre aren't you Islamic?)
Bitch shut your fuckin' mouth
I'm a keep eatin' 'til Richard Simmons comes to my house
With a chain saw to cut me out (me out, me out!)
I'll fuck your wife, I had sex since I met her
Too busy fuckin' wit (your twelve year old) baby sitter (ha ha ha)
And all women ain't shit, only good for cookin', cleanin'
And sucking dick and that's it (I said it)
I was responsible for killin' John Candy
Got Jon Benet Ramsey in my '98 Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody; truly yours the idiotic Bizarre

My adolescent years weren't shit 'til what I do now
I never grew up I was born grown, and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
The more ignorant, the incident is, I fit in
Ignorin' the shit how borin' it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwin' a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
Its they who rapped me and say they can take me
Its they who legs I brake and make achy
Its they who mistake me and make me so angry
(I'll shit on you!) I'll spit on you
Start pissin' and do the opposite on you
You weren't listenin', I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spillin' my guts like chicken cordon blew and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album
Pull my pants downward

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you!

Is Richard Pryor still alive?
If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dyin' (what?)
Born brainless, this steel ain't stainless
Your bloodstains are all over this steel god dang-it
Bitch bring it, these niggas that I hang with
I hang you up naked by your ankles danglin' (ow, ow)
My need I stay stranglin, I don't need your help
If you gon' give me the pussy
I'll un-loosen my belt (I'll shit on you!)
I'm what your daddy's not, your mom's kinda cock
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your teck, I'll beat you wit it across your chest

Yo it's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat ya peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in choke holds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
(hey, hey, hey!) I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
That's like D-Bo fightin' Peablo Bryson (I'll shit on you)
So what you hollerin' and yellin' about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fuckin' skeleton out
Niggas get hit wit a two piece; bling bling
Wit a poisonous sting, I'm such a violent thing

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you!
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you!
Fuck your wife, fuck your kids, fuck your family
I'll shit on you!

Once I get on two, hits of X
My disk slips and disconnects
'til I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
(C'mon, I'll shit on you!) Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
And spilling liters of blood like swimmin' pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too (*bullets spray*}
A lot of people say misogynistic which is true
I don't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy, girl, dog, woman, man, child (I'll shit on you!)

I will shit on you I don't care who you are
I'll shit on you
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll shit on you
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll shit on you
I will fuck you wife if you fuck with me
I'll shit on you

You heard me
Bitch, I'll shit on you
D-12 will shit on you
I'll shit on you

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No

Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product

Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth

All the horror, all the tragedy

Suburban and city niggaz hustle together
Long as it's money envolved, niggaz'll tussle together
Long as the hustle's a hustle, the green is green
White is white, nigga we buyin if the price is right

So (*scratch*) drop the mics
Everything's on cock, from the shots to the dice
We are not into hype
You can't say we can't work

Either we some plant workers or we some niggaz that plant work

You can just ask any one of ya niggaz that visit about it

And she'll keep a sugar daddy that'll buy her some shit, come on!

Eminem,"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, you feel weak
And when you feel weak you feel like you want to just give up

But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you want to just fall flat on your face and collapse

'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
'Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them
Women are caught in webs spin and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin is just not real enough
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics that shock, is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up
You Bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse

Music is like magic there's a certain feeling you get
When you're real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment and every single minute you spittin'
Trying to hold onto it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in;
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse

Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? Enough to not go against me, smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers'
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse

'Til the roof comes off, till the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out and my high perhaps
I'm a rip this shit till my bone collapse

Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from underneath me (Underneath me, I)

I will not fall
I will stand tall

You 'bout to witness hip hop in its
Most purest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges (boom sound)
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Yeah, here I come
I'm inches away from you, here, fear none
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so

So, skip to ya Lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it was 'til everyone knows the shit
The most hated on outta all those who say they get hated
On eighties songs
Exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up

Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans

It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You already who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center eight zero zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blink get me bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely
Ease ova these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, B-E-T and M-T-V
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains
Nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here

Can I get a hell yeah?

Eminem,"Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma?
I'mma make you look so ridiculous now

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes, but I'm only human
But I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'da killed him, shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to ""The Eminem Show""

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight
I'm cleaning out my closet

Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?
But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral!
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

I'm sorry momma!
I never meant to hurt you!
I never meant to make you cry, but tonight

I had a bag of the skunk, one and last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis
Denise from the cleaners
Fucked me good, you should of seen us
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable
French role stylin', body like a Stallion
Sizin' up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigga
Debatin' on to fuck, or do I wanna be a nigga
Caressin' this bitch, plus I'm checkin' out them tits
Sippin' on that fine shit
I ain't use to buyin'
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like takin' ho's money, but that's anutha story
For surely ya pussy on toast, after we toast
her clothes fell like Bishop and Juice
The womb beata', clean pussy eata, insertin' my jock
In that spot hotta' than the hottest block, don't stop!
Response I got when I was knockin' it
Clocks steadin' tickin', kinky finga lickin'
Then carryin on, semin's at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga, like a slave owna'
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foamin' at them lips, the ones between the hips
Pubic hair's lookin' like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighta' than conditions of us black folks
we in the final stretch, the last part of sex
I bust a fat ass nut, then I woke up next
Like, what the fuck is goin' on here?

Someone betta' get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw 'er
Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
But what's she shovin' me for? Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
Man I'm this close to goin' toe to toe with this whore
What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce
She's havin' another baby of the month and it's yours
And you found it isn't 'cause this bitch has been visitin'
Someone else and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips
When you get back to Michigan
Now the plot has thickend 'n worse
'Cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
So your paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it
Then the doctor comes out lookin' like Dennis the Menace ha ha ha ha
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's AIDS
He ain't even gotta call in you his office to say it
So you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho
And when you see 'er, you're gonna bend 'er fuckin' neck back yo
'Cause you love 'er, you neva' would've expect that blow
Obie told you to scoop, how could she stoop that low?

I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cause I'm happy

Yeah, I'm happy
Ha Ha
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

Some days I sit, starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (Oh no)

Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, 'cuz they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't phase me
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (oh no)

Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got 'er
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't abort
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug-addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' ma soul
And just know that I grow cold of the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harda to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look
I love my daughter more than life n' itself

But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin', 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I should of seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Would of ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's her soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

Woo!
I told you I can't sing
Oh well, I tried
Hailie, remember when I said

If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?
Well guess what, daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere baby
I love you",Hailie's Song,2002

Fuckin', turn the car off dog

Alright 

Alright we wait 

We wait for what? 

We wait until she comes out and then I'm gonna fuckin' kill her 

Man you ain't gonna kill no one. What the fuck did you bring that for? 

Man shut the fuck up dog
Just shut up. Fuckin' clip is empty

Yo, who she walking with 

How the fuck am I suppose to know, you told me to duck down 

Its the fucking bouncer
Did she just kiss him 

I don't think so

Okay then!
Everybody listen up!
I'm goin' to hell!
Who's comin' with me?
Somebody please help him!
I think my dad's gone crazy

There's no mountain I can't climb, there's no tower too high
No plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you,
To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?
Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls, I cut'em off
And got'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar inside of a hall
With my framed autographed sunglasses with Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off
All this time me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off (Suck it, Marshall)
So tell Laura and her husband to back off
Before I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one at these Russians and that's all
Blow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
Hailie, tell 'em baby
My Dad's Lost It!

There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it

I think my dad's gone crazy
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy

It's like my mother always told me and codeine and
Goddammit you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
Uh, fuck that shit bitch eat a motherfuckin' dick
Chew on a prick and lick
A million mutherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a mutherfuckin' Gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy lips glued to my face
With a clit ring in my nose then quit bringin' my flows
Quit givin' me my ammo. Can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go, eenee, meenee, meini, mo

My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise at the same time
Can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
See what you're seein' is a genius at work, which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first
'Cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time
I sung like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump and Grind"" comes on
More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave
Screamin' at the sky, 'til clouds gather, it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it, the parents are pissed but the kids love it
Nine millimeter heater stashed in two seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

I thought I had it all figured out I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself planted on my knees in cuffs
Which should of been a reason enough for me to get my stuff and just leave
How come I couldn't just see this shit myself its me
Nobody could of seen this shit I felt
Knowing damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me the minute she was seen she just bailed
I'm standing and swingin' on like 30 people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin' a heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, tryna get my feet on solid ground

And nothing in this world is too much
I swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would
And hit it for good and say good bye to Hollywood
I probably should 'cause these problems are piled all at once
'Cause everything that bothers me I got all bottled up
I think I'm bottoming out but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank god I got a little girl
Now I'm a responsible father so not a lot of good
I'd be to my daughter laying in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood 'cause I don't know how to do it
All I know is that I don't want her following in the footsteps
Of my dad 'cause I hate him so bad
Worst feeling I had was growing up to be like his fucking ass
Man if you could understand why I am the way that I am

Publicity my ass, consume my fucking dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done ill never look at gats
If I scrap, I'm a scrap it like I never whooped some ass
I love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact
That I sacrificed everything I had
I never dreamed I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more then I ever could of asked
Everywhere I go I had a sweater, hood or mask
What about math? how come I wasn't never good at that
Its like the boy in a bubble who never could adapt I'm trapped
If I could go back, I never would of rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, ill never get it back
I just want to leave this game with level head intact
Imagine going from being no one and seein' everything blow up
And all you did was grow up M-Cin'

I've forced us to live alienated, so I'm saying

Eminem,"So I'm out the game, huh?
Yo, Dre, we ridin'?
Whatever
Haha, well, I'm with you, homie
Okay, let's handle the small shit

I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, went through too much
Knew too much shit, corrupt
And I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to Earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep going
First take I make, mistakes, just keep it
No punches pulled, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit

Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age
(But what about Jermaine?) Fuck Jermaine!
He don't belong speaking mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think I don't read your little interviews
And see what you're sayin'
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me with a bunch of little mini-yous
Running around your backyard swimming pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with ten- or eleven-year-olds

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it

Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss from a Dixie cup
If you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in
Or have you blackballed
And make sure you never rap a-fucking-gain
Dre ain't having it, long as I'm here to play devil's advocate
If there was some magic shit I could wave over the industry
That could save it when I'm gone and buried
To make sure the tradition carries on, I would
If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn't, not even if I could
From the hood, and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered
And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fucking head off
'Cause I know if they get up
I won't get a chance to let off another punch
I'm punk rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck, white-Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mil'
Or grow up to be Attilla, go nuts and be a killer
And I'm something of a phenom, one puff of the chron'
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us (c'mon!)

Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it

Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars and Alizé, partying all day
But I handled my business, 'cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sending it your way
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
'Cause this is my space, you invade it
Live to regret it, and you'll die trying to violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated

Huh, like my old lady
'Cause what you say is what you say
Sometimes what you mean is two different things
Depending on your mood if it swings
Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed
I can do anything, catch a contact and I'm gone
And I'm back, I speed write
And my loose leaf's my launchpad
And I can pull any string, don't have to prove anything
Catch a contract on your head
You headed West, talk shit about Dre
You better get a vest and invest
In something to protect your head and neck
And it's back and forth all day, like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth
But a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend I'ma die a sudden death
Five mics in The Source? Ain't holding my fucking breath
But I'll suffocate for the respect
'Fore I breathe to collect a fucking check

'Cause what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
Just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
So who you playing with, huh?

Eminem,"These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do rags and a stocking cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, this house is a broken home
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go

Entertainment is changing, intertwining' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
But everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get their hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon
Any dispute, won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids been listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judges daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense b
It's all political, if my music is literal then I'm a criminal
How the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do, is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one, 'cus they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting ourselves
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it, how we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
'Til they sit and they cry at night, wishing they die
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
We're nothing to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes
That's why we seize the moment, and try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs
And we can

Eminem,"I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just want to see if it's true
If it's you, what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel, as part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
In confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it. If you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
Pull it, squeeze it 'til it's empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or crumble

I'll violate and all the motherfucking bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do, bitch, it's news
Pistol whippin' motherfucking bouncer 6'2""
Who needs bullets, soon as I pull it you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches coming out their halter tops
Running and ducking out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot whether its your fault or not, 'cause

I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talking to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped in two inch
So ticky-tock, listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on the cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at 30
And Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me, 
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity

Superman ain't savin' shit, girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase

Never know what kind of car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partying then
You don't want that
Neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride
Between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
Never loved you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

Love that tattoo, what's that say?
Rot in pieces' aw that's great
First off you don't know Marshall
At all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave hand prints all across you
Good lordy-wody you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two back hands

Eminem,"Music, reality, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Psych!
If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow or show love
Or would it matter
Can never be the lead-off batter of things
Shit for me to feed off
I'm see-saw battling
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
And I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for? A joke? You smoking crack?
Before I do that, I beg Mariah to take me back
I get up 'for I get down, run myself in the ground
'For I put some wack shit out
I'm trying-a smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
You all steady trying to drown the shark
Ain't gonna do nothing but piss me off
Lid to the can of whoop ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull the piece out,
Fuck shooting I'm just trying to knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap, motherfucker if you're really feeling froggish, leap
Yo slim, you're gonna let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him 'scape with that
Man I hate this crap, this ain't rap,
This is crazy the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops
There ain't no getting rid of McVeigh
If so you would've tried
The only way I'm leaving this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessey,
Got drunk then I finished he
I'm every niggas favorite arch-enemy.
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently

I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up
Mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
I murder you
Danger had me turned into a mad man, son of Sam, bitch, I'm surgical
I'll allergic to dying, you think not? You got balls? We can see how large
When the music stops
I was happy having a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy but
It only made my pain worst,
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg
When you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with they hands out
Checking for your record when its selling
When it ain't, that's the end, no laughs
No friends no girl
Just the gin you drink till your car spin, you think
Damn!

You slam into the wall and you fall
Out the car, trying to crawl with one arm
About to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder if they would even call when the music stops
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up looking for you
With a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil
I'm revved up, who said what would lead bust your head would just explode
With red stuff I'm hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon
Braggin about how you shot it like a coward, bullets devour you showered you
Niggas, if I was you niggas, I'll run while given the chance
Understand I can enchance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me, just the thought of dying alone that really
Irks me, you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop trying to walk how g's walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we plan tug-o-war with your life, fuck the tour and the mic
I'll rather fuck a whore with a knife, deliver that shit the coroner's like
You high hype poppin' shit in broad day light nigga your a gonna at night

When the music stops
Instigators, turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors wrist to razors
You all don't want war, you want talk
In the dark my dogs all bark like woof
Proof nigga I'm a wolf, get your whole roof
Caved in like reindeer hoofs
Stomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose
The more you all breach, the more I moves
This hill street, this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap checking all our jewels (nigga)
Or make the news betcha all you all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop
Music's changed my life in so many ways
Brains confused and fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
N-W-A said fuck the police

Now I'm in jail
93 was strictly R&B
Fucked up hair cut
Listen to Jodeci
Michael Jackson, who gonna tell me I ain't Mike
Ass cheeks painted white
Fucking Priscella at night
Flying down sunset smoking crack
Transvestite in the front
Eddi Murphy in the back
M-O-P had me grimey and griddy
Marilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue
And grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bow's
Now I'm in the hospital
Broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm going in shock
I'm reaching for the glock but the music stops",When the Music Stops,2002
Eminem,"I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touch, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction
Just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who woulda thought
Standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide
Reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on

If I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I can rap so fuck school
I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic
Show me where the fuckin' studios at
When I was underground
No one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me
Almost gave up, I was like ""Fuck it""
Until I met Dre
The only one who looked past
Gave me a chance
And I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top
Every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
Like damn we just swapped
Sittin' back look at this shit wow
I'm like ""My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?""

Whose mom's probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much muthafuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube right into ya livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped
When they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took
And they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected wit' me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' wit' a fine toothed comb
It's like this rope waitin' to choke
Tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like
""I dont like this, no!""
All I hear is
Lyrics lyrics constant controversy
Sponsors workin' round the clock
To try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip hop is never a problem
In Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered ya fathers
Of daughters startin' to blossom
Now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists
When they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch and say fagot

I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms. Cheney
Fuck you tipper Gore
Fuck you with the free-ness of speech this
Divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have

But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly (hey!)
And use it to get myself wealthy

So let me just revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me
Well I'm back, nana-na na na nana-na na na kshh
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in endin' up
Under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
""Testing attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A-tiskit a-taskit,
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit and that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie
You thirty six year old bald headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let it go its over
Nobody listens to Techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes this shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
Hey, there's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It will be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said, this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy

To make 'em believe I'm crazy so they can relate to me
And maybe believe in Shady so they can be evil baby
I like that! I'm only as crazy as people made me
Believe me, there'll be just as many muthaf***in' murderers
And heroin users without Marlilyn's music
But I figure I make my music I don't care if you use it
To murder somebody, I just want to be there when you do it!
Now the parents are suein' 'cause little Darren is screwin'

Does it make you mad when I switch my flow
You can't understand how I get my dough

[Eminem]
Here we go now 
Everybodies in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
Ain't trying to use nobody as a steppin' stone

But don't compare me I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what what up keep steppin' and just rep D12

Keep my nose clean stay away from weapons jail
And livin' wreckless, but if you would check my belt
You may see soemthing else I use to protect myself
A vest to stop a ruger and deflect the shells and

Send em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more I don't got to
Got under cover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people crossed the line

But this motherfucker Ja mustve lost his mind
That X has got him thinkin' that he was DMX 
Then he switched to Pac now his tryin' to be him next
So which one are you X Luther Pac or Michael ?

Just keep singing the same song recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and hailey dance to your songs we like you
And you don't really want to step inside on my group

Come on now you know the white boy will bite you
I'll hurt your pride dog and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to 
With syllable after syllable ill just slap ya

Killin' you faster 
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of
That shit you on but if you want it you got it 
You'd bump this shit too if we didn't diss you on it

But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants ta
So what's the deal where was all of the tough talk
When I walked up to ya like Ja what up dog

How come you didn't say you had a problem then
When you was standin' there with all you men
We could've solved it then I'm a grown man dogg come holla
All you did was slap hands smile and swallow

Another one of them lil x pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you want to be (Cmon)

[Chorus: x2]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You can talk I'm still the m.c
You don't want to bump heads with me

You couldn't slug me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot my bars would melt you
Ja, you... stuart little, shells will lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol

I clap at yo ass with this chrome 38
And put 6 through yo hat so seven in 3 eights (?)
Erv you ain't shug knight you shook light
I put my knife in ya wind pipe

Then freeze on this turn pike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got rolled two times so your ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with segal

Yo fuck that I'm tired of these -

I'm gone find you whereabouts [unknown]

I'm on the block where you was raised [unknown]

You probably forgot your way around the hood, good
Least when your paranoid its hard to make a song

How you want it with us and laugh [unknown] got make up on

Baby I'm feeling the feelings you giving, I'm feelin your style
And I'm willing to let my guard down to figure you out
I'm picturing your figure in a swimsuit wiling
Somewhere in the Caribbean Islands
Cause the vibe you giving me now
Feels like I'm an innocent child
Sinning is never tempting when other women's around
Hands down, this is my vow
I never heard a moan sound so profound
When a nigga's digging you out, phone rings
You cuss them motherfuckers out, quit calling the house!
If I call, you're in route
There's a drought, you look out
I'm on edge, you put the palm of your hand on my head and squeeze
Please believe I ain't scared of commitment
Fuck head from them bitches!
When you could do the same, but that respect is given
Our intimacy is significantly different

[Chorus - Eminem (Obie Trice)]
You gon ride for me (you gon ride?)
Then I'm gon ride for you (I'm gon ride)
If you put your mouth on me (put it on me)
I'm a put my mouth on you
Together there ain't nothing we can't do (there's nothing)
Any problem we can see it through (we see it through)
Baby if you promise to be true (you promise?)
I will never put my hands on you
Come on and think about it

[Verse - Obie Trice]
We ain't even got to talk when we see each other
We got it all chalked out when we see each other under them covers
You my lover, I'm your friend, I'm your man, but I'm sayin
Who needs a label, we roll hand in hand
Visions of you having my little man
We joke, you call me George Foreman
Cause I'm namin him O number four, me I'm three
Plus the ol' G like the personality, she say it's meant to be
I'm in the bathroom when you pee
She in the bathroom too when a nigga doo doo, you my boo boo
There's nothing in this world that a nigga wouldn't do to
Satisfy - this my bitch that ride
My bitch wit the pistol in the ride
A nigga act up she busting, she ain't got to decide
No discussion, she'll put a slug in a tough niggaz muffin
You're fucking wit her husband

[Chorus]

[Verse - Obie Trice]
Come on and think about it
You got a ring about it
Nothing could ever come between or intervene our bondage
Drama we overcome it if we out numbered
I promise it'll be us against a hundred
Rushing to your side when you vomit eating pickles and peanutbutter
Eight months later Obie rubbing your stomach
Paying homage to your momma for raising a girl proper
Enough to call O her Baby Father
You ain't gotta bother bout a deal, I swear I keep it real
Raise young O trill and cook a decent meal
It's signed and sealed, you the only female
Hail, my one and only pal come to get me outta jail
Post bail and post up for sale
I swore, I swear we will always live well
Long as I got my bombshell from the hood to the hills
Who's gon stop up? nobody! we's that deal

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Eminem (Obie Trice)]
If you gon stand by me (if you gon stand by me)
Then I'm gon stand by you (then I'm gon stand by you)
If you promise you'll be true
Then I'll never put my hands on you (hands down)
But! don't you play me for no fool (no fool) bitch!
Cause if I put my mouth on you (on you)
After you put your mouth on someone else
Better find someone else new
Come on and think about it

Can, can you shit on me?
I just want you to shit on me

Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby
I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend
If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fuckin' for real
I'll make you suffer like I suffered
If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love

Baby, I'm extra large in magnitude
And Magnum's the lubrication that I use
To chose which hole on a hoe I abuse
Have 'em confused, can't tell who is who

When I fuck the shit out you, then the next day
I rush the shit out you off my two-way
You wanna cuddle, emotional hustle up on Pocono's
Poke ya nose in and outta Obie's own

No, I'm in and out your home
And this in and out your tone
I ain't the nigga that settles 'em down
Put 'em in nice homes and floss 'em around

I bounce 'em around, camcord the sex and sell 'em around town
Now how that sound?
If I was in love witcha, now you wanna clown
Fuck with them clowns until I pound on your crown

Bust a few rounds and the cops come and get me
Bad mouth a nigga just to convince a jury
You don't want it with me, you just horny as me
You want a nut, nuttin' but what is you be

I'm internationally known baby but actually
There are few people who know how I am naturally
All you know is that I can act irrationally
When you shove a puppet up in my face on national TV

So they label me this crazed loony rap bully
But truthfully that ain't the truth
And if you believe in that shit then you'll believe anything's true
And you're too stupid to ever get to know me personally

But personally that actually works for me
'Cause the last thing that I need's a string attached to me
I'm a bachelor bitch and I ain't in no fast fury
To run out and find a new Mrs. Mathers

'Cause see, technically me and Kim ain't back fully
But we do still make booty calls occasionally
But be damned if I end up back in that pattern
And we end up back at that God damn tavern

And havin' another déjà vu, we seein' security
Pass my pussy around like it's Ja Rule's jewelry
I got news for you bitch, your new curfew's early
You ain't home by 2:30

Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby
I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend
If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions
I'll kill you, bitch I'm fuckin' for real
I'll make you suffer like I suffered
If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love

See you lookin' at the life, you lookin' at the lights
You lookin' at the ice, you ain't lookin' at the Trice
You should look at some advice when I see he ain't nice
Despite the fact you think you the feisty type

Oh, love to fight, I love the drama
Love when my bitch get to cussin' out Yolanda
Find the Obie condom on the counter
Swingin' her weave, can't breathe like I can't believe

Least I ain't deceive and try to mislead
And sell a dream just to get you on my team
I came clean to keep down the beef
Keep down my reach, you can keep all your teeth

So what we do under the covers should stay between the covers
And the two of us and we ain't gotta be news coverage
On the front page cover of ""Buzz's New Lovers""
And this is when the bitch get to showin' the true colors

'Cause the truth of it, everything that I do's public
And you'd love it if you could run and tell all your friends
Guess who you just screwed, assume it's me and you've done it
And save da used rubber to show 'em the proof of it

But I guess it's do unto others as you'd have 'em do unto you
But you better be careful of who you're doin' it to
'Cause you never know when the shoe
Could end up on the other foot and it backfires on you

'Cause you may think you want it then you want me, then you get me
Then you got me and you're fucked, 'cause you'll be stuck with me
For the rest of your life 'cause if I get attached to you
We'll be joined at the hip, I'll be so latched to you

You'll be walkin' out the house and I'll run up and tackle you
Chain your ass up to the bed and shackle you
You don't think you're leavin' this house in that, do you?
Not till I brand my name in your ass and tattoo you

Have you walkin' out this bitch in turtleneck sweaters
Scarves and full leathers in 90 degree weather
Front on me? Never
'Cause we gonna be together forever
Right bitch? Right bitch?

Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby
I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend

I'll kill you, bitch I'm fuckin' for real
I'll make you suffer like I suffered

I wouldn't trade it for the world
Only let's me know that I'm loved
By so many other motherfuckers that ain't you
And as long, as you keep fuckin with us, we keep fuckin you up
And keep pullin the rug from up under you
And what's ever more fucked up, is we enjoy what were doin

You will ask youself, how come your mans
Didn't enter that last round that he had in Curtis Jackson's ass while he had the chance
You keep askin us to keep it on wax but we can't
This is past any irrationalization
We have captured national media attention
Conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension start buildin
Soon as we enter the '106th & Park' building
Someone's gonna get killed and I swear to God
If someone so much as even touches one of my people
I'll put a million on his head
And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
But I'd rather rap than get into this gangsta shit
And it ain't because I'm a bitch
It's because I ain't a bitch, I don't endanger people that I'm with
I'm a general, I ain't Bush, I don't send my soldiers to war
I'm right there in the middle of the shit with 'em, so when I do get 'em
Orders to storm your headquarters, you'll be fuckin with a ..

Approach us, throw heat straight from the soldiers (c'mon, [gunshot])
We the soldiers, ya'll the youngsters (ha)
Youngsters lungs puncture, dead in a dumpster [gunshot]
Upstairs the Munsters, hand full of drama
You scared of the drama, bomber the monster [gun cocks, boof]

Eminem,"Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth, I don't care
But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day (Obie Trice go!)

Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna look
Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and
Let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn niggaz' moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggaz' vibes
Everybody running for their motherfucking lives
Tough club niggaz, we leave early, cock back surely
Open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z
Ho's in animal skirts get mirked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard
Trust in ""God""? It's 'cause you're about to catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from, who you be with
Keep this a secret, right by the nuts
A 4-5 that'll light niggaz up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck

Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth, I don't care
But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day (Obie Trice go!)

But as long as I'm here, I'm gonna grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty will make your ass bet on words
Touch niggaz in jail make them wanna finish their last set
They say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun
If that's the case, then get a bigger one
You don't think I'm packed to pump cause I'm out of the hood
That's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump
I'm in a white mink, the fabric is done
Cop rings like Mike, Larry, Magic and them
Out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm the clouds, you don't see me in the train
I travel first class, you ain't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name, cause I ain't going back and forth
Your boss and your captain's soft (Bitch)

Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth, I don't care
But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day (Obie Trice go!)

We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? you gon' get it
Name 'em we gon' hit em, chew em up and spit em out
HRRK-PTT
Too much venom, and if you roll with 'em
We gonna fuck you up with 'em
I got too much momentum moving in my direction to lose
My shoes will explode, soon as you go to step in 'em (BOOM)
You know how we do it, when we do, how we do it, when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie, we all move like assassins
Ski masks and gloves Consider this as a warning
Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
But we are fizast, fuck your little bitch ass up
We are not killers my vato will have you shot though
Drag through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osario
Little sorry hoe ass, go ask be Real
We burn source covers like fuckin' Cypress Hill
Did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still
Shady Records, ""you better believe the hype is real""
This is no joke, I don't smoke
But I toke enough second hand to make my fuckin ""P.O."" choke
I'm an OG you fuckin with a GI Joe
Bia Bia, mia meo a Vida loco
I'm a psycho, Mariah ain't got shit on me
When I retire I'll be spitting baby food on people
At San Ysidro Ranch, huddled up next to her
With Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
You ever had your cap peeled back, or your shit pushed in?
I put my blade in you like a fucking pin cushion
Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and indo
I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
Nobody told you that I'm loco, esse?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm Slim Sha ""D"" in the ""Dy"" is for ""deez nuts""
And you can get each one for free so feast up
I pee in a cup for three months I'm having an E party for Easter, please come squeeze guns

We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? you gon' get it
You name 'em, we gon' hit em, chew 'em up and spit em out
Too much venom and if you role with 'em
We gonna fuck you up with 'em
You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a 12 gauge Mossberg to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear God cause I bring death
Silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest around you know how I get down
I watch gangster flicks and root for the bad guy
And turn it off before the end cause the bad guy die
If you trying to buy guns, I'm the nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new
You can raise your voice like you fiendin' to touch something
When I raise my knife, shit, I'm fiendin' to cut something
See I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie
If the bitch think I love her, then the bitch don't know me
(50 Cent Ha-ha, Sorry Kim, ha-ha)
(Eminem oh, sorry oh)

Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth, I don't care
But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to

Babe uh, yeah!
Girl, you my only one though aight, haha
You my baby, fuck all that shit
You're the one for me
Check it out.

[Verse - Obie Trice]
Baby I'm feeling the feelings you giving, I'm feelin your style
And I'm willing to let my guard down to figure you out
I'm picturing your figure in a swimsuit wiling
Somewhere in the Caribbean Islands
Cause the vibe you giving me now
Feels like I'm an innocent child
Sinning is never tempting when other women's around
Hands down, this is my vow
I never heard a moan sound so profound
When a nigga's digging you out, phone rings
You cuss them motherfuckers out, quit calling the house!
If I call, you're in route
There's a drought, you look out
I'm on edge, you put the palm of your hand on my head and squeeze
Please believe I ain't scared of commitment
Fuck head from them bitches!
When you could do the same, but that respect is given
Our intimacy is significantly different

[Chorus - Eminem (Obie Trice)]
You gon ride for me (you gon ride?)
Then I'm gon ride for you (I'm gon ride)
If you put your mouth on me (put it on me)
I'm a put my mouth on you
Together there ain't nothing we can't do (there's nothing)
Any problem we can see it through (we see it through)
Baby if you promise to be true (you promise?)
I will never put my hands on you
Come on and think about it

[Verse - Obie Trice]
We ain't even got to talk when we see each other
We got it all chalked out when we see each other under them covers
You my lover, I'm your friend, I'm your man, but I'm sayin
Who needs a label, we roll hand in hand
Visions of you having my little man
We joke, you call me George Foreman
Cause I'm namin him O number four, me I'm three
Plus the ol' G like the personality, she say it's meant to be
I'm in the bathroom when you pee
She in the bathroom too when a nigga doo doo, you my boo boo
There's nothing in this world that a nigga wouldn't do to
Satisfy - this my bitch that ride
My bitch wit the pistol in the ride
A nigga act up she busting, she ain't got to decide
No discussion, she'll put a slug in a tough niggaz muffin
You're fucking wit her husband

[Chorus]

[Verse - Obie Trice]
Come on and think about it
You got a ring about it
Nothing could ever come between or intervene our bondage
Drama we overcome it if we out numbered
I promise it'll be us against a hundred
Rushing to your side when you vomit eating pickles and peanutbutter
Eight months later Obie rubbing your stomach
Paying homage to your momma for raising a girl proper
Enough to call O her Baby Father
You ain't gotta bother bout a deal, I swear I keep it real
Raise young O trill and cook a decent meal
It's signed and sealed, you the only female
Hail, my one and only pal come to get me outta jail
Post bail and post up for sale
I swore, I swear we will always live well
Long as I got my bombshell from the hood to the hills
Who's gon stop up? nobody! we's that deal

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Eminem (Obie Trice)]
If you gon stand by me (if you gon stand by me)
Then I'm gon stand by you (then I'm gon stand by you)
If you promise you'll be true
Then I'll never put my hands on you (hands down)
But! don't you play me for no fool (no fool) bitch!
Cause if I put my mouth on you (on you)
After you put your mouth on someone else
Better find someone else new
Come on and think about it

Ain't gonna breathe, til I see, what I wanna see
And what I wanna see, is you go to sleep, in the dirt
Permanently, you just being hurt, this ain't gonna work
For me, it just wouldn't be, sufficient enough
'cause we, are just gonna be, enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see, either of us
Coming to terms, where we can agree
There ain't gonna be, no reasoning, speakin wit me
You speak on my seed, then me, no speak-a ingles
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefin, unless
You're gonna agree, to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face to face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me, that you've never seen
And you're gonna see, this gangster beat on himself
I see you D-12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seeing you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you gon know me
When I'm this close, to see you exposed as phony
Come on, bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me, just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all of you, Ja, you'll get it too!

On purpose, to hurt your focus, you'se not MC's, you'se worthless
You'se not them G's, you'se a circus, you'se no appeal, please
You'se curtains, you use words, cool heard, slurred in two thousand third
You'se purpin, you'se no threat, who's ya servin?
When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseeing the Earth
Shady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold, I become a curse
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse is he who
Depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You'se not the streets, you'se the desk
Use not your chest nigga, use a vest
Before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the debt

Now go to sleep bitch!
Die, motherfucker, die! Ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch! (what?)
Why are you still alive? How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes?

I'ma stay blazin New York wit the heat

Peep how I'm moving, peep where I'm going
Shit don't seep, then sleep not knowin
But I'ma keep growing, getting larger than life
Easy-going with the same one that started the fight
He be knowing how dog get, when dog gon bite
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
Grand champ, and my Blood Line is tight
'cause it's all good, it's all right

Now they gots to swallow, everything in the sac

It's something you want, 745 chrome spinners

20 years of watching my mama's tears got my heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number under
My chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder

In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games 'til the shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'mma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'm back down like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you Marshall
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts
A whole other side I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow

I said What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

Niggaz is so gangsta, niggaz is thugs
Niggaz'll spend their whole life peddlin drugs
Slanging dope in hopes of one day bein able
To own their own label and give the game up
Some niggaz came up, some just didn't
That's just the way it is, if it ain't meant it, it just isn't
Some niggaz'll get money and pay niggaz to back em
So they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough
And that's as backwards, 'cause them niggaz just gone keep coming back
And that's when extortion happens
You struggle to get free, I know how this shit be
You deal with anything to live legitimately
But you gone find if you do get in this industry
It's best to be business with me than against me
Niggaz get behind mics and ain't even MC's
Niggaz get on MTV just to diss me
This shit don't even piss me off
I'm laughin' all the way to the bank
Watchin the satellite from a Bentley
You niggaz don't even got a car
You're so far under my radar
I don't even know who the fuck you are
To tell you to suck my dick while I'm pissin
I don't even listen to your shit to know who the fuck I'm dissin
The media just feeds into these feuds
Tryin to add fuel to the fire. This little nigga, Ja Rule
Talking bout he's gonna slap me. Nigga please
You gotta jump and swing up to hit me in the knees
I laugh at these magazines when they interview em
All they doin is making fake threats to us through em
And pussy you're not Pac, I knew em
Pac was a real nigga, you just a fuckin insult to em
It's too bad we had to fallout before he passes
If he could see this shit now, he'd be whoopin your ass
You're talkin to a pioneer who engineered this shit for 19 years
Who you got in your ear? I don't even gotta say it, the fans know
Quit tryin to be tough, nigga, you look like a asshole

What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?

The only peace increased is that which deletes your peeps
'cause niggaz run mouths but they don't run streets
Till that 4 5 will cease the speech

Could've reached the peep, now you're left with a horrible leak
I'm tryin to be as bleak with my speech as possible
Just in case a nigga tryin to throw me an obstacle
Nigga, I'm not boxin you, I'm hospitable
I put you in a hospital, that's how I get at you
Let the doc op on you, he don't rid you?
You back on the streets? I send another hit at you
This is not a hypocritical issue
I will critical condition your tissue
Give a fuck if all ten of them wit you
I throw an extra ten of them missiles
Turn gangstas into gentlemen vicko
And ever since Eminem dissed you
I swear I see the women and bitch in you
All this bickering back and forth over who signs who
Curtis, pull your skirt up, nigga, you got murdered
Now take it like a man and shake it off. Damn
And quit tellin all these magazines your plans
How you gone slap up my mans, you're fictitious
Nigga, we send Stan to come murder your bitches

What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?

Hahahahahaha
Yeah, yeah
Go out behind all the gangstas you want, nigga
Matter fact, go get every gangsta from every hood
In the United States of America to back you, nigga
Ain't nobody rap wit you
You can't see that?
Fell off, nigga
Hahahahahaha

Eminem,"Sometimes I just feel like
Quitting I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life
Sometimes I want to jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Something ain't right
Hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright
Drawing a blank like

Dah, dah, dah. dah
It ain't my fault
Great then I fall
My insides crawl
And I clam up
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I have just been ripped
So I must then get
Off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit
Yo, I'm going the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man
I'm a make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm going
Sorry, momma, I'm grown
I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

Walking these train tracks
Tryin' to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin' to chase rap
Gotta move ASAP
Get a new plan
Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV buries her nose in her pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother and dad
Ain't no telling what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep running from something I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset 'cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like a grew up but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't got a rep, my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man I'm just tryin' to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please, I'm beggin' you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homie wherever you are
Yo, I'm telling you dog I'm bailing this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go

You gotta live it to feel it
You didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is
Why it was and it still is
To be walking this borderline of Detroit's city limits
It's different and it's a certain significance
A certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You'd never seen, heard, smelled or met a real mc
Who's incredible or on the same pedestal as me
But yet still unsigned
Having a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunch line
When it comes crunch time
Where did my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't having to run with this little rabbits but fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet
I'm starting to doubt shit
I'm feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with
I live like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army trying to salvage an outfit
And it's cold
Trying to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battling mode
My defenses are so up
The one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
This city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I just feel like I'm being pulled apart
From each one of my limbs
By each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me want to jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not
What I'm doing, I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to u-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin' on next time I'll meet a new girl
I can not only play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat all I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur
I'm Eight Mile Road

I'm a man
Gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands

Eminem,"These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing, it's so scary in a house that allows
No swearing

To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child
And what bothers him all comes out, when he talks about

His fuckin' dad walkin' out
'Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back

Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him, so he socked him back, and broke his nose
His house is a broken home, there's no control, he just let's his emotions
Go

Entertainment is changin', interwinin' with gangsta's
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me

Yet everybody just feels like they can relate, I guess words are a
Motherfucker they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make

Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass

But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind
Every time you mad

So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off
Of these streets quickly

But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so I'm signin' CD's while
Police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete

It's all political, if my music is literal, and I'm a criminal how the fuck
Can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to, you're full of shit, too, Guerrera
that was a fist that hit you

Sing with me, (sing) sing for the years
sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, (come on)
Sing it with me, just for today, maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you
Away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you, and cock it, too
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued

See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus

But music is reflection of self, we just explain it, and then we get our
Checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it
How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin'

Thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long

Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
'Til they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe

We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold it
'Cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone

Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our
Songs and we can

Haha, wake your mother fuckin arses up
Yo what is the what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleepin on my roof bitch

For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my arse whipped
Cause I'ma have the last lift that ever gets arse squished
I just can't get past these little pissants
That want to be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it
Cause we can and they can't spit (Haawk)
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap and it's a wrap, and it's a scrap an then it isn't rap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my pashion 
Is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin 
Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
Cause I'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it
Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me
You poke a stick at a big boy you get bit be	
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets do fifty!
I'm the beautiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Kieth Murry when he threw a stool and hit a girl acci-dently (argghhh!!)
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?

?? the media pitted me of a beef starter
In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck slugs I'm walkin gloves with a shotgun
Constantly popin slugs they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever ain't conscious
In a house full of dog shit, 
I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathin 
You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
It ain't about what you readin
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins
Either that or we'll be beefin free when 
You ******* need a 'E' just to speak shit!
Your leader is a botique bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
****** I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan
You brave?

Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like 
'What tha fuck did he say in his rap Em?'
I can see that he's just a punk 
I mean these niggas squeeze on me 
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks
Am I empty seein them ?? I emtpy out them ?? to fight you 
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphores I get yours across when I write
So emotions enough to say ""fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!"" 
I might as well give this up like heavy sales
And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt 
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life

[Kon Artis]
I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off'a tha hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith
Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out shootin them G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on movin key's
But every time we hear you kick it 
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back 
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred niggas from runave
So get your gun and if you comin

Eminem,"Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the mornin'
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screamin'
'Cause they seein' destruction before they a see human bein'

So they start smokin' weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
'Cause they all broke an' why do ghetto birds die?
Before we learn to fly, somebody else's child caught in guns

Smokin' weed can all make a change
So I'm told but I haven't seen the change unfold
I keep hopin' please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead

Keep your eyes open now, can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free

Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens, rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the door to open wide, my brothers be wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies

We can only learn to take our anger an' our hate
Control our mental state, settle down an' just set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump our brakes
'For we said it, regret it later an' let it escalate

'Cause by then it's too just late, there's so much we can take
And there's only so much someone can swallow an' tolerate
Up to the point that he just breaks, snaps an' that's all it takes
You'd think that we was learnin' from other rappers mistakes
But we ain't

It's plain to go against, with every artists comes the image
He portrays an' a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger an' this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster
An' I ain't hear no complaints

But I know that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead an' never follow no one else's shadow
There will never be another me an' that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free

To this day the game will never be the same
No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me an' no matter what they do
There will never be another you

You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time
But in your hearts an' your minds, we will never die
We are forever alive an' we continue growin' one day at a time

Don't be caught in the publicity an' caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money an' light
Searchin' for fortune an' fame an' super stardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest

Now the hip hop police, the villains is watchin'
An' kids think beef is they only option
Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories could die but Makaveli lives on

You think the industry is fun an' no pity with guns
An' when your money is up, that's when your enemies come
So if he died an' came back, would he try to save rap?
We needin' a change, the drama remains

I spent my whole life fightin' myself
That I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help
An' every now an' then I take rights from the left
I'm still just like a kid lookin' for stripes on my belt

An' that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray an' hope God take a like to myself
No matter how much, I try stay alive
I'm gonna die mad, still standin' there in love with my pride

My heart frivolous beats, we past that
I'm tryin' to keep some income comin' in an' collect on my ass cap
The rappers in the game ain't changed
An' I finally realized that we not in the same game

The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it
Them 4 5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery an' keep your eyes on the rollers

They do what they gotta do to shackle an' hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
An' we continue growin' one day at a time, damn",One Day at a Time [#],2003

They pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does
From New York down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles
We've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us
It's funny, I guess money does have its advantages
And it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
It's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much
It's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
We just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it
Cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
You fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
That you got no business being in, we ain't even gon be in it
No one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit
And they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it
The noise from clips and rounds be drowned out by the crowd
And you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
Till the club closes, and clears out
And that's when they see you flatened
Nobody saw it happen, all cause your jaws are flapping
And you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping

And it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off

It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor

Some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
Mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious
We living for real and others just making the stories up
Illusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks
If you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done
When you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
Got a hot one, spraying you bitches til there is none
I'm like a rolling stone homie, I got you under my thumb
Silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
We cut you and give you stitches, for envy and all my riches
Your game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit

On this shit you call hip-hop, this function is where did it
When I - put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
My appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
Got you, stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
But you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamour
When you, enter the business you thinking you running shit
You witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit!

While I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments
Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes

I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step, it gets dim
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
If so, heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

[J-Black]
Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church (never)
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
That I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare
With the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
Now if I pray every night (night)
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Nordface
Nickel nine at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?

[Chorus]

[Masta Ace]
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care

But every time I take a step it gets dim, tell me is this hell we're livin in",Hellbound,2004

I am bored!
I came in the diner with skateboarders, and placed orders
Ate hors d'oeuvres, and hit the waiter with plate warmers 
Let you inhale the glock smell, while I'm ripping your wallet off 

And slipping a Molotov in your Cocktail (take that)
Burning your contracts, punch your A&R in the face 
Smash his glasses and turn em to contacts
I'm on some shook shit, if it's missing I took it (whoops!)

Nurse look at this straitjacket, it's crooked!
I go to jail and murder you from a cell
Put a knife in an envelope and have you stabbed in the mail (FedEx)
So how do you describe someone, with a decapitated head 
When the rest of his body's still alive running?

Coming with five gunmen, waiting to do a drive-by
So when you see the black 500 (what?) hide from it
For every hundred MC's rhyming about birds
Only about two-thirds'd really set it without words

Yo you ain't a thug, I can make you bitch up
Pick the fifth up, cock, spit, you would swear it's raining slugs (what?)
I'm the hottest shit in the industry (uh)
I got every thug on the block that get a wind of me defending me

You lack class and respect, get a direct backblast
The Bad and Evil mad rap, I cover the Bad half
You know how a thug in this shit'll end up
Spit a round, lift your chin up, you get hit, ten down and ten up (what?)

I take it if you run your mouth, then you want to get sent up
Heat it up, you be leaking blood and spitting phlegm up
Now we rivals, cause of a small name or title
You stepped, got devoured and left with a flower and bible

Forget a chorus, my metaphors are so complicated 
It takes six minutes to get applause 
And by the time you all catch on, I'm a end your career 
And walk away with the whole floor so you have nothing to fall back on!

I'll throw you off of ten floors
Pull a fucking headache outta my head, and put it in yours (take this)
I'm indoors, waiting for disaster to seep in my skin pores
To go outdoors and do some in-stores

This bitch wanted to blow me, I said, ""It oughta happen
You swallow cum bitch?"" ""No, but I brought a napkin""
Getting skully while I'm autographing
Got my daughter laughing cause I sent her mother whitewater rafting

I'm not a fact, I'm a proven fear
Mr. Rogers blocked up my you-haul screaming
""Wait, wait, wait, you ain't moving here!
Lorena Bobbitt, c'mere, want a souvenir?

I've been high as fuck, since I was a juvi-neer
Juvenile? Same difference, I need some 'caine 
'Cause I ain't sniffed since I woke up the seven slain infants
(Oh my God!) Brain implants and they say there's a slim chance
I won't stay the same cause I traded brains with a chimpanz'

Walking in swamp water with an M-16, out for the blood
Shove a gun in the mouth of a thug
To break braces, you say grace and make faces
I'll display hate and break you in eight places (what?)

Take paces, turn around draw in a standoff
Precise aim, icing my fame, blowing your hand off
Dancing with the Devil leading, I won't die, I'm never leaving (what?)
I pledge allegiance to forever breathing

Street niggas with nuts, what? My meat's bigger (what?)
Fake-ass thugs with toy guns and cheap triggers
With a deathwish, thinking I'm the nigga to mess with
Let the tech lift, direct chest hit, melt your necklace

For instance, you just a henchmen, on tough soil (what?)
A follower never had heart, he just loyal
Thugs is glass doors, I see through em, put the heat to em
Be careful you might get what you ask for

I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee

I will simple plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes free, right back on the streets
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?

You're only twenty four but you're plenty more mature
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still you're crazy, sexy, cool
Chill and you play your position you never step out of line
Even though I stay in your business
You've always kept out of mine
I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye
You ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved
Maybe cause we're crazy in love

Let me go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh
You are the ink to my paper
What my pen is to my my pad
The moral, the very fiber
The whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being
The meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do, and the irony
Is you rely on me as much
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply of gas, the match and igniter
The only way that I'm able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel
I don't need you as much as I really need you
So you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me
You're the air I breathe
I believe if you ever leave me
I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall
You're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem
The Alana to my Hailie
You are the word that I'm lookin for
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up
The beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half
The wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil
You let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much, too much is never enough
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

Crazy on you

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

Get your ass up for the Doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the Doctor, c'mon now!
Here we go, cliffhanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat, get on down
Time's up, game's over, you lose, I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you somethin' that we already had
But once you're gone you don't come back
Too bad, you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
Why I send multi-platinum albums, later three diamond
Worldwide, we on the charts with a bullet, and still climbin'

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side

When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk!
Get it crunk (crunk, crunk, crunk)
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and
Jump (jump, jump, jump)
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you artists censored
I don't gotta promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges
We ain't showin' off, we're just goin' off, popular contentions
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all
Washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin'
Doctor's this, Doctor's that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So D-J take the needle and just drop it on the record, what?
We goin' have this motherfucker hoppin in a second (pump pump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers whom if it
Wasn't for rap to bridge the gap maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages, broke down barriers
Of language and races, just call on the caped crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game that's why we came to

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side

50 Cent, c'mon!

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump, everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
And plenty hunnies involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, every day is just another party from the valleys
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
So never say never cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records, presents the return of
The, The Doc (and Shady) no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that uh

Cause we came here to set this party off right

For I know not what I've done

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet You
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Mama had a baby and its head popped off
(Head popped off)
(Head popped off)
(Head popped off)

Predominately-white, predominately-black, well what about me?
Where does that leave me?
Well I guess that I'm between predominately both of em'
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'm a scream
While I'm projectile vomiting
What do I look like a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding?
What do I look like some kinda idiot?
Wait a minute shit, don't answer that
Why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit
It's such bullshit it's tush mull, bish
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again
Whining about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drowning in
And the dad that he never had,
And how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict
And his ex-wife how they go at it man
I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers
Claims he had it, I can't imagine it
That little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank
And take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it,
Shit if you only knew the half of it?

Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons I never
Had any of this shit planned Mom please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa-Clause why are you not coming this year again
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been So perfect but life ain't a fairy tale
I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this Ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hallie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now do-si-do now curtains up the show must go on now
Ring-around-the-rosie the show's over you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me
This ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I can just turn off-and-on this ain't what I chose to be
So please God give me the strength
To have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

I just never had the chance to ever meet you

Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend

Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor, alright stop
Pajama time
Come here little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap, as in a new case
Of child molestation accusation aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, pappa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise, I done touched on everything,
But little boys
And that's not a stab at Micheal, that's just a metaphor,
I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide, up the center of the dance floor
Like T-P for my bung hole and it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it
Give a little ""poot poot"", it's OK
Oops my C-D just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip,

It's Friday and it's my day, chance to party
All the way to Sunday, maybe till Monday, I dunno what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Crusin' on the freeway feelin' kinda breezy
Get the top down, let my hair blow,
I dunno where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there, someones gonna touch my body
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out, yeah
Now what's your name girl, what's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre aah aah, beer goggles, blind, I'm just trying to unwind, now I'm

It's Tuesday and I'm locked up,
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was running butt naked
Down the street screaming aah aah aah aah aah
Your honor I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said save it boy, we got you on tape
Telling an old lady to ""touch my body""
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real tense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now step back to reality, look it's B.Rabbit, you signed me up to battle?
I'm a grown man chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba

Eminem,"Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier, who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never suppose to show it, my crew ain't suppose to know it
Even if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino, it don't matter
I never drag 'em in battles that I can handle less I absolutely have to
I'm suppose to set an example, I need to be the leader
My crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off I'm suppose to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squashed it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line, you just don't cross it, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
I'm so caught it I almost feel like I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in Hip Hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career with out ever mentioning
And that's just outta respect, for not running my mouth
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, just wasn't my beef, So I did
I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth while he's all over TV
Now I'm talking a man who literally saved my life, like fuck it
I understand, this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down, like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

It used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
Shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it
It's a different ball game, call names and you ain't just rapping
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja' start yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck 'em 50, smash him, mash him, and let him have it
Meanwhile my intentions pulled me in other directions
Some receptionist said the source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks
That I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust of his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it got a grudge against me for nothing but fuck it
That motherfucker can get it too, fuck 'em then
But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line that's willing to die for us
As soon as we give the orders, never to extort us
Strictly to show they support us
Maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show we love 'em back
And to let 'em know how important it is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more then any award is
But I ain't trying to have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I'll let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coping
I'm just willing to be the bigger man
If y'all can quit popping off at the jaws with the knocking
'Cause frankly I'm sick of talking
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause

And to the Republic for which it stands
One nation under God
Indivisible?
It feels so good to be back

I scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel  re-energize and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as I'm a whip someone's ass
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task
And in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft
Slash entrepreneur who has held onto few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career typical manure moving past that

As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong

To the light at the end of the tunnel

Take us right through the doors (c'mon)

Come together lets all form and swamp just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause don't matter the weather
If it rains let it rain, yea the wetter the better
They ain't gonna stop us they can't, we stronger now more than ever
They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, Fuck Bush, until they bring our troops home (c'mon)

Take us right through the doors (c'mon)

Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us
Mosh pits outside the oval office
Someone's tryna tell us something,
Maybe this is god just sayin' we're responsible
For this monster, this coward,
That we have empowered
This is bin Laden, look at his head noddin'
How could we allow something like this without pumping our fists
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice in your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify the times it, and multiply by six

Teen million people, Are equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Queda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an Ak-forty seven, let him go, fight his own war
Let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare, to trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero
Look in his eyes its all lies
The stars and stripes, they've been swiped, washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face, Mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight you know why,
'Cause I told you to fight.

Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed

We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors (c'mon)

And as we proceed,
To Mosh through this desert storm,
In these closing statements, if they should argue
Let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction
That we call our President, for the present
And Mosh for the future of our next generation

People think I'm a little bit crazy 
I get it from all angles, even occasionaly
Doc Drezy'll have to step in every once in a while to save me 
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things 
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think 
A lot of rappers finally wouldn't know how to take me 
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me 
I maybe a little too fast paced and racy 
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times 
'Cause I say so many rhymes, it may seem 
like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing 
And I could give a fuck what category you place me 
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone 
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats 
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z 
For every single die hard fan who embraced me 
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me 
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me 
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me 
In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me 
It only made me what I am today, see 
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me 
You ain't gonna make or break me 
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G 
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening 
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me 
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me 
You had all this time to think about it 
Now don't pussy out and try to wimp out, face me 
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day 
That we finally meet in the same place to see

No matter how many magazines on my nuts 
No matter how many MC's I end up 
Oh, it's never enough 

No matter how many battles I been in and won 
No matter how many magazines on my nuts 
No matter how many MC's I end up  
Oh oh, it's never enough

Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics 
You go say the wrong shit and get your face split 
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it 
My spot my talk, it blaze a direct hit 
Graze it, your peace talk, save it 
Your shit sounds dated, you're overrated 
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you motherfuckers

Listen, I just got call from the label 
And you're probably not gonna be surprised 
But um, Michael Jackson is extremely upset 
About the Just Lose It video
And um, I mean, he's pissed
So, I- I don't know what he's gonna do 
But we gotta talk about how we're gonna handle this
Um, oh yeah, anyway
Somebody told me that, um, they heard a rumor
That you got a new gun
Um, I know it's probably not true
But I just need to talk to you about that
So um, give me a call",Paul [Skit],2004
Eminem,"There I go, thinkin' of you again

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down
And write you a little poem
But off of the dome it would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song, whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head
That I could think of
Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it I'm a start right here and just be brief
About to rattle off some other reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two, ooh
Now I'm sittin' here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim, shit
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfucking thing you ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standin' here cryin' over you, boohoo

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know
You may not think you do but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

I was gonna take the time to sit down
And write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter, that you'd probably just shred up, yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to
A stupid piece of paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle
You're a fuckin' coke-head slut, I hope you fuckin' die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fuckin' guts you fuckin' slut I hope you die, die
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me want to yack, ack
But what else can I do? I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I want to do is puke

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke

You find me offensive? I find you offensive
For finding me offensive
Hence if I should draw the line any fences
If so to what extent if at
Any, should I go? 'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive
Psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this,
Far at other people's expenses
I say your all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship
And it's down right blasphemous
Let's end this shit now cause I won't stand for this
And Christopher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I, had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luther
I killed Superman, I killed super-man
Man how ironic, that I'd be the bad guy
Kryptonite the green chronic

'Cause I ain't got no legs!

Now in the Bible it says
Thou shall not watch two lesbians in bed,
Have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course, it's intercourse
And it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during or after performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such, more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids
In a more derogatory way but
But who's to say, what's fair to say, and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre? (What up?)
I gotta question if I may? (Yeah)
Is it gay to play Putt-Putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)
But, up, I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go in into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because

'Cause I ain't got no legs!
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is,
I forgot my name!
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is,
Rain man

You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whip ass canister
Goddamn it Dre where's the goddamn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, Kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high fived Nick Lachey
Stuck a pen in Jessica's head and walked away
And she flew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can and zoom I
Headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit

'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain, nice to meet you

Eminem,"If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say
For all the fools
Who fell for the first
Girl who comes their way
I been down that road, and now I'm back
Sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up,
Where I started from

I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though, my penis was deep down in your hoe
You should know between us we was like mates
Nothing could intervene us especially no hoes
You was more so the shalon type I chose
To more shows, haunted you nights
I suppose that's how it goes,
With time spent emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire

Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me

I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you re-call I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelery off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'd even knew that, who would of even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them god-damned darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's to hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dudes car parked
And reach up under your seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you haul and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing almost haunting
That taunting ring

Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me

(Yeah right bitch, Spend time with my dick)
In most cases Stats attitude is fuck a bitch
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in public
We suffering because of this
Shorty on some whole 'nother other shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'm gonna trick off rip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix dyin' to commit
Feed you the best of me I should have fed you piss
We started off closer than close,
But who could have predicted to know your triflin' ways
Would of stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I ask myself do I love these hos? Nope!
Em introduced us
Fifty this is Tanya, Tanya this is fifty
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said you had very nice lips
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like a opportunist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Says she's an inspiring actress she do videos for practice
Yeah, Yeah, now how many times I heard that shit

Spend some time with me

Evil Deeds
-----------------------------

Lord please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done

[Chorus]
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

Momma had a baby and it's head popped off
(head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)
My momma don't want me, the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
(gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off)
Ring ring ring, on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
(their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone elses lawn
(elses lawn, elses lawn, elses lawn)
Till somebody finally took me in, my great aunt, uncle Edna 'n Charles
(Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles)
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song
(sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song)
It went a little something like mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?

[Chorus]

Predominantly, predominantly, everythings always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black
But what about me, where does that leave me
Well I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding?
What do I look like some kind of idi-wait a minute, shit, don't answer that
Why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it sucks bullshit,
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again
Whining about his millions and his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it

[Chorus]

Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these deamons
I never had any of this shit planned ma, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
This Santa Clause, why you not comin' this year again
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know what it feel like, they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, doe see doe now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring around the rosie, the shows over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please god, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
Till I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, myself is gone

[Chorus x2]

She got hit and now she's yelling (Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me!
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38 I hope it's not too late!

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

(I been trying to call you all day motherfucker where you at?)
I'm on 7 Mile, what the fuck was that?
Damn, somebody hit me from the back!
(What with they car?) With a gat nigga, and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?) I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi (Shit, that's the clique we beefing with)
Man! (I swear) And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leaving a carcass today
And I'mma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'mma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up!

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still
Trying to get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals know the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd
Fans and some cumwad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aiming for, six feet away’s the door
Into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flying all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, having a mazeltov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not, what the fuck? Oh my God, it was!
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him hauling ass, I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, being trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
Goddamn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again I can't do it
I scoop Dee, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and
Made it to the front door and collapsed
On the steps looked up and I seen Swift
Shooting it out but I can't see who he's shooting it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his four-fifth

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

It's Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left, hand Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for trying to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender (bitch bring me a bottle of Mo')
I just wanna know who driving the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots

Welcome to D-Block, the city of broke down dreams
Where things ain't always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers
Panhandlers, hustlers and doped out fiends
The sun don't shine here, in this part of town
But we all got a town that's similar to this too
Say every city's got a ghetto, every ghetto's got a hood
Take a good look around you 'cause there's a D-Block near you

A place where ain't nobody that proud, it's a fucking black cloud
That got people under the impression they can act wild
Word get around though, 'cause if you can pull a trigger on the pound yo
5 minutes flat, the whole town know
Lotta assuming a niggas' salary
More lies than truth definitely more rumors than reality
Only way you beating a body is a technicality
Other than that catch 'em in Clinton on the gallery
The determination and dedication and discipline
Listening and catching the jewels that you was missing
And they still doing coward shit
You know the hate is gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it
Something in the air but the older they get
They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick
We don't play with the lizards, we make phrases up and say 'em exquisite
Anytime you can pay us a visit

Without two pistols on me that'll be cocked in each pocket
D-Block don't even stop to talk, you just keep walking
Stick up kids every block who watch for that free opportunity
As soon as you leave out that jewelry shop
And you won't even notice your mind will be so
Preoccupied with that new watch you just copped
You won't even see that ride pulling up alongside you
You'll be shot 'fore you even realize you were spied on for three blocks
D-Block the place where O.G.'s get knocked, locked up
Get out come home for a week and get re-knocked
You won't even see cops, hip-hop police don't even stop
On D-Block, where everybody wants to be 'Pac

Let the truth be told, you think O. will be over here
like, ""Massa, show 'em you got soul"" ? no!
Anybody knows us know this not how we roll
So, I still push the bucket
If I ain't trust it I wouldn't fuck with it
But fuck it, I'm gone bitch! {*two gunshots*}",I'm Gone,2004
Eminem,"Remix, Lloyd banks, ha ha

It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down, give him a crown, he just throws it around
It's like a joke, he's like a king, but he don't rule a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold, don't want the jewelery

He don't want the fame, don't want the loot, he's in it for the sport
Runnin' circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't beggin' for it
And you can love it, you can hate it but you can't ignore it

You can't be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm frontin' then you better come confront me for it

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred twenty on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain, yeah
Money, power and respect in this rap game

He's straight out of a neighborhood where niggaz hate
They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Your stomach's ache while he's loungin' at the big estate
And he hops in a hundred thousand with a nigga's skate

House's with just a bigger gate, houndin' him is a big mistake
He won't surrender, he'd rather give up a rib to break
'Cuz he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin' hand
So he was sittin' on green like a Celtic fan

Created a buzz so that you gotta mention his name
When you discussin' the illest playa that's in the game
And he's ridin' with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and them
G Unit records ain't no motherfuckin' stoppin' them

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit you're corner with my weapon, I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred twenty on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

He's no magician man, he can't make sometin' outta nuttin'
So now niggaz from his hood act like he owe 'em somethin'
They talk crazy 'til he send niggaz to where they buck 'em
Ask 'em if it's a problem and he'll say na it's nothin'

He's was gonna help 'em out, but since they fronted, fuck 'em
He don't care how they feel they can hate 'em or love 'em
He hold his own on his own the kid is really thuggin'
He's rich now, he ain't changed so niggaz think he buggin'

He bulletproof everything 'cuz niggaz try to buck him
Keep two pistols on his hip, I'll show you where he tuck 'em
Niggaz say they gon' get at him but they can't touch him
Try to catch 'em slippin', they creepin' and start bustin'

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon, I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

I can give you niggaz somethin' you can talk about
I can turn you're smile upside down
You ain't no G, you're a fuckin' clown
I can take your girl a turn and turn her out

Don't hold it in, let it all out
I can give you fuckas somethin' to be mad about
Invite her in, send her back out
With my DNA all in her mouth

Owwwwww!!!! yeah! my niggaz 
Throw your hands in the air right now man 
Feel this shit right here! Scott Storch nigga 
Yeah Khalid I see you nigga 
Show Big Pun love! Uh! Yeah! Uh! Yo! 

[Verse 1: Fat Joe] 
I don't give a fuc* about your faults or mishappens nigga 
We from the Bronx, New York, shit happens 
Kids clappin, love to spark the place 
Half the niggaz in the squad got a scar on their face 
It's a cold world and this is ice 
Half a mill for the charm, nigga this is life 
Got the Phantom in front of the buildin, Trinity Ave 
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad 
As a young'n - was too much to cope with 
Why you think ? mu'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit Shoulda been called Armed Robbery 
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny 
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle 
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was 'gon bubble 
Came out the gate on some Flow Joe shit 
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo kid! 

[Chorus: Fat Joe] 
Said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants 
And do the rockaway, 
now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back 
I said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants 
And do the rockaway, 
now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back 
(Come on!) 

[Verse 2: Remy Martin] 
are to the Eazy, M to the Wizzi 
My arms stay breezy, the Don stay fizzi 
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-40-fizzive 
And I just bought a bike so I can ride till I die 
With a matchin jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion 
My niggaz in the club, but you know they not dancin 
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance with boogies 
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies 
Listen we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us 
And we - walk around the metal detectors 
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section 
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it 
Said he - liked my necklace, started relaxin 
Now that's what the fuc* I call a chain reaction 
See ""Money Ain't a Thing"" nigga, we still the same niggaz 
Flows just changed now we bout to change the game nigga 

[Repeat Chorus] 

[Verse 3: Fat Joe] 
Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now 
And that G4 can fly through any weather now 
See, niggaz get tight when you worth some millions 
This is why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelings 
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit 
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit 
If Five-o boy come, then they'd proudly squeal 
Cause half these rappers they Blow like Derek Pharrell 
If you cross the line, damn right I'm 'gon hurt ya 
These faggot niggaz even made gang signs commercial 
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin it up 
B2K crip walkin like that's what's up! 
Kay keep tellin me to speak about the Rucker 
Matter of fact, I don't want to speak about the Rucker 
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this 
My niggaz didn't have to play to win the championship, come on! 

[Repeat Chorus] 

[Outro: Fat Joe] 
Ha! ha! yeah! (Can you hear me?!)

Yo yo yo yo its deja vu
And the day y'all do
It'll be the day y'all bleed
Wrist minus 80 degrees
King of Harlem ain't nobody made me leave
Who else could take 5 years off
Cold turkey come back and fly lears off
Cats front leave them leaning like Smirnoff
If haters wanna hate then its their loss
Come up in the Rucker with all my Jake's on
Car grills so big you can cook a steak on
People hear Ma$e call em' wanna get their mase on
You hot 16 I'm a very great song
Been beating on the DJ before the Ma$e song
You play Clake Kent you better have your cape on
Plenty homes mansion many rooms
My necklace, 2 ex's and 3 Bentley bulls now lean back

Lean back, lean back, 'cause he's back (come on)
Lean back, lean back, lean back, 'cause he's back

You don't want no problems with Harlem
You don't want no problems with the boogie down Bronkster
You don't want no drama with the blond bomber
Original don dotta of the blond bottle
The model from white America
Then Joe the spokesperson for the Latino
Then we got Ma$e back to represent everything else in between including the
Percentages of the press we don't
The best from each coast
The midwest to the dirty dirty
Even further to Miami
All the way back to Californ-I-a
It would probably be best right now if I warned Dre to get on the horn and
Tell him about the storm coming all our way
So tell him pack grab a gat right now get on the floor I'll wait
Shake that ass a little more my way
But baby I don't dance not that I can't there's a pistol in my pants

Said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
(Come on!)

Ayo, Remy pop but i'm hot,
Like an out of state spot,
And any body think i'm not,
You're found in a vacant lot,
You don't really wanna run wit the one chick who smoke dutchess for lunchess,
The castle hill I ain't luncheon,
Now its on it 4 the terror squad, pun, prospect, sunshine, geddy, crack and Remy Ma,
It's the hottest chick, in this game want it,
Mah 16 so mean, put 20 g's and my chain on it,
Quik to flip,

Im packin' a mac in the back of the 45 pass 6,
And you know I got enough goons to crush a country,
Any dude disrespectin' Pun he better play the run c,
Bring your mans, and then we hands all him,
Then we pull timbaland trample 'em, then we pull the cats in them,
Lean back 'cause I aint ever worry, see I'm forever glory, smackin' up any chick in my territory

No Judas or cowardice that Caine's brother Abel is able to stop me
Nigga not me
Got the streets asking damn who can top P
Summer jam killed it man they did it all with one beat
I guess I'm bicoastal now
Took a down south brother to bring your boy out
As the wheel keeps spinning
I can hear niggas thinking crack got one hit then he out
Nope, Joey bring them semi's out
Force you and yours to pour a little Henny out
So much rappers acting in the game
I had to tell them put the mic away and run and get your Emmy's out
Lean back mother fucker
This here's a three peat we back at the Rucker
It's good coke crack preach it to your brother

I'm sick
Damn, you straight dog?

Bitches
Gettin' sick

That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick

That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs

That's why I ain't got no time
Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk
I had a bag of the skunk, one and last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis
Denise from the cleaners

Fucked me good, you should of seen us
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable, French role stylin', body like a Stallion
Sizin' up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigga
Debatin' on to fuck, or do I wanna be a nigga

Caressin' this bitch, plus I'm checkin' out them tits
Sippin' on that fine shit
I ain't use to buyin'
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory

Like takin' ho's money, but that's anutha story
For surely ya pussy on toast, after we toast
Her clothes fell like Bishop and Juice
The womb beata, clean pussy eata, insertin' my jock

In that spot hotta than the hottest block, don't stop!
Response I got when I was knockin' it
Clocks steadin' tickin', kinky finga lickin'
Then carryin on, semin's at my tip when she moans

I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga, like a slave owna
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foamin' at them lips, the ones between the hips

Pubic hair's lookin' like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighta than conditions of us black folks
We in the final stretch, the last part of sex

I bust a fat ass nut - then I woke up next
Like, what the fuck is goin' on here?
This bitch evaporated, pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated cause my dick was unprotected

And doctor Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit
Fuck

Now I don't wanna hit no women when this chick's got it comin'
Someone betta get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw 'er
Off the steps on this porch, my only weapon is force

And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
But what's she shovin' me for? Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
Man I'm this close to goin' toe to toe with this whore

What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce
She's havin' another baby of the month and it's yours
And you found it isn't 'cuz this bitch has been visitin'
Someone else and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips

When you get back to Michigan
Now the plot has thickend 'n worse
Cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
So your paranoid at every little cold that you get

Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it
Then the doctor comes out lookin' like Dennis the Menace *hahahaha*
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's AIDS

He ain't even gotta call in you his office to say it
So you jet back home, 'cuz you gon' get that ho
And when you see 'er, you're gonna bend 'er fuckin' neck back yo
Cause you love 'er, you neva would've expect that blow

Obie told you to scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleanas
Bringin' me home diseases swingin' from Obie's penis
She's so deceivin', shit this ho's a genious
She gee'd us

(Aight, guess what? I ain't coming in yet
I'm come in a minute
Ayo, this is my love song, it goes like this)

Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark (fuckin' faggot!)
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women
Are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink, then in
A couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up
(Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me outta this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so)

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
'Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no""
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

In third grade, all I used to do
Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as Jude
Schemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game, and every face looks the same
They've got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's got me standin' next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like, ""Yo, what the fuck we do?""
I gotta go, bitch, you know I got stuff to do
'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run, these drugs are probably going
To catch up sooner or later, but fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit's stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm going to try to find some more

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
'Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no""
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me

That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?
Screw it! And what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow, you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Mar-a-ju-on-na is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
‘Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feeling like shit every mornin'
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lotta growing up to do
I still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out getting smashed

'Cause every time I go to try to leave
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay

And I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the f*** you take me for? A joke? You smoking crack?
Before I do that, I beg Mariah to take me back
I get up 'for I get down, run myself in the ground, 
'For I put some wack s*** out
I'm trying-a smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
You all steady trying to drown the shark
Ain't gonna do nothing but piss me off
Lid to the can of whoop a**, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull the piece out, 
F*** shooting I'm just trying to knock his teeth out
F*** with me now, b****, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap, motherf***er if you're really feeling froggish, leap
Yo slim, you're gonna let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him 'scape with that
Man I hate this crap, this ain't rap,
This is crazy the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops
There ain't no getting rid of McVeigh
If so you would've tried
The only way I'm leaving this b**** is suicide
I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessey,
Got drunk then I finished he
I'm every n****s favorite arch-enemy.
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous n**** with beef
I spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently

I'm not what you think
I appear to be f***ed up
Mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a n**** had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
I murder you
Danger had me turned into a mad man, son of Sam, b****, I'm surgical
I'll allergic to dying, you think not? You got balls? We can see how large
When the music stops
I was happy having a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy but
It only made my pain worst,
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg
When you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin' with they hands out
Checking for your record when its selling
When it ain't, that's the end, no laughs
No friends no girl
Just the gin you drink till your car spin, you think
Damn!

You slam into the wall and you fall
Out the car, trying to crawl with one arm
About to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder if they would even call when the music stops
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up looking for you
With a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil
I'm revved up, who said what would lead bust your head would just explode
With red stuff I'm hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon
Braggin about how you shot it like a coward, bullets devour you showered you
N****s, if I was you n****s, I'll run while given the chance
Understand I can enchance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me, just the thought of dying alone that really
Irks me, you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop trying to walk how g's walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we plan tug-o-war with your life, f*** the tour and the mic
I'll rather f*** a whore with a knife, deliver that s*** the coroner's like
You high hype poppin' s*** in broad day light n**** your a gonna at night

When the music stops
Instigators, turn pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors wrist to razors
You all don't want war, you want talk
In the dark my dogs all bark like woof
Proof n**** I'm a wolf, get your whole roof
Caved in like reindeer hoofs
Stomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose
The more you all breach, the more I moves
This hill street, this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap checking all our jewels (n****)
Or make the news betcha all you all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop
Music's changed my life in so many ways
Brains confused and f***ed since the 5th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
N-W-A said f*** the police

Now I'm in jail
93 was strictly R&B
F***ed up hair cut
Listen to Jodeci
Michael Jackson, who gonna tell me I ain't Mike
A** cheeks painted white
F***ing Priscella at night
Flying down sunset smoking crack
Transvestite in the front
Eddi Murphy in the back
M-O-P had me grimey and griddy
Marilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue
And grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bow's
Now I'm in the hospital
Broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm going in shock,
I'm reaching for the glock but the music stops",When the Music Stops [Multimedia Track],2005
Eminem,"I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touch, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction
Just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who woulda thought
Standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide
Reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on

Make ladies swoon baby (ooh baby)
Look at myself!
Let's do the math
If I was black I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I can rap so fuck school
I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic
Show me where the fuckin' studios at
When I was underground
No one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me
Almost gave up, I was like ""Fuck it""
Until I met Dre
The only one who looked past
Gave me a chance
And I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top
Every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
Like damn we just swapped
Sittin' back look at this shit wow
I'm like ""My skin, is it startin' to work to my benefit now?""

See the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose mom's probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much muthafuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube right into ya livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped
When they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took
And they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected wit' me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' wit' a fine toothed comb
It's like this rope waitin' to choke
Tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this like
""I dont like this, no!""
All I hear is
Lyrics lyrics constant controversy
Sponsors workin' round the clock
To try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip hop is never a problem
In Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered ya fathers
Of daughters startin' to blossom
Now I'm catchin' the flack from these activists
When they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch and say fagot
Shit,
Just look at me like I'm ya closest pal

So to the parents of America
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms. Cheney
Fuck you tipper Gore
Fuck you with the free-ness of speech this
Divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck you!

[Chorus]
The way you shake it,
I can't believe it,
I ain't never seen an ass like that,
The way you move it,
You make my pee-pee go,
Da-doing doing doing,
I don't believe it
It's almost too good to be true,
I ain't never seen an ass like that,
The way you move it,
You make my pee-pee go
Da-doing doing doing

The way she moves she's like a belly dancer
She's shakin' that ass to that new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door
But I don't think I'm a answer
Police saying ""freeze"" da-doing doing doing,
What do you mean freeze?
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs
I'm not done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest
I am agreeing Mr. Officer,
I'm already on my knees,
I can't get on the ground any further
It's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer,
I just like to pee, pee, pee
Yes, I make R and B I sing song It goes
Ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Sike, I joke I joke I kidd I kidd
If I offend I'm sorry,
Please, please forgive
For I am Triumph the puppet dog
I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and
You will love it

The way you shake it,
I can't believe it,
I ain't never seen an ass like that,
The way you move it,
You make my pee-pee go,

Jessica Simpson,
Looks so-so tempting,
Nick I ain't never seen an ass like that,
Every time I see that show on MTV my peepee goes
Da-doing doing doing

Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome,
Now they're getting older they're starting
To grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying ""freeze"" da-doing doing doing
What do you mean freeze?
Jeez I just got my seat I have ticket look,
I put it away my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this
Movie theater please
I did not even get to see, Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or
Make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Peewee Herman
This movie's P-G
Mr. Officer I demand to see my attorney,
I will simply plead innocent
Cop a plea and be free, free, yes, free
Right back on the streets,
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael
He's too busy?
I am Triumph,
Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh
Cause there's a puppet on my hand (Ha ha)

The way she moves she dances like a go-go,
In the video she sings
""Get out you bozo""
I need a new boyfriend hi my name is JoJo
Police saying ""freeze"" da-doing doing doing
What do you mean freeze?
My computers will be seized
And my keys, to my ranch
I just baked cookies, Mr. Officer,
Lookie, take a whiff of these,
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this,
Nobody is safe from me, no not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word pee-pee
Pee, On the radio, but I think I did,
Janet, is that a breast?
I think I just saw a tit!
Sike, I joke I joke I kidd I kidd
I don't think my joke is working
I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold get down!

Eminem,"Shady, aftermath
There she goes shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole, I think I'm losing control

Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget once get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin' still got a few chunks on your shoestring
Knowin' I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this bitch is gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg and his sing some shit

Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the muthafuckin' mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk, seen and dropped
If I ain't got a weapon I'm a pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm a continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights lie

We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin' it up

Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride with it
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish
Yeah me and Nate d-o double g
Looking for a couple bitches with some double d's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbuly, we finna finna have a party

We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' slut
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it 'bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can say no but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, will you be mine?
I heard you was freaky from a friend of mine

Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him that you like it from behind

Now, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
C'mon girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Oh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me

Eminem,"Yeah, it's my life
My own words, I guess

Have you ever loved someone so much
You'd give an arm for
Not the expression, no
Literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart
And you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
What happens when you become the main source of her pain
""Daddy look what I made""
""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy where's mommy?
I can't find mommy, where is she?""
""I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself""
I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me
But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn

I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing
""You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'""
""Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, daddy you're lyin'
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine""
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it
""Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em
They're sayin', ""you got one more chance to do right
And it's tonight, now go out and show 'em that you love 'em before it's too late""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that

Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'""
But baby we're in Sweden
How did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you daddy
You told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says number one dad
That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin""
""I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'""
""But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want
They want you, Marshall
They keep screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah I bet you you will!
You rap about it, yeah word, kid keep it real""
I hear a applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closin' on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground
Cock it, put it to my brain, scream ""die Shady!"" And pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes
The plane that I was supposed to be on, crashes, and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up
Alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say

And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

That I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it

How many records you expecting to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
Come on, relax, guy! I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)

Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital""
Preacher, preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing ‘cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from toppin' these charts
And you can't stop me from droppin' each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards (""duhh"")
And to think, it's just lil' old me
Mr. Don't-Give-a-Fuck still won't leave

I'm a criminal!
'Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime

The mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments, indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby, 'cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word ******
My morals went (pffft) when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now, don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me: I'm white, blonde-haired, and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happened to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined
""The Maniac's in"" in place of the Doctor
'Cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you, Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal!

Alright look, just go up in that motherfucker
Get the motherfucking money and get the fuck up outta there
Alright
I’ll be right here waiting on you
Alright
Yo, Em
What?!
Don't kill nobody this time
Awwright, goddamn, this motherfucker gets on my fuckin' nerves!
Hi, how can I help you?
How you doin'?
Yeah, I need to make a withdrawal
Okay
Put the fucking money in the bag, bitch, and I won’t kill you!
What? Oh my God, don’t kill me!
I’m not gonna kill you, bitch, quit looking around
Don’t kill me, I've got two kids at home don't kill me!
I said I’m not gonna fucking kill you
Don't kill me!
Hurry the fuck up! Thank you! (Go, go, go!)

Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it

Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut

To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass

Ih.. ih, ih (it has been)
It has been, it has been, it has been
It has been said, that there has been known to be bloodshed
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead {what?}
Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
Money power respect, street cred, yeah
It's scary ain't it? Picture yourself goin out as a hero {uhh}
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
We watched, so many Biggie backed off of {ha ha ha}
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact
these tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lifes
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest {uh-huh}
In this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starvin
Or it could just be somebody's horror, that just horri-fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
in his entou-rage, that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it

Since B.I.B. taught us niggaz to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious {what?}
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencin the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rollin, goin through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
When _Ready to Die_ was a sick part of my life {yeah}
Palmin that forty-five, plottin to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular huh? {uh-huh}
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I.

I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
Enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passin {what?}
All I did was build a dynasty, off of his passion
And I'm addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace...
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother...
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back {yeah}
And I visit your grave cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yellin ""God bless""
Regardless to critics yellin that East/West
I seen the game losin, I'm just pressin the reset {uhh}

No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks to add to the wall
Full of plaques, hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'mma let my dough freeze, ho please
You better bow down on both knees, who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies

The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said motherfuck the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see
Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped, y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep

With a Walkman on
When I caught a guy
Give me an awkward eye
And I strangled him up in the parking lot

I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hopping out with two broken legs
Trying to walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'mma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out
From here on out it's the Chronic II
Starting today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew

Now you wanna run around talking bout guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all, cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back

Man, I ain't have no hood, my mother was always movin
From Detroit to Texas, Texas to Detroit
Goddamn, mama, what's the point?
So I would go in my room and pack my little bags
Jump in the truck, with my step-dad
When I was 10 years old, I started to feel the hunger
Got a little older, then the force got stronger
And me and my rap partner wasn't seein' eye to eye

I'd rather be fishin' in flip flops, flip flops
Or cross over to country like Kid Rock, and I
Can't see no country singers beefin' over some guitar
Riff to Willie Nelson lifted from Bob Seeger
When I was younger I was so eager
To have a gun, I would do the same
Couldn't wait to get to the shootin' range
Me and my man Goofy Gary just tryna let loose some steam
Motherfuckers laughin' cause I couldn't aim
So I pulled the fuckin' target closer and just shoot the thing
I used to have this theory, keep three bullets in the gun
It was a mandatory year up here in Michigan
For each bullet if you got no C-C-W license
I tried to apply for one, they said it take 5-6 months
What the fuck am I supposed to do meanwhile when rivals come?
Hide that son of a bitch in the glove box or inside the trunk
Now back to what my three-bullet theory was
I'm triple-platinum, I ain't tryna catch no murder 1
Figured I'd shoot the womb, probably missin' at least one
But the other one's fuck his shoulder and his knee cap up
And I'm a say for self-defense how come I had the gun
Is because I was at the range, on my way back from
This dude approached me on some bullshit
I'll get a year for each bullet at the most as opposed to
Havin' a full clip in that
That was my idiotic logic, it was basically for safety
But it gave me power, and it made me crazy
And psychotic, I just got retarded

We all fall down
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier, who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never suppose to show it, my crew ain't suppose to know it
Even if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino, it don't matter
I never drag 'em in battles that I can handle less I absolutely have to
I'm suppose to set an example, I need to be the leader
My crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off I'm suppose to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squashed it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line, you just don't cross it, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
I'm so caught it I almost feel like I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in Hip Hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career with out ever mentioning
And that's just outta respect, for not running my mouth
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, just wasn't my beef, So I did
I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth while he's all over TV
Now I'm talking a man who literally saved my life, like fuck it
I understand, this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute cause

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down, like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

It used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
Shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it
It's a different ball game, call names and you ain't just rapping
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja' start yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck 'em 50, smash him, mash him, and let him have it
Meanwhile my intentions pulled me in other directions
Some receptionist said the source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks
That I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust of his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it got a grudge against me for nothing but fuck it
That motherfucker can get it too, fuck 'em then
But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line that's willing to die for us
As soon as we give the orders, never to extort us
Strictly to show they support us
Maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show we love 'em back
And to let 'em know how important it is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more then any award is
But I ain't trying to have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I'll let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coping
I'm just willing to be the bigger man
If y'all can quit popping off at the jaws with the knocking
'Cause frankly I'm sick of talking
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause

Ha ha, g-g-g-g, G-Unit!
Ha ha! (Ha ha)

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

Get your a** up for the Doctor, one more time
Get your a** up for the Doctor, c'mon now!
Here we go, cliffhanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat, get on down
Time's up, game's over, you lose, I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you somethin' that we already had
But once you're gone you don't come back
Too bad, you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and b****in'
Sit and observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
Why I send multi-platinum albums, later three diamond
Worldwide, we on the charts with a bullet, and still climbin'

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk!
Get it crunk (crunk, crunk, crunk)
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and
Jump (jump, jump, jump)
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you artists censored
I don't gotta promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges
We ain't showin' off, we're just goin' off, popular contentions
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all
Washed up, knock it off, who the f*** is Doc impressin'
Doctor's this, Doctor's that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the c*** of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So D-J take the needle and just drop it on the record, what?
We goin' have this motherf***er hoppin in a second (pump pump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers whom if it
Wasn't for rap to bridge the gap maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages, broke down barriers
Of language and races, just call on the caped crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game that's why we came to

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

50 Cent, c'mon!

Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump, everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
And plenty hunnies involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, every day is just another party from the valleys
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
So never say never cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records, presents the return of
The, The Doc (and Shady) no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that uh

Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front we'll come through the side
Cause I don't want to ever leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time

Yeah! Ha ha
Still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry bout that ""Detox"" album, it's comin'
We goin' make Dre do it (ha ha)
50 Cent, G-Unit
Obie Trice, D-Twizy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre, we ain't leavin'
Let's go!  Ha ha

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

Yo, yo
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (oops)
Aw shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids (AHH!)
These 'shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losin' weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce, come on bounce
I said come on, bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce (me!)
Not weed, I meant coke, dumb-ass sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D-12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is passin' out
Get her ass on the couch 'fore she crashes out
Come on!

Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Heh, hey Von you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid cause the X is gone
Ya I took them all dawg with some parmesan
And I think my arm is gone
Naw it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Yo stop actin' stupid
You so high that you might wake up with a guy on some new shit (EWW!)
Yeah I think I did too much, this substance equals cups
Red pills, blue pills, and green, big pills (that's ill), mescaline!

I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin' compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

Dirty Dozen, eighty of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
Some, somethin', some'un, some'un, some'un

Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was Incredible and killed the Hulk
I wanna, roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm, old and gray look for dope to smoke
No okey-doke, I'm packin' my nose with coke
Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby, born by whore lady
Now I gotta strangle a (you're crazy!)

I pop fo' E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin' mine
(Yeah, you got any shrooms?) Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get jobs cause our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggaz think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked
And if you like smack (uh-huh) then I might too
(Swift, chill) I just wanna get high like you! (ewww)
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue (uh-huh)
Speed, 'shrooms, down the valiums (uh-huh)
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
I just copped some and I'm goin back soon

I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin'
But nothin compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

I'm at rave lookin' like a slave, high off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic, body smell like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope-headed guy
Heroin mescaline, pencilnecks, wanna try?
Blue pills, golden seals, got Bizarre, actin' ill
Drugs kill (yeah right) bitch, I'm for real!!!
Shut your mouth you dirty slut, you know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt, let Bizarre nut!

Eminem,"When I just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it
'Cause that's just the way she was

They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin' the shit
Cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't goin' shoot you
I'm a pull you to this bullet, and put it through you
Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?
""Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore,
Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?""
You god damn right bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicadin, vrinnn Vrinnn, Vrinn!
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts

Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'm a kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef

You better kill me!  I'm a be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't a said
But when they kill me I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too!  You ain't nothin' but a girl to me
I said you don't, want to fuck with Shady (cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you (ah-ha ha)
I said you don't, want to fuck with Shady (why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you

Bitch I'm a kill you!  Like a murder weapon, I'm a conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Buck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
It ain't acid rap, I just rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops!  Is that a subliminal hint?  No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then, if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth

Bitch I'm a kill you, I ain't done this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In a tub but that's normal ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in

Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch I'm a kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't goin' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef

Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
Cause lady's screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
This eighty G's a week to say the same things threece!
Twice?  Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots!  I hope the weed will outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink?
Fuck that!  I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to off seventy-thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to out of school
I don't even believe in breathin' I'm leavin' air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play
I go the machete from O.J.
I'm ready to make everyone's throat ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on
Til I have you at knife point, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up!  Give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me!

Bitch I'm a kill you! You don't want to fuck with me

Balls, Balls, Balls
You'll never touch my

You're standin' tough
But you know that no matter what
You'll never get the chance to touch
My Balls, Balls, Balls
Balls, Balls, Balls
You'll never touch my balls

I see you ain't a playa, you ain't ballin'
And I don't even care who the hell you call in
In this game, it ain't no talkin'
You can get it started, I nail the coffin
And all I here is ""get your man up off him""
So why I gotta stop it, this nigga was talkin'
And I ain't gotta prove you nothin'
I do it and you ain't gotta push my buttons

This dude in front of me, he weighs a brick
He's quick and I can't get Marshall hit
So I played my position and don't make a move
Been doin' this for years, my team can't lose
And ain't nobody, ain't nobody hard
9 o'clock, I'm gonna punch me hard
Hut one, hut two, I'm ready
Hike, give the ball to Nelly
And nobody out there feels me
Take this 'fore you have to kill me
And any player in my way, I'm foldin'
Damn it, call holton

Football, Football, I love football
Yes, tres, dos, uno
Dos, tres, fuck, shit, bitch, asshole son of a bitch
Everybody cuddle, blah I mean huddle
I just stepped in a mud puddle, butthole
Freak, who just tapped on my ass cheek
Nevermind, let's try quarterback sneak
Cover me, smother me with love that's brotherly
That didn't work, try another play
Hut one, hut two, hut hut hurry up
And reach up another grown man's butt
Hike the ball, I mean I like Bizarre
But Jesus yikes, I think I can feel his balls
My dick is long as it is hard, yeah so are my balls
It's the longest yard, whoops that's not the chorus
Run it back, wrong song, yeah disreguard
That whole statement I just made, what yard line we on?
On 5 and our timeouts are gone
Less than a minute left, I just throw my ball (ball)
To the sideline to Von, he steps outta bounds
48 seconds left on the clock but every last one counts
Call another huddle, we're down by six
The plan is, to throw the ball to Swift
But he's so god damn high, that he's trips
Falls and slips, Proof grabs him by his fingertips
And runs the ball all the way down to the one
But he don't get in, but all we need is a put (blabbing)
But all we need is a touch down and an extra point to win
But then I get sacked all the way back to the ten
God dammit I'ma slap somebody if I get tapped on the ass again
Everybody's laughin' now, no timeouts and its now fourth down
We're never gonna make it, wait I just got an idea
Quick, everybody get naked, Denaun go long
I'ma throw the bomb, c'mon how they gonna tackle you wit no pants on
Ass out with a floppin' schlong, touch down yeah I told ya
It's the longest yard

[Chorus]

The new face on the yard, just hand me the ball (balls)
I'ma run through all of ya'll, ya'll just soft
Even though my cleats is kickin' up mud
It's more tragic for me, I'm stiff armin' punks
High steppin' through the end zone
I been grown, I'm so dirty you don't even know my skin tone
It's time to rumble, no time to fumble
And I won't stumble, your frontline will tumble
Playin' ball with killas, my team's gorillas
Three time offenders, even drug dealers
One of the best runnin' backs there never was
Movin' like Barry Sanders, leavin' you in the dust

Yack is high, I got the highest yack
Hit the ground so hard I leave tire tracks
Bizarre snaps like a fire crack
And my palm more stickier than spider back
Eyin' my eye, the back tryin to sack us
No matter how big they flyin' backwards
Wide receiver, recievin' wide
For every stride in my life, I breathe and die

Defense is playin' a pass
Then the quarterback peeps and screams
That means that its time for me
To run out the back like a bat straight outta hell
My tracks burn turf when they excel
I try to lateral pass the ball to Proof
He got dropped and the ball came loose
And shot up like a flare, I gave the ball a stare
And use my lineman's shoulder as a chair
Now I'm flyin' through the air like a superhero
I can use this pose for a box of cereal
I'm no joke punk, I get my dinerio
For bein' the best player on my team what
As soon as I hear the hut 1, 2, hut
I do one run, run, the screen go run run
Then I cut, spin around in the endzone
Then I do the ninety shuffle so

You touch Shady, I'll leave you dearly departed

This ain't Batman, Robin, Cagney or Lacey
It's 50 Cent and Shady, the worst, baby
You put your hands on my peoples I'll react crazy
Put a hole through your front and your back, maybe
But go 'head, you try me
I'll have your ass hooked up to an IV
I leave no witnesses when I ride, B
You fuck with me, you'll see
I react like an animal and tear you apart

Niggas know I was wrapped too tight from the start
But being a little off landed me on top of the charts
So you take the good with the bad, I guess

Somewhere along the line it's like me and 50 made a (Pact!)
He's got my back, I got his back (Back!)
It's almost like we're kinda like Siamese twins
'Cause when we beef we pull each other into the bullshit
Like we're conjoined at the hip, it's just unavoidable
Some of the shit is squashable; some shit'll never boil over
Some of it will just simmer at best if left alone
But let it be known there will be no sitdowns
With no Daves and 'Zinos
There will be no peace discussions with me
There ain't gonna be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fucking with me and I'll gladly quit fucking with you
Just spit your sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through

All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you never see
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
Accusations of violence you know you done heard of that
Spent a quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap

So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep up
Got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
I'm satisfied with it bein' my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can feel me
Only speakin' on what I know so the world can hear me
So peace to Jimmy and Dre for signin' my nigga

So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
And beat the hell outta anybody that fucks with us

Eminem,"You know the days of talking is over
And there ain't too much more we can say
To try to get these different individuals,
or muthaf***as as I like to call 'em
To just, shut the f*** up
Let's go

You witnessed the a** whooping, bones got broke 
When the fifty calib blast, wouldn't last
Through the smoke as you choke
Pay attention bear witness to this muthaf***in' twitch that you excite 
Cause none of the bullets hit you they missed you,
But we ain't trippin' wasn't after you, 
Don't you piss, it's like a b**** them ni66az laughed at you
Now you agitated a little bit, acting just like a little b****
I figured that you would surface I knew you happen to managed to pop s***
Saying Trick that, Trick this
When the balls that you have and if when I pop them
Should of died wit 'em, body and soul coulda burn 
I'm a keep killing these b****es until everybody learn
F*** time and it's time that these f***ers to start dyin'
I ain't sayin this to say in this rhyme and I ain't lyin
Man enough to say it and mean it, ni66az can be gone
I'm a do another verse but there ain't much more I can speak on

There's nothing more these words can say
This hard headed muthaf***a just won't let it lay
So say a prayer for this playa' cause he's going to his grave
So stand clear b****es betta' get the f*** out my way.

Let me show you how I started as a starvin' artist
This is Proof wit the truth regardless of all this
As my C-E-O and best friend of the essence
I won' why nobody in Detroit won't test him
Lesson learned, flesh get burned
Tex in turn, a scar hotter than the press and burn
Everlast the beef is over, you can sleep this over
Clique Benz took the streets wit soldiers
Including me I move and creep wit Uzi fleas that choose to lead
I'll put your dudes to sleep
Who is he (Trick) Trick no treat
That street life A-K that still'll lift your feet
The rest of these n****s is comical
I'm a go abdominal, split like a domino
Rhyming pro, sharp without a diamond, Go
Geronimo to any man wit pause
Murder you b****es, still screaming f*** the law!

There's nothing more these words can say
This hard headed muthaf***a just won't let it lay
So say a prayer for this playa' cause he's going to his grave
So stand clear b****es betta' get the f*** out my way.",No More to Say,2005

[Guard:] Mr. Yayo, your free to go, so I guess this means I'll see you tomorrow
[Eminem:] Guess who's home? Tony Yayo, Obie Trice, c'mon!

[Chorus - Eminem]

I'm a Drama Setter, gripping my baretta sipping Armaretta
Man you crazy if you think Ima let up
I told you I'm a Drama Setter
I'll be the first to set it homie, you can bet it just don't get in the way of my chedda
Man cause I'm a Drama Setter
I don't go looking for no trouble but somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With you momma crying cause her only son is dying
She just don't know it's just your karma catching upcause I'm a Drama Setter

[Verse 1 - Tony Yayo]

I'll poke you man I'm Riker's Island Pokemon
I got C.O.'s bringin me Filet Mingon
But now a nigga home looking frail in a drop
With a bitch shotgun that's inhaling the cock
I got rocks on my neck the size of bottle tops
And got glocks in the lex so we ride behind cops
On broke days we used to put water in our cereal
Now we crossing borders just to shoot another video
It's Tony Montano, full body armor
Soning niggas like Alfredo in the Godfather
Two shot revolver, that Dillinger shit
In the A-are 15, Bentley or Six
We taking trips to Morocco just to tan
We smoke weed in restaurants in Amsterdam
I was worth a hundred grams, now I'm worth a cool million
I'll put money on your hairline, your dime and your children

[Chorus - Eminem]

I'm a Drama Setter, gripping my baretta sipping Armaretta
Man you crazy if you think Ima let up

Man cause I'm a Drama Setter
I don't go looking for no trouble but somehow the trouble always finds me

[Verse 2 - Obie Trice]

Since Yayo is home, them A-are's is drawn
Obie's guerrilla-Unit, fuck affilia-tion
We are one, it is sensless, for you to prevent this
The 40, cal'll put you up under some photosynthesis
At any given instant, another incident
You just got a glimpse of Obie and Yay's temperament
And we holding them K's that's why homie won't age
Isn't it that Tony's enraged they throw him in cages
But now my nigga's loose, Our crews is bulletproof
All brought to you from whom's pupils, baby blues
His short fuses, put your portrait on the news
Nigga them screws is loose when you fucking with them shady dudes

[Verse 3 - Tony Yayo]

Got fat while I was gone, but now I'm here
And y'all rappers only bust shots only in fear
Chinchillas on my back itchy fingers on the mac
Get scrilla off of crack, get fifty's shooter back
Listen homie, don't let them niggas amp you money
Cause I got niggas in Queens that kill for pamper money
Move like Kaiser, Jayson Williams slaughter the driver
My daughter Maniyah, know that the kid spit fire
Reality rap, nigga check my salary cap
I give guns to my soldiers with a battery pack
What you know about light planes and heavy coke
And them drugs being smuggled on them fast speed boats
It's the rap tycoon, Tony you all know me
See me on MTV I'm a parole
I was out for 12 hours and went right back in
For three hots and 1 cot doin time in the pen

[Chorus - Eminem]

I'm a Drama Setter, gripping my baretta sipping Armaretta
Man you crazy if you think Ima let up
I told you I'm a Drama Setter
I'll be the first to set it homie, you can bet it just don't get in the way of my chedda
Man cause I'm a Drama Setter
I don't go looking for no trouble but somehow the trouble always finds me
Don't make me have you in the trauma center
With you momma crying cause her only son is dying
She just don't know it's just your karma catching upcause I'm a Drama Setter

Eminem,"Last month I spent two weeks on a vacation
I had a dream that I was inside of my PlayStation
Did you ever lay down, take a nap and loose it?
I dreamt I was stuck in this game called Rap Music
I started off underground in a dark room
With a freestyle, a sawed-off pump and a harpoon
That transform to a pen in case of a words war
And opened the first door that led to the first floor
I got attacked by a couple of rap acts
They wore dreads, these army pants and these backpacks
I hit one over the head with a broken verb
The muthafucka tried to hit me with some spoken word
But it didn't work, and I finished him and his boys
And disappeared from the scene without makin' a noise
I used up four bars but I earned a punchline
And proceeded to Level 2: Land of the Unsigned

[Chorus]
We don't play those games
Would you listen here?
What I'm doin he're?
Get me outta here

We don't play those games
This is gettin' wild
Can you tell me how?
Let me out now

We don't play those games
How'd I get in here?
Let me outta here
What I'm doin' here?

We don't play those games
This is no fun
Got me on the run
Rap 2K1

I got attacked right away when I walked in
By a four-foot manager with a contract and a pen
I put up my force shield to block any attempt
At this shrimp drainin' my life twenty percent
The floor opened up and I almost fell inside
But I used my mic right, I swung to the other side
And just when I thought I avoided the booby trap
I got slapped by a female MC with a doobie rag
And this chick was tryin' to be herd like she raised cattle
But I remembered somethin' I seen on the Blaze Battle
Whoever sold you them shoes, they fooled you
I killed her with a verse about her fucked up weave and her fake FUBU
A record exec then appeared in a black limo
And started to attack with a bag full of wack demos
And I will admit: it was hard as hell to kill
So I stabbed him with an invoice and a studio bill

[Chorus]

I made it to the next level: Above Ground
My soundscanner then picks up on this bug sound
I pull out the sawed-off pump and I get it cocked
And that's when this A&R crawled from under a rock
And start shootin' opinions, I stop, drop and I roll
Cause if they was to hit me, they'd penetrate to my soul
I hid behind some trees and I held my weapon tightly
His street team was up on the roof tryin' to snipe me
It took a while to finish em all but I finally did it
Then out comes this powerful beast known as the critic
With a fully loaded magazine and mad drama
My harpoon shots just bounced off of his armor
Now I wish I would've stayed down in the dark caves
I'm runnin' towards these big-ass fans with these sharp blades
But he was right behind me holdin' a flame thrower
So I jumped through the blades and I died, game over

[Chorus]",Rap 2K1,2005
