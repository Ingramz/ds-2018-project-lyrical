Tye Tribbett,"Forget about the cars, the bentleys with the rims
It's not about the clothes, the baggy jeans and timbs
Forget about the house, the mansion on the hill
With the swimming pool in the back and the barbecue on the grill
Forget about fortune, forget about the fame
See it's not about money or people screaming my name
I just love you, oh Lord I just love you for who you are
That's all, that's all
See, I'm not trying to be no superstar
That's not why I'm singing this song

Some people just love you for the things you've done
And some just love you for all the victories won
Now there's nothing wrong (nothing wrong) with that kind of praise (kind of praise)
But this time around, I love you is all I wanna say
I got one more verse, before I end this tune
See, I can go on and on like Erykah Badu
Cause I just love you, oh Lord I just love you for who you are
That's all, that's all
See, I'm not trying to be no superstar

Now if you never bless me with material things
(Like what?) Like the furs and the diamonds and the escalade or the rims
See you would still be God and that's enough for me to love you
Hey, I love you Lord
Cause I just love you, oh Lord I just love you for who you are
You mean more than this world to me
See, I'm not trying to be no superstar
That's not why I'm singing this song

I love you Lord and here's the reason why
You gave your life, you didn't have to die
Everytime I think about it I just cry
As I long as I live you'll be glorified
I know I don't pray just as much I should
I know I don't read just as much as I could
And if I ask you to forgive me Lord I know you would
Tryin' to end this song but you've been so good to me
I just love you, oh Lord I just love you for who you are
You mean more than this life to me
See, I'm not trying to be no superstar

You mean more than life to me, you're everything I need
You supply all of my needs
The list goes on and on

September 11th I woke up about 7 AM
West coast time, french toast and my turkey bacon
Takin' my time awakin, turnin' my TV on
To my surprise, saw what everybody in the world saw
Me and my children, images were chillin'
My son said - daddy were there people in that building?
A cold sweat, frozen with a lump in my chest
I heard his question, couldn't bring my lips to say yes to him
That night at my son's side, he cried
And prayed for the ones who died in the World Trade
His palms to God, seeds of qualms with God
He just, kept on pressin' me, wanna know why
Then one week later our bombs were dropped
We seein' them, on CNN, they just won't stop
The infrared, images of brutal attack
He said ""Daddy now we killin' 'em back,"" right right

Honest to God, why is the bomb always gettin' the last word
and why, did her uncles have to molest her
and why, did all them cops have to be shootin' to kill?
And why, did all them priests have to act so ill?
Tell me why did James Byrd Jr. have to be touched?
Tell my why did Malcolm and Martin depart from us
Tell me why did the sniper make that little boy shoot
And why, is human life always denied for loot?
Tell me WHY did MANDELA have to live in a cage
Why did my brother Sterling have to die at that age
Tell me why did Reginald Denny deserve his fate
And why the fuck can't love, seem to defeat hate?
Tell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat?
Why did 'Pac and Biggie Smalls have to fall in the street?
Tell me why did Jam Master Jay have to go that way?

See me in my business stance
There's still fish in the air for the kingdom
It don't matter where they come from bring 'em

You're saying God is Lord

I thought
Do what you feel like doing
No one cares any way
Maybe then someone would notice you

I never planned on being here
The devil tempted me and I was drawn away
But I have no desire to stay, oh

Got to get out of here
I've got to get out of here
I wanna be with You

Can't believe what I got myself into
Thought I had everything under control
I didn't realize the whole time
That the enemy had plans to destroy my life

Have mercy on me
Please forgive me and restore Your joy
I can't imagine staying here 'til I die
I gotta get back to Your side

When the enemy comes in like a flood,
The spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard against him.
I see the enemy coming in like a flood in our houses, in our churches, in our families.
But what I don't see is the standard. 
People of God where's the standard at?
We in a war y'all. It's time to stand out!

[G.A.]
It's about to go down. The battle has begun.
It's time for you to choose, whose side you gonna be on.
The devil is recruiting, temptin' every man.
But he's already defeated, all we have to do is stand.
No time for mixing light with the darkness.
Be black or be white, no more shades of gray.
Be separated, be holy, no matter what you do, don't bow.
And even if you stand alone, stand anyhow.

[Chorus]
Rise up!
Rise up people, put on your strength.
There's a war going on and we will win.
Stand up and fight, let the kingdom prevail.
With power and might, we will stand out.
Stand out!
Stand out!
Be not conformed to this world.
Stand out!
Be transformed, renew your mind.
Stand out!
Just like the three Hebrew boys,
Stand out!

[G.A.:]
God is playin' it cool, don't wanna rub nobody the wrong way.
Almost like we're trying to fit in. Acting like we don't know the name.
It's time for us to stand out and go against the grain.
Forget tryin' to be down, let the world know you've been changed.
How you gonna be the praise leader? But you listen to R & B?
And hip-hop is on your ring tone. I'm trying to tell you God ain't pleased.
And since when did it become cool for you to live together unmarried?
Men with men?
Women with women?
I'm telling you God ain't gon' have it.

[Chorus]

[Tye]
It's time to recognize.
The war it's in disguise.
No time for compromise.
Wake up open your eyes.
The devil is a lie!
You must be hot or cold.
You can't blend in the crowd.
It's time for God's people ta

When the enemy comes in like a flood,
The spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard against him.
I see the enemy coming in like a flood in our houses, in our churches, in our families.
But what I don't see is the standard. 
People of God where's the standard at?
We in a war y'all. It's time to stand out!

[G.A.]
It's about to go down. The battle has begun.
It's time for you to choose, whose side you gonna be on.
The devil is recruiting, temptin' every man.
But he's already defeated, all we have to do is stand.
No time for mixing light with the darkness.
Be black or be white, no more shades of gray.
Be separated, be holy, no matter what you do, don't bow.
And even if you stand alone, stand anyhow.

Rise up!
Rise up people, put on your strength.
There's a war going on and we will win.
Stand up and fight, let the kingdom prevail.
With power and might, we will stand out.

Stand out!
Be not conformed to this world.
Stand out!
Be transformed, renew your mind.

Stand out!

God is playin' it cool, don't wanna rub nobody the wrong way.
Almost like we're trying to fit in. Acting like we don't know the name.
It's time for us to stand out and go against the grain.
Forget tryin' to be down, let the world know you've been changed.
How you gonna be the praise leader? But you listen to R & B?
And hip-hop is on your ring tone. I'm trying to tell you God ain't pleased.
And since when did it become cool for you to live together unmarried?
Men with men?
Women with women?
I'm telling you God ain't gon' have it.

[Tye]
It's time to recognize.
The war it's in disguise.
No time for compromise.
Wake up open your eyes.
The devil is a lie!
You must be hot or cold.
You can't blend in the crowd.
It's time for God's people ta

We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no

Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig the attitude and how you're acting like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are

I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travee and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me
That sounds absurd to me

The way you stole my attention was flat out burglary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some naked peekaboo
'Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through

And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Such an angel with a devilish angle
And quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl

And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too

We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no

Now here's another bar, I'm coming for the slow gunners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your momma live
No turning back so you better buckle up

Shit, don't be concerned with mine
I feel like a Speak and Spell way I got you learning my lines
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I change my name to ""did he really just say that shit?""

Yep
I'll take a mile if you let me
Six-five, two hundred plus and so sexy
My legs going up for keeping my phone on vibrate

To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been tryin' to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up

We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
And we have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no

Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

Got chicks, all hot chicks
And you rock chicks, datin' hip hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

Good grief girl, you're giving me goosebumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you

It's not a skam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan, I'm a sucka for smucka's jam girl
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun

Shut up and kiss me like the antedotes under my tongue
Whoa

Playboys and socialites, young and fly fly fly

1989: No pressure, but to the best that's in my section
Levels of a professional, skip school, create my own lessons
Confessions of a mad rapper, music's got me wrapped up
Green stretching only leads to red stretchers
He's next in line for the blessing, get your mind off mine,
Hustle something and stop relying on mine, molding a lesson while u letting time fly by

At age 17 addicted to ink, a rap fiend who had money dreams, my taste of fame couldn't compare to what I'd seen
Them dying, government lying', all for that paper cheese
Mom's cryin', watching her only son through TV, MTV, BET
He on now, wipe me down, no longer fighting through the crowd
I control the crowd, how you like me now? Wow

Diamond life, sugar baby we dynamite,
Playboys and socialites, young and fly fly fly

Diamond life, sugar baby we dynamite,
Playboys and socialites, young and fly fly fly

Back to the cold, motivational roads
No guidance, just violence and probational homes
Thinking my hot routes is all out, music gotta be my way out
Family gathered around I gotta make 'em proud,
Pops propped in the penitentiary laid out, hoping his son feel under a different cloud
I'm speaking directly into the crowd, nothing but personal,
Just thought you'd want to know the person
Far from perfect, but nearly word perfect
Must be he, rate him on the scale from one to me
Me equaling greatness, one equalling every ten haters
The rest couldn't make it due to unlikely behavior,
So be patient or end up the next patient
Emergency room, newspaper, the new rappers call 'em straight actors
Music wise, they playing safety and I'm shootin off safety
Aiming for greatness,

Forget everybody just do what he say
They wanna move like, they wanna be like, you can do it just like

Regretted having your brother?
Would you forgive her and kiss her
And tell her you love her?
Or would you press it?
'Cuz being the only child
Could leave ya feeling desperate
In need of attention every second
But since you man of the house you never get it
Pops left without a smile but you never miss him
But when you reminiscing
You wished you had a father figure
At least weekend's man pay a visit
Aww forget it

What about lil' Jason up in prison?
You think an 8 year old had bad intentions?
Pullin' the trigger on dad just barely killed him
Just wanted to protect moms from the brutal hittings
But he a kid so it's their word against his
Moms won't even testify scared of her husband
So he in for some years
Don't even know what he did
But can't forget it now
'Cause it's too late

Only sing the lines that make you press rewind

You broke now
Don't regret it now

Best friends one and only
Confidant who I trust, never phony
Just I and the young guy I called my Brodie
We was like age of 5 since he known me
But now it's like hazy skies and in the mornings..
Waking up police say he died hollows pointed
Damn I can' believe you God.. Why you want him?
I needed him more than you. Now, What you lonely?
Just 2 more months man, we was good money
Now he can't go to awards and meet stars
I'm all alone now ridin' in luxury cars..
Life like a movie now someone press fast forward
So I can chill with him again and feel real
I rather have him here then this rap deal..
But he can't regret it now
Walking into that crowd...
Had his jewelry on
Next thing, man down

Be my goddess higher in this world

I think I'm all the above two teenagers in love
I gave up them girls you gave up the club
I gave you everything you wanted just because

Markin' those calendar days away 'til that moment I saw you

What else could really matter
But lovin' that's
What its all about
Till death does us part

I got more to stay to you
I thought I was more to what we had
Her secret stash
Filled with bundles of emotions

Now I'm startin' to notice
All that shit was bogus
All the dozens of roses
Thinkin' you was my golden token

Now I'm feelin' frozen
Lookin' like my life is hopeless
No human
Should ever experience

What I drove in
Now my car is broken
My engine hood
I should have never left it opened

Lookin' like I'm on E
No fuel I cant even eat
Don't even want to breath if you ain't close to me
No friends

My only enemy is cupid
How could you be so stupid
Please tell me why love hurts
Can you even hear me

Can you even imagine
If your arrow wasn't workin' for weeks
I don't
Think so

I'm just tryin'
To think slow
It just ain't me
So please play the drum rolls

And roll the red carpets out
As I wait for you to return
With an explanation
So baby start explaining

Why do we fight
Why do argue you
All through night
When we should be pillow talking baby

Make the wrongs
All things aside
Swallow our pride
And just love each other all the time

You got me and I got you
What else could really matter
But lovin' that's
What its all about",Pillow Talkin',2008
Tyga,"First off let me clear my chess
started off on baby steps
We get right to the moment where baby's come next
Grab tight holdin' our self to whats nothin' left
Two choices I'm ya boyfriend or lets just forget
After that you plead like I can't believe what we did
So only option was to agree and keep it secret
Or ya friends will make ya think that ya just another cheerleader
On his team, Tyga man a playa
See but, don't believe what ears can hear and eyes can not see
You seeing me on a daily baby
wheres my time for another lady?
get over it, trust me, faithfully, i can be all that you need

[Chorus]
Say you want to let me go and
thats gonna have to end
You can Go and get a new boyfriend
But you'll never get a better boyfriend
Love just ain't our way but,
You know i don't pretend
I'm a go and get a new girlfriend
I'm a get myself a better girlfriend

[Girl Talks on Answering Machine]

Dear Ma,
Misses She left ya guard down
For girbuads and riches
So we tore the mall down
And therefore fullfilled your little wishes
No more penny, pigeon, chowing at places
Dinner to reservations
I'm so on to this lifestyle
I put you on to it baby, Tyga Style
Just don't run from it 'cause theres carpets every where we roam now
Profits for party poppin' wit popular crowds
Getty images flickering, Perez Hilton
Liker her dress was ridiculous, complements of Tygas expense
I come at them like Pete Wentz
Don't worry its all coming back in the end

[Chorus]

Wait, so this is how we plan it
Benefit friends and relationships don't mix
But don't trip, 'cause you I'm far over with
Long John Silver sick
And this boat no longer floats for you goldfish
Go dig another ditch 'cause I'm dead done wit dis
I'm hangin' up now, My new girl shes in the front now
I know that gotta hurt
Time to answer her
Well i guess its true
Stick to the player rules

When I tell her keep it drama free

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (chu-chuckin' up the deuces)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I know you mad but so what?
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm 'bout to throw them deuces up

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her

Uh, use to be valentines
Together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care but I ain't gettin' no reply
Tryna see eye to eye but it's like we both blind
Fuck it lets hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some

'Cause when it's all said and done,
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big but it beat quiet
how never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone it's a awkward silence

So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit is over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby I think it's better if I let you know

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her

Look, my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make wanna leave the one I'm with Usher Raymond

Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick she give me deja Vu

And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon hear bout it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her

Now family and old friends wanna be involved.
Some nigga tryna marry mom he like my songs.
I find it odd sometimes wanna fucking shoot his head off.
Am in the wrong, didn't think so movin' on.
I'm working on my new album if you singing songs.

I know my fault, I should've gave more

Now it's drums playing, crowd singing
Light changing, wish you was here to witness all that

Probably one of my realest loves ever, four page letters
In time it’s all better, ‘cause time heal whatever
I'ma need a moment cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, females are on regular
What’s the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
I’d rather stay friends with benefits 'til we ready
Now ready, Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like one more chance, more problems, no Biggie, ah
It’s all good, don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or you can take your space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that
Tell your friend they can fall back
Ain’t even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?
I'm like

I feel good
Got some time off, Girl it's been so long
Did you have fun?
'Cause I'mma need a cab just to get me home
Maybe you could call in sick
Bring it to the crib and get all this dick
I know I'm blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?
Well you should know
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya
I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya

And even though we let it go, it’s better that you know
I still

Ain't nobody like you
Heard you got a ballplayer
But he don't excite you
I ain't the one you gotta lie to
Lay down, relax, climax, let me guide you
Still a super-freak
You know how I be when I'm rolling in the streets
Enough about me, I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Ginuwine cause I'm the same Ol' G
We was young, full of insecurities
Grown up now, all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies, arguing and ? clashing
Too much pride to say sorry
Shit, problems running like half the day
Number twenty four, let it fade away
She gotta leave but she wanna stay
She like ""how you feeling babe?""
Like, shit

I feel good
Got some time off, Girl it's been so long
Did you have fun?
'Cause I'ma need a cab just to get me home

King me ‘cause this is my time now
So all you other niggas bow down
‘Cause all I see on me is black crowns
Black crowns

Uh, heavenly father, appoint me to the coronation
I deserve it, brought music for clarification
Envision my past, Egypt reincarnated
Negativity hill, over the hump camels waiting
Never gave up, most of my peers forsaken
One make it, we all make it but I delivered that patient
King chronicles, never write it too logical
Fake niggas saying 'What up, fam?' but we ain’t biological
Hands down to my mother, she the greatest ever
Since I was the only child, wasn’t too much to stress her
Waking up before work, leaving allowance on the dresser
Raising the prince under pressure, no king, no refuge
It’s all good, got homies like Boyz n the Hood
We all good, I mean no matter what circumstances was
Champagne, weed, pills, it do the same
These niggas gassed up, too much butane
Working hard like one day I’ll afford the 4-door Porsche
Approaching every corner cautious
Too much shopping, niggas calling you a target
Too much flossing, niggas gossiping in your blog shit
I rather put one in the air, congratulate careers
Death defying moments, people that I ain’t seen in years
What you running from when you you’re your only fear?
Guess my time is here…
Now

All I see is black crowns
King me ‘cause this is my time now
So all you other niggas bow down
‘Cause all I see on me is black crowns
Black crowns

Uh, fatigue, I’m feeling jaded
She gave me the number but I ain’t never saved it
Shit is solid, why these niggas played it?
Drew the right cards, but I ain't get to play it
Determine payrolls, living the lifestyle
You couldn’t be in if you was to see it right now
I think I see it right now
They judge me every day, life on trial
Take your money, niggas betting on my downfall
Many all real hoes, bitches gonna call
Five fingers, pledge allegiance to my one God
We’d have been through hell, so heaven ain’t far
Two cars sedans, tearing it on the way to the Grammys
Guess we nominated, guess they appreciate us
These niggas often imitate us
We just stay creative

All I see is black crowns
King me ‘cause this is my time now
So all you other niggas bow down
‘Cause all I see on me is black crowns

One time in the, one time in the air for the…
Two, two, two times in the, two times in the air for the…
Both hands, both hands, both hands in the air for the…
One time, two times, times…

Just wanted to call to let you know how proud I am
Sweetie, this album is amazing
I have never imagined that God would bless you so much
As he is going to continue to bless you
He’s already made you the king that you are
Only one to wear the black crown
Well, I just want you to know how much I love you
And how awesome you are
And how I am so, so honored to have a son as yourself
I could never have ask for more, you’re just amazing
And I am just so excited for this album
I think this album is definitely your baby
And it’s definitely gonna be heard by a lot of people
And a lot of people are going to love it
They’re gonna love it, love it, love it
And God’s gonna continue to bless you with all the talents that you…

Truth be told, it's all lies
These the days of out lives
Why you wasting all of your time?
Voices from the skies
Said that evil fall in yo rise
They judge me low to the dirt
Then they celebrate to of my highs
Why you-Why you wanna be fake, I fucking hate you
Why you made cause I ain't take you?
Last day alive, I wouldn't even date you
""I'll replace you with somebody better"" that you only make up
We just make up, wake up king and queen and rule the world a little later
Later on in that day, tears all in her face
I said I’m going away
She begging me to stay
Took a look in her eyes, then she put my hands on her waist
Said, “Don’t leave, we’ve got a baby on the way”

I'm re-arranging my life, I'm single and now I laugh
All of the moments we had, beginning and just the end
At the end, stealing friends, heard I was on your hit list
Damn, now I'm driving Ferrari fucking random bitches
People saying I made it but I don't feel too different
Wayne told me ""close your eyes, they'll never see your vision""

Just compare me to dope dealers and ball players

Muhfucka I'm gone!

Middle finger to my haters, muhfucka why you hating? I'm gone

Leave the beat shit alone, leave the bullshit at home, I'm gone
Even though I'm out of here, nigga gotta keep it real, I'm gone

She fuckin' with me, these niggas ain't fuckin' with me
Got my mind on my money, my money piling up hundreds
You say you did it, I done it
You old nigga, I'm younger
You fold up under pressure
I'm good straight in it stretchers
Bitches pecking my wood: wood chuckka chuckka
Never gave 2 fucks: double rubbers
Now your color turn your face to a red gusher
And your girl stick it to me like a car bumper
Never depended on anyone co-dependent
Kept my thoughts to myself, I don't need opinions
No middle mans, in the middle of my sands
Niggas thing they sweet, they can't even pay their incidentals
I'm instrumental, on any instrumental
I ain't pullin' teeth, nigga better hide your pillow
To these rappers to the fucking grizzle
Bad to the bone, red zippers, mike jizzle, I'm gone

Middle finger to my haters, muhfucka why you hating? I'm gone
I ain't really wanna do it but I did it to em, nigga I'm gone
Leave the beat shit alone, leave the bullshit at home, I'm gone
Even though I'm out of here, nigga gotta keep it real, I'm gone

I say, fuck sleep stayed up
Fuck you, pay up
Always got the paycheck
Never took a pay cut
Payday will be worth all the broke nights I stayed up
So in my cup I'm mixing up whatever dreams are made of
Not too many young g's made of what I am
So I was waiting on a doctor man, patient as I am
I guess a young d-boy made it into a man
With girls half-naked around like we finna land the sand
Red-eyes to Rome and they connecting to France
With some bomb-ass pussy, that bitch came straight from Iran
My jewelry made in japan, I'm off California drugs
And where I made my money? nigga, all of the above
I could count my inner circle on my hands and my feet
Passing joints long as a branch cause it's family tree
Doing ""kush-ups"" man cause the weed too strong

Tires spinning, fast cars, fast women
And I just wanna get a night with a happy ending

Lift your glass, make a toast, we around the map
His and hers, Hermes bags, left the tag

Chillin' on top, get away, just a flight

She's so relentless, body of a goddess
Gotta take her higher
Rain through my window pane, she the fire to my flame

It's cold down there but it's lonely up here
The world's so cold you gonna need a moncler

With that top off and that drop head
Pull up on ‘em, they drop dead
Niggas talkin’ that bird shit
When them birds came, they was not dead
And I was out there with that work
From the 15th to the 1st
My clique mean and they merk
We’ll let them clips squeeze like dirt
When it come to them dollars, nigga, why bother?
These niggas don’t want no problems
‘Cause I’ll kill all y’all dead, put a price on your head
Get your brain, I doubt it
I be on that fly shit – M-O-B that mob shit
Boy, I’m talkin’ G5 shit

That’s right, I am YMCM, Grave Street, play that, there
Burnin’ up the track like a motherfuckin’ matchstick,
You know that’s him
Tryna shine when you come around stars like us
They do look dim
Ain’t got your game tight, ain’t got your swag up
Shame on them
Your legs too little and your T-Shirt big

For the love of my clique, we up in this bitch
So sorry that your girl’s suckin’ my dick
Throwin’ money in the air like I’m sick of this shit

Tyga,"I ain't tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue

Yea, got some shit on my mind

Uh first off, this song, meant to be tooken wrong
Bad intentions and all, don't want the problem resolved
Heard it was you, I'm like ""no not my dawg""
Went to school together took the bus and all,
Back of flashin' cars, tryna be a boss
Tryna fit in with the hustlers, they told us run along
Tryna learn to shoot dice, got my bike stolen dawg
Used to wanna gang bang, ride deep in cars
'Til I see the nigga wrong hat, now his head off
Picked up a notepad, thought you gon' do the same
Wrote down the shit I saw, now I don't look at shit the same
Now how am I to blame for you choosin a life you made?
Nigga you a man too, why you mad at me?
Same gravity hold you down, that's embarrassing
Your comments was hilarious, not even congratulations
Told niggas we're related, even when I made it
Had nothing but good things to say about you even though you still hated
I know you think ‘cause this fame I'm probably jaded
Ain't get a chance to see yo daughter, tell her happy belated
For me, I don't care if that car lease, you in it you own it
And that's all me, being smart don't mean cheap
You could take a life sitting in that driver's seat
Take your shades off, I'm like (Remember me?)

I ain't tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
If you know what you say then say who you are
We ain't gotta take it this far
So go on, make a diss song, this is not a diss song
They just wanted this song, tell 'em play this song
I ain't tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
Listen to this song

Lookin' at my story, breakin' down my glory
Judging my highlights when it's shots like Horry
Always tryin' to take from me, criticize, hate on me
Wanna call me fake cuz you really can't relate to me
Your remarks, playin league out of character
You social past couldn't make a dollar in America
On your keyboard cuz I blew up like a keloid
Me boy, why you niggas gotta be a kill joy?
I gave you niggas something to ride to
Gave you niggas something to get fly to
Gave you niggas something to die to
Niggas want the fast life, barely in the drive-thru
I advise you, do what yo life allow you to
You're a fare nigga? It's cool, I was once too
All that feedback, really don't need that
You like it? Buy it,
You don't? Don't cop it
Continue to be great but my eyes lit
Ignorance is bliss so I can't blame your ignorance
It's irrelevant, I'm relevant
I'm big event so go ahead and vent
(I'm big event so go ahead and vent)

I ain't tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
If you know what you say then say who you are
We ain't gotta take it this far
So go on, make a diss song, this is not a diss song
They just wanted this song, tell 'em play this song
I ain't tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
Listen to this song
Listen to this song
This song, if you know what you say then say who you are
We ain't gotta take it this far
I ain't tryna diss you
I ain't, tell em play this song
I ain't tryna diss you
Make a diss song
Tell em play this song
This song
This song

Bells ring, let the birds sing
Had to sacrifice, never knew what pain will bring
This moment of clarity
I do it for my auntie's nephew, never had a niece
They call it spoken word, don't want it to speak
Don't mix them colors with whites as if it was bleach
Back of the bus, niggas fightin' over window seats
Tryna compete, (T-Raww's)
Make this idea complete
Ryan just got killed, who is he to blame?
God rest his soul, tryna protect his gold chain
It's rules to the shit, but just it ain't a game
Give or take, niggas still gon' violate
Not up for discussion, load and cockin' and bussin'
You tough? It's always someone tougher sayin' fuck we's in public motherfucker
I kept it 1000 to be exact
Went from hood racks to Maybach's, how real is that?
Plaques on the wall, wall match the chrome gat
Got pack backpack backpack, rap whenever was that
Niggas fire arms like they fuckin' fist gone
These simple heartbeats, that's a real diss song

Tyga,"Blam blam with them Nina's, turn up like Tina

So all my money be even
I don't shop at Ikea
Got a beach house for the weekend
My bitch bad that's an understatement
Got a porno, might leak it
I Hail Mary to the deep end
I charge the pussy like defense
Crazy motherfucker
How you in that Benz and you ain't got cake?
Better use your legs, do what a pimp say

Driving, but my mind in the back,
You are alone but it's quiet cause we argued prior to that
I left my phone, stopped for gas, then some girl named Janet called
Said it really pissed you off and you let it build a wall
Emotions tall, we're in the mall and some random girl call
And Mina text it back, I ain't trying to lose it all,
Cause family first and pussy last, the last pussy that I had
It was good, but she ain't no trophy to brag
But I should do it anyway, cause we could fall off any day
And you'll be right back to where you was ,yeah, your momma place,
And things are safe and bills are paid and you just lay around
Man, you're so spoiled now, only child!
Business as usual, while you yell our business so loud
Bringing these groupie bitches around me
Ain't your friends, they're fowl
Swear also they tell addresses in your mail
First to say, ""I told you so!""
But first off, ain't they all alone?
Yeah, I told you so, you keep your enemies too close
Not everybody anti know, we're supposed to be like on the low!
Remember before we've been down this road
Tie your flat on the slope,
Came to a stop as soon as I spoke,
Cause you know

I wanna tell the world about you
But it’s like, you sworn to secrecy!
Why do we sacrifice? Growing up to fall in love so fast
Hope we don't become enemies!
I put my faith in God, you put your faith in me
Now I'm trying to keep my sanity!
Why do we sacrifice to fall in love so fast?
Man, I hope we don't be enemies
I'm still seeking!

I ran into my ex like the other day
Didn’t wanna let you know ‘cause usually you look the other way.
Despise face with hatred
Visions of me and her naked
Lies, you can't take it
Cheated before, but not much lately!
Lately I've been so into this shit, love is amazing!
Said you was amazing spending your time
All of your time until the days end
But it's one person you relate with
You go wild and lay with!
Never been good with relationships
Life difficult, she make it basic
Yeah, when it basic I drive slow, your body in my control
It's my control, ain't gotta go
No way, just pose like Phil Gold!
Let the time go, we'll go, too
No telling what I might do without you cause
I got a pass and you do too
But I ain't gotta judge what you've been through, cause:

I wanna tell the world about you
But it’s like, you sworn to secrecy!
Why do we sacrifice? Growing up to fall in love so fast
Hope we don't become enemies!
I put my faith in God, you put your faith in me
Now I'm trying to keep my sanity!
Why do we sacrifice to fall in love so fast?

Last time, best time, better than my next time
Rolex invest time, Moet it's sex time.
Hard to let go, a part of you gon' be alone
Scrolling your phone, looking at texts, seems like not too long ago
Ain't the same better than the rest
And what's real love if you ain't got respect?

Rolling weed since '99, smoke so much I'll probably fly
If I don't smoke I'll probably die

I love women and power
We used to sit and talk for hours
On the balcony, my condo play your favorite, shawty
No love lost, just the perfect soulmate, that's all
It's my fault, caught in a rupture
Should've been you I was touchin', I knew it wasn't
My ego, I was buzzin' but not how you wanted
Too busy tryna flaunt it, like I just bought it
You know them bitches 'round you can't hold water
This s'posed to be our moment
These pills set it, I'm feelin' better
Called you to tell you I love you
But you too busy with some other shit, I'm guessin'
No texts, no proof, no voice messages
How we become enemies so effortless?
Or was I blind when you was naked?
Or high when you was level
Know time is of the essence
No lie, I live and regret it
Decisions I made, embedded in my mind
Hate to admit it
But I gotta say it one time

Should've treated you right
But every night I was livin' life in the fast lane
I should've put my focus on you
In the club every night
I just get it wrong when you do right
And I keep just fillin' your head with the lies, oh baby
This shit comes with a price
A nigga should've loved you better
Oh (couldn't get you right)
A nigga should've loved you better

A nigga should've loved you better
Should've took the time, to get you all the time
Now you're out of sight, (oh baby) still on my mind

This ain't who you fell in love with
You say you need space
Don't do this
Just look at me
One more time
I know I fucked up but I'm tryin' to please you
I'ma give you all
And your heartache and pain's gonna stop
Baby right here
Don't walk away
There is no one left to call
Don't wanna be alone when you disappear
I know I hurt you more than three times
Now you need me time
Fuck I'm s'posed to do in the meantime?

They said it's racist, black on black faces
Can't portray a nigga when you're called it daily
Days I've dreamt, defeated diplomatic immunity
Ain't shit safe, livin' in a gated community
I put miles on this hooptie, my hero was Tookie
Never seen real life like a gangster movie
Though we kept that Uzi, black gators, we're movin'
Like pharaohs in tombs, bitch, I'm back in tune, bitch
Black out the room, we birthed into this
Who is this new nigga? Who is he proving?

23 years behind bars, no father, shoulder to lean on
No love lost, just cold found

Wanna pass a better generation down
Cosigned since a child, let him make his way down
A man who they praise now, gon' kneel down, say a prayer loud
I'm here, niggas actin' like I had invitations

I swear to God I'm ain't comin' back, don't wait for you
You know it's all love, heart attack, heart attack
I told the money where my heart at, no comin' back
And niggas take that money though
Niggas take that money though (I know I did)
And now I'm formed with no assists
Spend the gain with my main bitch
Comin' down in that lane switch
Stuntin' on these lame niggas
What the fuck yo name is, don't care what yo name is
And I be on the same block with the same Glock
I ain't the same now, I ain't the same now and she know

Not a faint on me now when you fade away
Tell me, is you down for me, you down from me
'Cause I don't trust that, I'm over that, I'm done with that

Tyga,"Stand back, God talk
The watch cost

First things first I pop, slay all the honeys
Ain't it funny? Angel, I got devils wanting money
Seems sacred but get naked
My penetration is all revelations
And my eyes only seeing basic, they foul flagrant
Infatuated with the bracelets, diamond-cut player
You fallacious, not complacent
Competition, I'm your favourite, knock knock
It's me, motherfucker, you're dead wrong
Turning your doorknob, a heartthrob
Never my title but you bitches getting robbed
I rhyme and flip lines so far ahead of my time
My punchlines is lemon lime
I'm sour, nigga, sweeter than pine
I'm God's gift like Christmas time
The money Jewish but it's black on black crimes
They box me in from time to time
For a Rolex, is you willing to die? You willing to die, nigga?
Oh shit, nigga, you a rich nigga?
Does your wrist glitter? How much your car engine?
I can tell you got six figures
Figure you ain't no real nigga
You don't struggle like real niggas
Probably snitch on a real nigga
Just to get you out of bed, nigga
Well let's see, my God is your God
If he got faith in me, go and pull the trigger
And leave it be, nigga
Russian roulette, let's make a bet
100 on black, I'm back with a vengeance, the villain is vicious
Heart of gold is relentless, book of Genesis
Don't eat the apple, but you'd rather live ravish
Street savvy, but not wealthy
Good health, be blessed, tryna reach the heavens
One day as I pray, halo over me
As I lay back, chick on my lap everyday, this God talk

This God talk
This God talk
Let God talk
Stand back lil nigga, let God talk

Tryna follow Christ, but this club light super bright
And they pay me cash every single night
Taking models back to the crib
I know you want my life, you don't want my life
Couldn't handle what they write about you
The Superman of height, you can get 'em high
But how far is you willing to climb for your own shine?
Blowing shine, papers let a nigga vibe, letting God talk
I'm like when summer approach
Niggas thinking they're good, but they're more TO
I'm known coast to coast, you tryna play God
With the devil's robes
It's only one God, boy, you far from close
Been ready, change cars like winter coats
Niggas bubblegum, Winterfresh, in they Easter clothes
No lint on my Easter clothes
Resurrect, the prophet spoke

This God talk
This God talk
Let God talk

Tyga,"You know it’s only good pussy that I'm used to
Now this good dick only thing you used to
Anything less couldn't hear her with a bluetooth
Laced up, tongue out, stuntin’, actin’ brand new
They ain’t even know you was steppin’ in Giuseppe too
37 spare bright jeans 'bout 12 jewels
Posin’ like a mannequin, bag, matching manicure
Two ill shawites in the Benz Jeep, heaven sent
Ever since you was little had a silver spoon
How they make it hard for you shoulda made a song for you
And the world is your stage, turn on the lights for you
Lighting up one in the crowd I be rootin’ for you
If it don't go well, well, I'm still rootin' for you
Lean on me if you need help, I'm a tutor to you
Put me in the cell, hit a nigga when you ready to
Better when it's late night I'mma just drive through

I know it's hard for you
Do it too well, I don't wanna see you fail
They just try and make it hard for you
I know it's hard for you
Even though you a star to ‘em
Everybody need love just pick up the phone and Imma come through
And make it hard for you

And you know the summer’s mine, fuck with a winner
Had to show you shit they ain’t really wanna show you
Imma put you on game, run game on these other bitches
Told her never show no love for a bitch nigga
Keep it all business if you fuckin’ with 'em
Never let your guard down even when the stars ‘round
Got a love it baby, if you in it for the long haul
If you pacing I can show your ass how to last long
I don’t wanna see you up in every video
Every year All-Star cities I go
If there’s money to be made I can understand
But don't fuck up your brand for a grand, you understand?
Somewhere in Miami gettin’ all tan
With a flock of all tens, talkin' bout who they fuckin’
Ducks swim together baby just remember that
You got too much potential to lose so get rid of that

I know it’s hard for you
You do it too well, I don't wanna see you fail
They just try and make it hard for you
Well me, I just fall for you
Even though I'm a star to you
Everybody need love just pick up the phone and I’ll come through
And make it hard for you

Spendin’ all your time on the internet
Checkin off your wish list, things that you wanna get
Make a nigga pay for it, they ain't gotta wait for it
They just wanna fly you out, maybe bring a friend for ‘em
I can tell you over that, been through hell and back
Fuckin’ with the wrong one, you ain’t try to double back
Time to find some love for that, lay up and cuddle that
In the club gettin’ on, rather chill in bubble bath, parlayin'
And I know I ain't saying much
But you gotta learn to give trust
Even when it’s no trust, you gotta find some
Being young on your own it’s like the world against ya
I can bet I could preach that
Appreciate what I do for that
It’s more what I came from if you cater back
Lemme guide you, get inside you, style you
Is what I'm getting at

It’s hard for you
It’s too easy if it’s all for you
Anything that can ball for you
Don't wanna make it hard for you
When the sun rise, you be right there
Still shining like a star to ‘em
Everybody need love just pick up the phone, I’ll come through
And make it hard for you",Hard for You,2015

Looking at headlines, it's all a lie
But who are you and I to decide, (Just tryna get by)
And that's pure, like virgin blood mixed with 1-51 one sip
Will make a nigga flip, I ain't tripping off shit
That happened yesterday, 'cause I just wanna rest today, in pure luxury

All my life I wanted luxury
A roof over to sleep
Family, that's luxury
All I ever hung around was G's
Breaking bread with the homies, that's luxury
Something like virgin blood that's pure and she screaming out ""Its yours""
All I ever wanted was luxury
Now all I got is luxury, come fuck with me

20 bandana, cross my fingers when in danger
I protect you perfect stranger, put that body on a hanger
Her man's in Herman, better floss don't need a fucking filla
Hold my hand, your halo's fading, pesos and Pinot Grigio
Bless the newborns, my comrades they ride for me
It's not the game, you just a casualty
War ruins who after me
Surviving, could have been a tragedy
Ninth grade, in a driver seat
Skipping class, no time to speak
Truth be told this honesty
Poker face and poke her highness next to me
I'm soaking royal altercationally
Not complacent, want the cake and cream
Settle in, you just another lawyer fee
I don't smoke that reggie seed, high at the presidential suite
And I ain't at the legion seat nigga, overseas
With Sheiks that's royalty nigga
You can bet that, my tux black
My bitch black and I'm backing out
That ghost black, black AMEX
Ain't gotta say shit, hold the faith

All my life I wanted luxury
A roof over to sleep
Family, that's luxury
All I ever hung around was G's
Breaking bread with the homies, that's luxury
Something like virgin blood that's pure and she screaming out ""its yours""
All I ever wanted was luxury
Now all I got is luxury, come fuck with me",Pure Luxury,2015

Filin' the sins of another can lock you away
And you can knock on any door, from now until eternity
And you can keep on lookin' anywhere, you won't find another man like me

In her eyes, shimmers twilight, drivin' hard, it gives up the fight
And she fights it back, knowing that the dam could break wide open

I called up everyone I found, but didn't talk to no one
And the rain comes down as if it's trying to wash me away
And there ain't no romantic movin' lines, like they say

[Chorus]
Standing alone, like I got nowhere to go
Standing alone, like the day that I was born

Out on my own, I believe this boy has grown, standing alone
Ain't no way to take a blow when every cheek's been turned
I can't show another side when every side's been burned
I'm helpless, can't fight a raging heart

And I got no use for bein' torn apart
And the world don't seem to have no use for me
'Cause you've given nothing, and nothing isn't free

[Chorus]

You can't keep it all inside, I need someone else to stand with me by my side
Give me something to fight, something to hold on to
I just don't want to be standing alone

And the rain comes down as if it's trying to wash me away
And there ain't no romantic movin' lines, like they say

Soared to Taco Bell and I ordered some gorditas (Mmm, that's good!)
Wanted four more, ordered 'em, didn't eat 'em
Then head to Thebe's house for some gymnastics
Fantastic, I backflip on this beat B
Cause we running shit like the Dingleberry's on four cheetahs
Flow colder than Papa Joe's or Domino's (Fuck it, whatever, um)
Trashwang scratched inside the knucks
Got some One Direction tickets, I should hit that up
Drive by with puppy signs plastered on the truck
Then see how many of they fans could fit inside the trunk
Move over the microwave and the cannabis
Try to take the van and the whole band to Canada
Fuck the block news and the venues, they can't handle us
They can't stand us including fruits that Frank's channeling
The Ku Klux Klan see me and my managers
But thank me when they ask where the Five Panels is (fuck)
Man, I suck now, I ain't still dope (nope)
But Chris and Rihanna's fuckin' again so there's still hope
Oh fuck, I went there, balling bitch, I'm Ben's hair
Y'all barely breaking like Taco's self-esteem in a thin chair
Old Navy bitches love this gap, yeah this grin's rare
Watch a nigga smile like five-year-old child
I'm kicking it with Nak and the nigga from Green Mile, it's
Red Bull in this cup so a nigga may seem wild but
That's just all the sherm I was burning a little while ago
Don't let me get hold of that rifle
Shout my nigga Sage Elsseser and Sean Pablo
Surrounded by them niggas that skate with a sick style
And some freckled bitches with giant peaches that's vile
They never did catch that rhino

Squadron full of some lost souls
Sergeant of all, it's autumn and Nak just nollied a pothole
Non-cooperative with his momma's wishes for college
And coppers labeled a problem since paying for Damianos
So shimmy through the swamp, nigga, follow me through the foxholes
Moral Orenthal with a pretty bitch in a Bronco
Hopped right off the seven and stumbled into some Vatos
Threw a punch, got jumped, dusted off and then walked home
Shit, it's like 6 p.m. and his temple throbbing
Hand in the cabinet by seven, sniff the prescription oxies
Logo in the boxes, all my niggas hostile
Cautious of your crosses, scoffing at your doctrines
Bitches augmented stupid as the group is
Only slightly, write precise to get a pussy nigga two chins
Man these stitches shut the loose lips, stumbled in a Ruth's Chris
Slid into a booth and hid the luggage from his shroom trips
See, Lionel ball with Leonardo on the weekend now
And Maui on a scenic route, we on the second season now
Small fry got 'em seasons salty, weeded, coughing
Ease up off me, end is breathing easy as bulimics barfing
From a different breed of doggy, from a different seed and cloth

Pen? Naw, probably written with some used syringes
From out the rubbish bin at your local loony clinic
Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented
On the hunt for clues, more food, and some floozy women
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch
Gooey writtens, scoot 'em to a ditch, chewed and booty scented
Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose with spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms
Stupid, thought it up, jot it quick, thought out
Toss it right back like a vodka fifth
Spot him on a rocket swapping dollars in for pocket lint
Then lob a wad of chicken at a copper on some Flocka shit

Played her something nice and slow,

I wanna roll down the windows, 
Crank it til the speakers blow, 
By now you outta know
Ya play me somethin' that a rocks, 
Knocks me outta these flip flops,

They don't feel like they used to feel
My religion feels wrong, but I can't tell my mom
I'm afraid that my words would kill

I think I still believe in Jesus

But my demons get me high
'Til I'm burning all the time

As Sunday service got me anxious
It's the reason that I was depressed
I could see it on their face
I did not deserve His grace
So I skipped the holy sacrament

I swear I still believe in something
But I couldn't pray the gay away
So if I'm the wicked one
I'm still my mama's son
And you'll never take that love away

Something's in the distance

My memory gets fogged

I'm only a man, I'll do as much as I can
I can't help it if I'm that way

Don't blame me for something I can't change
It's not my second nature to be good like you

Why stop I'm on a role
I'm trying to do good get in a better mood 
Then we can really tear up the floor
Well, things haven't changed, baby, I'm still the same 
I'm not perfect and you should be glad
Take one look and listen to me play 
And you can see I'm not half bad

Run around day and night barely never time to fight 
We're different from all the rest
How do you do it, putting up with me
Let me tell you baby you're the best
Well, it makes no sense having us apart
You'd have to see it or you'd be blind
When we're together I'm so confused
When we're apart your on my mind

Let's take a break from our life all the pain all the strife
It sounds too good to be true
Living my life and singing my songs

Every night? 
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright

Thinkin' bout her eyes and hair

You're my one and only care
But my heart you have to spare

Where would you go when I'm not there
And what would you do about me and you
Do you even care

Your soft touch and your kiss
Now my heart is spilling bliss cause of you
And if I had only one wish
To say goodbye and to dismiss

And I'm sending you a signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
But it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long dusty road of mine

And I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone, away
I ain't missing you
No matter what my friends say

And there's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
If I can't wish this distance (huh)
Stop this heartache all alone

I ain't missing you at all
Since you've been gone away 
I ain't missing you 
No matter what my friends say 
I ain't missing you (yea missing you) 
Since you've been gone away (missing you) 
I ain't missing you (yea missing you) 
No matter what your friends say 
Hey yea yea yea 
I ain't missing you at all 
Since you've been gone away 
I ain't missing you at all 
No, and no matter what my friends say",Missing You,2006
Tyler Hilton,"What was that about the ballroom dancing class I asked about
It's all I've thought about ?cause you were saying
We might get a chance to talk and talk might lead to dance
And maybe dance might lead to dates and dates to aging

Hope you let your intuition
Precede my reputation
'Cause I have one

I am what you see
I am not what they say
But if I turned out to be
Could you love me anyway

Standing anonymous
Hoping your heart will just
Wake up and ask for me by name
Maybe someday you?ll ask for me by name
Just not today

Well, if this is love then it?s hard to say
With your notes and your books and your reaching away
And I've confidence issues with your intentions

And I'm not hip to all your tricks
With your algebra and your politics
And the band has planned a hotel intervention

Don't you leave me by my lonesome to exceed my reputation
'Cause I have one

I am what you see
I am not what they say
But if I turned out to be
Could you love me anyway

Standing anonymous
Hoping your heart will just
Wake up and ask for me by name
Maybe someday you'll ask for me by name
Just not today

I'm always here
I've walked you home
Then headed for my own
Until again I?m need

I am what you see
I am not what they say
But if I turned out to be
Could you love me anyway

I am what you see
I am not what they say
But if I turned out to be
Could you love me anyway

Where did you go?
I thought I knew you,

You don't look different, but you have changed.

I cannot hear.
Your voice is soothing,

You don't sound different,

I'm looking through you, 
You're not the same. 

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight. 

You're thinking of me, 
The same old way.
You were above me, 
But not today.
The only difference is you're down there.

You've stirred this wonderfully right
I'm traveling, you know, so that's how I've ended up here

There's that couple in love
Young and like one I am of

And I don't know what I'm doing here

But I've got this lingering doubt

Everyone says that it's true
They say my woman's the best thing I got
So I'm being faithful to you, love
I'm being faithful to you

Wave your hearts in the air
Someone's sure to take care
Oh, constable help me I think that I've almost lost mine

And I've heard there are families of four or five
Crossing an ocean it's where my
Heart belongs somewhere but I
Couldn't care

Everyone tells me that they understand
Everyone says that it's true
They say my woman's the best thing I got
So I'm being faithful to you, love

I am behind what I say
I don't look at the ladies
But I don't look away
I don't need any hell to pay

The inspiration of a nation innovation
Til I change the talk into a conversation
I'm like a doctor and my patients are anxiously
Waiting healing all the hating
That's faking in the paper chasing
Its hard to live up to these expectations
That I'm facing and gain the admiration
Of an older generation
That's why I'm pacing back and forth
Contemplating, meditating how to use what I've been taught
As a positive force

Oh this is who I am
I wish you'd understand
Its time to set me free

No no matter what I do
I'm still apart of you
I hope you'll always be

I wanna be the greatest in the world
Not for the money,or the fame,or the girls
Not for the car keys,jet skis,or the vacation to the West Indies
But simply 'cause love it
When I write I'm like a puppeteer
Pulling my strings til the melody sings
And it honestly makes me spread my wings
You calling me out
Without your mind
Send that thought back down your spine
I'm on the ground
It's on the line
Road signs say both ways at the same time
Most days I can't wait to rhyme
Express my stress elevate and shine
Progress,regress
Each step's climbed

The passion in Philosophy of possibilities
Every dream is in my reach
I'll find my freedom in this beat
Follow me now it's a brand new ground
Swallow your pride I'll make you proud
All of my life I've lived out loud
We just preached to different crowds

If you're a rapper why is Kris your back up dancer like an extra on soul train
I see your mommy and your daddy in the front row
They must be embarrassed for you bro
You're not a real MC
You should quit hip hop
Now be a good bus boy and go get your mop

Bling, you don't wanna battle
You're the snake without the rattle
You're the boat without the paddle
You're the duck without the waddle
You're the horse without the saddle
The ranch without the cattle
The day without the shadow
Son, I think you should skedaddle 
Kick gravel, sayonara punk arrivederci
What language do I have to say it in for you to hear me clearly 
Adios amigo, you're over with finito 
This clown couldn't rap anything but my burrito 

Kid, you have to hold your mommy's hand before you cross the street
You have to sneak out the house just to clean and sweep
And now you look queasy
I made him go mute
Put your camera phones up so you can post this on youtube
Truth's got a screw loose, he's terrified to bus 
So lightweight that I could blow him over with a gust 
You're weak like seven days, you deserve boos
You should walk around in some high heel shoes, ha
You should rock pigtails and a skirt
You're shaking in your boots, are your feelings getting hurt
Ooh well, maybe I should hurt more than your feelings 
Maybe I should rip the roof off the theater ceiling
Maybe you should start kneeling his eyes are getting misty
Your so whack if you were me you couldn't diss me
Kissy kissy Roxanne did you miss me
I'll take you out to dinner after I've eaten this pip squeak
And when were on vacation I'll let him house sit
Here's a couple bucks buy yourself a better outfit

You know what? 
You don't have a stack of cash you're a flashy pad
I saw you last week driving the taxi cab
Your secret's out, and now they know sport
We'll call you if we need a ride to an airport
In fact, you can drop me off at home after this
Then you can take your couple bucks back, but as a tip
You're playing yourself like solitaire
Telling everyone that's here that you're a millionaire 
You're not a baller, you're a phony
I bet your whole crew is a bunch of rent-a-homies
And now you lie in bed lonely
Your persona's a fade 
The only girls you get are in the pages of a catalog 
Here stands lord of the bluff
His lies were legendary til the truth made him hush
And what's funny is your truth is enough
Why'd you have to make up all the money and the stuff
I guess it's easier to play the role and act hard
'Cause you don't have the guts to tell us who you really are
So you can keep a trophy that you don't deserve
I might be a busboy
But you just got served!",Moment of Truth,2012

Me? I could be in jeans and a hood

She could read my mind, it's like she a psychic
Every night, I'm outside her window
But I can't let her know how I feel, oh

Every time she near, my heart skip a beat

I'm blinded by your shine, you're kinda like the sun
'Cause the world revolves around you 'til my days are done

I had to hit the booth to tell my secrets
See I could spit a line, but it's more than my words
I cannot describe what an angel deserves

Was for another guy
Well I'm that other guy
I'm just a shy kid, camouflaged before your eyes
Then I knew my lyrics were the key to see the other side
I should have told you but I never had the courage
And I thought you really wouldn't understand (No)
And now I'm out here just to let my feelings surface
Apologizing for disguising who I am

Tell me are you who I thought you were
Or who I wanted you to be?
Did you do it all for him
Or were you only playing me?

I did it for you

But I'm back now
And Kris was all this and that
And my look didn't really fit the rap, it didn't match
He had the style and I had the swag
So I locked up my feelings in the words he said
Give me a hand and I'll take off my mask
If you give me a chance, that's all I ask

What ya expecting me to do?
'Cause you were him and now you're you

Now it's just me

And it's tearing me apart

You need so badly to belong
But don't forget to talk to me

If I's all so bitter sweet 
If you're feeling incomeplete
Put your trust in me

Loving you, I shouldn't
You take me, chain me
I have nothing anymore

You want a regular dude, but you think that I'm what you need?
You gonna get in your mood when I bitch in every text you read
So I think I'm gonna let you breed, but I'm the enemy that set you free
I gotta let you know what gets to me, ready or not like a refugee

You complaining when i see you, that I never have time
That I'm busy as a beaver
Gotta face when I feed ya, really need Hennessy

Why you wanna stand and cry the most
All you think I'll get up for you to try the coat
Then knot the ho, really wanna tie the ropes
And buy the ?, And hang Nina by the throat

'Cause you stay on dismay, temper detections
And that's nightly, too much messing with my psyche
That enough hurts, but you fight me
So you must love to dislike me

What did you ever see in me?
Was I only needed be?
I'm running away from your judgement
Don't you try to find me
I won't let you change me anyway, anyway

Yo, I'm feeling stoned now
Sick of having those breakdowns, they gone now
It's on now, I've grown foul, it's wrong how we've shown clouds
You keep your tone out of my dome gal

All the pickin' and the pullin'

And what I'm givin 'em livin 'em diggin a ditch

But you ain't supposed to be my nemesis
Wanna be in ta kiss, then Ima finish it
What happened to close friends with benefits

Away from all the faded dreams and tainted lies
I wanna tear you up and love you all I want

Yelling ""someone"", and when it's done
I'ma treat it like my daughters and son, we having fun

Four in the morning yelling my name so they know it's me
Scramble and try to find my nigga's gun, I'm supposed to be
Prepared for the crazy, my lady screaming don't go to see
Fuck it, I'm going down to the kitchen to get the knife
Invite 'em all in my crib and then take everybody's life

Leave a deep gash, bring the heat fast
Hit 'em with the venom, when I get 'em I'ma keep 'em
Giving them an enema, even if it's ten of 'em
Then I'ma, eat 'em like dinner in the cinema
Then I'ma, shit 'em out, get 'em out
In about twenty-four seconds I'ma fuck 'em in the ass
Tuck 'em in the grass, cut 'em up fast

I can still remember, it was January twenty-third, 1994
And a group of us was chilling at the table
We was drinking with our fingers on the ouija board
Tryna summon spirits asking ""ouija, can you hear us?""
Never thinking what was in store
Then the dogs started barking, in the darkness
All of a sudden it was knocking at the front door
Then we started approaching, cautious as hell as we pulled the door open
Nervous adrenaline, seeming slow motion
No one was there, we went back to the board hoping
That we finally made contact, with the deity
Apparition on the other side
Then it started moving out and soon it was
Spelling out the warning in the morning one of us would die
We decided to stop it, said our goodbyes, and left the apartment
On the way home sarah hit a patch of ice
Lost control of her car, hit the ditch and lost her life

Of escapin' this place and it swept across the nation
That place is pain and tribulation
Instead of wastin' this achin', I give it awakening motivation
Yeah, I burn so you won't have to
I rap through fire flame you wouldn't wanna adapt to
This trying is totally tough, Tech is turbulent

put on a pedestal on a level playing field with them

A therapist who sweared to get you through a crisis
Soon as I write this, you invite this terror to view
So much death around me, stress to drown me

Through my darkness, I created a bright force
The book told me, ""Behold a white horse""
But I didn't fear the death, I'd just report it, I am your life's torch
The pain shows and fame grows
Angel Heart and Evil Brain chose insane flows
To try to control the direction the flame goes
It aims low, then it build up and the thing blow
I don't know why it's the darkness that they desire y'all
Hotter than mixing 151 with grain and fireball

Tyler Sneesby,"When we were kids we ran like INTERPOL.
I killed a copper with a puck of coal.
Put a rock through a saint, made a stained-glass hole.
In the back of the class, we giggled, sniffing rush.
The best of friends, we rode the Islington bus.
Your gum was sweet but the chewing was tough.
I got drunk, I threw up on gin I mixed with orange stuff.

This dream we call familiar
Is like death in golden wraps.
Now if that's true and we both know that,
I'm sorry if I said you were...

Bye bye, Mr. No One.
Bye bye, Mr. Woebegone.

I cracked my head when I fell from the highest rung.
Two poster children wagging blue-green tongues.
Drank pop, ate Pez, laid down and played dumb.
Crashed through a snow fence, some stitches were sewn.
Your face was a window, I crawled from my home.
My life was yours, your blood was my own.
I don't know what I would have done if you never ever left me alone.

This dream we call familiar
Is like death in golden wraps.
Now if that's true and we both know that,
I'm sorry if I said you were fat.
(And I know you still don't like me for that.)

Hey! I don't even know who you are.
I don't even know why I came.
I can't remember your name.
Everyone's a robot when you're a zombie.
I don't even know who you are.
Everyone's a robot when you're a zombie.
You look like someone's been shot.
You look like someone you're not.
Everyone's a robot when you're a zombie.

Can't get what I want,
Not feeling all right

So I dreamt up a life that I could live
And what could be.

Well I had money, Cars and things
The attention and lights.
Looked up and laughed
I was feeling just fine.
Holding it down in this game that we call life.

And I believe
That this game is so much more
I could see
This got me higher enough to soar

Well I was more than just your typical guy
'Cause everywhere I went no one blinked an eye
You could tell that I was the one they wanted to see
Well I knew all the right people with all the pretty faces
Never missed out on extravagant places
A big stack of cash
Will buy me anything.

And I believe
That this game is so much more
I could see
This got my high enough to soar

But I soon lost it all in a game of roulette
I bet my life savings and my red corvette
I had the no good dirt, running on the loser blues
And all of my friends who were supposed to be there
Decided to run to the next millionaire
The dream that I knew, quickly turned into a nightmare

That this is a game and nothing more

Of affection, a step in that direction
'Cause love is about progress not perfection

What you need is some love and appreciation
Gotta treat her like a queen before she walks away.
Before its too late, you gotta, sing it, you better treat her like a lady
Oh ah, treat her like a lady, shes that special lady. 
Yea uh.

You love your homeboys, but you hate these ladies.
Your gonna chose them over her, you crazy?
The ones you post up with, smoke blunts with.
Y'all share the same spit, you might as well kiss.
Now don't get me wrong, I love my dudes,
But I'ma pick a girl anytime I gotta choose,
I like mad, but I love orgasms
And I'm not trying to have the same problems your having.
Cause your confused the scared little dude
Beatin' on your lady 'cause your in a bad mood,
Your insecure, a little unsure,
Don't know how to deal with the feelings so pure.
It's called love, it's joy and pain,
But you gotta take some risk to enjoy the game

What you need is some love and appreciation
Gotta treat her like a queen before she walks away.
Before its too late, you gotta, sing it, you better treat her like a lady
Oh ah, treat her like a lady, shes that special lady. yea uh.",Love and Appreciate II,2008

Tyler Woods,"Let’s Go
Yeah 
I'm alive on arrival

I’m alive and well
I can feel the inner chi
Through the rays of the sun
Shinning down upon me
And even though it pours when i trains
I know that won’t stop me
I gotta fight through the pain
To make a better me

Quel torrent fougueux est ma vie
Je les chevauche avec passion jusqu'au seuil de la nuit
Les cubes m’entraînent au pays où la terre fume petite mort
Emmène-moi auprès de ceux que j’ai perdus
Je t’en prie ne souffle aucune amertumes
L’univers a ses règles, un jour elles nous percutent
46 printemps le cœur plein de rustines
Je m’étais gouré de monde car j’y cherchais la justice
Y’en a pas alors dans la rue m’assure le 
Colt con t’façon on verra bien qui est le plus speed
Faut bien le dire, la plume reste muette
La feuille immaculée lassée par les duels
Quelle importance si la renommée s’étend sur les lèvres?
On pense être fort quand bout le sang dans les veines
Et puis le temps aidant, la lumière change de spectre
La violence est bien l’arme du méchant et du faible
Laisse-moi voir la route, la vie écraser leur régime
Encore plus de 10.000 roses, courber leurs échines
Les flèches rouges du soleil dard te déciment
Frappé en plein cœur, l’une d’elle embrase mes rimes
Je suis en vie

I’m alive and well
I can feel the inner chi
Through the rays of the sun
Shinning down upon me
And even though it pours when i trains
I know that won’t stop me
I gotta fight through the pain
To make a better me

J’ai été élevé à la dure par les rues de cette ville
Pour réussir y’avait la queue, j’ai grugé cette file
Arrive un âge où on perd le sommeil
Et les souffrances ne sont pas compensées par le soleil
Parce qu’on le regarde comme si il nous devait tout
A force de se mettre au centre, on ne sent plus la terre tourner
Et elle boit doucement sous les coups
Combien d’âmes arrachées en une seule journée?
J’ai appris à contempler la nature
Et ma joie ne se mesure pas à la facture
Entre deux univers depuis c’est la fracture
Comme ces condés qui nous matent comme des singes de la voiture
J’ai mis mon cœur à nu dans les courbes des lettres
J’espère que de là-haut mon père approuve mes gestes
Comme rendre grâce pour ce jour, c’est le minimum
Ta vie est mieux gaulée, elle a ses deux nibards en silicone
La paix n’a pas de prix, la foi n’a pas de maître
Accepter que tout meurt est dur à admettre
Que cet arbre sera la caressé par la brise
Le jour où la terre aura effacé ton sourire
Mon œil court sur l’eau qui tourbillonne
Et les cieux à l’horizon s’habillent en vermillon
Les hirondelles volent sur la citadelle
La ville s’éveille, au loin une voix délivre son appel
Je suis en vie

I’m alive and well

On ne va pas jouer les gros minets là où y'a plein d'chattes
D'où on vient, dans les clubs, y'a des gunshots
Ça fait rêver ceux qui n'y vivent pas
Nous on fait tout pour que nos mômes n'y grandissent pas
Et s'ils sortent ne prenne pas de balle perdue
Dis-leur qu'être bon ce n'est pas toujours être bien vu

Et que sert leur vices

Prends-la comme elle vient, prends ce qu'elle te donne
Y'en aura pas d'autres, une par personne
Ni reprise ni échange
Même avec le ticket
En ce qui concerne la chance
La belle est bien trop occupée
Prends-la comme une course d'obstacles
Et affrontes les tous
(Juste au cas où) Après tout on sait pas c'que y'a au bout
La roue tourne alors kiffe maintenant chaque rayon
Et pense à toutes celles a qui on a mis un maillon

J'ai oscillé dans ma jeune vie
Entre Glocks et lumineux
Stock de phrases fortes
Et glocks volumineux

De la chance, et être en paix sous le ciel bleu
De la France, enfant gâtée qui a dit qu'on ne savait pas

Un de ces soirs où la chance vous invite à boire
C'est à croire que ce jour-là j'avais vraiment soif
(Alors j'ai bu) Parfois j'nous revois à nos débuts
J'kiffe ma vie, déjà parce que j'en ai une décente
J'ai pas à craindre chaque nuit que les bombes descendent
Elle est ce qu'elle est mais c'est la seule que j'ai
Alors dès les premiers jets faut marquer l'essai

J'kiffe ma life comme elle est
Cool est sa cadence
Sans prises de tête, tue à trop d'extravagance
(On peut toujours avoir plus)
Et taguer son bonheur avec un logo Brabus
Même si le ciel tonne
Gardes le cap, j'suis libre comme l'air
Le clébard de personne
J'veux faire c'que j'aime et ne pas faire comme
Du rap hardcore en polo vert pomme

On est que de passage
Et le temps ne s'étire pas
Ne s'édite pas
C'est tout droit jusqu'au prochaine étage
D'ici là j'vais garder le bon, lâcher le naze
À chaque pas, j'veux faire gaffe (à l'erreur d'aiguillage)
La changer, ouais j'ai dû y songer
Une de ces fois où submergé on se met en danger
Mais la vie est précieuse et mon but est précis

If there is and you know her, 
Show her!

Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me!

"Tyler, the Creator","My window is a book and I'm a fuckin' crook
Stealin' phones to call home but the line is off the hook
And if my mother answer, I'll ask her
What she wants on 25th because I'm chillin' with Prancer
Rudolph, Adolf, Hitler
Rollin' with nineteen 88's like it's 1988
But my speakers are bleedin', the doctor's in uniform
Fuck cars I have a damn unicorn
That flies me to places, with spaceships, that don't need money
Where I can free at hand, eat candy with Easter bunnies
Where donuts equal water, inhalers and mushrooms
And we don't have cars, we have balloons and we zoom through
Sound and the bass is astoundin'
The snare plays square no roundin'
Major ninth chords tower synth like it's Yao Ming
Kobe, imaginary friends, fuck homies (They don't know me)
The tooth fairy blow me, swallow don't shit this
With my Donald Trump hair piece you're an apprentice
You're fired and tired, you can't stay up like a limp dick
If you think you can spit then I am the fuckin' dentist
My visions that I record, the instruments I adore
The happiness that I hoard (can't be bought) at liquor stores
You faggots can buy chains but Utopia can't afford
And they sore on hatin' reality that I ignore
You can try to walk inside my brain but I close the door
Fuck dogs, I roll around with my pet dinosaur
Yeah, Hodgy Beats (Drop it)

Fuck dogs, walk around with a pet dinosaur
Wing flaps on the back of my pet rhinosaur
Gold chains, twenty-four, niggas must be shinin' more
The money gets closer when you seem to be grindin' more
And it feels better than a tongue-kiss
Carbonated with the flow, orange-flavored Sunkist
We musically grow unto the world like a fungus
Amongst this, playin' the piano like a trumpet
Little guy, but his words sound so humongous
Eat 'til you obese, arteries clot, need lunges
MellowHype from Ralph Lauren to the Hundreds
My crew cliqued up like Brady Bunch is
The captain that crunches, invitin' you to lunches
My nutrition have robots malfunction
I suggest you stay away from the factory
My breath chemical, I don't know how you'll react to me
It's a dog-eat-dog world so I double doggy dare it
Hold it in my hand as I stare it
Down, like a magnifyin' glass to a diamond with a karat
I read through niggas that bluff like a tarot
They copy my actions, I call them fools parrots
I'm the pyro with one eyelid that weareth
Long hair for wisdom while bitch mades nair it
I don't care if the heat I throw is unbearable
Just know, it's shareable, and there I go, where I go
I don't know, obviously I disappear
Close your eyes bitch, I'm all in your ear
I have your hearts as if I stabbed it with a spear
And wrote my flows with your blood smears
If you can't see a legend, I'mma make it clear: nigga I'm right here

The Odd Future compilation
Fuck, give it up

Will y'all shut the fuck up?
Damn, I’m here
Alright, let me configure this
Get this ready
Alright, let’s go

Nigga seventeen his own fucking magazine
And of course his Hunger Force is Aqua Teen by all means
Fuck a deal, signature is legible
I'm the reason why niggas is heatin' up they vegetables
From being bullied in the sixth, to being dissed by any bitch
That can breath, please throw me in a ditch
And I hope I sell a copy of this disk
Fuck Hope, I am one short, a miracle of wish
Whether you nigga or ese, the magazine is great
Because the articles an essay
Half you dumb niggas can't even write an essay
'Cause all of ya'll some stupid asses, S.A
You motherfuckers in denial
I'm the square just like the tile, right down the fucking isle
Music was my only friend, ever since I was a child
I make niggas frown, just to give myself a smile
Mother was my father, the nigga didn't bother
To send a kid a dollar, my only role model was
Niggas that record and that could play keyboards
And wild piano chords make me happy
Dr. Seuss more important than Jesus
Y'all immigrants to depression, nigga give me a visa
We sick, the same lames that sneeze us
Made us turn to Jazz now, because the black kids would tease us
I need a fucking chain, I need to make it rain
I need some fucking rims, a car that I can rent
A verse about swag, jeans sagging off my ass
No I don't, fuck that, I am not a fucking fag
I rhyme and I'm still scared of guns
In the marching band but I bang my own drums and
Sing my own song, all of my wrongs are right
Never got into a fight, hit me
Bass, drum, snare, let it go
Disappear like good music in the past year
And everybody do the same thing, I hear the same shit
All the time, like the radio is queer
This isn't a mixtape, it's more of ear rape
By kids who think you other niggas suck
It's very offensive, you niggas defensive
If you can't take the heat then get the fuck out the kitchen, listen

"Tyler, the Creator","This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought some food for death, go 'head and fuckin' eat
My father's dead well I don't know, we'll never fuckin' meet
I cut my wrist and play piano cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so posessed
This meetin' just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son

My mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckas
Are much important I'm gettin' angrier while recordin'
I'm feelin' like the Bulls, I've got a Gang of Wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up on they mental
Simple but probably not, fuck 'em

I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up like a tampon, but keep the lamp on
Cause this album packs enough evil
That you can't fit inside a jansport, go to school with this

I go from AP to JC inside of fuckin' week
Wakin' up with random girls like ""Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?""
I stay with grandma, she always bitchin' about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honour classes
By those slow as molasses, take this shit to school

Raquel treat me like my father like a fuckin' stranger
She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecomin', demons runnin'
Inside my head tellin' me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothin' but nightmares I caught, go to sleep

I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
Fuck me the monster said, some how the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, max keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is evil
My fuckin' samples are too illegal, play this shit in church

I graduated without honors or a fuckin' father
He died, no bitch, don't even fuckin' bother
I wanted a brother my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fuckin' situation
That's havin' our brains racin' like Dayton, wearin' some fuckin' heelies

I know you fuckin' feel me, I want to fuckin' kill me
But times I'm so serious you think I'm silly
I'm doin' Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11-7
What's religion nigga? I am Legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talkin' 'bout Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressin' their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad I'mma toss it eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's somethin' I inherit
My mother's all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Malonda decide to fuckin' share
This confused boy, I wanna hug all ya, I???m bad for you kids to listen to
Soy is not the choice, I'm bad milk, drink it

My wrist is all red from the cutter
Drippin' cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fuckin', if I'm kissin'
But I'm sittin' here downin' beers simply just wishin'
With tear they try to tell me but I never listen
Cause I don't give a shit like sittin' down pissin'
Eighteen, still talkin' to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully momma will attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this

So I can tell him how much I fuckin' hate him in detail",Bastard,2009

When it comes to the perfection of my shit I know you smell the RECTUM
I'm like a chromosome I always ex 'em
Like wolverine steps in attackin a deadly weapon
I'm openin a church to sell coke and led zeppelin
And fuck mary in her ass... ha ha... yo
I'm fucking Goldilocks up in the forest
In the three bear house eating their muthafuckin' porridge
I tell her it's my house, give her a tour
In my basement, and keep that bitch locked up in the storage
Rape her and record it, then edit it with more shit
Octopussy special effect, the wet bitches be banging
And please never disrespect my set with cannon
Hanging from my neck like it's a muthafuckin' circus

I guess I left my dignity up in the cupboard
Cause every girl im digging, when im digging in her pussy
Im never using a rubber
But fuck it I guess I gotta steach it out like it was flubber
And leave it drippin green and red like it was double cheese buggers
Chewin on cum like bubble gum from hubbard
This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shimp

Yo Im seventeen, already sniffin blow
I tell my friends its asthma every time I start to itch my throat
I got a new show for MTV, ""Pimp My Boat""
Because some bitch said my semen was dirty, thats silly ho
The most that they can do is find me, Im hiding
Somewhere where Chris Stokes cant find me
Oh no Mister Stokes I dont like misters no
Dont tell R. Kelly where my sister goes

Of the picture, punchline figured out ahhh I get you
No you dont nigga so why dont you go figure
You seem confused anyway, pressure enough?
You the type to do the choke when the pressure is up
The pressure is to pump and pressure is us
Bitches havin eargasms and the pleasure is us
Niggas wanna B.O.F. and write letters to us
Competition's competition, yo you better than us?
Digest what Im sayin? I dont think so
We sick shit, throw it up down in the sink yo
The odd niggas are beginning to spill these pink hoes
We think sorta odd so we think so

I never judge a murder by weapons, only the rage

They say that I never cease to amaze
While half my mental belongs in a cage
The ape is a beast, tranquilize that bitch
If you niggas selling dope then you selling my shit
Selling my assets, I'm so damn illegal that I need to be arrest
But then they'll get my mom for 18 years of possession
She showed me affection like a drug dealer using her pocket for my protection

And if I want to go outside
I got to make sure that I can play here
I bet you've never seen a pig fly
Well you ain't been looking through my eyes

I bet you've never seen a pig fly, nope
Right next to the fat lady hitting high notes
Went to sleep at seven never woke up from the dream
Wore my wings and my jeans but my hat is from Supreme
So I guess that's where I hide my things
Caged, and the wonder is seen
Middle finger missing so I can not give a fuck
I can hear the bells ringing off the nice dream truck
So I'm chasing the dreams, no realities
Hoping that maturity won't be too mad at me
But if so, I'll take the scorn, indeed happily
Long as I can feel my heart tap like happy feet

Fatherless kids, orphans like me and Domo is
A fuck that we will never give is like our pops
But what we did was found our niche and made a stitch
Just like a shirt, that's why our stains smell like the shit, that's from

It's all night (Don't go home tonight, chill)
It's all night (Please stay, don't go home tonight)

I'm an odd fellow, the opposite of mellow
The therapist said hello but my mom would wonder
I was dealing with iller shit like professional plumbers
Like food for thought was my father but I ain't have the hunger

I'm thankful for my position I was given in life

Read about starved children who ain't eatin' this right
Drug lords declare war, sellin' cheaper the price
Stuntin' dummy drug money, yeah, them sneakers is nice
Get your swag from the black sellin' back to the white
Niggas can't get a job, so we self-employed

She handles herself a classic
She got a nice ass but she can't run no games on me
She claim to like the stores and the clothes
Jeans bleached with the holes, but she can't get my bank homey
Too smart is no good, if she smart for no good it's so good
She can't flaunt her thing on me
She can be full of swag, drive a Jag, poppin' tags on the Ave
But she can't get her cake from me
That sounded like the hook I threw at her in the Swagger I rode in
Said she came to feel me in, when she really came to fill me in
Like baby what's the deal with it?
Seem to be attracted by the fiancee and finance that no wifey concealin' it
Dealin' with life's shuffle, then fold
Dippin' with the duffles I hold

"Tyler, the Creator","Slip it in her drink and in the blink
Of an eye I can make a white girl look chink
Don't know what to think, cause last time
I attempted this shit the judge ordered me to see a shrink
Started with the link, contended her to meet me
At the local Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink
We was uniquely in sync, already fucking and we only met last week
We're both young, not yet antique
So her mindset was working for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week
You can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks
No, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep that
Neighbors by the creek say that my house stinks
It reeks of a chic girl, streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
Oblivion makes obvious seeks
Which makes meats for my obvious feasts
Used to just blot up thoughts, plot and rethink
Now I get daughters and tie them and clink
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc
Now they just rot up, arms caught in the sink
Where they get cut up to fit my physique
Critique my chic in this brand new mink, go

Bitches running round, down, pussy take a trip
Make you strip, got my dick harder than the unzipped
Tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit
Round trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket
Film clips popping on that Canon, busting odd mind cannons
On the pill, is he real? Gaza stripping
In my living room, Wolf Gang full moon
I'm assuming mushrooms, I'm a necrolampoon
Not of Charles Mansoon, this fuck is ending soon, because I'm ejaculating

Now I'd like to take this time of day to thank the Mother Earth
Letting the sun shine down on the lake while I fish the waters
Ooh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters, hell hide grandmama too
Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool, he on the loose, yeah

Got to wash it down, all this gold is fucking bait
Wait until you see the semen swimming, baby
Please not half the hole is great
Morals? Your body's near that coral reef
It was once upon a time you came home with me
Then the next chapter left you in my teeth
Fill your gills with goo, going deeper than Pacific Ocean
This specific motion makes this hammerhead puke

Said bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake
Bathing suit is going down, shit just meet me by the lake
We could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me

I'm give it to her, she wants that sumer time
I'm give it like no other 'cause she knows I'm hers
Damn right she's mine, we both know it
So when we separate everything fine, her phone ringin' in her purse
Damn right it's me, I'm her nigga, nigga
Come for mines in sumer time, I'ma bust that trigger, nigga
Catch us where the beach at, she wanna go shopping
Sun down after club 'cause she like to get it popping
Sangria on my feet ma, 'cause she likes to get it popping
No ecstasy for her but she wanna get it popping
Drop topping, I measure her pleasure
Then drop in when she get out of place I quantize
She is my concubine, I am her porcupine
I poke her face her throat for taste, give me head like I'm on her mind
I know her analyzation, so when she try to fake
Summer time in the boat of love, meet me by the lake

I can grab the fireworks, the soda, all the cookies we can eat

We could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me

I packed a couple sandwiches inside that basket
And brought some extra towels if anyone was asking
We should take a dip in that lake quick and then split
Then do something that's beyond what we both can imagine

Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset
Watch the sunset (There goes the rainbow)

Now, moshing pits to breaking arms, Zombie Circus not a carn
Evil wolfs is on the farm and were all evil harmed?
Any sheep creep, quiet tendered sleep
Make a peep, fucking body will go missing in a week
Roam around the city with her titties like a fucking greek

Shooting from the sky, the only problem is the missing beak

So tell me what's been going

I'm not a fucking role model (I know this)
I'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
So Kanye tweeted tellin' people, hes bumpin' all of my shit
These motherfuckers think I'm supposed to live up to something? shit
I'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless
And getting more pussy 'cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)
LA to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares,
from skate parks and airports it's all in the air, its weird
Yonkers dropped and left their craniums mind-fucked,
now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
He still hasn't called me yet (it's not your fault)
That's a whole fucking different argument
Shit, I got over it
And a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy a couple hot pockets
So grandma can stop cooking those nasty ass colligreens
Pressures on me like this top hat bastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?
OK you guys caught me
I'm not a fucking rapist, or a serial killer, I lied

I tried too hard huh?
(no)

I'm a start a group,
so no one else gets the respect they deserve 'cause of you

What you think I recorded for?
To have a bunch of critics call my shit a bunch of horror core?
Like I didn't make Parade or Inglorious
'cause I'm too fuckin' scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel?
Of course they only listen
To lyrics about me pissing off
In the tombs of Lara Croft
I'm getting pissed off
Message boards are on my dick I need to piss away
Lemme bust one in they mouth, I know they feel the flavor
Can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothing living out his dreams
Why they gotta fucking hate?
I don't even skate anymore, I'm too fucking busy
I can barely kick flip now
People excited think this shit is so tight
Making me co-sign with rappers I don't even like
What the fuck you want me to do? start to gobble this mic
Start jacking em off, till his cap blasting off
Fuck that, 'cause these niggas ain't fuckin' with me
'cause I don't listen to the immortal tech of the nique
And all this underground bullshit can never gone peak
On the billboard top 20 and jam of the week
Id rather listen to Baduh and Pusha the T
And wacka flocka flame instead of that real hip hop that's full of the shit
But they wanna critique
Everything the the wolf gang has ever released
But they don't get it
'cause its not made for them
The nigga that's in the mirror rapping, its made for him
But they do not have the mindset, that is same as him
I'm not weird, your just a fagot, shame on him
I'm not homophobic fagot
What the fuck is a good performance?
I get on stage and have as much fun as I can
Who doesn't have ADD?! I don't

Someone gets blamed
If some white kid had aimed
His AK-47 at forty seven kids
And I don't wanna see my name mentioned
College wasn't working
And I wasn't working
So I sat at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
But I was determined to be great
So this classes can wait
'cause those 4 days I went, I wasn't learnin' shit
Now I'm living dreams i've wanted since 8th
And I can afford to get my mother something on her birth, day
They claim the shit I say is just wrong
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
I;m just a teenager, who admits hes suicide prone
My life is doing pretty good
So that day is postponed for now
But wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
And when she gives you lemons nigga throw em at pedestrians
I still live in my grandmas house
Sell out a fuckin' show in London just to end up on couches
I hate my fuckin' life, but when I make that announcement
My hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then
And then I am confused and I want energists out

Mom is getting jealous I see my manager more
Than I see her before, I go on tour and it hurts
I miss the days when this was fun but now it turned into work
They getting legal, so now I gotta watch the shit that I blurt out
My friends are turning into opposites
Because my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist
And all the bitches who forget about me want to ride my dick
Harder than the white kids that copy shit
Ending it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about
All alone, bawling 'til my mothafuckin' eyes bleed
See, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets disgusting
When there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man
Fuck, I'm putting myself at a distance
For instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant
Niggas saying ""Free Earl"" without even knowin' him
See, they're missing the new album, I'm missing my only friend

When I say Odd, y'all say Future
Odd uh-uh, that shit's corny as fuck
(Tyler, you have a cult following)
To these white kids?

Charbroiled nigga on these dark beats
Nashes with the Nazis but it's normal what the cops see
Awesome at his concert, but he never had a pop, see
Mommy was a living single queen with a lot tee
So while my wallets piling with some symbolic colored paper
I lace her, 'cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age
20, why didn't she get that abortion?
Probably 'cause that motherfuckin' embryo was morphing
Into a Grammy winning schizophrenic fucking orphan
Oops I meant bastard, a skinny ass disaster
Mom works hard, still working on her masters
Son lies about, taking classes at community college
Just to record some bullshit he calls Bastard
Start a fuckin' cult, clash his talents in a brash way
Before he even had a mustache and cash
And all I got was a fuckin' shitty article in Thrasher

I'm not crazy, I'm a fucking table, I'm a fucking table!

I'ma grab the Nina and find a nice arena
Cause I can't even choose between Ortega or Suprema
And I'm not even human, I'm a body shaped demon
With some semen in my sack and some problems in the back
And a life that's fill with crap, and a finger filled with hate
And a gat that's filled with love, now let opposites attract
I can finally be one like a marriage in a church
But this marriage has a hearse and the parents of the one
That's getting married has a curse and it's made up inside of him
Too late to reimburse but, wait it gets worse
All the guests that's in the church, all decided to disperse
So there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse
So they tied the knot, now it's too late to reverse
This arrangement (Yes it is) and the nurse is amazed at the hurt
That he was painting but it was obvious in all the photos
He was paining, now a bunch of whispering immerse

And then the nurse blurts
(What the fuck is his problem, here, we have two doses to give him, here)
Why didn't anybody ask him first? (I've been asking you this whole time)
Because nobody gave a fuck (Someone gave a fuck Tyler
And, uh, the person that gave a fuck was me
See, you're not, going crazy, it's me, I'm your best friend Tyler
I know everything, I know everything about you
You've been helping yourself this whole time

We talk every night, she cry to me about her guy
And if we text I get pissed when I get no reply
I know that she's the key to love
She is who I'm thinking of when I am beating Richard up
To mental images her face look
The closest that I got is when I'm poking her on Facebook
Video chats are so exciting
Cause it's like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy
I'm getting gassed up, I think she's liking me
She's gullible and I just wanna take it like a pirate
I see her in class
Not really two doors down but in anytime that I pass
To take a piss in a stall, I picture us in the hall
Locking lips on the wall, her hand grabbing my dick
My left hand on her tits, oh my shit's getting hard
From thoughts of dating this bitch
Her name is my passwords, fuck

All my niggas got they bitches and stuff
But all the bitches they fuck, are known as bitches and sluts
But she special, I know to y'all I come off as rough
But I'm the nicest to her, and I just want to concur
A relation, I want the cheesy dates at the movies
And stupid walks on the beach, and sharing straws in a cup
I never had that, so when we holding hands walking home
I look past that, the fact that she's fucking guys that I hate
But, things are looking great cut copy
Last time we talk she said that her relationship was Rocky (Action)
Now that Mr. Fag is gone, there's no one that can stop me
From bagging her, I got these tickets to the Roxy
Next day metro's taking me home
I see her in a car at Wendy's, but she's not alone
Who's that guy? Wait, why the fuck he 'bout to kiss her?
Come to find out she got back with her nigga, damn, fuck

She's so pretty, fuck self pity, I feel so shitty
I wanna text her in a jealous rage
But if she reply to say anything, I'ma smile I know
What do I do with myself, sit in my room for some days
Play Xbox and piles full of wet socks? Fuck that

My nigga ask, ""Ace, what happened to such and such?""
I could smother her name, and then tell him I probably fucked
Or I could tell him the truth, and just say she ain't like me much
But instead I lie and say she moved to Nebraska",Her,2011

Well, first off

My only problem is death
Fuck heaven, I ain't showing no religion respect
Brain damage, therapy's the only thing I regret
Talking to me is like a fucking body missing her neck
But, I'm surprised I ain't pop off my top off
Life is a bitch and my cock's off the Glock's cock
My hand's shriveled, my finger's slipped, the wall's red
Her life is fucked, she sad now, her son is dead

I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems

When I was younger, I would smile a lot
I'm getting older, getting bolder but a wiser top
Now I'm drunk driving, lap's full of the Budweiser tops
Life is a movie and you're just a prop
They begged me to stop but I listen like death drones
Love? I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some
My father called me to tell me he loved me
I'd have a better chance of getting Taylor Swift to fuck me
Annoying and I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me
I'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me
Feel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all
I'm Ace, I'm parent-less, I'm kinda arrogant
Ignorant as fuck, defend people for the hell of it
Because I am the devil, fucker get on my level
Doughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers
My life is Ms. Mo Unique Parker,
But a little darker, I'll see you in a couple

I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems

Tyler, here's some water man
You seem a little tense, how is Thebe?

All because a nigga just don't give a fuck
Parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up
But fuck that, you're shitty parents, face it, suck it up
That's what you shoulda did before that nigga bust, huh
Feel like I missed my little brother growing up
Feel like my little brother missed his brother growing up
But this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growing up
I got a little taller since the last time you seen me, bro
Now I'm emo, so fuck it, I'm Poe-in' up
But I never had a drink, ""Sydney, Tyler's throwing up!""
My nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough
I won't feel the feeling I be feeling when I'm sobered up

As emotionally strained as Travis when he's (Tyler, calm down)
Don't look at me, I'm 6'5"" about to fucking cry
About another guy, but this is Golf Wang, do or die
I finally had a family

Now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me
But before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?
Fuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death
One ear I got kids screaming ""O.F. is the best""
The other ear I got Tron Cat asking where the bullets and the bombs at
So I can kill these levels of stress, shit
They say that I'm shock value
How about you hop off cock and turn volume down?
I haven't got around to telling my mom shit
Cause I don't know how to  (Whoa)
All I want is her support, whenever the fight's at home
When mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown
Now she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown
And hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone
Looking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone
Then they wonder why I stay at Travis pad with a backpack
For the whole week full of plastic-wrapped black tees
And deodorant like this house is my home
I could live with the same hat
And the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack
And the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday
Where I skate with the same fucking friends at
Didn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh
""Message from GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat""
Email full of emails, I never write back
Ain't kill myself yet, now I already want my life back

I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems


One shot, two shots, one gun, two cops
I'm blowin' them flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers
You're on the side of fagots and cock blockers
I'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches
I'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human
Cause I'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys
You niggas can't harm me 'cause you all know that
We at the fuckin' dirty lifer's laundry (Tyler, calm down)
Nigga get off me

Fuck off me man, fuck (What's got into you?)
I don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times
Sometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not (Yeah, you)
As though I got a fucking voice in my head
Telling me to do all this fucked up shit, man (Yeah, what's this?)
I don't fucking know, man (What's this person named then, Tyler, huh?)
He tells me to do this shit
That I don't wanna fucking do (What's his name?)

Y'all barely breaking like Taco's self-esteem in a thin chair
Old Navy bitches love this gap, yeah this grin's rare
Watch a nigga smile like five-year-old child
I'm kicking it with Nak and the nigga from Green Mile, it's
Red Bull in this cup so a nigga may seem wild but
That's just all the sherm I was burning a little while ago
Don't let me get hold of that rifle
Shout my nigga Sage Elsseser and Sean Pablo
Surrounded by them niggas that skate with a sick style
And some freckled bitches with giant peaches that's vile
They never did catch that rhino

Squadron full of some lost souls
Sergeant of all, it's autumn and Nak just nollied a pothole
Non-cooperative with his momma's wishes for college
And coppers labeled a problem since paying for Damianos
So shimmy through the swamp, nigga, follow me through the foxholes
Moral Orenthal with a pretty bitch in a Bronco
Hopped right off the seven and stumbled into some Vatos
Threw a punch, got jumped, dusted off and then walked home
Shit, it's like 6 p.m. and his temple throbbing
Hand in the cabinet by seven, sniff the prescription oxies
Logo in the boxes, all my niggas hostile
Cautious of your crosses, scoffing at your doctrines
Bitches augmented stupid as the group is
Only slightly, write precise to get a pussy nigga two chins
Man these stitches shut the loose lips, stumbled in a Ruth's Chris
Slid into a booth and hid the luggage from his shroom trips
See, Lionel ball with Leonardo on the weekend now
And Maui on a scenic route, we on the second season now
Small fry got 'em seasons salty, weeded, coughing
Ease up off me, end is breathing easy as bulimics barfing
From a different breed of doggy, from a different seed and cloth
And teeing off, believe it's Golf Wang, nigga",Sasquatch,2013

Actually flick cigarette ash at bitch niggas
Harassment, ate nickels of hash, delay quick, and then
Dash to Saint Nicholas pad to taste venison
Still in the business of smacking up little rappers with
Raquets you play tennis with, hated for bank lifting and
Spraying that hotter wind in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and filetted sentences
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up
Tan khakis, an antagonist Dan-dappered up
Vagabond, had it since a Padawan
Rapping hot as fucking cattle brands wearing flannel thongs
Grab a bong, momma and some food, beer, tag along
Get a nice spanking, new Sears catalog
Send them nettled critics to the bezzle stop, dead and wrong
Get 'em higher than the pitch of metal tea kettle songs

Get it? Like a blue pill, make ya stick longer
Or a swift fist off your chin from his wrist launcher
Chick, chronic thrift shopper, thick like the Knicks roster
Stormed off and came straight back like pigs' posture
Pen? Naw, probably written with some used syringes
From out the rubbish bin at your local loony clinic
Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented
On the hunt for clues, more food, and some floozy women
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch
Gooey writtens, scoot 'em to a ditch, chewed and booty scented
Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose with spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms
Stupid, thought it up, jot it quick, thought out
Toss it right back like a vodka fifth
Spot him on a rocket swapping dollars in for pocket lint
Then lob a wad of chicken at a copper on some Flocka shit

Come up with weird ass videos with roach bugs

You should've took me instead (uh, that's weird)
See, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither

I don't like that cellular convo's getting left in the wrong

And find time to write facts (fuck)
I love you

(Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?

Crazy who makes me the happiest
Can make me the saddest
Look Alice
Let's get lost in your wonder-er-land fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing
And you'll see the meaning of stalking
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evening
Make sure you never meet again like god damn vegans
Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing
I love you so much that my heart stops beating when you're leaving
And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding
Life without you has no god damn meaning
Sorry I'm passive aggressive for no god damn reason
It's that my mood change like these god damn seasons
I'll fall for you, but I love you

I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it

And while you're at it, pass the lotion

I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck I can't sing whatever look)
We met through mutual friends
And this is where the story and confusion begin
Cause I was in a problem but I had to pretend that I wasn't

There go the police man knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat
Or do I answer real confused like ""I don't know""
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man I'm so paranoid

Girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young for me
And when temptation calls (my phone), I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love

A six year difference is a ten year sentence
And with the pigment on my skin
I don't want to be another statistic
You bring me joy, joy, joy, joy
And you fill a void that was once missing
And I can say I'm in love

There go the police man knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat
Or do I answer real confused like ""I don't know""
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored

Girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young
And when temptation calls (my phone), I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young

When you're 35, I'll be 41
And when I'm 27, you'll be 21
Yo, this is dumb
And when that time comes for that 1-8, I'll probably run
Cause I'm fucking terrified, yo this is dumb
You should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself
And mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help
Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help
So when you mention ""hang,"" I'm thinking about a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention-
Span, it's gonna suck your shit
It's that kitchen fan
It splattered on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds
But I found my wings, fuck
(But you're too fucking young)
I really like you

Hard pill to swallow like some thick soda
Walk wit' it, 'cause my pockets look like thick Yoda
Do the Skywalker, riding round' sola
And the kid skin sprite, and my tint cola
Getting neck from the ball like some big shoulders
Til' I bust like that 9 in your heat holster

Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance, the lyrics
Matter of fact, I'mma just call you, so you can hear it

To trust her, only my heart and that elder white man
His name is Clancy, I fancy him, gotta give him props
He half the reason why dealerships even let me cop
So now I'm speedin' and tryna drive away from the fact
That she was right, so I triple left, tryna double back
The streets are filled with some clues, like how I ain't notice that?

I pull up, get out, what up?
I wanna help, but what you want for some
Some niggas really don't want for themself
Now do I stay? Do I go? That's my dilemma
And traffic is picking up, if I don't leave I'ma get stuck (skrrt)
So I speed off, we talk barely and it seems awk-
-ward, and I heard through some words that you off it
I got too much drive, don't wanna steer off path
And crash and get distracted
But I listen to that weather man 'cause it might rain
Keep my windshield wipers prepared 'cause y'all threw so much shade
And I got jacket in trunk, but that's in the front
I also got power for both of us if you're ever in need of jump

All I can show 'em is a couple cars and more things
That I've made in the couple past month, he's on, please
Everyone is a sheep, me, a lone wolf
Nobody gon' make a peep 'cause everyone wants some wool
Since everyone is a sheep, not everyone here is cool

See, man, T-Man fans be seesaw

One day, ""Fuck no,"" the next day, ""Okay""
