Kevin Gates,"As a wise man that think if I possess the game in my mind
The reason I wear shades you can't see the pain in my eyes

In the rain storm in the blizzard, expressing all of my feelings
Pause, never took me serious, naw, mama never wanna listen
Stomach hurting my pockets empty how dare a nigga wanna tempt me
In the dark room all prayed out, I ain't never sat in no Bentley
Hustle hard in the alley way by Ms. Cita house I'm getting it
Wrecked my car Chris laughed at me, like I ain't supposed to remember
Wish Wig was still living, wish Shrimp was still living
Wish Joe was still living
Look at Chris how he tripping
Young Troll just hit the phone
But he don't keep it a thousand,
Ray Vicks just jacked him, and he ain't even see bout that
Now he telling me 'bout that
Seem to me he ain't 'bout that, nigga let me get a thrill juice
You don't have it now, but you gone have it later
My face card worth a hundred bands
Game recognize game baby, my lil brother lil Terrance Hines
I'd die for him and go to war behind him
Real niggas, all around me, bitch niggas ain't round me
Talkin Massachusetts exclusive, somebody bring it back
Cocaine made me smile but I cried
Ain't think my team a rat
Stroke know I love em
But nigga around could say fuck me
How that go when I fuck with nigga, ain't nobody gone fuck with em
In the neighborhood that I grew up in
They call it the southside, everybody house overcrowded
Forcing them to hang outside, my lil cousin Corey, hustle hard in fruits town
On the boulevard with the roof open like damn Fed what I do now
Me and Bees and Rodney, ice cup and it's muddy
You don't like me then fuck you
Probably dap me off and say fuck me
God forgive me next nigga play with me
I'll probably kill they mother
Make the funeral you in trouble
A lot of guns out and they bustin'
Pussy rapper talking shit on Twitter
But out in public it's nothing
Discussion had and I bump em
If looks could kill, I would've been dead
Bitch I'm with give real head
But I don't trust her that much
Let me slip and go back to jail
Watch how many niggas she fuck
Let me slip and go back to jail
Watch how many niggas she fuck

Niggas all on my dick (zip)
Bitches all on my dick (zip)
Only God know my struggle
Had it hard so I hustle
Don't fuck with none of you niggas
Don't trust none of you niggas
Run up on me nigga I'm with it
Put a slug in one of you niggas
Only God know my struggle
Had it hard so I hustle
And everybody 'round me say
I don't give a fuck a bout nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
I don't give a fuck about nothin'

Most likely I'm too intelligent
They say cuts heal, not much here
You forget about it or you get around it
Can't forget about it, then you kill about it
I'm a ordained street minister
Read the bible, but a finish ya
Still have trouble with letting go
That ain't my ho, I just thought it was
My friends laughed when I kissed on her
Shoulda pulled my dick out and pissed on em
My family on fire wouldn't piss on em
Cold world, don't quit on me
Grind hard, get rich on em
Whatever you do just stack paper
My lil cousin Chief just called my phone, and I'm like what's the problem
""Heard about Lil Mocha? Nigga tried him and Lil Mocha shot him""
Bitch I'm going hard
It ain't no stopping, do that for the bottom
Everybody watching, Gates a great and he just made it out
Everything I make from profit
God I promise, I'll invest in houses
Just give me another chance at life
Put me back in bounce
Went to jail, already had my strips
Ain't no backing down
Shawty Spit Stacckz was in the cell with me
I'm laughing loud
This for all of you that hated
Panamaras backing out

Niggas all on my dick (zip)
Bitches all on my dick (zip)
Only God know my struggle
Had it hard so I hustle
Don't fuck with none of you niggas
Don't trust none of you niggas
Run up on me nigga I'm with it
Put a slug in one of you niggas
Only God know my struggle
Had it hard so I hustle
And Everybody 'round me say
I don't give a fuck a bout nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
I don't give a fuck about nothin'",IDGAF,2013
Kevin Gates,"I ain' gon' lie I be getting a little emotional
Go head record it out
I be getting a little emotional when I be doing this but,
It's him with that camera, that shit be throwin' me off
You ready?
Start it off
(You go)
You ain't gotta leave out, it's just I know I'm on film ya heard me?
So it fuck with me a little bit
You ain't gotta go nowhere though
You can sit down and stay
It's a true story
I ain't gon' forget my words
Start it off

I was chillin' in a Ihop, overheard a conversation
Both of them niggas killas, one of em was Michael Caden
Big brother The Jason
I went to school with him
His brother got killed, so now he keep a tool with him
Live around the corner from his two daughters, no father
That's when the waitress came over like,
""May I take your order?""
Give me the breakfast sample
Orange juice and a Coke
That nigga looked at me and nodded
He said I never spoke
Like what the fuck them niggas lookin' at
That's what I heard the other say
Looked a mean muggin' way
Nigga turned the other way
Had to turn deaf ear, Satan was in my left ear
Like go and council, you a nigga nobody could see you
Show them niggas that you real
Nobody could be you
I walked over and asked him
You wan take it off your shoulder?
Hand checkin' him in his face
Tellin' him I'm a soldier
I ain't no fucking drug lord
I ain't the type to try to be
Ten years of aggression, you don't wanna see that out of me
Jagged ass Smith and Wesson
Bangin' Sangin' I gotta be
That nigga, that nigga
All started on a Tuesday afternoon, me and my bitch got into it
Unnecessary fools, just toolin', her hair ruined
Found out from another chick
Livin' out of town
In an upstairs apartment, that was three corners down
Click spot for my round
Jeff used to scope pounds
Tanya ran into me, her and Amber they ran into me
Me and Tanya remained cool
Amber's man was pussy
He ran to the block, and sent some niggas from another hood
They came back, and black masked up
Just like I knew they would
Runnin' out there buckin' loud
Niggas only laughed at ya
Hard not to bang when you got bitch niggas attacking ya
Up to 40 calibre, oncoming passenger
Scaffold through the tourist section
Stole all the traffica
See him with his clique
He used to mug, but never buck with them
Used to keep a smirk because my old lady was fucking him
Ain't no need to get mad
I'm thinking I ain't never fuck with him
Hit one of my niggas up, we bargained on his brain
Fucking with my little brother, who frequently snort the cain
Dapped him down as I passed him
What's hannin', where's Twerked em?
Back was turnt the whole time
Little brother ran up and murked him
Issued him two to the dome
And worked him with the chrome
And to this day, I can say
I set him up, and he's gone
Three months prior
I'm downtown, meeting Lisa McBoyd
I'm in town handling business for Floyd
He couldn't make it, I'm a take it by myself
I'm awaiting a vacation
Three bricks going to Kurt, coming home from Las Vegas
On the phone with Joe, finishing a conversation
That say I was gonna be off, cause he was at a graduation.
Well shit, I'm on my way out of state to meet Mason
He told me to be safe and any problems, I could page him
Jeff sitting patient in a vacant location
Not knowing that we were stopping in another metropolitan
Tanya texts Jeff, still waiting, replied obviously
""Hope your cousin Kevin ain't fake, and he ain't jivin' me,
Or tryin'a get me up to the Jake's plotting on robbin me""
Tanya said ""Kevin's my cousin, he wouldn't lie to me, whenever y'all had talked,
He was right here on the side of me, they in the real estate and probably lookin'
At property.""

Kevin Gates,"Yo me llamo Luca Brasi
Ughh
Yo mato por nada
Yo tengo muchas pistolas, cabron
Yo tengo cocaina, marijuana, y lo que tu necessita
Numeros bueno
If you having trouble translating what the fuck I just said, go get Rosetta Stone
Puta, pendejo

Passionate about crack sales, people wonder if I have a cracked head
See OG and freelow, don't ever call em no crack head
Brap brap, cracked legs, broke ribs, cracked head
Me cleavin' to the white meat, cracked eggs
Pots, pans, still objects, non-stick, district court
Nonsense child support, tryna settle things outta court
Luca brasi a mobster, chill get thrown in ya collarbone
Broken nose and a collarbone, neck look like a xylophone
Sick a being bothered pussy artist you can blast off
When I was broke I was a joke, I couldn't die far
Wrong number, call a bitch, I get the dial tone
Now my dipping game away from getting smiled [?]
Cheeks, cheeks, or should I say no teeth
Been on the streets for 14 months and I ain't miss a beat
White girl wasted, a couple want me to cuddle
Need them bills to pay her bill, she love my lil' brother Chuckie
Booty club transaction in traffic saying they love it
OG car moving blocks boxing impuddle
Down sag hood, out the hood I suffer concussions
Why receive a past protection, no fumble, touchdown, or nothin, go

Bitch I run the streets, don't talk to police
Say what's my name perdon mi no habla ingles
Bitch I run the streets, mi no talk to police
Say what's my name perdon mi no habla ingles
Narco trafficante, narco trafficante
Ti quiero cocaina mi familia es mi hombre
Narco trafficante, narco trafficante
Te quiero cocaina mi familia es mi hombre

I know I'm the shit like my shit don't have a stench
And all my hoes are ratchet like I don't have a wrench
And all my hoes are in the game like I don't have a bench
And they gimme so much brain, them hoes don't make no sense
And my white girl in the kitchen work her wrist like Rachel Ray
I don't see no black and white, I see 50 shades of grey, yeah
Cocaine and jail, bars story of my life
I got 11 in the car, I hope amigo wrapped 'em right
I don't want these nigga's bitches so I'mma give 'em back to 'em
But they mouth game exclusive, I'm startin' to get attatched to 'em
Bitches on my dick, I got to ask 'em where my dick is
Shout out to my girlfriend, act like you ain't catch it
Benz truck, I'm loving it, I love it so much I fuck in it
Am I tripping or is her pussy talkin', I swear it just told me to nut in it
Her pussy so tight I'm stuck in it, feel like she still sucking it
I beat it until it young bleed like her, nigga what in it

Bitch I run the streets, don't talk to police
Say what's my name perdon mi no habla ingles

Te quiero cocaina mi familia es mi hombre

Bitch I'm fresh up off my grind like a skateboard in this prime
Don't skateboard why lie, couldn't skateboard if I tried
I like trap houses and kitchens and love to fuck with prescriptions
Got a bad bitch and she [?], you'd prolly guess she a stripper
She kinda tall, got a long weave, her thighs thick and she slender
She play men but she really sweet, got pretty teeth and she tender
My mother's Puerto Rican with pistols, illegal tender
I ain't pussy like the son of the one on illegal tender
Gason Donald bitch you play Willy Cooley I get you injured
Went to school, too busy focused on pigeons, we got suspended
Boyfriend ugly, girl I'm too cute to be going duffy
Keep that hifey shit from around me in public, could lead to scufflin'
Free zoah li jamalo while in the Roco republic
Still I thrive in the gutter, missing lives in the jungle
Pair of cleates dirty feet had to improvise when I'm probably
Boobly bumpy on a muscle, can't go aside from the hustle, no

Bitch I run the streets, don't talk to police

Kevin Gates,"Bitch you something so serious
It's recording?
(They say diamonds are forever)
(They say diamonds are forever)

Public thought me a pessimists think my thoughts too pessimistic, reminiscing
Roastin' Garcia Vegas, just don't do swishers or rillas
Murder rap, we beat it 2am in two seaters
Yellow things bright embrace, I arch it back and lay
Face down, I'm a gangsta my heart colder than Chicago
This black Impala just sent bullets through my car door
These niggas I've been runnin' wit' pressure hit they crumblin'
Never had no love in this shit, pray to god, somebody please pray for me
Deep conversation was always elated and then celebrated the things of the past
Happy belated, while handing her Franklins,
Just thought I was stated, but stated too fast
Went to the pen, and was living upstate
But feel I got away cause I skated with cash
Made crooked lawyers and dirty attorneys,
Who take all your money and say that they working
Fucking with you, stuck in this loop
You jumping through hoops and we running through hurdles
Ain't met ya momma but I told her
I promise that when she around me nothing will hurt her
She do the talking I can't be too perfect lean drinking, no Bud Light
Itching for them chickens, them idiots must don't love life

Free to speak on anything at all
Before we met, not much belief in
Anything at all
And then we found love under neon lights
Fluorescent body paint, while under neon lights
Lemme get you to sound off loud in here
But say my name, loud and clear
Watch we wake up all the neighbors when we makin' love
I'm talking naked, making faces, really cuttin' up
In the bathroom, or the shower let this water fall
Like Soulja Slim I got enough dick for all of y'all
Now the luxury whips come equipped with neon lights
Body paint fluorescent under neon lights
Fuck what he don't like, we gon be alright
Cookin' soft and sellin' hard while under neon lights

Grown in the Mafia, we poppin' in climate with tropical leaves
Take off my shirt can't come out my sleeves I got it in ink and that's what I believe
Exploring desires the moment devours I'm watching this fire ignite in the sheets
Kissing my wrist, got her legs on my shoulder my dick in her stomach I'm giving her ""D""
She grippin the pillow with teeth, I wrinkle my lip she wiggles her feet
Built up a tolerance now that its inside of it, hollerin' louder she get it with speed
This is sweet, they say Diamonds Are Forever
Boyfriend called her and cussed her out for real, I'm for real
Cling on, got the theme song on my ringtone, wanna beef with you everytime you leave home
Tell em that the plan out of hand, you scared? Bout to tell him
I'll catch em, I'll tell em whatever what up
Name in the streets and I stand on that spit my life through the wax I'mma die bout that
Outside make it 4th of July out there
And they say Diamonds Are Forever, I'm for real, I'm for real
From start to finish go call December, sayin' life's but a race put the petal to the metal
Sayin ready, set, GO now start ya engine, got a 90 day run, we talking different.
We still keep in touch no loss in feelings, with an understanding

The sound off loud in here
But say my name, loud and clear
Watch we wake up all the neighbors when we makin' love
I'm talking naked, making faces, really cuttin' up
In the bathroom, or the shower let this water fall
Like Soulja Slim I got enough dick for all of y'all
Now the luxury whips come equipped with neon lights
Body paint fluorescent under neon lights
Fuck what he don't like, we gon' be alright

Kevin Gates,"I'mma let you hear that other one after I do this
I'mma let you hear the one you know the 6's and all old shit all that we don't fuck around shit
I like this shit man

Coke and rock and choppin' off 'em, private goin' on shopping sprees
Glock in my back pocket, already cocked okay I'm clockin' cheese
Strap jump off the hinges in the trenches, all in alleyways
Had to say, each and every day we grabbin' paper
Live the hustle, probably die, gangster and etcetera
Sometime I can't take no break, they keep callin' my cellular
This the game and we know this life we gon' be alright
Ain't no sleep tonight, bitch we out here chasing paper

At the Paul Inn with the Tech 9, no bandana, no gloves on
Long kiss, goodnight my nigga, but we ain't makin' no love song
This bullshit you sold me got Inisotol no soda on it
I straight dropped and lost 20 grams like what the fuck is you smokin' homie
Red Camaro, white rally stripes, gon' probably be on TV
Move wrong while the tool on, I'll put your ass on Street Beat
Repeat, you see me, I'm a repeat offender
Park the whip, lay under houses, you're moving round with the stethoscope
Arrested for [?] to teach these pussy niggas 'bout stretchin' coke
Bend the bend with the machine gun, like, ""Say hello to my little friend""
Chick I met at Texaco, down here for school, not visitin'
Say it's about to get interesting, bitch say she from Michigan

Coke and rock and choppin' off 'em, private goin' on shopping sprees
Glock in my back pocket, already cocked okay I'm clockin' cheese
Strap jump off the hinges in the trenches, all in alleyways
Had to say, each and every day we grabbin' paper

				",Paper Chasers,2013
Kevin Gates,"In 7th Grade, we promised that we'd never break each other's heart
Fought with the pressure of deep depression while naked making confessions
Underneath the covers, coloring in the dark
Gave LaToya my information and she ain't even call
Could it be women's intuition telling her I'm a dog?
Criminally involved, past-tense on my prior history dealing with the law
And this is no facade, refrigerator in my chest just like Omarion
I got this icebox where my heart used to be
Excuse, that's just a broken heart
I'll think that I'll just hang out here for tonight
[Say Gates, what you doing?
Playing songs on my invisible guitar

Every night, I kiss your picture on the nightstand
Love's a battlefield, it's not a one-night stand
Alone, praying every day that I can stop thinking about you
But I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby
I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby

Every time we talk, it's like you end up getting aroused
Standing, while I'm sitting down with my fingers under your blouse
Still looking you in the eye, you're looking back into mine
If I told you I was different, would you understand the difference?
Try to suppress the feeling of this different way of living
Creatures of the night - we gon be alright
In the twilight
Skin gleamin', labeled a demon cause I can't even die
The curse of eternity - God created me, but why?
If I turn you into I, your age would never age and forever be by my side
Spoke about the wisdom that entered into my thoughts
The will of the universe, including the Willendorf
This is art
I'm a God

Every night, I kiss your picture on the nightstand
Love's a battlefield, it's not a one-night stand
Alone, praying every day that I can stop thinking about you
But I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby
I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby

I would go to war with God",Twilight (War with God),2013
Kevin Gates,"‘Sup, nigga, huh?
You know what this shit is?
Stay down and come up, (damn right)
Street niggas is street niggas alike
It ain’t even one way, nigga (two niggas most)
Stay down until you come up, nigga
Four songs, nigga, (Blood Money, let’s go)

Everythin’ wrong, this can’t be right
Man, it’s so much, this can’t be life (yeah)
Shit get real, me and K. on back
(Stay on back, nigga, do what you gotta do)
Never came back in that black on black

I still do it for them niggas with them bricks on bricks
I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
Let me tell you how real niggas pull a rebound back
See I never came back in that black on black

Nigga come through for a nine and a half
I’ma tell him ain’t nothin’ left
Nigga need an eight, tell him everythin’ straight
All they gotta do it wait, tell a nigga I’m a Chef
How you think a nigga went and got that race?
Could have went to jail but I bought that case
Lawyer came through, told him it’s about time
Jim Carrey to the Rollie, I just switch that switch
Put 10 karats on my daughter ear, fuck it
She deserved every rock, I done sold out in public
Do anythin’ for my Destiny’s Child
She a Beyoncé, never be LeToya Luckett
Black on black, checkerboard Louis luggage
On a PJ feelin’ like Warren Buffett
With the Minnesota Twins, ain’t no Kirby Puckett
Let the shade fear clouds, tell Aaliyah that I love her
Back and forth in a Lear
My grandmother say I never see her
She want me come home on Thanksgivin’
Cause I’m black on black like, yeah
Black on black to my dear
Black on black in my ear
Black Maserati that I gave to my mama
Right hand to the throttle, she can’t even find the gears

Everythin’ wrong, this can’t be right
Man, it’s so much, this can’t be life (yeah)
Shit get real, me and K. on back

I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
(Stay down until you come up)
Let me tell you how them real niggas pull a rebound back
(How you bounce back nigga, nigga do what?)
See I never came back in that black on black

Hold up, hold up, hold up
Shit get real, we don’t fold up
This is what I told myself in my grandma’s kitchen
At the table, nigga, choppin’ my blow up
Said she want to sell more like my father
Same time, had me for a couple dollars
Yeah, I’m ’bout to put on
And now I’m ’bout to kill these niggas
So you might not see me ’til tomorrow’
’til I get it, then my palms start itchin’
Soon I hit the block, then my bong gone missin’
See, I’m ’bout to take me a trip to the other side of town
And I’m goin’ there to find me a chicken
Yeah, I got a nigga in the spot with a nine right now
So, I’m goin’ there to sell him a pigeon
My parents told me that the money is the root of all evil
I said it is then a lil’ more

If I had to be precise, tell you two things about life
Niggas win everyday, niggas fail every night
I say, “Now, Oprah got a billion dollars
And you know what near her”
Type of shit I tell myself while starin’ in the mirror
What!

Everythin’ wrong, this can’t be right
Man, it’s so much, this can’t be life (yeah)
Shit get real, me and K. on back
(We gotta do what we gotta do, you feel me)
Never came back in that black on black

(Talk to ‘em, homie)
I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
(Stay down until you come up)
Let me tell you how them real niggas pull a rebound back
(How you bounce back nigga, nigga do what?)
See I never came back in that black on black

Met man named George, straight drop, no whippin’
Electric off, everything’s boilin’ in the fridge
I ain’t bathed in a week, I was smellin’ like pickles
Street showin’ no pities, still gettin’ to the business
? break it down, sell nickels
Had to ball him out of jail, blew the money on the bail
When flat, bounced back from a 30-cent flipper
I don’t even know a nigga livin’ how I’m livin’
I don’t even know how many times I’ve been to prison
Shit get gangsta, we call …
Bought two things, had the third one off issue
Two-fifty-two on the scale, that’s a nino
Eighteen sales, five hundred-four grams
Add an extra gram when you weigh it with the …
Real rap talk, keep it real, don’t believe you
When you get out of line, swear to God, I’ma leave you
Dirks cuts the water ‘fore they kick a nigga dope
Try to flush it down the toilet but the dope just flow
Tear gas from the cannon
Everybody scramblin’, but I ain’t the one to panic
Double homicide, broad day, that’s my jacket
Tried to bird feed, cut through on my jacket
And I take change, I’m a serve when they askin’
Come from out of town, I’ma test, none or less

Everythin’ wrong, this can’t be right
Man, it’s so much, this can’t be life (yeah)

Drew your name in class
Professor asked is this a new degree
Profusely in pursuit of in something you
Reminded me of us society
Feel 'em slipping from sanity,
Don't eat enough
I'm rude no longer speak as much
Frequent find the reasons
Niggas stepping on my sneakers
Got me steaming, I should beat 'em up
Or get beat up and say somebody made ugly

Huffing puffing phone reluctant

Actin' like she don't but I know she really wanna
Break the bitch down if she ask of my karma
Won't pick up the phone, make her turn into a stalker
Put her out the car, don't perform and you're walkin'

You are not a star to a king and regardless

I prayed from em', everyday for em'
He'll smile at me make a face for em'
My auntie say thanks which I couldn't believe

All praise go to heaven your god don't exist

With popular people I don't fit
They was stupid they focus on bullshit
Now the whips they be driving is bullshit
Yo pastor lie to you right from the pulpit
Go hard or starve
No wait on God
Give him your money? That's bullshit

Put it in a ho name so I buy it for 'em
Pockets was slim as a diet form
Good dope sell itself wanna try it for 'em?
Smoke out hotel rooms and set off the fire alarm
Bwa start a riot for 'em

Child support court or get fought
All the best lawyers get bought

Let that other nigga take care of that
You be on his dick like his shit raw
Lied to you in his friend car
Sold you a dream and you got caught
These hoes want rap niggas or a athlete that play ball
Sip coffee peep it don't talk
Handle shit horribly we fall off
I was just tryna be a real friend to you now
I'm wishing that we get lost
We was only fifteen at ya momma house
Clicked over hold up miss call
Phone ringing damn it's my dawg
Thinking like how the fuck he know y'all?

Way a nigga living when you see me in the picture 
Difficult to tell the difference in the season when I'm thugging
Heart cold, long nose, stumping through the jungle
Automatic that I'm packing, wearing jackets in the summer
Body being healed, having trouble with my left foot
Learned how to fight different, caught him with the left hook
Really pushing D with the clip, cooking Ki's
Many probably agree, on TV was the best look
Anticipated launch or a lift-off
Metaphor, going opposite of dick-soft
Mind on the ticket, out the mud seen Nicki album cover
Would make the dick spit, but it's still soft
Get out my cell when I shit, get lost
I'll punch a nigga down when I'm pissed off
Wanna wrestle, had to put him in a hip-toss
Lot of rap niggas backwards, criss-cross
Guess I never had swag

Pants tight on your ass, matter fact while you at it, put on lip gloss
Mind rambling, I guess it kinda slipped off

Playing tears running down my face I ain't playing
Miss laying with my bitch having real-talks
Laying in her lap with her fingers in my scalp 
Get to rubbing on my back till I drift off
Affection ain't cheap, coming with cost
Paying all the bills when the rent call
Fucking with a NFL player when his check long
Running back as if a running-back
Hard to stomach that you let him fuck for nothing

Spontaneous the way I do my shit, you wouldn't believe
Rip out in the kitchen then I fuck her on her knees
Make her eat my dick in front of her friend before I leave
Bae you got these niggas jealous, steady wishin' they was me
I turned up for a check and got some money off the streets
Backseat of the Jag cut up for everyone to see
Hit the club next to me in my section in VIP
Eat the pussy from the back and I don't give a fuck who lookin'
Might not notice but I'm strapped, bitch act a ass, I gotta cook em'
Under the light she dance for me, body movin' slow
Break bread, fingernails pedicured, the polish glow
My bitch look like a tiger, eye color type, she exotic
Swallow from the bottle, point at what I want, she holler
Tongue between her asscheeks, steam all in the shower
Down for whatever, whatever, Bonnie and Clyde her

Would I be wrong? I wanna fuck you with one of my niggas
If afterwards I promise that I wouldn't look at you different
Broke down some buds of grigy, emptied my garden twisted
Settle down, it's 'bout to get explicit
Passed you the light, you lit it, inhale, you cough, I get it
Love the way you look at me, especially when you're tipsy

Shoes dirty, everybody used to laugh
Did the dash, acting bad? Yes I am

Ran the money up, then she started calling
Smokin' good, excuse me with the cough

Big Ron jumping out of cars
Seen my process get destroyed
Hard to say I love you when I don't
Stubborn, not admitting when I'm wrong
Smoke clears, not enough alone
Passing by your grandmothers house
Hoping I could catch you outside
Stepping out, I gotta dress fly
Hoping, we could maybe catch eye
I'm that little nigga now
Balling for billions
I'm leaning, a hell of a feeling now
Turn the lights down, mouth blinging
Goddamn just what I was thinking
Big Jigga talking about banging
Actually I'm thinking 'bout sneezing
Never change up
Never change up
Gave the lames up
In the game
Never gave a name up

I am Louie banged up
But I move those thangs
I don't do no gang banging
Fuck the game up

AMG, big body coupe
Passing through the ghetto, they salute
Broke and out of dope
They was acting like they didn't have smoke on 'em
Now we on the road, my cologne got a strong odor
Asking where you been at little homie
Smell like you got a pound of smoke on ya
Mall shopping look at what I found
Private jets, we not on the ground
12 am, smell of coffee grounds
Gates right back at it once again
I'm a gangster, my administration
Go and get it, I don't to no waiting man
Pussy rapper made me play the waiting game
Smell like Teen Spirit, I am Kurt Cobain

You ever jumped out on a nigga block ya heard me and just been like, ""Ay who the big dog is?""
I'm getting 'em whole, I'm gettin' the load
They come off a plane, they come off a boat
The eighteen wheeler pull up on the low, beep!
Back it back into the zone, beep!
Pager we hit like a phone (hello?)
Text message I settle it wrong
Text something your nigga be gone
He ain't on the connect that I'm strong
I send a hit and the pressure be on
Ridin' in Bentleys mind your business
I'm the business, we in the building
Breadwinner, boss material
Breadcrumbs, not with the cereal
Real one when I look in the mirror
Dope in the pot here makin' a miracle
Hold on boo don't get hysterical
We in the gutter, shit'll be scary
That's the new scary, I am not scary
You are not fresh, what are you wearing?
When I get dressed people are staring
Think what you want, I am not caring
Tell my lil' hoe, ""I don't mind sharing""
She keep it solid, movin' in silence
Every time, a lil' hearin' impaired
Nobody perfect we understand
Balled a case, gave her some bands
She hold a sack, thumbin' through that
I hit from the back, I make her tap
Pullin' her hair, we in the trap
All of the (?) seen her naked
Still servin' whilst I'm flexing
Shirt off and I'm sexy
Skrrt off in the Lexus
Straight raw, I'm a legend
Gold MAC-911
Rap talk, I'm a veteran
Cookin' a brick and I'm makin' a steal
I got cooler right in the kit
Food boomin' right in the trenches
New booty give me your digits
Stick and dick all of your kidneys
New jewelry really ridiculous
New coupe removable ceilings
Two scoop, nigga we drippin'
Ice movin' all of my digits
Bitch bad booty got dippers
Fuck her face, or do you got pimples
Dump her off, she live in a demo
Migo call, tell him to send her
Roadside, surface deliver
Rolls Royce, shitting on niggas
No choice, force me to kill 'em
My swag, you cannot mimic
This high, I'm really livin'
Truth be told, I'm one of them niggas
Truth be told, I shot a few niggas
I'm a trophy, I'm in the city
Trap spot, we goin' digi
Push button, punish your witness
Kush comin' in a few minutes
(?) hey why you pretendin'?
Wasn't for me, you wouldn't be livin'
Pull up outside, hop out and finish
I'm really winnin', standin' up tension
Make a decision, how we gon' fix it?

And beat others again

I had to make a decision

Just one of the extras with blood on their faces
In snow-white and the seven basket cases
I'm happy and dopey and dirty in places

Lock up your daughters, Avon crawling!
Devoted collectors of paraphernalia out walking the rock
Battle and bitch for the ultimate kitch

Appear every hour and bang in the nails

On your block

Disturbing facts about Nazi splinter groups seen on the news

Kevin Godley,"I was standing in the station
being pounded by the rain
so I chose the last compartment
of a stationary train
I felt someone get in behind me
but I never caught their eye
but I thought I heard I heard a woman''s voice
whispering goodbye

So I lay down in the darkness
with the beer and coffee stains
and I stared out at the thunder
through the broken window panes
And although the storm was booming
like an engine in the sky
I''m sure I heard a woman''s voice cry

Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb
it''s over and done
I''ll never be under your thumb forever

So I rolled myself a cigarette
and smoked it on my own
but it didn''t stop the whispers
or the smell of her cologne
Then she rose up out of nowhere
and her hair was full of steam
and she stuck her head out the window
and screamed and screamed, she screamed!

Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb
it''s over and done
I''ll never be under your thumb forever

So I picked up an old newspaper to read
and I noticed something very strange indeed
So I looked a little closer
and it chilled me to the bone
""Woman throws herself from speeding train,
identity unknown""
But I recognized the picture of the woman who was dead
and underneath the picture it said

Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb
it''s over and done
I''ll never be under your thumb forever

Kevin Grant,"His pulpit's a corner at 19th and Main
His grip on the gospel is his one claim to fame
He hurls fire and brimstone at the cars passin' by
He offers salvation from the savior on high

His khakis are tattered, he ain't bathed in weeks
His bouts with the bottle show up on his cheeks
He looks like a scarecrow, a sight to behold
While he works for the shepherd, bringin' lambs to the fold

He points to the Bible he holds in his hand
Says, I'm proof that the good Lord can save any man

Son, it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear
Material possessions won't matter up there
Someday in heaven with the angels I'll sing
And these rags that I'm wearin' will be fit for a king

He's fightin' a fever, in spite of the chills
He pulls up his collar and speaks of God's will
His body is weakened but his faith is still strong
He's filled with conviction for the mission he's on

'Cause a mansion is waitin', he'll be homeless no more
And his words will still echo from that far distant shore

My cinnamon apple, you know you did me wrong
My cinnamon apple, said you know you did me wrong

Look I wanna take y'all back to 7th grade, middle school
Skinny kid that everybody knew
I was a lil' cool
Had my intial ring, gold chain, my lil' jewels
What was more than most had so I never got ridiculed
This was '89, matter fact it was '90
Crack was already huge, the streets start getting grimey
But I wasn't in that world then
I'm 13, all I'm thinkin' bout is Nike's, basketball and my girlfriend
Yeah, who at the time was Tia Williams
And she had no idea that one day I would see a million
This is a teengae love, few months but we was buildin'
She was grown, I was the man but we was children
She had ass though, I mean for her age or whatever
She wore my ring some times like we engaged or whatever
And this the ""No, you hang up first"" dial tone era
Your mom's pick up and say ""Hang up my house phone"" era
And I hated that, how you gon' scream in my baby ear
That pretty lil' brown skin girl with the baby hair
As we was going steady, my sex drive was so Andretti
She a virgin but I feel like it's time, I know she ready
He ain't got much experience, but she don't know that
That boy's chance is coming up, I hope he don't blow that
I'm waiting for the opportunity, mama at work
Start with a kiss, then I'm in her shirt, next I'm in her skirt
You know that always heard that the first time gonna hurt
That's what she heard from her cousin, 'lied and told her it doesn't
And so to me, it's just a matter of time
That Tia gon' give it up to me and that'll be mine
But one day I was absent, I came back to school
Learned that, I left the man but I came back the fool
They said that ""Tia did some bullshit, I mean did y'all speak?""
She cut school, lost her virginity, some kid named Khalif
An I'm stuck... Like what the fuck?
I ain't hear that my girl did what?
But had to act like I ain't care
Felt like I wanted to cry, but nah I ain't tear
That first time I learned that trust ain't a must if I ain't there
And of course we broke up, she moved on, I did the same
I ended up with some next girl, forget her name
Which probably isn't right, cause we used to get along
But I remember Tia, cause she did me wrong

Kevin J. O'Connell,"There's a dear old land of leprechauns
And wondrous wishing wells
And nowhere else on God's green Earth
There be such lakes and dells

No wonder that the angels love
That shamrock covered shore
It draws my heart home again
And I love it more and more

Have you ever heard the story of
How Ireland got its name
Well, I'll tell you so you'll understand
From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven [Shure They Call It Ireland],2000

And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go.

Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

Beneath all of our words

Habrías de encontrarme
Allí en tu dulce abismo

Qué lindo que es soñar
Soñar no cuesta nada
Soñar y nada más
Con los ojos abiertos
Qué lindo que es soñar
Y no te cuesta nada
Más que tiempo

Soñé que no hacia falta
Hacer ningún esfuerzo
Para que tu entregaras
En ti yo estaba inmerso

VERSE 
I'll remember forever, 
When I was but three, 
Mama, who was clever. 
Remarking to me…. 
If son when you're grown up 
You want ev'rything nice 
I've got your future sewn up 
If you take this advice… 

REFRAIN 1 
Be a clown, be a clown 
All the world loves a clown 
Act the fool play the calf 
And you'll always have the last laugh 
Wear the cap and the bells 
And you'll rate with all the best swells 
If you become a doctor, folks'll face you with dread 
If you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead 
You'll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head 
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown. 

REFRAIN 2 
Be a clown, be a clown 
All the world loves a clown 
Be a crazy buffoon 
And the demoiselles'll all swoon 
Dress in huge baggy pants 
And you'll ride the road to romance 
A butcher or a baker ladies never embrace 
A barber or a beau would be a social disgrace 
They all'll come to call if you can fall on your face 
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown 

REFRAIN 3 
Be a clown, be a clown 
All the world loves a clown 
Show ‘em tricks tell ‘em jokes 
And you'll only stop with top folks 
Be a crack jackanapes 
And they'll imitate you like apes 
Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears? 
Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years? 
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears 
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown 

REFRAIN 4 
Be a clown, be a clown 
All the world loves a clown 
If you just make ‘em roar 
Watch your mountebank soar 
Wear a painted moustache 
And you're sure to make a big splash 
A college education I should never propose 
A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clo'es 
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose 
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown 

REFRAIN 5 
Be a clown, be a clown 
All the world loves a clown 
Be the poor silly ass 
And you'll always travel first class 
Give ‘em quips, give ‘em fun 
And they'll apy and say you're A1 
If you become a farmer you've the weather to buck 
If you become a gambler you'll be stuck with your luck 
But Jack you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck

Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
And I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And I and girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

For you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone (you are not alone)
For I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (though you're far away)

For you are not alone (you are always in my heart)
For I am here with you though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone not alone, oh",You Are Not Alone [*],2008
Kevin Levar & One Sound,"Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone

Alone, alone
Why, alone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone

We'll shed our stains showering
In the room that makes the rain

All alone with you
Makes the butterflies in me arise

And the earth rotates
To our dictates
Slowly we make love

That you thought was so sexy 
And even though you had a man 
He was still turnin you on

Move the feelin right

Not an ordinary night 
Feeling lust is in the air (hey) 
Way your body looks 
Its turnin me on 
They way you lick your lips slow 
Makes me want you even more

Whoooooah oh oh oh oh

End of the night

For just me and you

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Then let the fire start

Kevin Mahogany,"I used to visit all the very gay places
Those come what may places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life...
From jazz and cocktails.

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distant gay traces
That used to be there you could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day...
Twelve o'clock tales.

Then you came along with your siren of song
To tempt me to madness!
I thought for a while that your poignant smile was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me.

Ah yes! I was wrong...
Again,
I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A troughful of hearts could only be a bore.
A week in paris will ease the bite of it,
All I care is to smile in spite of it.

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still burning inside my brain.
Romance is mush,
Stifling those who strive.
I'll live a lush life in some small dive...
And there I'll be, while I rot
With the rest of those whose lives are lonely, too..

And start heading for the door

Piercing me right through the core
It says, turn around, you fool
You know you love him more and more
Tell me why is it so

Don't wanna let you go

Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's the same old dizzy hangup
Can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go

In the first embrace of a haunted smile
With the hopeful eyes of an alien child

In the burning sheets of a neighbor's pain
With the sweat of a night and the summer rain
In the cry of birth and the death of fear
For the hope of a light and the joy of tears

From the tear-stained face of a haunted kind

Kevin Max,"People get ready, there's a train a-coming
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear that diesel humming
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

People get ready for the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers coast to coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board them
There's hope for all among those loved the most

You know there ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
For there's no hiding place against the kingdom's throne

People get ready, there's a train a-coming
You don't need no baggage, no, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesel's humming
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

Kevin Max,"My goodness gracious, let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dew
I've been down on a bended knee
Talking to the Man from Galilee

He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet
He called my name, and my heart stood still
When He said, ""Son, go do my will""

Go tell that long-tongue liar
Go and tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter
Tell him God Almighty's gonna cut him down

You can run now for a long time
(Run on for a long time, run on for a long time)
Let me tell you, God Almighty's gonna cut you down

You can run now for a long time
(Run on for a long time, run on for a long time)
Let me tell you, God Almighty's gonna cut you down

You may throw your rock, hide your hand
Working in the dark against your fellow man
As sure as God made day and night
What you do in the dark will be brought to the light

You may run and hide, slip and slide
Try to take the mote from your neighbor's eyes
Oh yeah, as sure as God made the rich and poor
You're gonna reap just what you sow, oh, oh no

You can run now for a long time
(Run on for a long time, run on for a long time)

Some people go to church just to signify
Trying to make a date with the neighbor's wife
Well then, let me tell you, just as sure as you're born
You better leave that woman alone

'Cause one of these days, just mark my word
Think that brother has gone to work
You sneak right up, knock on that door
That's all, brother, you'll knock no more

So tell that long-tongue liar
Tell that midnight rider
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter
Tell him God Almighty's gonna cut him down

You can run now for a long time
(Run on for a long time, run on for a long time)
Let me tell you, God Almighty's gonna knock you down

You can run now for a long time
(Run on for a long time, run on for a long time)
Let me tell you, God Almighty's gonna cut you down

You can run now for a long time
(Run on for a long time, run on for a long time)
Let me tell you, God Almighty's gonna cut you down
(Run on for a long time, run on for a long time)

Let me tell you, God Almighty's gonna cut you down

Kevin Max,"No more lying friends
Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They won't go when I'd go

All those bleeding hearts
With sorrows to impart
Were right here from the start
They won't go when I go

And I'll go where I've longed to go
So long away from tears

Gone from painful cries
Away from saddened eyes
Along with him I'll bide
Because they won't go when I go

Big men feeling small
Weak ones standing tall
I will watch them fall
They won't go when I go

And I'll go where I've longed to go
So long away from tears

Unclean minds mislead the pure
The innocent will leave for sure
'Cause then there is a resting place

People sinning just for fun
They will never see the sun
For they can never show their faces

There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who will take more than he will give
He will give, he ain't hardly gonna give

The greed of man will be
Far away from me
And my soul will be free
And they won't go when I go

And since my soul conceived
All that I believe
The kingdom I will see
'Cause they won't go when I go

And I'll go, when I go
No one can keep me from my destiny

Kevin Max,"Every generation
Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door

I know that I'm a prisoner
To all my Father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage
To all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thoughts
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got

You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talkin' in defense

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts

So Don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different date
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be O.K.

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

I wasn't there that morning
When my Father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say

I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

Say it loud, say it clear

Don't give in

Time moves so slow when promises get broken

Children shout as they're running out to play

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1998

Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind I know they still live on and on

But how do you thank someone
Who was taken you from crayons to perfume
It isn't easy but I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I'd write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high

To sir with love
The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong that's a lot to learn
What can I give you in return
If you wanted the moon

I would try to make a start but I
Would rather let me give you my heart

And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot,
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upset.

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away.

Now the ground is white,
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song.

Baby, hands that rest on jutting hips repenting
Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows

I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize

There are some with no home,

Not a nickel to loan
Could I be, really mean,

Pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred (scarred), somebody's broken heart (heart)
And a washed out dream
(Washed out dream)

They follow the pattern of the wind ya see

'Cause they got no place to be that's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself, and then make that change

Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind I know they will still live on and on
But how do you thank someone
Who was taken you from crayons to perfume
It isn't easy but I'll try
If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
To sir with love
The time has come
For closing books
And long last looks must end
And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend
A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong that's a lot to learn
What can I give you in return?
If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start but I
Would rather you let me give my heart

I had a sky-blue, rag top Mustang, a 1964

As she took the stage
But she was convinced if she got up there
That she'd be discovered some day
So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh, she melted them
She brought them to their feet

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place
And she signed autographs
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath
That small time town was hers

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

Hey, she doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends cut her down
The only thought she entertains is where they aren't
And where she is now

A few old neighbors swear they are certain
She slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you're goin'
Unless you got something they ain't got
So she sings tonight
To twenty thousand plus
And the young girls scream out loud
Man that could be us

She's a big star
She eats caviar
Just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She's a big star",Big Star,2006

Got to figure how to get you on the team

So I asked if we could sit on the steps
And let a young G kick it from the right to the left
Gotta keep it movin? and work the game
Trying to spend a minute up next to your frame

she's so fine that it really, really blows my mind

It hit me like a missile when I seen it, shawty got me feelin?

Got me wanna clean and cook, maybe I'm dreaming
Listen, ba boom, ba boom, hear my heart beating
Weekends I don't even hit the club

In the bed it?s whatever she wanna do
We stop, take a break and get ready for round two
?Cause I can't get enough of that girl
I can't get enough of that girl

she's five foot nothing, I'm feeling the frame
A man that donkey on the back but like you need to be tamed
See I got her by the game, you know it?s a fact, boy

Hey, little girl, don't cry, dry your eyes
I wrote this song for you
Now, it goes down

Can you imagine every world?
Every boy and every girl
They'd all get the same things
They'd all get the same things

A little dough, a lot of love
With a mom and dad to hug
They'd all get the same things

Huh, but down here the world is real
And it don't matter how you feel
Because, we don't get the same things
We don't get the same things

You got to work to stay alive
Forty hours, from 9 to 5
We don't get the same things

All my gangster friends, yeah
And all my skater friends
(What they want?)
We all want the same thing
(What we want, now?)
We all want the same thing, yeah

DJ's in the clubs, Jesus, freaks and thugs
We all want the same thing
Same thing, same thing
Same thing, same thing, now

And, I think about the way
All the politicians say
(What they saying, now?)
Say they want to change things
Say they want to change things

But every year, they take some more
And I don't know what it's for
Though, they never change things
(They don't change nothing)

But, if you want to make it stop, stop
Well, first, you got to start
Making some big, old changes
Doing some different things, yeah

Get up out your bed, think outside your head
And you won't get the same things
Same thing, same thing
Same thing, now

All my gangster friends
And all my skater friends
(What they want, now?)
We all want the same thing
(What we want, now?)
I said, we all want the same thing

DJ's in the clubs, Jesus, freaks and thugs
We all want the same thing
Same thing, same thing
Same thing now

All my ex-girlfriends
And all their new boyfriends
(What they doing, now?)
They all want the same thing
(What they want, now?)
I said, they all want the same thing

From Wall Street to the hood
New York and Hollywood
We all want the same thing, yeah
(And what you say, what you say?)

Yeah, first say pie to the people
The have's and the have not's
Are we willing to give up all the hours
Just to make it all equal?

And make players out the mascots?
'Cause, right now, we don't see you
Like the Sasquatch
Unless, the root of all evil is what you have got

You're even more visible
If your hair is lots
If not banging from the beach
Then banish you to the sand box

With no lifeguard to come after you
No amount, you don't count, like Dracula
Your bound to drown like a Titanic passenger
Or, a Haitian refugee trafficker

They come and get you off the island
That you crashed into
They take a yacht
And send the slave ship back for you

Money matters, don't let it master you
Pressing on the answer
Till they give you what you're asking for
It's like that, yeah, it's like that

This is a message to
Remind you there's just one who calls love
Take them to church, Kevin

Was made bright by the light
Of the smile in your eye,

Like a candle that's set
In the window at night,
Your fond love has cheered me
And guided me right.

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Kevin Olusola,"If you would allow me a second to deal with some in-house issues here

Hey Pastor you know it's hard for me when you quote Puritans
Oh, the precious Puritans
Have you not noticed our facial expressions?
One of bewilderment, and heartbreak, like ""Not you too, Pastor""
You know they were chaplains on slave ships, right?
Would you quote Columbus to Cherokees?
Would you quote Cortez to Aztecs, even if they theology was good?
It just sings a blind privilege, wouldn't you agree?
Your precious Puritans

They looked my onyx and bronze skinned forefathers in they face
Their polytheistic, God-hating face
Their shackled, diseased, imprisoned, face
And taught a Gospel that said that God had multiple images in mind when He created us in it
Therefore destined salvation contains a contentment
In the stage for which they were given
Which is to be owned by your forefather's superior, image bearing face
Says your precious Puritans

And my anger towards this teaching screams of an immature doctrine
And a misunderstanding of the Gospel
I should be content in this stage, right?
Isn't that what Paul taught, according to your precious Puritans?

Oh you get it, but you don't get it
Oh that we can go back to an America that once were
Founded on Christian values
They don't build preachers like they used to
Oh the richness of their revelation
It must be nice to not have to consider race
It must be nice to have time to contemplate the stars
Pastor, your color-less rhetoric is a cop out
You see my skin, and I see yours
And they are beautiful, fearfully and wonderfully, divinely designed
Uniqueness
Shouldn't we celebrate that rather than act like it ain't there?
I get it
Your Puritans got it, but

How come the things the Holy Spirit showed them
In the Valley of Vision
Didn't compel them to knock on they neighbor's door
And say ""you can't own people!""
Your precious puritans were not perfect
You romanticize them as if they were inerrant
As if the skeletons in they closet was pardoned due to they hard work and tobacco growth
As if abolitionists were not racists and just pro-union
As if God only spoke to white boys with epic beards
You know Jesus didn't really look like them paintings
That was just Michaelangelo's boyfriend
Your precious Puritans

Oh they got it but they don't get it
There's not one generation of believers 
That has figured out the marriage between proper doctrine and action
Don't pedestal these people
Your precious Puritan's partners purchased people
Why would you quote them?

Step away
Think of the congregation that quotes you
Are you inerrant?
Trust me, I know the feeling
Same feeling I get when people quote me like if they only knew
See I get it, but I don't get it, huh
Ask my wife

And it bothers me when you quote Puritans, if I'm honest
For the same reason it bothers me when people quote me
They precious Propaganda
So I guess it's true that God really does use crooked sticks
To make straight lines
Just like your precious Puritans",Precious Puritans,2012

And it's calling your name
And before the night is ending
The message that it's sending
Will it all be in vain

And we'll watch them come and go

Don't go, you can't deny

As the wailing winds are calling
And the broken leaves are falling
And the magic that surrounds you
I will build a world around you

Don't go, and in my heart

Don't go, and in my eyes

Information's giving quite a grand illusion
Hearts are beating, keeping time to meet a deadline
Faces pressed against the pane to watch a headline

When the winds blow I will call
When the winds blow I will call
When the winds blow I will call you
We will stand and watch them fall

All our ships are sailing blindly under one sun
Sending signals, calling kindly, reaching no-one
Echoes sound the shifting air of empires calling
Hold my hand, the shifting sand of empires falling

When the winds blow I will call
When the winds blow I will call
When the winds blow I will call you
We will stand and watch them fall
Oh, we'll stand and watch them fall

We confided, then decided not to follow
All the slogans, taunts and charges, sound so hollow
With open minds across the border, we have waited
But keeping place within this race is complicated

When the winds blow I will call
When the winds blow I will call
When the winds blow I will call you

Kevin Ramsey,"Okay folks here's a little story just for you
Now one night Farmer Brown was takin' the air
He locked up the farmyard with the greatest of care
But down in the hen-house something stirred
And when he shouted, ""Who's there?""
This is what he heard

There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So quiet yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
We chickens tryin' to sleep, and you butt in
And hobble hobble hobble hobble it's a sin

Now Farmer Brown lit his corn cobbed pipe
He looked down at his trusty dog
And he said, ""Hey I'd the chickens said they alright they are alright
Let's head back to the shack Jack""
But the dog wasn't convinced, he said, ""Go back to the hen house""
Gave a little doggy knock and in his best chickenese said
""Is everything alright?""

I said there ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
You're stompin' around and checkin' around
And kickin' up an awful fuss
We chickens tryin' to sleep, and you butt in
And hobble hobble hobble hobble it's a sin

""Okay, okay, okay"", said the dog and he turned to leave
Just then a very unchicken like sneeze came
From the hen house, ""Achoo""
Farmer Brown cocked his gun, he says, ""I'm a comin' in
You better open that door just a teeny weeny
Bit so I can take a peek""

No, tomorrow is a busy day
We got things to do, we got eggs to lay
Ground to dig, we've got worms to scratch
You know it takes a lot of sittin' gettin' chicks to hatch
Besides there ain't nobody here but us chickens

There ain't nobody here at all
So stop that fuss and raisin' dust
Hey there ain't nobody here but us
So kindly point that gun the other way
And hobble hobble hobble off and hit the hay

Okay, I guess you're right, I'm off to sleep
Goodnight
Hey Boss man, what d'ya think?
Easy pickin's, ain't nobody here but us chickens

I'm tired of transportation in the back of a hack
I'd love to hear the rhythm of the clicketty clack
And hear the lonesome whistle see the smoke from the stack
And pal around with the democratic fellows named Mac
Take me right back to the track Jack

Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie
Woo woo, woo woo, ch'boogie

You need some compensation to get back in the black
You take a morning paper from the top of the stack
And read the situations from the front to the back

So put it right back in the rack Jack

Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie
Woo woo, woo woo, ch'boogie

Take me right back to the track Jack

I'm gonna settle down by the railroad track
Live the life of Reilly in a beaten down shack
So when I hear the whistle I can peep through the crack
And watch the train a-rolling when it's balling the jack
For I just love the rhythm of the clicketty clack
So take me right back to the track jack

Tú me seduces, baby no abuses 

Entonces dame una noche, una noche y ya
Que mi cuerpo ya siente la necesidad
De recorrer tu piel y poderte amar
Dame una noche

Solo una noche pa' estar contigo

Haz que el alcohol desaparezca el temor

Acércate más a mí báilame con tu malicia 
Te voy a explotar mami con tan solo una caricia 
Te lo hago una delicia, te tengo una noticia ma' 
Si me das una noche te envicias 
Quiero preguntar ¿Por qué me miras así? 
Será que deseas que te lleve al éxtasis 
Lo puedo asegurar, tus ojos dicen que sí 
Para que adivinar, mejor vámonos de aquí mami 

Entonces dame una noche, una noche y ya
Que mi cuerpo ya siente la necesidad
De recorrer tu piel y poderte amar
Dame una noche 
(Baby) 
Solo una noche pa' estar contigo 

Tú pones a volar mi imaginación 
(Si) 
Solo tú me provocas esta sensación 
Me haces perder la razón con tu seducción 
Con la intensión de que se de la ocasión 
Porque quieres darme esa noche 

Yo sé que esa mirada que me das no es para nada accidental 
Se nota la malicia y óyeme tú sí que sabes provocar 
No me conoces, pero aún así sin tener piedad 
Tú me seduces

Vea usted quien no lo ha hecho, no se va pa fuera
Que la discoteca esta hecha pal perreo, fumeteo, botelleo

Esta loca es soltera que calentaera
Que quiere tomarse la botella entera
Y voy a gastarle todo lo que quiera
Quiero que sea mia, sea lo que sea

La mujer maravilla
De amiga tiene una escuadrilla
Les dicen el combo pesadilla
Tienen el corazón seco, vaciaron el amor por un juego
Te enamoran, te dejan los sentimientos chuecos
Kevin y yo estamos puesto pal problema
Bebe sabes cual es nuestro lema?
La que pillemos, le derretimos el sistema
Y mañana nos textean poemas

Soltera es la que hecha el condón en la cartera
Y esta que no lo ha hecho, no se va pa fuera

Deja tu novio en su casa
Y te me pones un vestido
Voy hacer de todo contigo

Y una pastilla que la nota le explota

Le derretimos el sistema bien duro le metemos
Baby si tu eres soltera, si estas soltera
Alza la mano puedes hacer lo que quieras

Ella esta ready, no tiene novio lo dejo en el sótano
Me enloqueció cuando llego con ese culo bien nítido
Parece que se manda solo, pero yo se lo descontrolo

Esta sola en la pista moviendo eso

Y odiar en mi cama que seas la intrusa
Yo soy feliz cuando lo hacemos y lo hacemos, nos entregamos por completo
Hacer de una aventura lo que tenemos, aunque no sé ni lo que hacemos

Arriesgaría todo lo que soy por que se haga realidad

Todo el mundo sabe lo bonita que estás
Y aunque hayan millones, como tú nadie más
Conquistas corazones donde quiera que vas
El mío ya es uno más, yeah yeah yeah

Y si no, me vuelvo loco por tu calor 
Ya quiero que estemos solos, baby tú y yo 

Oye bonita
Cuánto daría por un beso de tu boquita 
Con solo ver cómo mueves tu cuerpo me excita
Ay bonita 

Te estoy pensando, tu cuerpo mi domina 
Me estás tentando, mi mente se imagina 
Que estás bailando, conmigo en una esquina 
Después te lo voy hacer

Entre todas la mujeres, tienes lo que ninguna tiene 
Esa carita y ese cuerpo que el piso me mueve 
Contigo me olvidé la movie y los billetes de cienes 
Estar contigo baby es lo que me entretiene 

Es que tu cara, tu pelo, tus nalgas
Esa actitud, bebé que a mí me encanta 
Tú eres lo único que a mi vida le falta
Yo sé que yo también te gusto y estás que te quitas la falda 

Oye bonita
Cuánto daría por un beso de tu boquita 
Con solo ver cómo mueves tu cuerpo me excita

Swear the goal is to be bigger than everyone before us
Gotta show my son and daughter, that just because they your idols
They don’t mean they won’t be rivals, I’m looking at it like I was him
And I’m just tryna show him it’s all in the passion
I got dreams bigger than life, only I can imagine
Just want my expectations and what’s meant to be to have at it
So I’d rather overdo everything than half ass it
That’s why I remain to speak my piece and stand my ground
Keep my head high, won’t swallow pride
Just take my time, won’t compromise
For nobody, 'cause we can all be somebody (somebody)

Gotta figure out what you wanna be rather than just don’t wanna be
Down your chones, 'cause this is where I wanna be

Lately I’ve been realizing its all of what you make it
Amazing this grace is, my gracious, I want you to embrace this

Never been this critical, some say that it’s ridiculous

Kevin Rowland,"I'll need tonight to sit and think about this
Think what to do.
I'll take some strength to banish hollow sorrow.
Hollow sorrow's nothing new.
Just enough strength to last until tomorrow
Until I believe in my soul.
Tonight I lost sight of all purpose
Despite all this trickery you told me was right.
I was such a good boy I let you hold the door
So kind, so nice, where's my prize?
(That's all there ever is) Oh yeah yeah yeah?
(That's all there ever was) Ah you must be fucking joking.
(The same for everyone) Oh yes. Yes yes.
Would you repeat that. Break it to me gently,
Stand over there.
Oh I know I was an arrogant boy but I let you hold the door
Oh I was kind. I was nice, where's the prize?
And I'm on the train from New Street
To Euston. I'm going out to Harrow again
And I'm trying to get the feeling
That I had in nineteen seventy two.
Oh but you're going too fast for me here,
I'm saying, wait a minute there, wait a minute there
Hold it, stop! Let me get this clear
(That's all there ever is) oh yeah yeah yeah?
(That's all there ever was) yes, yes. ha ha ha.
(The same for everyone) Oh yes. yes. yes.
You see I know what this is, I know
What's going on here, this is just the difference between 
It's the battle between the body and the soul. The spirit
And what's needed here
What I intend to do now is I'm going to punish my body.
I'll punish the body to believe in the soul, I will punish
my body, until I believe in my soul",Until I Believe in My Soul,1982

Introducing the Celtic Soul Brothers and featuring the strong devoted,
Ladies and gentlemen, would you now please take your leave.
Because we've sat back looking and nearly been took,
Even been scared but now I don't care and I'm telling anyone who'll listen.
I've seen what's on show and now there's no more to know
'cause I've been there, 
I've been seen there, 
I've seemed it, dreamed it,
Beened it, schemed it.
Excuse me please, you're standing in my space,
So step aside, now your time's up.
Come on my friends, I would now like to propose a toast
To the strength I see that's surrounding me and those who've cared,
Oh yes, I've been scared and I'm telling anyone who'll listen

Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

It would come with rockets, bells and poetry
But with me and you it just started quietly and grew
And believe it or not
Now there's something groovy and good
Bout whatever we got
And it's getting better
Growing stronger warm and wilder
Getting better everyday, better everyday
I don't feel all turned on and starry eyed
I just feel a sweet contentment deep inside
Holding you at night just seems kind of natural and right
And it's not hard to see
That it isn't half of what it's going to turn out to be
Cause it's getting better
Growing stronger, warm and wilder
Getting better everyday, better everyday
And just like a flower that takes time to bloom
This love of ours is taking time to grow
