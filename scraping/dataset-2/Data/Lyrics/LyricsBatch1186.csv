The Verve,"Cause it's a bittersweet symphony this life
Trying to make ends meet, you're a slave to the money then you die.
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the veins meet, yeah.
No change, I can't change, I can't change, I can't change,
but I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold.
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Well I never pray,
But tonight I'm on my knees, yeah.
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah.
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now.
But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now.

No change, I can't change, I can't change, I can't change,
But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold.
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

(Well have you ever been down?)
(I can't change, I can't change)

Cause it's a bittersweet symphony this life.
Trying to make ends meet, trying to find some money then you die.

The Verve,"I wander lonely streets
Behind where the old Thames does flow
And in every face I meet
Oh reminds me of what I have run from

In every man, in every hand
In every kiss, you understand
That living is for other men
I hope you two will understand

I've gotta tell you my tale
Of how I loved and how I failed
I hope you understand
These feelings should not be in the man

In every child, in every eye
In every sky, above my head
I hope that I know
So come with me to bed

Because it's you and me, we're history
There ain't nothing left to say
When I will get you alone

Maybe we could find a room
Where we could see what we should do
Maybe you know it's true
Living with me's like keeping a fool

In every man, in every hand
In every kiss, you understand
That living is for other men
I hope you know that I am me, so come on

I'm thinking about history
And I'm living for history
And I think you know about me
'Cause I am

And one and one is two
But three is company
When you're thinking about the things you do
And you're thinking about the things you do

I want to tell you my tale
How I fell in love and jumped out on my bail
Do you understand there's more in a smile than in a hand

In every sky, in every kiss
There's one thing that I might have missed
Why am I going to
A place that now belongs to you

But you were weak and so am I
Let's pick it up, let's even try
To live today, so why not smile
Don't dream away your life 'cause it is mine, it is mine
Is that a crime, is that a crime, this life is mine
But the bed ain't made, it's filled full of hope
I've got a skin full of dope
Oh the bed ain't made but it's filled full of hope
I've got a skin full of dope","History [Brixton Academy, 16/01/98]",1997
The Verve,"So take your time
I wonder if you're here just to use my mind
Don't take it slow 
You know I've got a place to go
You always do that
Something I'm not quite sure of
But just for today
Let go and slide away

I was thinking maybe we could go outside 
Let the night sky cool your foolish pride
Don't you feel alive 
These are your times and our highs

So take your time
I wonder which cup you'll drink from
I hope it's mine
Because you always do that something
Something I'm not quite sure of
But just for today
Let go and slide away

'Cause I read your mind
I read it because it takes me where I can't find
Because you always do that something
Something I'm not quite sure of
But just for today
Let go and burn away

I was thinking maybe we could go outside 
Let the night sky cool your foolish pride
Don't you feel alive 
These are your times, these are your highs

Slide away, burn away
Slide away, burn away
I read your mind
I read your mind
'Cause it takes me to where I can't find

I was thinking maybe we could go outside 
Let the night sky cool your foolish pride
Don't you feel alive

Maybe, maybe we could go outside 
Let the night sky cool your foolish pride
Open up you feel alive

the sky is lavender with ivory clouds that threaten
drops of finger-paints
puddle jumping children clad
in yellow raincoats splash the deeper
purple of veneer

rows and rows of animals, their shiver skin
is painted different shades
and from grazing painted grass their teeth
are stained the incandescent green
indifferent they watch the rainfall steady
blend their spots and run their stripes
of veneer

lovely ladies strip themselves of furs the winds require
lovely ladies bathe themselves in technicolor mire

till there was ringing in my ears
i haven't felt this good in years

another villain on the cover
of every major magazine
the victim somewhere in between

see how they twist and shout

and as i'm searching for the story
subscription card falls on the floor
i'm losing interest more and more

to pick it up i'm bending over
out of the corner of my eye
i see a pair of blazing thighs

see how they twist and shout

i straighten up to look her over
and up my back a shooting pain
it's bound to settle in my brain

When we walk in these places
Am I to blame

Blow them all away and start again

There's something about you
You're just the same

Why don't you blow, blow, blow,
Blow them all away and start again

But lightning strikes my heart
And the mayhem suits me well
I will be your umbrella
My stormy Cinderella

Blow you all away and start again
Teasing me forever, kiss me and then never come up for air
Why don't you blow, blow, blow, blow
What can I do my heart has chosen something wonderful
Just one look from you
And then I could brave the weather
With very little effort

Shiver at the sight of beast and beauty
Standing upright in a hurricane

The Verve Pipe,"Another day of deflating your face into tears
I shook your mood with the game and a bottle of beer
The day I fell off of the wagon you threw up your hands in disgust
Once again you just get the best of me

Remember you loved to be held, how you loved to be touched
And anxiously laughed at my jokes just a little too much
When I was so careful of cursing while you were still nursing your beer

Now it's a shame but I know that there's really no use for a brand new convertible
A mile to your parents', a mile to the store
Turn in our bottles for 10 cent deposits I'll drink us two dollars more

I don't recall anyone placing a gun to our heads,
We traded a trip 'round the world for a family instead
Our friend's were dispersing while you were still nursing our boy

And I knew things had changed when the pet names that you once gave me we soon gave to the pets
But I still come when you call them just to be sure

Now there's really no use for a neighborhood cheerleader
A block party president mowing his lawn,
Whose cabinet is empty with a mind full of nicotine fits

Cause I don't have the strength anymore",1229 Sheffield,1998

Felt the urge to stretch after a yawn and incidently raised my hand.

Someone who will never pioneer.

I just want to be her ornament.

Her shadow seems much cooler.
Camouflage myself and plan a splendid entrance.

I just want to be her situation pending expectation.

The Verve Pipe,"I've got to get arrested to keep you interested
I should have known that I can't change the world by staring at it
My arms have little feeling from lifting to the ceiling
A recipe for stealing hearts I have no power in healing

And I suppose the Jesus pose is tired and superficial, lame
I wrote a song, I'm moving on, I'm praying you can do the same

I'm changing my direction making a correction
Oh my god, I've dodged the unexpected bullets behind accolades and
Shake your head of leisure get your head and body into seizure
And battle with whoever hides assault disguised as dancing

This rotting phase of hands that raise, bumping heads that pass each other
It's a boring phase, so part the wave and drop the dead as driftwood surfer

With those who can relate, two months, a day, a wake up

Drink it down, dear brother, their generation smothers you
And we'll leave no trail to discover
Build a callus sister, they're generation blisters

Another wake up with the morning hung over, 
We gonna pack up or waste another killer day
Then our heads exploded, overload when we decide

Your generation bothers me and I'll leave you to grieve
With my mother

Now empty your bottles and open the throttles, 
There's plenty of fighting ahead

The Verve Pipe,"Sometimes I wish we had a short term memory just enough to recognize each others face
It would be the same old stories but you're hanging onto every single word I have to say
And to the world I'm not that clever but you would stay with me forever
I'd keep your friends from reminding, reminding you to

Save yourself, leave me behind you would if you had half a mind
I'd tell you every day's your birthday and every gift I bring could be the same
Or how I stood beside you at a shotgun wedding and the child we once would love but never came
Hearing stories that were never you would stay with me forever

But I'd forget to make money and you'd forget to
Save yourself, leave me behind you would if you had half a mind (how vulnerable you are)
Write a note to remind you you would if you had half a mind (how effortless to stay together)

For these ties you may have severed now you'll stay with me forever
And so you write on your forehead, or better yet you engrave
So when you look in the mirror, well you won't forget to

Up in her bedroom and they gaze down on her
Guarding her slumber

A black bead rosary
Under her pillow and when it thunders

Sound is black,
The world is wrapped in a paper sack

And when I leave I close the door
To this galaxy of yours

Dropping by
I open a window
As the breeze blows in the curtains are butterflies

And we hear the church bells ring
Out on a hill
And all of their echoes
Left us singing

Silence is black,
The room is bright,
Our world is basking in tv light

And we are laid out on the floor
Of this galaxy of yours

With all of your heroes waiting
In paper piles laid on the floor

I push my paintbrush lightly
And fill in any empty nail holes

A dresser top,
A jewelry box,
Colored tassels tied in knots

And a porcelain girl danced a music box ballet for us
And your nightlight is a star,
Or a firefly

That leads my gaze up to the ceiling
Wondering if you think that it's the sky

I'm getting to like this feeling I've found
I'm getting to love
The thought of having you around
And I will never let you down

Your friends were all well-meaning
When they said ""No one is good enough for you""
They play with your emotions
Dismiss the notion
Do what you have to do

'Cause people don't take chances with their hearts
Since I've met you I am past the hardest part
So remember one thing
I will never let you down

The thought of having you around
And I will never let you down

Sometimes you feel defeated
But, it's OK
You're not the only one
And all the complications
The bad situations
Happen to everyone
It doesn't matter how it ended, or began
Sometimes, the best that you can do is change your plans
I hope you understand that
I will never let you down

 There among debris find casual in casualty
 It's not pretty underneath

 A bottle meant for two a glass that's full of legs but free of any fingerprints
 From you
 A neighbor one time pounding on the wall now lulled to sleep by lowered voices
 Is waking

Creep from the cradle, but a hero's what I want to be 
Keep it moving people cause there's nothing more for you to see 
I'm just a jerk, but a hero's what I want to be yeah, oh yeah 

Love me, love me sweet cowardice

Or a song explaining why, but it's not dignified

You crawled forth, now you're crawling back again.

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Haven't you heard the music in the night?

Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

The Village Singers,"Hear the blessed Savior calling the oppressed,
“Oh, ye heavy-laden, come to Me and rest;
Come, no longer tarry, I your load will bear,
Bring Me every burden, bring Me every care.” 
Refrain:
Come unto Me, I will give you rest;
Take My yoke upon you, hear Me and be blest;
I am meek and lowly, come and trust My might;
Come, My yoke is easy, and My burden's light.
Are you disappointed, wand'ring here and there,
Dragging chains of doubt and loaded down with care?
Do unholy feelings struggle in your breast?
Bring your case to Jesus—He will give you rest. 
Stumbling on the mountains dark with sin and shame,
Stumbling toward the pit of hell's consuming flame;
By the pow'rs of sin deluded and oppressed,
Hear the tender Shepherd, “Come to Me and rest.” 
Have you by temptation often conquered been,
Has a sense of weakness brought distress within?
Christ will sanctify you, if you'll claim His best;
In the Holy Spirit, He will give you rest. 
",Come Unto Me,1999

Hardly a comfort can afford

Where could I go oh where could I go
Seeking the refuge for my soul
Needing a friend to save me in the end
Won't you tell me
Where could I go but to the Lord


Life here is grand with friends I love so dear
Comfort I get from God's own word
Yet when I face that chilling hand of death
Won't you tell me
Where could I go but to the Lord

From some enchanted land.

I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,

Now you and your girl ain't speaking no more 
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about?  Jealousy, infidelity, envy

The things they say of you
You really do believe
This talk of God is true

Will soon be swept away

Listen Jesus
I don't like what I see
All I ask is that you listen to me
And remember
I've been your right hand man all along
You have set them all on fire
They think they've found the new Messiah
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong

I remember when this whole thing began
No talk of God then, we called you a man

Gets twisted 'round some other way

Should have stayed a great unknown

Would have suited Jesus best

Listen Jesus, do you care for your race?
Don't you see we must keep in our place?
We are occupied
Have you forgotten how put down we are?
I am frightened by the crowd
For we are getting much too loud
And they'll crush us if we go too far

Made guilty of the things we're not
We were lost in vicious circles,
Looking for a key,
Another door, another lock

There was only so much we could take 
So we left it all to happen,
Left it all to chance,
With a passion that they could not shake

In the ashtray, oh
Could she 
Be who she says, don?t lie

She cast the die on your plans
Chances on everything 
You take your life in your hands

Wow murder the way she likes
Murder feels like
Murder the way she likes
Murder feels like

I don?t care what she?s done, I love you, we gotta get you outta here! how do you know she?s not gonna do the same thing to you?
Fuck it

Wow murder the way she likes

Well somebody did you dirty 
Spilled your tears onto the street
Well your heels already hurt
As you disappear
Tips are coming from a snitch
Said he saw who did the deed
And they?re turning up the heat
Crime wave stretches the beat
My shirt it clings to me because of you
I loved you I love you
Won?t let them put this shit on you
Picked you right out of a lineup
I got money we could get away from here

Somebody did you dirty
Maybe it was me
Somebody did you dirty 
Maybe it was me 
Somebody did you dirty 
Maybe it was me
Somebody did you dirty
Maybe it was me

The Virtues,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unchecked

And every road that takes him, takes him down
And by himself, it's easy to pretend

There's a man with a gun over there

There's battle lines being drawn 
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong 
Young people speaking their minds 
Getting so much resistance from behind 

It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

What a field-day for the heat 
A thousand people in the street 
Singing songs and carrying signs 
Mostly say, hooray for our side 

It's s time we stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

Paranoia strikes deep 
Into your life it will creep 
It starts when you're always afraid 
You step out of line, the man come and take you away

Under all the buses I was already thrown

I called you out and an ancient fate
Walk over bones in a laundromat
Holding onto ghosts as a portion of war
I'm seeing, and I'm waking and I'm propping them up
Echoing the love for a machine of war
Dying in the tremors of the home anymore
I want to walk into a night where I was open to care
I would've walked forever just to wake up there
But I fell flat can't imagine it now
Pushed to the limit of a living was there
I can't push myself, through

Killing off his love for noise
Driving lost and going far

I was nothing more than loss
I was nothing more than loss
I was nothing more than loss

See the struggle when it's locked away
See me fail when you cut the string
All the pain that a loss can bring
See me burn in a suburban forge
See me quiet in a softer war
See me fading in the brittle noise
See me lost with all the hollow boys
See me hoping like this time it would
End with something like a final good
See me fail when you cut the string

Oh woe betide those that say



They think they're safe enough on their own
Drown in murky depths below



We all need a lighthouse for our own

It gets so dark I can't see which way I'm going
Oh lighthouse man I'm all at sea


Shine a little lighthouse light on me

The Waifs,"I'm going to dress up tonight
I'll look real pretty 
For I don't know who
I'll find my own way 
Around this great big city
And I'll sit at a bar 
And I'm gonna have a drink

I'll leave you to revel 
In your youthful yearnings
I know you like to visit them 
From time to time
Like a thief I steal 
The words you write to her
I take them to my heart 
And I wish them to be mine

But this is nothin'
But it ain't nothin'

But it ain't nothin'

You long for sweetness
Does mine make you sickly
Or maybe I no longer have 
The sweetness you require

About a heart so embittered

And tonight it's out for hire

This is nothin' new
But it ain't nothin' here

You mean stuff to me

I like the way you're wearing your smile 
And you close your eyes
And you leave us for a while

I got a good pair of boots
And my guitar plays sweet tunes

Sing me a song before I go
The tours on the road and I won't be home

Folks down there tell me,

It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
