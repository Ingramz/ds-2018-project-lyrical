Fast Animals and Slow Kids,"Amore mio 
Ascoltami 
So come uscire da qui 
Ti tiro fuori da qui 
Non vedi cosa ci aspetta? 
Abbiamo ancora una scelta
Ascoltami 
Lo so che c'è

C'è un'altra strada 
Fra le montagne 
Che attraversa fiumi di corpi come noi
C'è un'altra strada 
Di quelle lunghe 
Ma adesso baciami la fronte

Dove stiamo noi 
In questo giardino
Non batte il sole 
Non batte il sole 
Non cresce niente 
Fra queste lande

Dove siamo noi
Non batte il sole 
Neanche d'estate
Ascoltami perché son certo che

C'è un'altra strada 
Fra le montagne 
Che attraversa fiumi di corpi come noi
C'è un'altra strada 
Di quelle lunghe 
Ma adesso baciami la fronte",Fiumi di corpi,2017
Fast Animals and Slow Kids,"Adesso elaboro una scusa 
Che mi preservi dal piacere 
Di aver guardato quella volta e quella sola 
Negli occhi di chi avevo accanto 
Se il giorno è tenero 
La notte mi consuma 
Sfonda gli argini del vino in questa bocca

Perché ho ancora 
La tua lingua incastrata fra i miei denti 
Sì, ho ancora la tua lingua incastrata qui fra i denti miei

Con quanta rabbia ancora vivo 
Quanto deserto ancora vedo 
Se il vuoto è immenso allora che circondi il sole 
Per oscurare ogni mia navigazione

Perché ho ancora 
La tua lingua incastrata fra i miei denti 
Sì, ho ancora la tua lingua incastrata qui fra i denti miei

Rugiada leggera 
Distesa sulle scarpe 
Quest’alba s'innalza 
Ma è stanca, riposa 
Quest'alba s'innalza 
Ma è stanca, riposa

Forse non è la felicità ciò che voglio 
Ma il percorso per raggiungerla 
Un alpinista che non vorrà quella vetta 
Ma solo il rischio di cadere giù 
Forse non è la felicità 
Forse non è la felicità 
Forse non è la felicità 
Forse non è la felicità, ooh",Forse non è la felicità,2017
Fast Animals and Slow Kids,"Non vedi gli occhi neri? 
Non senti che non canta più? 
Ma il suo sorriso è forte 
I suoi vent'anni in fiamme

Non riesce a stare in piedi 
Non vuole stendersi mai più 
Anche se serve a poco 
Dovrebbe piangere

La battaglia è andata male 
In piazza grida ""manifestare"" 
La sua generazione 
Ha paura di sbagliare

Fa che si scotti ancora un po' 
Tutto sembrerà nuovo 
Dopo le lacrime

Saremo sempre fieri

Perché quei cambiamenti 
Ancora li rimpiango

Come per gioco svanirà 
Quel vuoto che scuote la sua età 
Quest'è appartenenza, lo sai 
L'abbiamo cercata anche noi

Fast Animals and Slow Kids,"Non saremo liberi 
La ribellione è morta 
Il peggio che ci aspetta 
È avere ancora scelta

Dietro al collo 
Non ho più una schiena 
L'ho spezzata in due 
Per farmi guardare

La mia stretta 
Non ha più certezza 
I miei limiti 
Mi danno da mangiare

Non saremo liberi 
La ribellione è morta 
Il peggio che ci aspetta 
È avere ancora scelta

Perché adesso 
Ho ben chiaro 
Per cosa combatto 
Perché ancora leggo 
Perché amo chi ascolta 

E proteggo chi affonda 
Per le bestie feroci 
Ed i cani randagi

Come noi quattro idioti

Fast Animals and Slow Kids,"Ricordi quella stanza? 
Era più piccola 
Perché eravamo insieme 
Insieme era il mondo

Nel mondo il vento e il pianto 
Nel mondo la tempesta 
Ma per noi c'era altro 
Per noi c'era un abbraccio

Ricordi quella stanza 
Enorme come un tuono 
Una nave che poi salpa 
Dal porto di una vita

Le braccia di un oceano 
I fiumi del Montana 
Come se quattro mura 
Fossero liquide

Tempo 
Inquina 
La stabilità 
È crusca per le bestie

Se il terremoto arriva 
Ricorderai la stanza? 
Sia vuota che vissuta 
La chiameresti casa?

Dipingeremo a nuovo 
Lucideremo il tutto 
Sarà come se il tempo 
Non sia mai stato qua
Non sia mai stato qua

L'abitudine fra noi 
È la piaga nel mio petto
L'abitudine fra noi 
È la piaga nel mio petto

Fast Animals and Slow Kids,"Mai avresti messo 
Il viso di fronte a uno specchio 
Eppure che grande beffa 
Riflessi gli anni più fieri 

Di una giovinezza 
Lasciata nel tronco 
Di una quercia stanca 
Del manto che non toglierà 
La tua tenera età

Di rosso e di giallo di foglie vestita 
Il tuo posto risiede nel dirupo più alto che c'è
Più buio che c'è 
Che la tua montagna mantiene sicura 
Ma perdi in bellezza e ne perdi in tenera età 
La tenera età

Questo paesaggio 
Mi incute timore 
Perché è così esteso 
Che non c'è una fine 
Non è più il cielo
Non è l'oceano
Questo è l'universo ed io
Io scavo qua 
La mia tenera età

Grazie natura per avermi reso essere incerto 
Che si può godere 
La tua creazione 
La tua grandezza 
Il rifiuto al dovere 
E una quercia che non ha più età 
La sua tenera età

Di rosso e di giallo di foglie vestita 
Il tuo posto risiede nel dirupo più alto che c'è
Più buio che c'è

Fast Cars,"This old heart of mine been broke a thousand times.
Each time you break away, I fear you've gone to stay.
Lonely nights that come, memories that flow, bringing you back again,
Hurting me more and more.

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside;
'Cause each day that passes by you got me
Never knowing if I'm coming or going, but I, I love you.
This old heart darling, is weak for you.
I love you, yes, I do.
These old arms of mine miss having you around;
Makes these tears inside start a-falling down.

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside;
'Cause each day that passes by you got me
Never knowing if I'm coming or going, but I, I love you.
This old heart darling, is weak for you.
I love you, yes, I do.  Yes, I do.

I try hard to hide my hurt inside.
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin'
I try hard to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always keeps me cryin' the way you treat me,
Leaves me incomplete, you're here for the day, gone for the week, now
But if you leave me a hundred times
A hundred times I'll take you back.
I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it.
Tell the world about it 'cause I love you.
Yes I do. Yes, I do.

Man it still feels the same but it ain't do the job
They came to take it off these girls in tank tops
Like my man Gareth P we came to crush rocks
Shoot hoops with jump shots and groove in high tops
We work like tape opps music something I've got
We put our foot to the pedal and the pedal to the metal
But the channel ain't changed it's Rap not Heavy Metal
Went and lost my licence once for speeding
Quickness is the thing the Fast Crew be needing
Too damn hot!! Since ya momma¡'s breast feeding
Got you in your nappies when your mouth be teething
Old school feel got your ears receiving
Beeping on your cell phones and fax machines and
Leaving it to me you best be believing
Throwing these punches get down it's duck season

I've been rolling since back in the days of skateboards
Still my money ain't changed still making these acorns
Still the clan blazon we started moving our feet
No more using bluetack to make ends meet
No more saying like who's that and when do we meet
It's about meeting the snare highhats and the beat
Shake hands with the bassline it's rhyme over matter
Still seeing these sails like gathered at a regatta
And I've got plenty of time but never late
I cleverly time every rhyme that I make
And never mistake me for a liar or a fake
And if you want to hate, well Yippeekaiyai mutha...
Skipping my way come now follow the leaders
The words in my rapbook digest the readers
So let's bang another rap bonanza
Blow it up yeah I'd just like to thank ya

We be rockin at the corner store
And down to the taxi stand
We be rockin with the crew
Say who could ask for more
'cause you know that we do it we can
We be rockin like everyday
And it stays the same
Like they do at the Holiday Inn
We be rockin till six am
And that's just when we begin
Come on

And I've got
And I've got
And I rock
And I've got

Oh you forgot we're the cream of the crop so let's do it
We be	-bang something solid so ya can't see through it
Mix ya head up with some alcoholic fluid
I concoct something on the rocks like a druid
We're not doing this but doing it for ears
Got plenty of beats rhymes and plenty of beers
All inhouse ain't got any of theirs
And it don't stop all for the love of Hip Hop
It's the Fast Crew coming whether you're ready or not
Girls grab a guy do ya dance show me what ya got
It's a match made in Heaven manage a trois
With a fat beat a dope rhyme and an acoustic guitar
And I got more dollars and cents than a thief
I rock so many mikes I got chipped front teeth
And I can tell by the gleam in ya eye why ya looking
That yeah you can smell what the Fast Crew is cooking

Auckland city, let's go
It's about time to set the record straight, you know

I was born to fly, I wasn't born to hide
You suckers can't touch me, I'm like a porcupine
I was sick of being a grimy f*ck
I was broke as a joke and my rhyming sucked
I had to cop a few bucks just to shine me up
Now critters look all star struck when they're eying me
Up
A few years ago, a friend of mine
Told me these little crystal rocks would blow your mind
And blow they did, right through his head
He spent the next couple years eating soup and bread
See, mumma didn't raise no stupid kid
If I wanna lose it, I use music instead
I ain't gotta prove sh*t, hip hop is in my veins
And I roll with a clique that's as swift as my name

Yo, your all superstars and your all on the map

It's diablo, nothing like the car, yo
But when I'm in limbo, I'm still raising the bar, yo
So get spastic, my life's fantastic
Rocking ice, not plastic, you know I'm getting
Sarcastic
Glass trick treasures call for drastic measures
I wanna live and let long with all the pleasure
I want a beautiful critter, she be the pick of the
Litter
Throwing her hands in the air when we're rapping the
Heavy hitter
Cause we ain't lack luster, it's a blockbuster
Packing more punch than tuaman can muster
The sky's the limit and I'm in it to win it
So when the dj spin it, just give me one more minute
Yes yo, believe me when I say,
I killed my nine to five, so I'm still not getting paid

It's nice to meet you, my name is ck
I like the Giants, punk rock, English, and beat breaks
Certainly no Burgundy, my friends call me Charlie
My dorm room smells of a pungent mahogany
A leatherbound moleskin, I wrote in some poetry
Scream into the speakers until my neighbors know me
I built the Eiffel Tower, invented the wheel
And when I got the mic I'm kind of a big deal

I was that nice dude who you knew in high school
You could talk to about haikus or Ice Cube
As time flew I'd choose to write words
My turn to learn til nights my eyes burned 
I found two friends who at the same time
Were riding the same vibe of trying to make rhymes
We gave it some time, added some substance
Just some kids who made something from nothing
It was online, the whole high school read it
Mentioned it like it was social extra credit
Kids I barely met like, 'nice rhyme last night?
My whole goal was just to satisfy that high
An addict to approval, respect injections
I kept at it so I could get that next fix
Cause I wasn't drinking stuff, I hadn't touched drugs
I just lusted for a deep seeded need to be loved

I self-love, self-loathe, self-hate and self-gloat
When the world's too loud I just throw on my headphones
Someday I might stitch them to the side of my face
Plug myself into the stereo and turn up the bass
Frankenstein figure, fuse limbs and split nerves
Inject ink into my veins so my fingers drip words
Emerge out the fog like after jubala shows
Open the exits, release the marijuana smoke
I'm on the road like Kerouac, anywhere been there and back 
Always awake to the same face staring back
The puddles get muddy and the mirrors get foggy
My mind's always moving but it can't leave my body
Undiagnosed neurotic, unfocused and toxic
If I'm not sick I don't know that the problem is

As she's caught up in the middle of everything

And wearing violet wings when she really needs them...
It's easier when the porcelain,
Lays on the wings of the decadent angels and saves your skin

Fat City,"I saw a Berkley woman
Sitting in her rocking chair
A dulcimer in her lap
A feather in her hair
Her breasts swayed freely
With the rhythm of the rocking chair
She was a-sitting and a-singing and a-swaying
Her cheeks were red I declare
 
Twas hard to believe
What my eyes showed me then
The colour in her cheeks
Was just her natural skin
She wore no makeup
To make her look that way
She was a natural mama with the red cheeks
What more can I say
 
Well I finally realised
There was hunger in my stare
In my mind I was swaying
With the woman in the rocking chair
But the lady I was living with
Was standing right by my side
She saw my stare and she saw my hunger
And Lord it made her cry
So with anger on her face
Yes and the hurt in her eyes
She scratched me and she clawed me
She screamed and she cried
Oh you don't give me near
All the loving that you should
Yet you're ready to go and lay with her
You're just no damn good¡±
 
Well I guess she's probably right
Oh I guess I'm probably wrong
I guess she's not too far away
She hasn't been gone very long
And I guess we could get together
And try it one more time
But I know that wanderlust would come again
She'd only wind up a-crying
 
Well now you've heard my story
Plain as the light of day
It's hard to feel guilty for loving the ladies
That's all I gotta say
Except a woman is the sweetest fruit
That God ever put on the vine
I'd no more love just one kinda woman
Than drink only one kinda wine",Berkeley Woman,2014

Fat Freddy's Drop,"I sit and watch you from my window,
Giving yourself away,
You've been working hard all day

I see the ground catch at your feet,
I see the sweet signs of defeat,
Like you're beaten but you feel no pain

And then you turn to me instinctively,
Checking if you're alone,
Like a reflex from my guilty mind

I fall away into the background,
Like a shadow on the wall,
To leave you with your peace of mind

I watch from my window up high,
All alone in this room,
So many people go the same way,
I think it's time that I changed my view

Like a king in his lonely kingdom,
A ruler who had no rules
Ooh, 
Oh I got nothing got left to lose,
I think it?s time that I changed my view

Why did you choose my way?
Why did you come down this lonely street?
Was it to meet me?
Was it to tango? 
Well the roots they sound so sweet

Sweeter than gold,
Sweeter than fame,
Sweeter than honey
Won't power the money

Walking along this lonely street,
Someone I'd like to meet,
Someone I'd like to know,
As a kindred soul

oh so spiritual the sound ran down like waterfalls
Running away never the same
Changing my view of you everyday

ohhh


[I watch from my window up high,
All alone in this room,
So many people go the same way,
I think it's time that I changed my views

A ruler who had no rules, Ooh

Your (Monologue's) getting tired, now it's time to ride
You're print distrified, you're no longer desired
So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire
I'm on fire, holly dipped in octane
Let east coast bang, let west coast bang
And Rule gonna bring the ghetto gospel
To every hood possible, pushin' through in the sky blue
Back with the gods you now, preferably the 4 pound
Slugs flyin' at the speed of sound
Tryin' to catch the ears of niggas that's runnin' their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the runnin's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airin' our prey out
Leavin 'em laid out, dead, in just a sport
Cause we ain't playin' up here in New York

Nigga I can see the coke in your nose
This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find god
But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a menage
And everybody talkin' crazy how they're AK spit
But we know this investigatin', and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth homie, got the industry shook like
""Naw nigga, Joe gonna let 'em loose on me""
True Story, I'm bringin' the T back
Even Roy Jones was forced to (Lean Back)
My nigga Dre said grind cook
Now we killin' them Howard niggas, who said I must of found Pun's rhyme book
Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling, like the ring around Saturn
Cook coke, crack, niggas fiend for that
And you already know the x is where the team be at

I swear it couldn't be sweeter, Life's a bitch
Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gonna die, you might get missed
For maybe 2 or 3 hours, 'til they light their spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken
And you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold a title, because I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids, hoppin' out with them old rifles
Just doin' shit for nothin', it's so spiteful
Ha I'm just like you
Word that niggas want to murk you is in the air
A double shot of yak and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment

I'm the type of brother to beat you down then fuck you up
Grabbin the mic to rock on tonight to see if the crowd will care
Step to the Gizzy you dare, you get lit up like a flare
From the, Bronx the Boogie Down battleground, Uptown
Turn smiles to frowns as I smack clowns around
Shorts I don't take em, bones I fracture and break
So make not one mistake, or you get eat like steaks at Frank's G
Jack in June, gettin swept, with a broom soon
To meet your doom, mornin night or the afternoon
Harassin the mic, with a verbal assault of rap
Stick lyrics back to back, that'll pack, to keep myself on wax
Hot like an iron, to defeat the kids you gotta keep tryin
If you spread any rumors sayin you took me out, you're lyin
A human beat is struck I know when it really sounds trunk
I'm never ever buck I don't give a fuck if you think that I'm a sucker
Parties that I've made, people wonder how long it lasted
Lyrics that are so hardcore, it'll leave you flabbergasted
Gasp for air, inhale it hold it in
And just wait for the rest of the posse to begin
I'm the human beat magician with the bag full of fun

Everybody knows the flav
Fat Joe Da Gangsta, yeah
You know my style

Fat Joe, a.k.a. Da Fat Gangsta
I'm no joke, and I'm far from a prankster
I got skills, aiyyo word life
Suckers is scared, because they know I live trife
As I troop down the streets of a ghetto
Skins are jockin, and always screamin hello
But I keep drivin in my jet black Beamer
I'm not a daydreamer, but I'm known as a scheamer
I'm dead-ass, when it comes to this
And if you fuck around, your moms'll reminisce
Thinkin of the good times she spent with her son
Somebody shoulda told you that I wasn't the one
Yes I'm known to get nuff respect
and if you face Fat Joe, well then you face your death
Now in ninety-three, it's time to take a stand
And you know how I'm livin, I'm a bad, bad, man

Niggaz know the flav
""I'm a bad, bad, man!"" 
""I'm a bad, bad, man!""

Check it
All the old folks, hate my guts
Cause I be hittin all they daughters and they big fat butts
Cause I'm the papichulo when it comes to rap
and if you fuck with me, then you leave handicapped
I don't give a fuck, don't care who you are
I gotta say peace to my peeps GangStarr
Some real motherfuckers from around the hood
When I chills with them, we be up to no good
Hittin skins, makin ends
Loungin with my friends in my fat BM
Whether Uptown in the Boogie Down
Or checkin out stunts in the Polo Ground
See just like Mel, I'm internationally known
And I'm mob related, like Al Capone, check it
Too hot to handle, blow you like a candle
You never catch Joe in the middle of a scandal
Now in ninety-three it's time to take the stand

Everybody knows the flav

One day I was chillin, caught a buckshot
The nigga was butt, so then he gets no props
Word spread fast around town
I was layin six feet deep underground, check it
Niggaz wished the worst, but spoke too fast
Cause here I am and I'm ready to blast [gunshot]
The cops must have missed, takin' me for a bitch
Because they tried to gas me, and make me turn snitch
But I'm not the one for peace
So I turned around and said, ""Fuck the police!""
I'm the type to handle this on my own
Pack two joints and pass one to Tone
There's no shame in my game, I do what I gotta do
See I'm rollin' with a crazy live crew
Now in ninety-three it's time to take a stand

Chill.. hah  yeah.. 
Come on.. 

I'm comin rougher than the roughest motherfucker could get 
Playin Russian Roulette  never lost a bet yet 
Bluffin  ain't my style  niggaz ain't sayin nothin 
'Cause I'm buckwild without frontin 

Raw to the core  I grew up poor 
Once I hit the door  I began to explore 
Curiosity killed my cat  but not me 
because I learned how to kill with agility 

I grew up in the South Bronx, punch you in your mouth punk 
I know these streets like Fred Sanford knows junk 
In the trunk of a car lays a body 
Head decapitated, bust him with my shotty 

Stabbed the mug, to make sure, he wasn't comin back 
Now police, can picture that, with a Kodak.. huh! 
They can't stop me with a homicide investigation 
'Cause if they do my crew is hittin up the station 

Your best bet, is to let me jet 
'Cause I bring war, like a vet, when I'm upset.. huh! 
I'm not the one you want to play out in a program 
Yo, you better tell them who the hell I am 

""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Yeah! (2X) 
""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Tell em who the hell I am 
""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" 

Now on the hip-hop tip, I'm no joke 
Get live at a jam, and leave a system broke when I spoke 
MC's froze, but I never said freeze 
Hopin I don't hit em like a fucked up disease 

Fall up in the club, Mr. Hype for a night 
Choke a rapper with a cord, hang him from the lights.. huh! 
Now you do want to mess around with the Fat Man 
'Cause you see my face in every newsstand 

Every other magazine from Billboard to Spin 
Pick it up and read Fat Joe strikes again 
How true, I'm not about weed and brew 
I'm just another papichulo like the rest of my crew 

So give me the microphone 
This jam is dedicated to my main man Tone 
'Cause he flips, and I flip, and we flip the script 
And you know, you don't want to get your ass WHIPPED 

Party over here, another in the hospital 
Lincoln, Memorial, notice that's how I sent you, hah 
I was the one who played the shoot 'em up games 
Here's another patient, and yo what's my name? 

""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Yeah! (2X) 
""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Tell em who the hell I am 
""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" 

So I cruise around in the be	-M 
or in the Benz, hurtin' enemies and makin' new friends 
They shake my hand, smile in my face 
The nine's in my waist, so there won't be a chase 

That's it, the situation is blown out of proportion 
When you leave, you must use caution 
Look over your shoulder, even on your block 
When I come to visit, you know you're in shock 

So don't say who is it, act like you know 
Kickin' down doors is the Gangsta Fat Joe 
And I got no time for games 
My name is goin' down in the gangsta hall of fame

""This is Joe Da Fat Gangsta"" Tell em who the hell I am

Peace to the money makers always plottin mono
Together we gettin dough, just like Lucky Luciano
People always tell me, yo you're dope Joe
But I'm not a car, so I don't get gassed like Amoco
Never ate the paint, no I'm not a sucker
Never liked ? so to Hell with the Rucker
Always on my own never sweatin nobody
Warm up a crowd like a bottle of Bacardi
I can kick it this way, I can kick it thattaway
I kick a funky style, from New York to Piscataway
Suckers best scram

I won't lose weight cause I'm not on the run
I'm on point like a sniper, hyper than the hyper
On the DL, overlooked by C-Cypher
Never get caught, I'm on top with my game
Flip a fat ride, there's no need for a train
Rappers come close, but they just can't make it
When it comes to the funk, you know I won't fake it
Peace to Serge, and my right hand Flex
And when I grab the mic nobody wants to rock next
The name is Fat Joe, cause Joe is livin Fat
Niggaz gettin jealous cause I got a contract
But I don't sweat it, I know the style is raw
You can't compare me to a cornball
And you know I kick game like a hottie

Nah, this couldn't be, Tone always wore a vest 
But that's the way the story goes 
Today you're here, and tomorrow who knows? 
Man I'm gonna miss him, I love him to death 
Charlie's in jail and I'm the only brother left 
It's time to get strong, forget about the sorrow 
But like Ike said, no one is promised tomorrow 
Fuck the bullshitting, it's time to get cash 
Don't fuck with me cause I got this in a smash 

Yeah, you know I got this in a smash (So what's up, what's up?) [x4]

Well it's the F-A-T, Gang S-T-E-R
Living like a star, drive a fat car 
525 and I'm crazy live 
Not all the loot in the world could make me take a dive 
Fucking mad bitches on the first date 
Straight to the telly, hit the skins, I gotta skate 
See, I got no time for a stunt 
Because a 40 and a blunt, that's all she really wants 
Yeah, so dough keeps collecting PC 
Knocking out punks with my man Diamond D 
'Cause everybody knows I'm the man 
And if you fuck with me, then shit'll hit the fan 
I took mad flicks since '76 
Robbing every other brother for their motherfucking kicks 
I once heard a kid say he's his brother's keeper 
His brother turned around and bust him with a street sweeper 
Everybody wants the cash 
But don't fuck with me cause I got this in a smash 

Yeah, you know I got this in a smash (So what's up, what's up?) [x4]",I Got This in a Smash,1993
Fat Joe,"Baby come and see me  I know you want to see me 

The brothers out there fronting that only want to be me 

They don't really have it  yo missy you can grab it 

So open nice and wide so I can start to stab it 

Before I do my duty  really knock the booty 

I want to let you know you're a real hot cutie 

Baby it's time  I gotta go for mine 

We can rub a dub or wine wine wine 

I can take you up or be very gentle 

Whatever you want, cause it's all in the mental 

See, I'm a pour silver, all over your body 

Get you real freaky, I know you love it, hottie 

Baby, I'm a lick you, tell me does it tickle 

I won't hit the skins if it smells like pickle 

Smooth like butter, though I won't stutter 

Sit on my lap if you really want to 

Get with the man who really knows how 

To knock the boots, God bless the child 

So don't try to front and give me your back 

Cause you and I know I'm a hit that 



""Skins, you got 'em"" ""Hit it!"" (Repeat 4x) 



Man I really love it, yo I really need it 

I have a fat jimmy and I have to feed it 

Sometimes I'm filled with humor, I know a girl named Zuma 

We hit the sack once, then she started rumors 

Telling all the chicks that I was really good 

I'm big like a train, but I'm the man that could 

Give you what you need, give you what you want 

I guess I'm like Kenieval, cause yo I love stunts 

We could get together, whatever is clever 

I used to watch Dynasty just to see Heather 

That was then, and now is now 

And if Heather ever sees me, she'll scream ""Wow"" 

The big man of rap, and even more nosey 

I'm gonna flip, but yo I got hoes 

Don't try to front and give me your back 

Because you and I know I'm a hit that 



""Skins, you got 'em"" ""Hit it!"" (Repeat 8x",I'm a Hit That,1993
Fat Joe,"Yeah! 
Check it out  check a check a  check it out 
Would you believe that Fat Joe would flip a style like this? 
I can't get played  cause I roll with Baby Chris  nevertheless 
niggaz be tryin to front the role 
When everybody knows  I'm gonna go gold

After every single show, you know (know) 
One of the best to grab the mic so don't try to front 
Ain't nuttin here yours, so what the fuck you want? 
When I step on stage, I'm second to none 
Makin MC's run, without the use of a gun, yeah 
Talkin about the way I rock a party 
Niggaz must be thinkin that I'm high, or drunk on Bacardi 
I be hippin and hoppin, rockin and shockin, the whole rap scene 
I'm mean, my favorite color is green 
I guess that's why they call it the blues 
Your money you lose, cause you choose to disrespect and neglect 
the skills of the Fat one, but I'm all that son 
Gimme the microphone and I'ma show you how it's gonna be done

Look at the way I freak this style, I'm versatile 
Niggaz don't want the funk, because they know I'm buckwild 
Could you believe the rappers that they talk shit 
While I be rippin the microphone and all my records are hits 
The name is Fat Joe, I'm on the down low 
I chill with Lord Finesse, you know I got the flow 
I be freakin the funk, not fakin the funk, you're facin a punk, yeah 
Fuck around and you'll be layin in ?v-ducts? 
I got props, believe it or not 
I never got caught, because I pay off the cops, yeah 
One of the livest niggaz in New York 
Sometimes I be chillin with Son 
Sometimes I be chillin with Hawk, you know that

Yeah
This is goin out..
To all the live motherfuckers, knowhatI'msayin?
All the real niggaz
Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens
California
LaBella Puerto Rico, wherever the fuck you from
Know what I'm sayin? Yeah

This story takes place, back in the South Bronx
Where at the age of 14 I was already knockin' off punks (yeah!)
And suckers were scared to death, every time I walked by 
I hear them niggaz take their last breath (ah..) 
See I just didn't give a fuck, and if you had a see-skin 
A leather bomber, you was gettin' stuck (word!) 
That was the way it was
One day I went to visit my aunt, and stuck up my 'cause
See shit was fucked up back then
No matter what the fuck I did I never had no ends
And my moms was on welfare
Ayyo I knew I had a father, but the nigga was never there
So what the fuck was I to do
I'm sick and tired of bein' the bummiest nigga out the crew 
I gotta get mine, I gotta get cash
I see an old man, I'm gonna rob him with the quick-fast
Give me your motherfuckin' loot, papi
I'm gonna get paid, and can't a damn thing stop me
See, I'm tired of this poor shit					 
And who the cops? Well they can suck my motherfuckin' dick
Cause all them niggaz ever do is harass
That's why I get glad when I hear somebody smoked that ass (*gunshot*)
Just to let ya know how I feel
Word em up, the fuckin' shit is real
Hey yo, it's real

[Chorus] (*cuts ""Down on the reel to reel""*)
Aiyyo the shit is real
Aiyyo it's real
Word up, the shit is real

[Fat Joe]
Now I'm sixteen and there's a brand new scene
I'm makin' mad loot, gettin' paid off the dope fiends (word)
Keep the shit in check, in order
And my main man Tone was fuckin' everybody else's daughter
See everybody knew in town
That Joe and Tone had shit locked down
And a nigga wouldn't test me
It seems like every other day the fuckin' cops arrest me (yea!)		 
But the shit will never stick
I make one phone call and be out like quick			 
Cause Uncle Dan had my back
And now niggaz gettin' jealous cause they know I'm livin' fat
Talkin' shit around the way and on the block
But never in my face, cause they knew I packed a glock
And my crew is mad deep
A bunch of crazy Puerto Ricans, so aiyyo don't sleep (word!)
And all you bitch ass niggaz know the deal
Check it out, the fuckin' shit is real
Hey yo, it's real

[Chorus]

[Fat Joe]
Check it out
Let me let ya know why I made this song (why?)
Brothers can't deal with the real, word is bond
I'm sick and tired of these fake ass niggaz
Sayin' that they catchin' bodies when they never pulled a trigga
I know your style, I've seen it before
You wear an army suit, now you think you're hardcore
Drinkin' on your 40's, smokin' on your blunts
Can't afford a chain so you wear gold fronts, yeah
You're fakin' the funk, kid
And you'll be gettin' it up the ass if you ever did a fuckin' bid
It's time to separate the real from the phony
The name is Fat Joe, punk, act like you know me
I come equipped with the ruff shit
Nowadays I can't believe the bull rappers come up with
And all ya bitch-ass niggaz know the deal
Check it out, the fuckin' shit is real
Hey yo, it's real

Word up!
I want to say peace to my peeps, The Beatnuts
Messengers of Funk, Strickly Roots
My man Funk Flex, Zulu Nation
Jazzy J in the house
Diamond D, the whole Diggin' in the Crates crew
And rest in peace to my man Tony Montana

Well it's Friday night  I'm in a club with a crew just maxing 
Cuties and booties and yo I'm ready for action 
Cause Fat Joe doesn't go to clubs for his health 
It's too many skins  so every man for himself 
I got me a Sex on the Beach from the bar 
I know this girl was looking at me from afar 
Plus she with a crew  they all got it going on 
She came over and asked me if my name was John 
I said  ""Yeah, John Doe, so what's it to you?"" 
She said ""Sorry yo, I just thought I knew you"" 
She walked away dissed because I had dropped the bomb 
I felt bad so I reached out and snatched her arm 
I pulled her back, gave her my apologies 
She accepts it, but now she starts to follow me 
Watching where I'm going, seeing who I know 
Once she saw the Gucci, she said ""Oh, that's Fat Joe"" 
I could hear the conversation, Shorty was digging me 
No way she was igging me, ayo she was big on me 
Throughout the night she remained in my eyesight 
My man Black Caese was telling me ""Yo she's fly, right?"" 
No that the jam is over there's no need to front 
Cause she's leaving out the club and I'm right behind her 
Now we in the deli butt naked catching wreck at last 
Cause shorty gotta fat ass 

Shorty gotta fat ass (Repeat 3x) 
She got a big fat... 

Driving in my Five on the live side of town 
One of those days I just want to ride around 
With three deep, me Diamond D, and Peep 
(Who's Peep?) That's my man that be whipping the white jeeps 
So bust it, I hit Fordham road in the town 
Cause I'm riffing in the front fool, Luther Vandross 
Never too much, and what did I see? 
Honeygrip had a little too much for me 
Diamond said ""Damn!"" Peep said ""I know her!"" 
Yeah right, whatever, I'm still pulling over 
Hey mamita, Spanish I'm assuming 
A Spanish caught wreck and that ass was booming 
I couldn't see her face cause she wouldn't turn around 
Peep is out the window staring Five-O down (Bo bo bo!) 
Chill with that, cause I want to stop and chat 
Like a diplomat, yo you're fucking up my rep 
She wouldn't turn around so I reached for her pelvis 
She turned around, ugly hound dog, and I felt this (God damn!) 
Money grip was ugly, I had to find out at last 
But shorty had a fat ass 

Shorty gotta fat ass (Repeat 3x) 
She got a big fat... 

No need to be ill come all out my face 
But the name is Fat Joe and in love I got good taste 
Big butts come a dime a dozen in New York 
I couldn't help but notice when I watch you walk 
You got the booming system and I don't mean sound 
I want to smack it up, flip it, and rub it down 
I know girls try to say I'm living foul 
But you know you can't trust a big but and a smile 
I'm not concerned with the niggas in your past 
But straight up and down, shorty gotta fat ass 

Shorty gotta fat ass (Repeat 3x) 
She got a biiiiiig... 

Shorty gotta fat ass (Repeat 3x) 
She got a biiiig, ha ha

You might think you a ROTC but I don't give a fuck though 

I'm rolling hard like God for the squad black 

Packin them poppers bitch, where that money be at? 

Aiyyo I be the show stopper, as I shine like gold 

Other rappers dull like copper, the certified fake nigga dropper 

Which borough, is the thorough 

I know, do you know, let me know I'm sayin though 

The coke connector, sweating leather with reflectors 

Don't get caught up in my sector, or I'ma haveta inject ya 

with a slab of this lyrical dope shit 

Fake MC's and wannabe's best to quote this 

Fat Joe the true and living will prevail 

Kingpin like Sonny up in Bronx Tale 

Will I fail? I doubt it 

I'm the nigga catchin bodies, while other niggaz fantasize about it 

True indeed, behind my back MC's claim they can serve me 

In my face they screaming ""We're not worthy!"" 

Youse a has been, actually you ain't been 

I be touring, while you be home taping 

So what punk, you could battle in a second 

Frankly the bottom line, is where's your hit record 

You claim I'm jocking, claim I'm on your dick, where's your witnesses? 

If I'm on your dick my name has got to be syphillis 

Chorus: 

""If you're feeling lucky duck, then press your luck"" - Jeru 

""Up up up and away 'cause I don't play clown"" - cool G Rap 

""If you're feeling lucky duck, then press your luck"" - Jeru 

""Buck buck buck take that witcha on the way down"" - cool G Rap 

Verse Two: Fat Joe 

As we proceed to lock it down, don't get it fucked up 

We be the kings of the Boogie Down 

All we do is spark izm and get cash 

Tortuing MC's like that warden up in Alcatraz (bo! bo! bo! bo!) 

It's Fat Joe, yo you know my steelo 

Get so much love, I'm payin sixteen on a kilo 

Sendin niggaz outta town, still got control of the Boogie Down 

Now how the fuck you sound? (Yeahhh) 

Ain't no army that could harm me or bomb me 

c'mon G you clowns ain't got a fucking thing on me 

I'm flashy like white linen (tell em) 

Your rap is under pressure like two outs tied score in the ninth 

inning 

I'm down with Kris and ain't no stopping me 

I'm out for Bronx and Monopoly with chicks on top of me 

It's My Philosophy, but for now it's in the corridor 

Slappin caps like a ball hittin hard to my laborator 

These motherfuckers don't want it 

(Word to mother Joe, these niggaz don't want it!) 

Chorus 

Verse Three: KRS-One 

Merrrcy, you want to serve me but you ain't worthy 

My style is too curvy, what you tellin me 

But your flimsy ass will go home after the battle and find I'm your 

boss 

With KRS-One up in your memory 

I know your kind, you rap write 

You're Mr. John Gotti the Don, but you're just another bwotty mon 

Telecro bwotty mon, how you collect 

Rap magazine dating back to, Tougher than Leather 

The only reason you got, such an extensive rap collection 

'cause most of your rap mags are all stuck together 

Watch what you sayin, watch what you say 

When your skull gets cracked, whatcha gonna say crackhead? 

Your file is dead, kneel to the rap God in bed 

Fore I slap you way Back in the Dayz like Ahmad 

Don't get me fed up, or vexed up, 'cause you'll get set up 

My crew don't let up, I be dead up in this piece (tell em)

I been plannin my strategy for the next kill 

Ninety-five for the real live 

Only the strong survive, that's why I pack a four-five

Knahmean? There's no room for snitches and loud bitches 

But it's always room for riches and deep ditches 

That's how it be in this everlasting game

The streets are full of vengeance, and it's expensive 

If you don't organize your words right in your sentence 

Twelve gauge holes take souls and lives are lost

Things are done different, in my zip code 

Hollow tips implode, dumb-dums explode 

Now your crew is screamin like they see demons when I reload 

You can't comprehend, act like you want it for clarity 

I'm pushin wigs, handin out jigs like charity 

You best to get your groove on, or get moved on 

Or play the hot steppa, and die with your shoes on 

I collects ass and cash 

While my crew consumes liquor and hash, and keep the stash 

Whether, hustlin or dustin we get busy with ours 

T.S., T.A.T., respect for miles 

The Bronx is the turf, South is the area 

Bring ten, bring twenty, the more guns the merrier

I drop ya down in boilin' acid 
Ya melt like plastic, elastic, is drastic 
Violations, room vibrations, son 
Cock the hammer let the uncle give 'em one 
Done take a flick of a wicked lunatic 
Puttin' hits on your clique, got'cha wife in turnin' tricks 
What you don't want to, I thought that you was bawlin' 
Now watch 'cause I cock ya love, ya girlies fallin' 
Uh, what's my function? Lyrical injection 
Blazin' niggas, hittin' 'em raw with no protection 
I take advantage 
Ya fear me, I'm doin' damage

Trapped in a cagin, toe kissin' a cajun 
Ya mob's locked down underneath the surface 
Ya gettin' nervous for talkin' shit with no purpose 
Laced up, mind charmer, mad drama 
What goes around comes around, not around farmers 
Silence, sh, very deadly 
Come and battle, let me add you to my medley 
Possessin' power, takin' everything I can grasp 
Go get it now, why you always dwellin' on the past? 
Baby boys reminiscin' old school shit 
Young fools get dicked, LL rules the shit 
With a platinum fist, the relentless abyss 
I take you to a land where piranhas like to kiss 
Massacre, muah, blowin' up the tour bus passengers 
Chuckin' the color outta cartoon character 
Ya get serious 
Real niggas recognize what my theory is 
I shot ya!

Ya clique thought I fell off, they didn't want to hear me 
Oh really, now tell me how long have you been whinin'
Sixteen years, twenty million albums, yeah you're climbin'
I love your joint 'rock the bells', it was mad hot 
Ya record 'bout the radio was blowin' up my spot 
My girl was on your chip when you flipped 'I need love' 
Your backseat count set was mad butter, son 
I loved your boomin' system it was wicked as could be 
You bad, now I'm writin' on your pink cookies 
And you had me screamin' 'mama said knock ya out' 
Ya jinglin', baby, no doubt 
Uh, talk to me (what, what, uh, uh) become a zombie, walk to me 
Ain't a MC alive who fought with me 
Y'nah mean? Man, rock it 
Easy does it

Faster than Roger Clemens,
Ya know the kid with the O's
That's as large as linens
When it comes to sellin' trees
I'm as large as Timberland
My lawyer got my charges slimmin'
He said the only way I am goin upstate
If it's in larger swimmin'
Pull out the garage like gremlins
Anarge with trimmins
System in it that have the projects tremblin'
Ya know nothin' about lettin' a few strays go off
Ya only reach for your hip when your two ways go off
Shots'll fly by your head
Your toup blow off
I ain't crip I'm just a blue gray show off
Ghetto fab I more than rap for my bucks
Keep two 9's on me like Warren Sapp from the Buccs
The word I'm ballin' be flowin' to the fed Jakes
And I keep chicks on my lap throwin' me head fakes
Nigga I walk around with the grams you stackin'

13 years old  already trying to cop a gun 

I never understood why my pops would beat me 

No matter what I did, yo he'd still mistreat me 

That's why I never listened to a thing he said 

And I wasn't just mad when I used to wish him dead

I catch a fag three o'clock in the morn
On the block all alone and put the glock to his dome
Tell him ""Give it up quick, you nitwit, don't try to get slick
Or I'm a let this four-fifth spit and leave your shit split""
Grip, it ain't nothing decent about me
A true thug for real, you can ask the precinct about me
A rap junkie, don't try to play me like some flunky
Jewels be chunky, pockets lumpy, attitude grumpy
Mad niggas be fronting the life
Popping mad shit, trying to be something they not
Your faggot ass better stay to dancing, don't even look at me

Expose the facts, you know the haps
We go to laugh astrological, like the signs in the Zodiac
To rap you, out the stack glue, word up

Can't see me, I'm camouflage, and besides, I'm God

Caught up in the mental, watch her bless A.G.

Thought you was the boss when your fat thoughts were empty
Not Fat Joey Crack, but still Jealous One's Envy

Take a puff of the blunt and play a nigga like a chump

Sucking the next nigga's dick, moving pricks
I'm too slick for you high school dropouts
You got knocked and tried to cop out
Couldn't fight when the kids pulled the mop out
And wails you out, right at home saying ""Bail me out""

You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.

Like my man Tony Montana
Stand and pose in front of cameras
With my golden silk pajamas on
Smoking havanas, drinking Don P
Thinking beyond deeper than Ghandi, while I'm in the Diamante
Counting my G's, I'm out to be a millionaire
Dipped in gear, flickin' hundred dollar bills in the air
Oh yeah, Cuban Link is into getting benjamins
'Cause if doesn't make dollars, then it doesn't make sense
I represent, I'm in to be the king of New York
Went from living in tenements to up in house resorts
I'm the latino, that'll take you to war like Al Pacino
Even De Niro know not to gamble in my casino
Vino wanna rock, slaps, to dinners with mobsters
I got shit locked from Prospect Ave. to the tropics
Sitting on top of the world like the sun
A living legend from the Bronx, second to none, unless it's Pun

It's the glamour life, blow up the kids and the wife
Players who ain't half as nice swear to, but they sacrifice
Bottle the rock, freeze the ice, stash the dope and rice
And get ready for the glamour life

Ripped off from the Infiniti
Dump the body an' the shottie down the lake, leaving no identity
Just the memory, a casualty as I casually make move on my rivalries
All eyes I be, on the quest for loot
Pushing a Lexus coupe, to pursuit them troops, against the big-joker
Sipping alimoca, playing poker with some chocha
Heard an approacher, must be fam', but damn I had to smoke Pun
(Get the motherfucking gun)
Since ? become the one wanted for a lump sum of G's
Dirty rats pack gats for cheese
Bullets of breeze at light speed
Taking your pretty wife life and sacrificing your seeds
Indeed, we let him bleed for 50 G's
Ship his body to the states, filled with 50 keys
Please, no remorse for your two face
Inside a symbol, my life throughout the motherfucking suitcase
You about to take who's place? Not Seis
Your body'll be laced, and left without a trace

Yo, It's the motherfucking Don Cartagena
The leader, Terror Squad cleaner
Leave your family crying for you like Argentina, mira
Sweet dreamer like Nas, my entourage is thick
Camouflaging this bitch, so God forbid you start some shit
My squad's equipped with an arsenal of ammunition
Hollow tips an', cop killers with the ?
Accounts in Switzerland for rainy days
Nigga I'm staying paid, you's a joke
Always broke with your lazy ways
Anyway, back to the subject, in the bub-Lex
In the back seat, having rough sex
I love this glamorous life I live, having the ice and shit
Think twice, I give Christ your kids
I live life for gifts, keep the five burning while the tires turning
I blaze an L and seek a higher learning
Kaiser's learnin' everything illegally
We could de friend for years, cross me once that's theivity

Yo, the dough, the rap, the audience, party heavy till the 40's in
Ill like the Yakuza run the Orient
Take all the rent, and no man wept the path his daughter went
Dicks with the fallopian, wide as auditorium
She fuck for dough for opium, prostitute emporium
500 Benz, 500 friends sell Cambodian
8's cup of vodka, four cup of juice for sodium
Money, money, sweet as the smell of magnolia
It's get you down, but you spitting image of Appalonia
Now how can I go broke, pumping twenties of coke
Plus songs I wrote, milkin' dumb honeys I poke
The young blood sat on the bench in Vant Courtland, slingin'
Singing how he trying to get cash for Jordans
Another cat toss his Beamer to get the insurance
Currency's gonna murder me, it's never enough
Breakin' my ass gettin' it, just as fast as I spend the stuff
Calling Uncle Sam's bluff dun, taxes don't bite us, bite us

Least my wife and kid got somewhere nice to live
I used to live in the gutter, me and my mother
Now she's fifty years old, pushing a hummer

Pass the mic down the line, let them hear it 
Let them fear it, send it screaming to the Holy Spirit

I put aside the guns & robberies  see good guys copyin' me 

The good times is here, rainy days is clear 

You want to go where everybody knows your name like ""Cheers"" 

Where problems is all the same and we got stories to share 

Where you don't have to look for joy in a bottle of beer 

See what I'm sayin? Stop feelin' sorry for yourself 

Besides, those shots of Jack Heed's bad for your health 

Understand tough people last, tough times don't 

Some get up off they ass, and nigga, some just won't

What was once a dream is now reality

Fat Joe,"Yeah  time to educate the youth (Speak on it God) 
'Cause if we won't  then who will? (True) 
Terror Squad style  yo 
(Speak on it God) 

Yo  I was a wild adolescent  blessed with the foul essence 
Messin around with the wrong crowd  I learned my lesson 
Stressin all the things that I have not 
I pray to God I get my Uncle out the crack spot 

I hear mad shots  homicide come and play Matlock 
But never crack the case cause the defendant's a bad cop 
You feel me fam? The devil's got a plan 
That's why Farrakhan formed a Million Man up in Washington 

The Hidden Hand even planned this man 
Have me goin hand to hand, killin my own clan 
But now I understand and see the big picture 
Fuck cryin about the struggle, I teach you how to get richer 

Shit is a hassle in this rotten apple, kids robbin coppin capsules 
Rockin tattoos, boppin with ankles locked in shackles 
Got the cops joggin at you, spittin rounds of clips, they down wit it 
New clowns'll make you feel as if the Bill of Rights is counterfeit 

Now it's been written that all men are equal, but then it's legal 
When they beat us and treat us as if we're different people 
We go for delf, fuck the cop's health 
I'd rather drop shelf and let off shots until my Glock melts 

'Cause God dealt us a helpless hand, they made us sell this land 
So the palest man could build a selfish plan 
You know we can't trust the government, cause Uncle Sam is smugglin 
Drugs for us to hustle all the stuff for him 

Even McGruff is in it, gettin a percentage 
Takin advantage, punishin just blacks and hispanics 

My heart is cold as ice, so I know I'm sheist, Big Pun was the kid 
That no one liked, my whole life, is one big roll of the dice 
Payin a price twice as expensive as white kids 
Destined for Riker's not knowin my existence was priceless 

IT'S LIKE THIS, my soul was lifeless, I earned stripes 
Fightin the nicest in the crisis I slice em in half and make em dash 
Like hyphens, invitin any rapper to Clash With the Titan 
The writing's like fighting cause rappers be biting like Tyson 

I'm hypein the crowd, keepin em Loud like my label 
I'm proud I'm able to lift from the bowels of the ghetto 
I found me a little sanity inside a career and a family 
No more wars and renderin tears to insanity 

So keep the salary and tear the mic, cause I love it 
There's my life, you judge it, fuck it Seis, I don't want it 

I'm a Dominican, stranded in New York like Filligan 
Don't want to get locked up in the pen again 
But here they come, the faggots and cuffs, searchin for guns 
Turnin they ride on the side of the curb to see who runs 

They authorize the beast to walk the streets holdin heat 
Four deep, we puff production, my cheek, you know my steez 
Fuck the police, usin ""probable cause"" to break laws 
Behind the badge you try to cover up your racial war 

I got somethin for you boys in blue 
The system poisoned you, blew your cover, now what you supposed to do? 
I never let the faggot pull the trig first 
It won't be no American flag over my hearse 

What's worse, you know they disperse for bucks 
So take caution in the streets cause our protection sucks 

This dude, he had the darkest pads 
Who dressed up in the heart of brash 
Forever talkin trash 
How he stacked niggaz to almanac 

Gunshots to corner four police informants 
Stood like he modeled the latest fashions, sidewalk sideshow 
Performance 
He raised the pull of grace, a razor blew his face 

Force calm the ?sere? plus a pack of the ?dunga dun? laced with 
Toothpaste 
Life ain't to be gambled son, you could get trampled 
By people that act more like animals than mammals high off enamel 

That's what his poppa said whose locked for droppin Akmed 
In the candy store robbery probably to get his veins fed 
He ain't listen, he became a braindead cocaine head 
Older Mexicans knew, they killed him eatin ?bagualitos? 

But hey little kids, don't follow these dopes 

What? Uh-huh, yea I can dig that 
They call me Prospect, I just came back from ? 
Had this track on pause, now I'm back on course 
It's lost on the Ave, tryin to take my life from the past 

Get this legal cash, ? without dad 
Kinda sad how he got dragged down to negativity 
Only if he had one love, trust for liberty 
This world would be a better place, get what it takes 

In a race to racism replace the snake in em 
Bad ones, want to spend lives and discriminate 
I'm tryin to keep this positive vibe, and from that 
I generate to the top, like Puffy won't stop 

I'm mature now, with one knot, from tryin to get locked 
And to the shorties on the block, tryin to twist 40 tops 
Get your act together, do some carpentry with a Black n Decker 
And stop speedin like a Kawasaki 

From my life, to your life, I'm touchin everybody Twinz watch me
Everything we speak is the truth 
From Prospect to Munroe, here in a hot second 
The whole world run know, everything we speak is the truth

Fat Joe,"My stripes show like regiments, military intelligence
Murder game, I leave no evidence credentials
Go ask my pre-school, even talk to my old principal
He'd tell you how you I used to pack a number two pencil
Stabbin students, grabbin' teachers, Catholics, preachers
In the school staircase, cuttin' class, passin' my reefer
In my own class, operation return, they tried to say
I was incompetent, not able to learn
The table turned now, got my own label to earn
Like that nigga said in ""Dead Presidents"", money to burn
Queensbridge, pay homage, respect Nas is the vet
Acknowledge the rep, polish baguettes, niggaz is dissin' that
I'm just the best, puttin' all violence to rest
Between Latin Kings the blood ""los sangres"", blood in Spanish
So many thugs vanish, unite the system
To fight with inner street wisdom, to help teach a prison

My crew puff lye, anyone test the Pun must die
Just give me one try ""Now you know you done fucked up right?""
Hah, you ain't got no wins in my casa
Que te pasa, you ain't even in my clasa
I hate a actor that plays a rapper
I'm Terror Squad beta kappa everybody's favorite rapper
Grand imperial college material insane criminal
The same nigga who known to blow out your brain mineral
I reign subliminal inside your visual
Try to supply your physical with my spiritual side of this lyrical
I'll appear in your dreams, like Freddie do, no kidding you
Even if I stuttered I would still sh-sh-sh-shit on you
Soon as I chitter chatter you shitter shatter, I'm the kid
Out of Bronx, that'll stomp you to death like it didn't matter
I'm even better than before, iller metaphors
Killers bet it all on Pun, cause one verse, dead em all

J-Ja-J-Ja, John Blaze
""Johnny Blaze ain't a damn thing changed!""

Aye yo my attitude is subject to change, I mess around
And spit twelve at the driver's side door of your Range
Six hit you, the other six, up in your dame
Mafia style, leave you with your watch and your chains
Take heed that, not only can I flow I can aim
Cause y'all misdemeanor niggas can't stand the reign
Better believe that, whenever I see y'all I'ma test ya
Only cause I know that fagots respect pressure
Hardcore, like shit you get, kicked out the yard for
'Kiss ain't the cops, but I lock niggas up
You could meet me in my cell I soak and sock niggas up
Far as the flow go, you could let your dough show
Put your money on the table, we could battle on cable
Y'all hot dog niggas get Nathans
Fuck around with Jason, that shorty from The Lox, John Blazin'

My son cool out (what) don't beef yo, throw the tool out
Let's run these niggas, kidnap they work, make em move out
Crushed hash, hands is like glass, keep the heat
In the dash, did some dirt for some work, caught a gash
The flicker blocker, wicked sneaker rocker footwear
Strike me out God, stackin' up joints, rack em like Footlocker
This is raw, raw like fuck kid, represent
Here to Crenshaw, hold my words stronger than a Benz stall
Relentless, the anthology consolidated
With the quickness, dress up in the wig and blouse, killer sickness
Lex, imagination large, gold cards
Beat the bogus squad brains that connect put on the Older God
Specialist, iciclist, Woolridge collar
Feelin' the rich, work for every dollar don't snitch, that's why
Broke niggas who got heart God, sign em up
Start the wind up, we John Blazin', Don up in the line up

[Chorus]

It's simple mathematics, you gotta love us
Cause Joey Crack plus gat equals a lotta dead motherfuckers
Just when you thought I was done, I recruited Pun
Terror Squad Enterprise, undisputed Dunn
I'm from the slums where it's worse, bust with guns til it hurts
For fuckin' with my funds on the first
And go to church like a mobster
Discuss your death over shrimp and lobster, with my Cuban partners
Lucas with the cartridge, twenty shot
Run up on any block, disrespect any cop
Used to run many spots, now I own shops
Gortex with the lot, five sixty-four bills a pop
I'm hot, who wanna get burned?
I fire one in your knot and watch your whole fuckin' head turn
You best learn to parlay, I've had a hard day
Fuck around with the Don and get John Blazed

Seventies s***, got the lean
S*** is leanin', it's to the left
It's just leanin', dribblin'
Like he gave it a bag of dugy
Or a bag of that Tango and Cash
It's just leanin' and s***, seventies (The Lord Tariq)

Ah-yo I been through many places
Done many things
Seen the eyes of many faces
From New York to Texas

To the faces on Rolexes
Not a racist or sexist
And the best is the Lord, none the less is Gunz
Nothin' less than a Lexus

Bubble eye with V-V-S's
Trouble minds and troubled times
Stacks, I'm tryin' to double mine
I'm in a six wit double dimes and a couple of nines

Me and tracks back to back, circle the block a couple of times
And we searchin' for this n**** to try
I'm bubblin' mine
If we don't get him now then we will in due time

I bust enough shots to kill him two times, I do crimes
I get caught then my mind's defendin my son's rhymes
'Cause my thoughts stay runnin like thugs from one-time
I been through it under the influence

Bustin' off I'm runnin' into it
See me say he didn't do it
Put the nine to his mind and blew it
'Cause some times I lose it give me a gun and I'll abuse it

Puffin with my family, my b****, my money or my music
Makin' killas say he's too sick when he do s***
But I'm on some new s***, and it's too late the fuse lit
I treat my nine like a new b****
And the s*** do kick, word

My last trial's one of the reasons why I rap now
But still could blaow any n**** actin' irate now

F***in with me's worse than duckin' police
After puffin some trees I'll probably be abductin' your niece
Murderin' beats since the days of permanent crease
Been around the block seen grams converted to keys

Aah Cartagena, breaks hearts in Argentine
My misses slugs to love me, my wife act like Anita
Terror Squad'll die for the cause even if it means blowin' up things
And takin' over City Hall

My s*** is raw straight from the Panama shores
If the feds can't catch me then they make up a law
Can't take it no more, n****s is fake to the core
My state pen friends'll leave you broken negative nore

Bet it all on the Terror Squad click from Forrest

Regardless, n****s shouldn't have tried that s***
That's why mothaf***as gotta die like this

So fierce b****es they be callin' me exorcist

Far from a devil, I'm God I mean I'm Gunz
And I shine like sun, rhyme like none, find my gun
Got beef with this n**** with hits and s***
Chips and s***, run around here switchin' s***

Tellin' people don't play that, you gotta play this
Tellin' school you ain't sayin that, you gotta say this
You can't wear that, you gotta wear this
Well hear this, I'll go in yo chest and leave you earless, fearless

The only thing between us if you stop my cream
Is a glock nineteen, and I'm a pop like steam
Tryin' to stop me and mine from eatin' you need a doctor
With a hundred gauze pads n**** to stop you from leakin'

And a prayer from the deacon as you weaken
And words from the Funkmaster Flex dogs shouldn't have been reachin'
There's only one Gunz, from what it's worth
That's me, that's it, buryin' s***, right in the earth

Bumpin' the heist, in the GS with the bug lights
Just us guys, tough guys, the puff lye
Cut up pies from night, 'til the sunrise
If one of us dies, his fam gets a share
Every man's treated fair, no one's getting his hand kissed in the chair
We all shine as individuals, ex-criminals, we trained to not hate you for the
Residuals
Now his interludes, reflecting how we was reppin'
Snappin' necks-nigga, 
Charging the mob for our protection
I'm still rejecting offers from half the forces
A corner office, and ten percent of all extortion's
I'm still enforcing, but only when it's close to home
Do it for Tony, he taught me how to hold my own
But now I'm fully grown, and I got dreams of my own
My whole team on the throne, living like kings out of Rome
It's on!

Over three gods, Terror Squad'll cough 'em up real nice
Send him to Christ, taking his life's not a problem
I've been robbin' niggas and pullin' triggas way before my album
Drowning my sorrows with bottles of Moe
Anybody can go, lose your control, end up a John Doe
You didn't know, my shit is game tight
The insane type to bust open your brain with a drainpipe
It ain't right, but I don't give a, uh!

My red dot that make ya head hot, disgusting wet spot
Blood gushing down your bumbleclot dreadlocks!

Let's fly the kite to his Ma
You leave the key inside the breadbox
I hold the toaster, Fugee-Camou coats and penny loafers
Glass table meetings with Dons, I'm nice wit' mine
No time to be fair, I build in this square
I'm holdin' it there, my corporation's like a million in share
The gat push weak niggas back, from Brownsville to Flat bush

So much frost on my wrist look my fist froze up
A photographer is tryin' to get a little close up
Why cause I'm a star now? Buy out the bar now?
Or I press one button, start up my car now?
I heard that you want to spar now, so baby it's on

And this day I hit 'em off I'll have America sewn

Make you bite your lips, Jenny you know you like unless
Nice and thick, if you ever leave me I'd slice my wrists
Treat you like a bitch, never that
We got beef where my niggaz at
Streets is where I'm living at

Where the glock, that's the sounds of the mini mack
Where we at, uptown where its really at
Here me yack, I want the mansion, the yacht
Advance on the spot, we can dance till we drop
Let my hands slip a knot

Joe you the don

Jenny you the bomb
Any man disrespect, good as gone

When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me
That everything is going my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of my fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened up for me
That's why I'm feeling

I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around

Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine, oh no
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
'Cause I'm loving life, and tonight's for feeling

I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself like I should (Like I should yeah)
'Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around

I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around

Boricua, that's you mamacita
Puertorican diva, from la isla bonita
Let me freak ya on the dance floor
Lead your man off,
He's just trying to get your pants off

That's the last straw
Pun I ain't got a glass jaw
Better run when you see me coming through the back door
Crack smart, I give it all for my brother
There's to things I don't share
That's my money and my mother

I love honeys since the paradise for real
Seis caps some steel, this better scrap for real

Shut up your grill
You know we never fight
It's your world girl, set it off right

I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around

I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause not one thing
Can bring me down
And nothing in this world's gonna turn me around
I'm feelin' so

Party all the night
Everything is feelin' right DJ
Party  all the night
Everything is feelin' right DJ
The world's gonna treat me right

I'm feeling so good
I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself like I should (Play my song for me)

From the streets to the jail cell
I mean, my niggaz is facin' death penalties and all that
Charlie Rock el D
Yeah, yeah, this go out to you my nigga, yo, yo

Ain't no solution for this
Since day one I been true to this shit
Often niggaz try to shoot but they miss
I been provin' to hit so you know it's really real

I went from chillin' on the hills to signin' deals worth fitty mil
Self made millionaire status
We all gettin' money but it's funny how mine makes niggaz maddest
Come at us if you ready for war

Whoever you are
Leave you dead in your hall leakin' red on the floor
Better than y'all
Niggaz need to face the facts

Since the days of crack I been blazin' gats, tryin' to raise my stats
Tracin' back, you could find me at a racin' track
Laced in black, bettin' on a horse called Amazin' Jack
Joey Crack's the illest, fully backed my killaz

Hoppin' outta 18 wheelas, like mad gorillas
Niggaz need to calm they nerves when I'm concerned
'Cause if you didn't know by now, you all gone learn

I ain't know you really want it
How am I supposed to know there's something when you keep frontin'
Don't want no people wantin' to play my game
And if you really want the problems nigga say my name
Bring it on, come on

How am I supposed to know there's something when you keep frontin'
Don't want no people wantin' to play my game
And if you really want the problems nigga say my name

I puts it down with Pun
Now all I do is lounge in the sun
Look what I done from the slums, to sportin' 5 thousand and ones
See the ice glitter, I only walk with them nice niggaz

Sheist niggaz that quit it for doin' life niggaz
You had a judge, we came through in the clutch
Fifty fifth ain't no what to do when I came through wit'cha
The Don Polly, you could find me as fresh as Denali

In times probably even marching at a Shaufton rally
I often carry that's the price of fame
Got precise the fame snipe you with the rifle and unlight your brain
It ain't a game, it's real niggaz with real guns

That still run, caught a box and pump ox by the millions
Before the children that's confusin' life
The voodoo type that'll pull out the Uzi and make you lose your life
The news is tight, I got 'em hangin' by the neck
Man you tanglin' with vets when you bangin' with TS
(What, what the fuck)

I ain't know you really want it
How am I supposed to know there's something when you keep frontin'
Don't want no people wantin' to play my game
And if you really want the problems nigga say my name
Bring it on, come on

Hey, what about Pun?

Terror Squad leader, come down

When I was young I blazed the corner with a vengeance
Crack king descendant, 14 years old facin' a sentence
Me and Tone Soul still co-defendants
Know your legends, Fat Joe, Soul blowin' up sessions

Split dough with detectives to get my flow in protection
Through the ice on my gold you see your own reflection
Can't tell me shit about murder and movin' weight
I got niggas that's off the scale that'll bust through you and your mate

It's proven today, Armageddon's comin' sooner than late
We rappers that really blast, I know Cuban relates
50 niggas of terror, rockin' 560 leathers
Some of us are dyin' to gain but the name lives forever

Marked on my flesh to make my thoughts manifest
When I spark, no man's heart could withstand through the test
So apply the pressure like I used to do but Crack never left
I traded in my double breasted for a Mac and a vest, what the fuck?

I let you ride if you bustin', I let you die if you bluffin'

Who want dramas, word to my dead and gone mama

Leave your mama covered with a white [incomprehensible]

Fat Joe,"Man, what the fuck is we gone do, man?
Shit, man, I can't believe this shit, man
Them motherfuckers done killed him
We got to ride for this nigga
On them old hoe ass niggas
I say we ride over right there, right now
That's what I'm talking about, let's roll

As we delve through the mud and rain
Straight shots of tongue ease the pain
As we put to rest one of my niggas
That got cut up and lost half his brain
Shit, ain't the same niggas is dangerous
Buckin' like it's the thang to bust
When I looked at my nigga fucked up
I couldn't help thinking this could've been aimed for us

Niggas do hate like that, nigga, you never know
He say a friend but I smell foe
So I sit back and wait for the day niggas try to kick in my door
So I sleep with the big fo-fo
But what if I fuck up and pull it too slow
You know what they say, gotta go, gotta go
What if I be the one breathing no more, oh well
When I die I want all my motherfuckers to ride
(For me)

On the niggas that did me killed, me committed my homicide
Gather up after the funeral and pull out all the big guns
(Posse up)
Go through every hood poppin' till somebody tell you somethin'
How in the fuck can I rest in peace when I wasn't ready to die
So I'm begging my niggas to get my revenge
And do it the same night they put me under
Now I'm gone but this thug shit gone live on
Just write on my tombstone he was that thuggish ruggish bone

Murda mo, niggas, gone kill some more
(Nigga, you never know when you gone die)
Murda mo, niggas, gone kill some more

When I die I wanna see about a hundred niggas cryin'
Lying, talkin' 'bout they all love Ryan
And Joey too, you should've seen me at the funeral
Sporting the top hat tuxedo was royal blue murder who
Nigger, I died in the car chase shot
The place like the last scene in Scarface
Now I'm in the far place chillin' in the whites of the sky
Terror Squad till the day I die

I'ma thug, I'ma die high O.D. off the la-la
Niggas tell me get off that weed, I'ma keep smoking on that thai
Nigga, fuck that, I'ma keep hittin' that
(Puff puff)
Till my lung collapse, what's wrong with that?
You hypocrite, just a little bit you know you down with it

It's all good in your hood having laughs
Puff weed to clear my cataracts
Never thought I'd see the inside of an ambulance
But now I'm there too many dead brain cells
Runnin' 'round inside my head
That's when I died my eyes were blood shot red

Now picture me dead, still getting head in the coffin flossin'
Bitches fightin', cryin', tryin' to get a bigger portion
My niggas talkin', figuring how to get my fortune
While I'm lost in space waiting for Satan and his horseman
Walkin' through fire sparkin' my lighter cloud the sky up
Rising higher and higher, eye to eye with my messiah
Viya Con Dios as I cross the gates of hell
I faced the devil with a shovel and told him brace yourself

Reporters steady ask why KB be talkin' 'bout murder on all the songs
I say 'cause I could step out the door, somebody could pop and I'm gone
Then they wanna know why I pack chrome for one I'm paranoid
Smoking too much of that weed, what's that I just heard a noise
Get the 12 gauge and I call my boys
Motherfuckers is plottin' to get me, I know when I'm dreaming this
So that's the meaning of this

Nine millimeter heater strapped with infrared beams and shit
So nigga don't trip the reaper, seem to be getting closer
So I'm running from that motherfucker swervin' and duckin' murder
Pistol grip pump protected by the gauge
Mr Sawed-Off Leatherface reload the clip and into the crowd I spray
Murder murder, mo murder, murder, kill, kill, kill

Shit, it's selling but what they ain't telling niggas is that it's real
But you better realize for it be you in the casket dropped
Better get you ass a shotgun and go get a plastic glock
Nigga, don't take murder for no joke, that's like slittin' your own throat
But I tell you what'll help for sure is if you bust back at them hoes

And what you make in a year I make in one show
Now you wanna frisk me and search my ride
Call me all kinda names try to hurt my pride
You're just mad cause I'm a young cat, pockets dumb fat
Talkin' bout: Where the gun at?
I been there and done that
I'm through with that illegal life, I'm stayin legit
I love to see cars come cruisin' bye and playin' my shit
I walk around with six thou' without a pist-ol, my whole cliques wild
I'm rich pal, no more sticks I'm makin hits now
I drink Cristal, I'm through breakin' laws
I don't sell coke anymore, I do tours
So get that flashlight out of my face
To bring me down them Jakes'll do whatever it takes
Word up them federals got my phone and my house tapped
Praying that I fall for the mouse trap, I doubt that

Why do I end up in so much shit?
I done came way too far to be callin' it quits
Jake wanna lock me up, even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother pockets get thick

Aiyyo enough's enough, federals try to set me up
Put me in cuffs and crush what I lust into dust
Plus, they want a nigga soul, but they know

So I'mma keep doin what I'm doin
Pursuin' my dream 'til there's enough cream to start my own union
And show these kids how legit it is
Shit is real, I used to steal but now I own several businesses
So where's your witness that you claim to have, sayin' that I'm takin half
Extortin' New York and not payin' tax?
I'm laid back, playin the role, layin the low
But it's the same ol' Joe so don't get K.O.d
Hey yo I'm gonna fry for what I never did
Or catch a heavy bid, why don't they just let a nigga live?

Why do I end up in so much shit?
I done came way too far to be callin' it quits
Jake wanna lock me up, even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother pockets get thick

Dimes I'm willin' to hit, I stay drillin' a chick
They all know I ain't shit, but they still on my dick
And I never walk the streets without the vest and the chrome
'Cause all my jewels be Rocky like Sylvester Stallone
I blast the tech at your dome to leave you restin' alone
Go home and puff a fat bag of sess 'til I'm gone
You got this nigga frontin' like he the main event
When his album ain't even last long, it came and went
I'm like Gotti to him, I throw the shotty to him

Who am i, to justify
All the evil in our eye
When I myself, feel the high
From all that I despise
Behind the jail or in the grave
I have to lay, in this bed I made
If I die, before I wake
Hope the Lord don't hesitate

Get 2 heaven, went through hell
Tell my peeps, all is well
All them fools, whose soul's 4 sale
Sitting next to the Jezebel
Demons screaming, in my ear
All my anger, all my fear
If I holler, let them hear

You's wrong, n**** we can get it on

Aiyyo, guns we toss 'em, and bodies we auction
To his family we tell 'em he owed us a fortune
Gimme forty-thou, you can have yo' child, you don't know
What I had to go through, to clap this clown, check my background
The last n**** to see you bleed, the last n**** to see you breath
The last n**** you wish you shoulda believed
And Drag move quick, blend right into a wall like a brick
The only thing you see before I blow off ya s*** is my wrist
'cause my hand the gun is covered in
Not this range, when I pump this pistol, it's very rare I miss it
Damn it on ya lips
y'all keep talkin' like y'all teflon with no weap-ons
N**** I'm pumpin my four, I ain't throwin no more
Nowadays n****s run upstairs, open they drawer
My circumstance, you ain't got that chance mines in my draw, you get it?
that's means y'all walks for two dicks, so don't be stupid
and make me use one unless you that b****

The only rapper that'll pull out a gun and slap the s*** outta you
You can't tell me nothin, I'll clonk you and stomp out ya belly button
I'm too violent for this rap s***, I should be out somehwere killin som'thin
Too quick to blast, some n****s talk s*** and dash
But I really will KICK YOUR A**
Juggernaut, I don't care if you a thug or not
I'll get Jamaican on ya a**, boy, with the Bambaclad
On your mark get ready, run, I'm sparkin' everyone
The one get locked stand back and watch where you from
How dare you come and try to s*** where I eat
F*** you n****, literally 
Dick in your cheeks, you rich in the street
But I'm still gon' hit cha'll n****s
Because up north you be tossin salads with maple syrup
I know you hate to hear it, but everybody know this one
Why you always gotta be right n****, why can't you ever be wrong

[Fat Joe]
Now it's on, from the Bronx where it's at
You was wrong, me and Pun brought it back
Now it's on, stay on with the gat
You was wrong, it's the Don, Joey Crack

Who the f*** want beef with Joe Crack
Make your body fold back
Lift his soul with the chrome mack
I don't chat on the phone, 'cause the phone tapped
You heard there's money on the block we control that
I got the work in the pot where that stove at
Cook it up 'til its wack, get my dough back
You n****s so wack, tryin'a compete
I blind you with heat, I'm the reason crime on the street
I die for my peeps, keep an open eye when I sleep
Let you slide when I coulda put five in your Jeep
Who's liver than me? I ain't know you really want it
I'm like Christ, n****s beg for they life when they see me comin'
Ain't nodoby gonna stop my shine, you out'cho mind
Don't make me have to c*** my nine, pop ya spine
Neva did believe in the Don's 
Since ninety-two I've been proving that y'all n****s was wrong

[Remi Martin]
Aiyyo, it's on, though I'd stay on the block
You was wrong, now Remi on the rock
So it's on, thought I wasn't gonna drop
You was wrong, I was right all along

I told these n****s, that I was the sickest b****
And everytime you spit, I'ma spit some sicker s***
Ridicoulous, I reminise when I blaze the track
Tight s***, make a n**** want to play ya back
I'm hatin that, but I'ma make 'em all believers
F*** hot, I'ma come and straight drop a fever
Cop a heater, turn around and pop your leader
And for the followers, I'ma leave their heads hollower
Make your wig twisted as if I was Oliver
Layin' in a hospital, hooked up the monitors
That's for the game, y'all lames just came to first
'cause I ain't neva heard a b**** straight flame a verse
I blame the church, how God let you lie like that
Who scribed you for, 'cause you ain't neva rhymed like that

Face Triple Seis the God of War like Mars
That leave MC's smashed but my Squad, is odd
Y'all never seen relish, but always seem jealous
Of my extreme fellas, rockin' the ? sweaters
The ones who paid with they life
I rock for forty days and forty nights, and every verse is tight
Better than before; rough, rugged, and raw
Chainsaw metaphor that leave your brain sore
This ain't a game, I'll leave you maimed
Allow me to explain I thrive on the pain while robbin' your chain
Knahmean? Do him and the fiend, grab his wallet
Leave a trail-blazin like (Rasheed Wallace)
What's today's knowledge? Hold your heat like The Peacemaker
I walk the same streets the police take us
Livin' on the corner so won't speak it out my mouth
Respect and got the money son that's all that it's about
No doubt, silence of code, violence of mode
Under control, can tell my real niggas really roll
On the low tryin' to blow trees
And for no reas', we hit a nigga up for mo' cheese
Better relate and start to think, or be the missin' link
I got my Hustle on like Larry Flynt

We brave in the heart, playin' a part, amazingly smart
Razor sharp, futuristic raps, state of the art
Takin' New York cats past the stars
First it was Nasty Nas now watch me turn a Apple into Macintosh
Computer chip locomotion flow, la cosa nostra dough
Hold your toaster low, business never personal
Just some words to know, if you run the streets
Come in peace or leave in pieces
Even Jesus was killed by the polices
They crucified him now they inject us with juice to fry 'em
Depends on the state if death is my fate then cool I'm dyin'
If that's my destiny it's meant to be
Just remember to bury the motherfucker that bent me right next to me
Aight crew? (No doubt Pun!) Aight then, let's fight then
I'm hypened, comin' with the thunder and the lightning
Invitin' the comp, ice on the arm
Nights when I storm, snipin' your moms, right from the Bronx
Mic in the palm it's the ghetto God
I rip a nigga heart out his frame while I scream TERROR SQUAD
Be larger than life, my initials carved in my wife
She said she'd starve on a diet instead I'm a God in her eyes
The father of Christ, sure to be immortal
Guzzlin' beer bottles by the dozen with Devin that's mi hermano

""Big Pun "" "" will be here, forever""

You ain't understand how I push your wig back quick
A little quiet nigga wouldn't think I did that shit
I'm from where the guns love to introduce thyself
Reduce your health, little bulletproofs get felt
Who mind ready, for this big dog who hold a nine steady
I'm John Blazin' when you see the arms razin'
Shit crime heavy already, I keep it sharper than the long 'chette
Far from a snitch nigga who call Teddy
I click triggers how you more ready and switch bigger
Than more berry I'm a cherry you a strawberry
If you lost that mean I'm on top of the whip
You plottin' to flip, fuck around and get shot in the lip
You stop with the quick and never make another move
Even your mother lose, I hurt up your pops to pay your brother dues

""Big Pun ""
""Forever do you understand? FOREVER!""

Make way for krill, I don't play I spray for real
Blow your top with the glock, that's my favorite kill
Blaze your crib with like thirty shots
I'm already hot, but my last one is with some dirty cops
I play the streets with toast 'cause the thieves is close
Wanna keep your post then don't beef with Joe
Still niggas think I won't bring the heat out
That's like sayin' Puff ain't never beat up Steve Stoute
Truth first, Terror Squad, shoot first
War with me and you guaranteed to leave the earth
I'm, dressed to kill, my niggas rep for real
Joe Crack's back like I never had a deal
Hungry and shit, it don't get more lovely than this
Blow a hole through your ribs just for runnin' your lips
The street's a trip; either you deep or you sleep with the fish
I keep a fifth for them niggas that's seekin' to flip

If they move, Noodles shoot that fuckin' whore 
Dead in the middle of Little Italy little did we know 
That we riddled a middleman who didn't do diddly 
 
It'll be a cold day in hell the day I'm taken out 
Make no mistake for real I wouldn't hesitate to kill 
I'm still the Fat One that you love to hate, catch you at your 
Mother's wake 
Smack you then I wack you with my snub trey-eight 
 
I rub your face off the Earth and curse your family children 
Like Amityville drill the nerves in your cavity fillin'
Insanity's building up pavilion in my civilian 
The cannon be the anarchy that humanity's dealing 
A villain without remorse, who's willing to out your boss 
Forever and take all the cheddar like child support 

I support Pun in anything he does, anything he loves 
My brother from another mother sent from the above 
A thug nigga just like me, one of the best, might be 
Even better leavin' niggas kneelin' on they right knee 
 
Spike Lee couldn't paint a better picture 
You small change, I'm blowin out your brains gettin' richer 

Hit you with the Mac (Mac), smack your bitch, nigga what? 
You gettin' stuck, my trigger finger's itchy as a fuck! 
Trunk jewels (jewels), cruisin' in the Land, pumpin' 'Cash Rules' 
Last crew to want it caught a hundred tryin' to pass through 
That's true, so who the next to get it? 
GS the best that did it (get it off your chest kid admit it) 

[Chorus] 
And it's 
Here, and you don't stop! 
Twenty shot glock with the cop killer fill 'em to the top 
Yeah, and you don't stop! 
Joey Crack's the rock, and Big Pun keeps the guns cocked 
Yeah, and you don't stop! 
We'll make it hot nigga, what bring it I blow your whole spot 
Yeah, and you don't stop! 
It's still one-eight-seven on an undercover cop! 
 
Fuck the po-lice, I squeeze first, 
Make 'em eat dirt 
Take 'em feet first through the morgue, 
Then launch 'em in the T-bird 
The street's cursed, the first amendment's culturally biased 
Supposed to supply us with rights, 
Tonight I hold my rosary 
Tight as I can, 
I'm one man against the world, 
Just me and my girl 
Black Pearl Athena my sena who keeps it real 
You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it 
Peep it it's no secret, 
Watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it 

Creep with me, as I cruise in my Beemer 
All the kids in the ghetto call me Don Cartagena 
Kickin' ass as I blast off heat, and 
You never see me talk to police, so 
You should know that I really don't care 
Pull you by the hair, slit your throat, and I'll leave you right there 
So beware it's rare that niggas want beef, Big Pun speak 
And let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets 

Fuck peace, 
I run the streets deep with no compassion, Puerto Ricans 
Known for slashin' catchin niggas while they sleepin, no relaxin 
Keep your eyes open, sharp reflexes 
Three techs in the Jeep Lexus just in case police estas 
Street professors, Terror Squad, ghetto stylers 
Fill the clips off, inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers 
Better acknowledge or get knocked down until I'm locked and shot down 
Heather be couldn't make me put my Glock Down 

We lock towns like rounds in the chamber 
Boogie Down major like Nine, I bust mine 
Every time plus I'm the crime boss of New York 
When we talk to walk the walk all my niggas carry chalk 
And stalk, I prey like The Predator, whoever want it 
Go and get it set it baby and I'ma bury ya 
So remember the Squad that I'm reppin' 
I pull a clip for my weapon and Punish niggas till it's Armageddon

Once you rule the world every girl will want to be with you
First I get the money then I get the power
B-Real of the hill eliminate the guitars

Thinkin' of takin' a plane 
To take a flight out to the red light
And smuggle 10 pounds of weed
Make it home tonight
Be the number 1 smuggler in the area
Got enough weed to fill up and air craft carrier
Erb slanger, Hasila Incorporated 
State to state and over seas gettin' faded
Buddah king had seen the green proton
I'm bringing it on right back home to Don
Many different strains of erb in my brain
I'm slippin' through customs in my hydro plane
Skunk and the one chocolate ty bud
Niggas lets get high in the sky hit the blunts
And the bongs, fill up the lungs, niggas don't stop
Fools get sprung when they get there smoked up for crops
Like gettin' props, where all the soldiers in the board
Yo what would you do if the world was yours.

What would you do if you could do the unbelievable

Lying penance with diamonds ill as lacin' in a face with avengances
Having blocks on in the lava parts dome
My mankind with crime is how you shine if you can't rhyme
Dime droppers will give ya fad time if you sleep
But momma single be mastera heater on city streets
In the east I be known as Don Cartegena
Claimin' the ? like ?
Lacin' the china with Menida
To seller need repeater or be a leader 
Like a preacher or presume a steeper
Peep the shit that I be on, sippin' Don
Until I'm drunk with a million in my trunk like Nikki Vons
Come on I be the top extortionist 
Adopt adopted foster kids right out the mothafuckin' orphanage
Yea, I do it for the youth, I'm livin' proof 
All my peeps in the streets know I speak the truth.

Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you
First ya get the money then you get the power
G Rap bustin' the gats slangin' last by every hour

No doubt, 
I be the crime story of all ghetto territory's
Soldiers at war be blowin' up niggas like glory
With pharmaceutical lavatory's
Major to chemistry, PHD in streetology
Degree in drug industry
Combinin' H²O with matter from crack batter
Rest it through molecules scatter 
Launchin' rockets to make the pocket fatter
Mind bitin' an arm starts a crime
G equals and MC dat ain't near the square son I gets mine
But yo the kill the fill with force fields and shields
And holy steel, a nigga keep it real
You know the deal, if the stakes ain't to high for me to grab
I got's to have, stack all the cabbage
From constructin' a drug traffic
Police a jam me in try to find a new pot to frame me in
Armenians so I resort the evil thoughts like Damien
This flame of fury to the D-A and the jury 
A hundred grand the judges hammer slams I'm a free man.

What would you do if you could do the unbelievable
Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you

Be larger than life, twice as nice as ya idol
Pump you with pride, then guide you str8 to hell like the bible
I'm lible to start manipulatin' minds infiltratin' clown
'm out the pitfalls of life entice with nickle plated nine
It seems every time I'm dream I'm in a nightmare of fiend
Livin' a world of mothers and queens and men would fight fare 
(Hell Yea!) I wish I could, I wish I could
Never forget this whole damn world ain't shit I'm just a hood
Yo I change my life make my wife and get the chance for the pain
And physical abuse, give her back her best years
Grab my chest hairs, pound my fist on the hard cement
Spark the scent, and cloud the sky till my heart's content

If you even think of bustin, they ass'll sooth your thoughts
A damn shame, I'm from the streets where it's fair game
Nigga's will ift you off your feet wit the Can-yan

Till the Don out her to the qualities much greater

It's like I gotta keep remindin' you and remindin' you
Who's that nigga, you heard the kid
Fly was on the casket of all those who oppose the squad us
It's the motherfuckin' don Cartagena ya heard
What?

They wanna know why ya name is Joey Crack
You a hustler, how they think you got the stacks?
You stuck being in jacks on the blocks with your paps
And the squad to hard niggaz gotta fall back
Damn papi, you're shit is icey now
In the bronx witcha Benz rims pokin' out
You got the niggaz in the pen straight lockin' out
But when the don is on nigga close your mouth

Yeah, yo, you wouldn't understand my story of life I live
Most niggaz that really know me got life as bids
The trife as kids, this ain't no scarface shit
These niggaz really will kill you, your wife and kids
I walked through many blocks niggaz couldn't stand on
Had shit locked before I had a glock to even put my hands on
Before I had the doe to put my fams on
Before I had rocks sealed in pink tops, tryin' to get a gram off
A wild adolescent, raised by the street

Mesmerized by the dealers and the places they eat
And when they blazed the heat, I was the shorty to take the hand off
Run upstairs, tryin' to sneak the gat past grand moms
This is how it should be done, my life
Is identical to none, son tried to duplicate but I knew he was fake
'cause every time I walked by he turned blue in the face
I'm like heavy on the leg when I pop
All my change is like heavy on the weight when I cop
It's just the way it's done
Niggaz tell me they respect the way I blaze them guns
On hold it down for the bronx in the name of pun

They wanna know why ya name is Joey Crack
You a hustler, how they think you got the stacks?
You stuck being in jacks on the blocks with your paps
And the squad to hard niggaz gotta fall back
Damn papi, you're shit is icey now
In the bronx witcha Benz rims pokin' out
You got the niggaz in the pen straight lockin' out
But when the don is on nigga close your mouth

Yeah, my name ring bells like a P O
Put the pressure on a nigga like I'm right at the doe
With the muzzle out, nigga can't shoke with my dough
I'm at his mothers house
Beat up his pops, put the pistol in his brother's mouth
Wave bricks, whips, jerked a few coke and next play the strip
With chrome knowin' that they won't forget
And on the weekends we shut down clubs
You know them crazy Peurto ricans always fuckin' it up
If I can't afford it, I'm a extort it

If I can't cut it, I'm a bake it
Strip you niggaz butt-naked, I'm a thorough bred
Carry guns and pump heroin
Never went O.T. I'm too light for Maryland
I'd rather play the streets of New York
Where the friends are guaranteed
To keep the meat on my fork
I'm just a hustler, feds put the tap
On our phones in hopes of cuffin' us
Then wonder why we livin' life so illustrious

They wanna know why ya name is Joey Crack
You a hustler, how they think you got the stacks?
You stuck being in jacks on the blocks with your paps
And the squad to hard niggaz gotta fall back
Damn papi, you're shit is icey now

You got the niggaz in the pen straight lockin' out

If it ain't then it ain't, no wonder you dead
So go to sleep - now, throats is splitted
and folks that get it they gotta get the hell on widdit, BIATCH

Yo, yo, all these niggaz that claim thug like they're the type
But when it's time to go to war they runnin for dear life
Get the hell on with that - say what, say what what?

Got this clown runnin around like he's my fam

Yo, everybody talkin gats, really don't pack em
98% of these rapper's is all actor's
Stay frontin, like you wild and'll spray somethin
Come to find out, you ain't never slanged nothin
Think it's the game, gon lose the sport
I seen dude's get bruised through fort
Then choose the court, a new's report
They just pursed the court
If you even think of bustin, they ass'll sooth your thoughts
A damn shame, I'm from the streets where it's fair game

Nigga's will ift you off your feet wit the Can-yan
Three in the chest and one in the part
For disrespect you, get left right in front of ya moms
Joe is the Don, you clean, then show me your arm's
For these track's, I'ma fiend like a soldier in 'Nam
Only the Bronx will blow your ass outta ya Lugz
Fuck love, here we believe in nothin but slugs

Automatic Semi's wit the fully clip and the leather
Poppin champagne like we celebrating whatever
Switch to the chin, shoot top, hair and a feather
Versatile, walking threw the aisle, hurtin the crowd
Even got the god in the cloud, observing this style
He love the way I do this, leavin nigga's clueless
It's Prospect, it's off wit ya head, you should've knew this

Puff blunts, like to get high just like Whitney
Thug type, ""Set It Off"", like Jada
And this chick go both ways, don't hate her
Back in the block, they use to try to play her
Till the Don out her to the qualities much greater
Net Worth, put the tool in the skirt
Which you fools know about gettin head in reverse
About, clockin grips, and coppin whips
You muthafucker's stay frontin, stop poppin shit

Let's be honest y'all niggaz left me to die on that cold December day
BUT, I survived; so much if you thought I
Would pull up in the corner and die, not I

Ain't no peace on the streets with these Spanish kids
Just another cop beating in Los Angeles
Yup! You guessed it the President didn't say shit
'Nother vacation, chillin in Camp David
And they wonder why the hood's so hot
My pops locked up, my moms cooked rock
And just the other day Lil' Troy got shot
Over a 2 dollar dice game, way to lose your life mayne

Yeah, this is things of that nature

I'm like, ""Holy Christ!""
Is somebody tryin to come up in my crib?
I'm like ""Who the fuck is this?""

With a black mask that match
I'm bout to blast his mask off
Push his cabbage back
Make spaghetti out his brain
'cause I'm steady with the aim
Niggas comin sideways, gettin petty wit da game
Musta heard about the half in the safe
The stash in the base, iced out
medals in the case
Niggas comin wit da chrome
Tryin to sneak up in my home, rumors out
I spent a Mil' on the pump piece alone
I got the heat in my palm
Nobody's seein it though
Step your feet on my lawn
I'm puttin 3 to ya dome!

Front if you will, get chopped up
Stuffed in the quill
Back to the lab, got these niggas
After my math, these hoes try to play it off
But they captain is back
They must have teamed up
With some niggas thinkin they sweet
Like I just rapped and
I got a ho waitin in the street
I'm playin for keeps, I see 'em
Creepin on the moniters
Got my temperature risin faster than thermometers
I burn banana clips, make all
My victories unanimous
I'm accurate, once I catch a peak
Hey man, yo ass is hit!
Now I see 'em creepin through the front door
I think not! We exchange shots
Like cops into getting blocked{*gunshot*}
He busts, I bust back{*gunshot*}
He caught one in the chest

In the stomache and neck{*gunshots*}

Fuck tri-borough, we reppin' five borough
Get at these niggaz straight music

Yo, Friday night, woke up in a cold sweat
I can't believe niggaz schemin' on Joseph
Nah man, this ain't the way it's goin' down
Niggaz talk too much shit, and I jump like the sound

They fear my presence like the rest of them
Jose's the bettin' informer, flesh-n-blood like the president
Now maybe I'm a target on the pedastal
Got a little fame now, niggaz wanna harm me for my revenues

Start ya little beef, that's the shit I love to eat
I been a soldier, you a son, be a humble seed
My own niggaz let them hoes make 'em envy
Posin' like they friendly when I'm knowin they resent me

That's the shit that get me aggrevated
It be the same niggaz in ya face talkin' 'bout, ""I'm glad ya made it""
Fake niggaz, Jers' State niggaz
Funny how cake can make ya learn to hate niggaz

You've now tuned in to the sounds of Jose
Where we push sex, money, drugs, and violence all day
Mostly heard in penals and project hallways
And by niggaz blowin' trees out the back of O.J.'s

Ice cold like Alaska when I pass ya
Got girls shakin, losin they breath, as if they catchin asthma

It's like tryna take the flesh outta the mouth of hungry cannibals
Joe the God, the flow is hard
Known for packin two dozen birds like Noah's Ark
I'm the realest of 'em, make you feel the pressure
Catch you at a club, smack you up, steal ya leather
You niggaz soften me, beat you out of the mix
Tough talk, tough walk, but you cry like a bitch
I see you downin the Cris', I'm not hatin, I'm just aggrevated

Fuck around with the Don and get decapitated

Now I know you can feel the heat I generate
Imagine when I penetrate ya stomach, and make ya body's center bake
We can argue for days, whether it's faster to drop five shots
in ya astronaut before you cloud the stash box
Splash ya brains on ya birds' laps
Swerve you on the curb, crash the Range, and push the front skirt back
And murk after that, blurtin curse words
Yo I popped that nigga's son one before we catch the first
I'ma kill any murderer, leave a nigga burpin up
Blood, chokin on chunks of his lung interior
Every verse that I spit's a personal riff
I meet a ill key frontin, I'm a murder you shit
Niggaz play me while distrubin the Bricks
I'm like the feelin of the first time they ever held a bird in they grip
Motivator thug, scrape 'em, shoot the bolts in his butt
Energizin 'em up, make 'em want to open 'em up
Actin like I can't happen till I smack him in his Adam's apple
Death to rappin, I don't want to battle
I'd rather rush your studio session and shatter the booth
Clap at ya face, give the mic feedback the goof

Never seen a brick, never seen a crackhouse
Wanna a war with the Don have your techs out
Bring it on, and I'm a show you gangsta

Yo, yo, I stand alone in this cold world, could you believe that?
I've seen some good men get blown over G-packs
In the Bronx where it's known to hear the heat clap
And live niggaz get it on with the D-techs

Shit, my life's legendary
If I wrote it all down in a book it would be very scary
What you know 16 BM'ers and Benzes
Rope chains down to my dick, the beef looks tremendous

Me and my niggaz flip holes in bitches
Back then, when I wouldn't even pose for bitches
A-YO, you can ask Dapper Dan, who was the man?
Back in 88, every other week tricked 30 grand

Even my bitches wore Gucci and Louie
My peeps already in the crowd lookin' for groupies to screw me
Exit the club, about to cruise up the block now
With the Taj, stay frontin' with top down

See me in that new thing with my fiancee
Ass so fat, makin' you say, ""Muchos Grande""
Don't blame me, blame them, the white folk
For givin' me ten mil, for possessin' the tight flow, whoa

It's the Don of this rap shit, go on with that wack shit
Heard you walked the dorm in a thong on your last bid

Joey Crack is, the most official
Toke the pistol for those who oppose the issue
I hope I convinced you to back up, really you acted up
Believe me I could easily get your ass touched

And that sucks, ain't nobody fuckin' with this
Bullet shook could make you take a bucket of piss
For runnin' your lips, got the fifth stuck in your ribs
Don't make me splash your lungs right in front of your kids

I'm a basket case, don't ever give this bastard space
Or I'ma have your ass erased, I'm from the Bronx amongst corrupt cops
We mothered this rap shit but still don't get enough props
All I hear is 'Gangsta', you ain't built like that

Don't make me have to pull a tool and really tilt your cap
I'm from crills to crack, you've been dealin' with rap
You ain't never run the streets, now I'm revealin' your act
What the fuck?

Ya'll wanna live my lifestyle
Never seen a brick, never seen a crack house
Wanna a war with the Don have your macs out
Bring it on, and I'm a show you gangsta

See what it's like to walk in my shoes
It ain't all fun and games (ya heard?)

Yo yo
I'm sick and tired of stressin, every days a different lesson
I'm free-fallin tryna leave this deep depression
My son Joey still slow, my moms got cancer in her throat
My big brother sniffin dope
Lemme know how many motherfucker want to be just like me
Screamed at and treated like shit by your wifey
This hot bitch be sweatin the coke cash
My baby mother think I grow dough out my ass
It's like, how much fight I got left in me?

Uh, yo, the South Bronx, nine years later
Ain't nuttin changed, niggaz still playa haters
T.S. the best that's done it, forever live and never front it
Reminisce of when I used to hold heat and tell niggaz ""run it""
Now we flooded with jewels, hundreds of dudes
Crowd the Coliseum to hear they favorite tunes
Then at the time of our prime we caught a sick one
The angels came down, took my twin Big Pun
Shit were unbalanced throughout the whole world
All I could do was try to provide for his seeds and his old girl
Hope your listenin, tell Ton' that we still missin him
I'm like a prisoner in jail with no visitors

[Chorus 2x]
[Fat Joe]
Yeah, uh, aiyyo the third verse is dedicated to you
Even though you switched teams, I'm praying for you
We used to stay up all night countin dollar for dollar
You was my son's godfather, where the fuck is your honor?
Can't even rap the shit we did together
You'd probably have me shackled locked down doin bids forever
You broke the first code
I'd like to twist ya wifey till it roasts gold
Snitch nigga, turned state to sold ya soul
How could a nigga that was clappin in the streets
start yappin to the deez, like what I rightly should believe?
Like ever verse is a charge, for every hurt there's a scar
I never once tried to hurt cha'll
I'm just tryna do me, sell a few CD's
Buy land in Miami and cop a new be	 come on!

[Joe talking]
Motherfuckers think it's sweet
Think a nigga got money and a nigga don't feel pain
You ain't never feel my pain
You don't know what the fuck I'm goin through
Niggaz lookin at me like, ""He got it made""
Like I ain't lose Pun, my grandfather a week later
My aunt a month later
Like my fuckin sister ain't in a coma right now!
You motherfuckers don't know pain!

Shout to my homies out west hoo-bangers!
Mack Deezy for Sheezy
All my niggas in the Bronx
Holdin' them corners down
Ya heard? Get it right!

Joe cracks back, been a long time comin'
No mean to disrespect but a lot of y'alls frontin'
Shook niggas, me and the Squad done took niggas
Flex drop bombs but you seem to overlook niggas
We the nicest in the game, even lifers know the name
Throwin' blows like Tyson when he rained
Fuck the ice in the range, I'm tryin' to get stocked
Generate mil's so I can buy back my old block

It's like the rap games far from the crack game
Niggas is mad lane, how come? They act tame
You can tell from my scars life is hard
Shot down in broad day life in front of my Mom's
And the feds never give up, they tryin' to kill us
I'm stressed drinkin' VSOP tearin' my liver
Livin' my life like I don't care I'm out to take the throne
My mom's in the window hopin' I'ma make it home

The streets is funny peeps'll kill you
Over piece of money, 'specially if you sleepin'
And don't keep it gully, I'm from the Bronx
Home of niggas that'll stomp you senseless
Don't resent this, I'm knowin' that you comprehend this

Its the wild life, niggas done lost they mind
Its the wild life, everybody wanna floss and shine
But could you blame them?
Niggas is brought up with anger
Pops in jail, Moms get tossed up on strangers

Yo it's the wild life
Where peeps takin' life for keeps
Yo it's the wild life
We all brawlin', fight to eat
The enemies and the D's lurk through N.Y.C
Some of them on they back lookin' up like ""Yo, why me?""

I never really had a pops
But who the fucks to blame
He did 13, and wonder why the streets my name
And heat's my game, 'cause I'm the type
To leak your frame, give you a slap
With the cast, you can meet my pain
Defeat I bring, to the nicest rapper you know
I ain't a killer but I still might clap at you though

You for real here, niggas be followin' with steps
I made my own moves, so the tokers, could swallow they breath
Acknowledge the best, and do what I did
Like I'm blessed, 7 days in a coma
This is life after death
I'm in it to win, ya heard?
From beginning to end, you could get shot
Even though you once considered a friend

Sometimes my minds driven to win
Tryin' to scare society
But can't slip again 'cause my lil' man relyin' me
Everyday I put through a test
But still progress
I'm tryin' to climb hills
And tryin' to make me kill for less

Yo its the wild life
Where peeps takin' life for keeps
Yo its the wild life
We all brawlin', fight to eat
The enemies and the deeds lurk through N.Y.C
Some of them on they back lookin' up
Like yo, why me?

Yo its the wildlife
Straight kidnappin' and carjackin'
Yo its the wildlife
Nigga fuck scrappin', we all packin'
I'ma smash on anybody disrespectin' the turf
Straight to the dirt
We niggas known for puttin' in work

I make it all go down right
In front of your face
Another life goes to waste
For names sake of the paper chaser
It ain't safe here, the bright lights cablide you
Mix sedica, swallow you whole
They can't find you
Worst thing is walkin' these streets

I need clarity, peace and prosperity
Is never gon' see, so niggas with beef
Niggas bumpin' they gums and teeth
Straight to the police
Tryin' to plant us six feet deep
But I ain't goin' for that
My shit clap through your starter cap
Pull your socks back, we ain't runnin' from nothin'
Comin' from nothin', makes you struggle harder for somethin'
Shit is disgusting, you can even trust who you fuckin'

The wild life! Colder the nights
You niggas ain't nice, put yo money where yo mouth is
And roll the dice, puffin canibus and tiva
With the Don Cartagena, believe a nigga
When I say, don't make me have to spray ya

Yo its the wildlife
Straight kidnappin' and carjackin'

They got that energy, confident and always aware
who's watchin them, bitches on top of them, they don't just be near
Probably spot poppy and them they robbed last year
and just, nod and stare and show no fear
Cause nine times out of ten this bitch connects this kid to shoot you
They too hot so catchin a body's too crucial
If you a hustler, I know you relate
Whether you home base or go out of state
This shit is real
and you better recognize when you see 'em, these niggaz kill
A whole 'nother drug dealer keep 'em with steels
So be creepin so it's real on the deal, with the F-E-D

Everybody want to be us, wife beaters and flip drugs

They don't need to wear shines
They got that energy
Confident and always aware
Who's watchin' them
B****es on top of them
They don't just be near
Probably spot poppy and
Them they robbed last year
And just, nod and stare
And show no fear
'Cause nine times out of ten
This b**** connects
This kid to shoot you
They too hot so catchin'
A body's too crucial
If you a hustler
I know you relate
Whether you home base
Or go out of state
This shit is real
And you better recognize
When you see 'em
These niggaz kill
A whole 'nother drug dealer
Keep 'em with steels
So be creepin'
So it's real on the deal
With the FED
Some of them sleep in six feet
'Cause they skrilled
CHORUS:
(Armageddon:)
F***in' with hustlers
You see us in the clubs
Everybody want to be us
Wife beaters and flip drugs
We them hustlers
A little thug's role model
Where the snubb full of hollow's
Tryna earn a little power
He a hustler
Some of us locked for eternity
Get shot down and murdered
In beef or turnin' for police
Hustlers
Yeah, you know
What the sparks done
You know where we evolve from
You know when the heart's pump
Hustlin'

(Fat Joe:)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
See life a style
Now it's rappin'
How you push packs
In large amounts
And never spend a day in life
Movin' them cats about?
That's not what Crack's about
I cooked it, cut it and lift it
From Brooklyn to one-sixty fiddith
I took bricks and flip shit
Clips I sit 'em even
Whip some women
From runnin' they lips
And gettin' me in the
Middle of shit with other niggaz
And real dealers
Don't be yappin' on the phone
What you think, father born?
Don't be caskets and clothes
see'mon why'all know niggaz slip
Speakin' a joke
There go the dial tone, click
Now you steamin' with holes
why'all motherf***ers couldn't fathom
What's about to go down
Like a year from now
When the bears get out
From a ten-year stretch down
To air shit out
Make him a man
Show your heart when I tear it out
They say hustlin' is the key
To success, and on that note
I can feed you niggaz for less
I got madd coke

Repeat chorus
(Fat Joe:)
Yeah, it's for all
My hustlin' niggaz
All my liquid dime niggaz
All my niggaz flippin'
Bricks out there, yeah

till I fucked around and hit a broad back
Got burnt, Now you figure the rest
Dick hurt like I'm pissin' baguettes, now I'm livin' depressed
Should have known better than to trust a hoe
Especially she wanna know how much doe you hold
Cause there ain't too many real bitches
If you got one hold on, don't wanna be nobody's meal ticket
And you know it don't mean shit to me
Cause you know, Bitches ain't shit to me
What

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
You see the problem is them busta ass niggas you been fuckin' with
Always bought ya shit, But never taught ya shit
Did he ever tell you some things that a player do
And made you aware that life is more than a hair dew
Boy I tell ya, Best to deal with them real niggas
And stay far away from fuck niggas
Don't be a sucker, Hell at least not from nothin'
All this suckin' and fuckin' a bitch better have somethin'
I need something that is compatible
Not nothin' young and dumb and full of cum, But one that's edible
I bet a, Nigga like T Double
Get it wetter, Suck and fuck 'em better than the average nigga
I need a girl that's into tryin' things
So I can put it in her mouth, Fa real ain't into mind games
I know she's a mama girl and I'm a street nigga
Once we get together, I'll bet you she'll sleep better

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil Jon]
A-T-L nigga, Shawty pimpin' how I put it down
Grindin' hard everyday, Chevy ride through ya town
23's on the truck, Ask me if I give a fuck
Rally's on that 75, Rollin' up 85
Lookin' for some cut like you
Tryin' to see what you gone do
Shawty I ain't playin no games
I ain't tryin' to be yo mayn
I just wanna cut you up, Slice you up like cold cuts
Lay you down and eat you up, Jonny slong up in them guts

[Verse 4: Big Sam]
See I'm something like a freak, Part time pimp
Big block Chevy rider all through Decatur
Wanna know my name, Well its Big Sam
And I play no games with these hoes cause the lame
Lemme break it down, Tell ya right now
If ya see me in ya town its goin' down
And all I want to do, Is cut you and ya crew
So let me know what's up with ya girl and you

Every time I speak to you you got something to say
According to you I'ma speed crushing all day
All I'm askin you for is to be more trusting
I'm outta town all the time and don't accuse you of nothing
Picture me creepin with a chick on tour
When you love my son as if it was yours
I know at times you feel alone cuz I'm not at home
That's why every few hours I pick up the phone

Touring making dollars assuming that I love you or regardless

Something to hold you down till a nigga come back
Me and my lady got history this worth she deserves
More then this cold world is giving me to share with her word
And I don't care about nothing else except my girl (my girl)
Not myself no one else just my girl (my girl)
You bring life to my world you give me strength to go on
And face life even when it seems all holes gone
Labeled my wife but you truly exceed the title

Fat Joe,"Yeah, it's time, baby
It's time to speak the truth, maturity
Niggas gotta evolve to let niggas know the real
Call yourself real, ya gotta start speakin' about the real
This is Joe Crack, The Don an' this is what I'm bringin' to you

Yo, nowadays, I'm flirtin' with uncertain death
Lord, I gotta be dyin' 'cause after all this cryin'
How much more hurtin's left?
When will the pain stop? This depression an' anxiety
Is gonna make me show another side of me

My niggas ride with me 'cause I'm the truth
There's benefits to rollin' with this clique
Don't nobody fuck with you
Still they label me a tyrant an' a backstabber
But study the facts of crack, the shit don't add up

I'm bringin' opportunity to my community
Probably the only rapper that cares
But still you out to ruin me
Who you foolin', be? I'm for unity, Latins an' blacks
Could you fathom the strength, we have of the two it attach?

Born together, voted alike
These 'Uncle Charm' politicians ain't holdin' us right
How could the same nigga be 20 years in office
When it's clear the only thing that's risin' is unemployment?

Abortion, little kids havin' kids
The school system is failin' us, now ain't that some shit?
While the rich keep gettin' richer, the poor keep dyin' young
I can't hide no more, the time has come

I was born in the ghetto
Tremblin', tryin' to stay alive
'Cause when you're born in the ghetto
No one seems to hear your cry

Brown skin, you know I love my brown skin
Every day, I'm confronted with racism
These motherfuckin' coppers wanna bag us
An' have us shackled up in state prisons

After all the taxes I pay
You would think when they stop us
They would have something nicer to say
Than, ""Get the fuck out the car, where the drugs at?
All the jewelry, you wearin', where the fuckin' guns at?""

Once they search the car clean an' find nothin'
The same crooked cops try to act like they know us or somethin'
Laughin', tellin' jokes by the thousands
Two seconds ago they tried to send us to the mountains

Leave my son without a father, my wife without a husband
The more I think about it, man, it's just disgustin'
Still we live amongst 'em, everybody wants out
That's why we rap like we got silver spoons in our mouths

Like we ain't grow up on welfare
Nigga, don't even go there, you probably wore Pro Players
We need to educate the youth, tell our seeds the truth
Too much to share, the bare minimum will exceed the proof

I was born in the ghetto
Tremblin', tryin' to stay alive
'Cause when you're born in the ghetto
No one seems to hear your cry

Yeah, so much pain
Trying hard to stay alive, stay alive
Out in these streets

Man, sometimes it can get so tough
Yeah, yes, it can, yes, it can, yeah
It can get so hard, so hard, so hard

And I'm lookin' for some bustas who be actin' like them niggas do dirt
Come to find out they ain't put in no work
An now my feelings is hurt
Cause they decided that they wanted to murk
But I'ma chase 'em to the end of the Earth
Cause I'm a motherfuckin' rider
You can see the pain in my face
Got no problem exchangin' the hate
They got me fightin' a case
And if I blow will I face a fifteen
And I'll probably do it all in the pen
But yo I'm livin' with it

It's the murder man mack, I stash in the Lac
I bought my bricks from these dro back stacks
It's the Birdman baby come and holla at me later
Duck ass niggas, we deal with 'em later
First you, go to the mall and you ball like a dog
And we drop the car, then holla at ya boy
Tell them pussy ass niggas, break bread with the boy

I keep my forty cal cocked cause these niggas on my block bang
Right up the street from where the cops hang
And in my head I hear Pac sang
And then them rushin' memories make me cry till I can't stop man
Tell my mama I'm a killer if I happen to die
That's how I lived, ain't no sense in me lyin'
My whole life's filled with danger
Never been a stranger to homicide
My neighborhood's full of gangstas and drive-bys
And niggas fightin' for position
The demon has risen from out of prison
Now I'm losin' my religion

Cause I don't fuck with you, now I'm bustin' at you

We hit the swiss hotel before you finish your glass
And you know you wanna be where the cake is at
Where the pockets just like calories, extra fat

She was only sixteen, when I met her I was playin' the corner
Had to scream one of her niggas, like get up off her
She was a diamond in the rough, real neighborhood jewel
You would never see her out, 'less she comin' from school
At first we started out like sisters and brothers
'Till we finally let it out, and started kissin' and huggin'
And your moms always dissin' me, tryin' to get rid a me
I guess she figured out, I had taken your virginity
She was right, sexin' all day
When they wouldn't let me in, we be playin' the hallway
Talkin' all day, bout the stupidest shit
Like if we got rich, what would we do with our chips?
And who was our favorite rappers, it was Nas at the time
We would memorize every single bar of his rhymes

I might just ride by, let 'em sprinkle the truck

She was sixteen, maybe seventeen
I was eighteen, nineteen maybe a little bit more
(was she a little more), ha ha
Yeah, huh, but life goes on
She was sixteen, maybe seventeen
I was eighteen, nineteen maybe a little bit more
Ha ha ha ha, yeah, yeah, woof, uh, yo
But life goes on

This shit got deeper, you was havin' my seed
I couldn't wait to see this little nigga look like me
Sure enough a little fat guy named D'Ryan
Kept us up all night, always bitchin' and cryin'
I was still slingin' fast, the ""Flow Joe"" came out
Things changed, wasn't the same, wanted to hang out
The groupies was chasin' me, rudely awakened me
No longer safe for me, this new world is takin' me
You deserve much more than to be mistreated
I was a fucked up nigga, but at least I admit it
Just to be cool, I helped you through school
So you can have your own career, and don't depend on no fool
Life seems crazy when you look back
I pray to God, that you hook up with a good cat
We can't look at, who's right or who's wrong
But I thought I'd let you know through this song
That Life Goes On

[Chorus]

So I moved on to the next phase a my life
I finally met the women I would make my wife
It was love at the first sight, in the worst way
Shorty kept holdin' out, had me thirsty, mercy
Mi shari amor, whisper in my ear
Tell me baby girl is it me that you adore
Used to stay up all night, just bumpin' and grindin'
Makin' plans for the future, how to hustle my rhyme in
Used to drive cross state for like a G a show
A well known famous rapper, but my pocket's is broke
But we kept grindin'
Slowly but surely, kept climbin'
Pun broke in the doors, now we headlinin'
I'm lettin everybody know your my sweetest possession
How you kept me real strong through the deepest depression
Paid no mind to your friends, cause their words is trife
I hold you down for the rest of your life
Cause Life Goes On

[Chorus: x4]

Look just shut the fuck up, Joe told us what happened

Told us what, what happened
You're trying to act like you don't know what's going on, but I know
You know what happened that night

I was drinking Cristal on the right hand side (yeah)
Hennessey on the left hand side
Macho gave it to me, I don't remember after that so, aw

You think your a tough guy right (tough guy)
Your not, your a pussy, cause your afraid if you rat on Fat Joe

Aw, sorry, sorry, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

Maybe we should put him in a cell and lock him up, until he fucking talks

Rat on Fat Joe, what do you mean?
There is no rat on Fat Joe, you disrespect him right now, that's not good

Your fucking busted man, just tell us this shit
Your fucking baby momma told us

Fuck it, listen to me, I don't snitch, I'm twistin alright

Cool & Dre, uh
Terror Squad motherfuckers
They're all gonna laugh at ya, haha
They're all gonna laugh at ya
Yeah, (YO), uh, (oh God), haha
Haha (feedin you, feedin you)
Yo (feedin you, feedin you)

[Fat Joe]
Yo, uh, yo, call me the JV artist
That means I own two joint ventures and two different labels, niggas that pay me homage
Been in this game for nine seasons
That's nine reasons why I'm expired the rhyme beefin
Ya'll niggas is rappin ass backwards
I left twenty spots since beginnin this rap shit
All yo papi lo que pasa contigo
Mad cause I'm the only nigga reppin our people
When I came in this game, no one wanted the job
All of a sudden niggas actin like they wanna go hard
Spittin venom 'bout the Squad, try and shittin the God
This ain't no ""Scarface"" shit, blow up your kids in the car
And since you wanna act like you livin a movie
I'll hit you with more shots than Bruce Lee got in a ""Fist of Fury""
Bitch niggas, nothin but snitch niggas
Today you on my dick, tomorrow you on his nigga
Got deported from the Squad, can't afford another car
Where's your house at? I heard your livin with your moms (livin with your moms)
Blane nigga better stay in your place
Keep talkin, burst a flame in your face, motherfucker

[Armageddon]
Yo, yo, with this comparison the Geddy is God
Cause even though you never seen me, I been put fear in your hearts
And I'm smooth like a Mulo it theme
Skip bullets of your Coogi beam
Before you knew you were seen
Yeah I'm nice and I don't care if you know
Cause all you really need to understand is how hard I'm rulin with Joe
And the streets is no place for late bloomers
Just gangsta niggas, snakes and bitches that meant to spread rumors
Listen, I'm from the Bronx were the gun shoot rabid
Front if you want, but don't think we don't shoot rapids
I'm what some might consider a ghost
Cause I move at night, plus I'm the type to play a live nigga close
I'm the ultimate, high consulted, rhyme vocalist
I write dope, spit dust and shit cocoa bricks
This is what you dicks need to act-knowledge
Or get the shit smacked outta ya fat cabbage
Don't ask why we act violent
We just killas and thugs
Niggas wit mad talent, that still dabble in drugs
I only rap now to speak to the streets
They say the Squad gotta feed 'em the beef
So we gonna feed 'em the beef

[Prospect]
My nine milly blaze, and hit hard like Willy Mays
Since my kiddy days, grew up with thugs who were really crazed
Ain't no silly games, right here be the truth
150 proof, whoever, I'm talkin to you
They call me Prospect, I'm one in a mil
One of the real, I rap but I still put a gun in your grill
I'm the reason why I catch you when your car breezin by, with your Iceberg team
You look when the light turns green
Your scared to death, don't make me have to air at ya chest
Or tear ya flesh, for actin like I carin what's left
Anyone can get it in a minute give it some time, I'm livin this rhyme
Let my nine get in your spine, sit and recline
Get so mad, forget and rewind
So I can see what I did again and just slide
To the next level, hop on the bike and just pedal
Bustin at your best rebel, who runnin to test medal
Let me get settled, lay my mom down in this game
For niggas kinda refain, I push 'em down in the train
Bout it the same, my three cousins up in the Benz
Big, G Psycho and E, ya'll know what this is

[Remy Martin]
Yo, yo, It's the T, E, a are a, a are a, O, are Squad
So you know I gotta be that bitch Remy Mar
With Armageddon and your nigga Joe The God
Tony Sunshine and motherfuckin Prospect
Straight out the projects
A forest, where they kill for mils and they blast the steel
But I'm from murda murda Castle Hill
I got a big ass burner, but I'll slash your grill
Yo don't got no status, don't want no static
They knew you was loco toto, and I don't no Spanish
All I know is how to cock back and aim for the cabbage
And keep on bustin 'til the bitch brain splatter
And the kids won't matter, when the crib's on fire
What you spit don't matter, cause this bitch on fire
And I won't stop rockin 'til I retire
Any bitch disagree is a god damn liar

[Outro - Fat Joe talking]
Yeah, uh infamous Terror Squad nigga
Loyalty, what does it mean to you
How many a ya'll niggas is loyal?

[Verse 1]
Its like I'm always out to prove somethin
Everytime I stop on the block
I set up shop and try to move somethin
And I'm talkin about kilo's and pounds
Fuck a desert eagle
I got shit that spit over 300 rounds
Can tell by the scar on my neck

Joey boombay-ay, hit hard with the left
Sharp with the right, I don't know why I bother
Y'all not retarded
Man ya know what the squadron is like
And he can get it too
But I let him die slow death I probably just collectin his food
I'm deadin ya crew
To tell ya the truth we not stoppin
I'm like lil' lease from be	-street man I keep poppin
The streets knockin my shit, the d's watchin my shift
We can do this however, east glock or the fifth

Daughter slaughtered and maimed you should have paid the ransom

Niggas be like you crazy, he got classic shit

[Verse 2]
Its the killa kid from the bronx
Holdin down to the death
You can hear the squad comin
By the sound of the techs
A hundred rounds in a sec
Leave you on front page
You would think I was down with the ROC
The way I just blazed
I puff haze to keep my mind at ease
Can't wait for the day to see shyne released
This hip hop shit is unjust, who you gon' trust
When most of these record label execs is dumb fucks
I keep a gun tuck under my belly
Only nigga on the island makin calls from the celly
We watchin belly on the DV, 60 inch TV
Flat shit attatch to the back of the CP
This game need me, I'm like gotti once I'm gone
All you gonna have left is a bunch of fake dons
Champagne with the women, run a game for the puddin
Its all the same, still runnin trains with my hoodmen
A bunch of goodmen, but don't get it confused
We like dinero in heat nigga, nothin to loose
I know you seen the shoot out scene
Don't make us reneact, 'cause I rather be laid up in ?? with a featured actress

Fat Joe,"Slow motion, baby
Tell you what I see through these eyes
All we do is speak the truth, yeah
Shit is realla then real, yeah
Shit is realla then real, ain't it?

My true niggas walk wit me, yeah
They ride wit me
Would you cook pies wit me now, ya heard?

Lord, I keep hollerin', I hope You listenin'
How come I'm still stressed an' even though the squad's glistenin'?
Why You had to take Pun, someone so young?
Had so much more to live for, as real as they come

Dead man can't talk
That's why You're hearin' one side of the story
But did they tell You how he provided for forty?
Family members, grandmas to shorties
Even my seeds ate off the big homie

How could You deceive Your kids like that
Make 'em believe they dad wasn't worth jack?
Listen to the facts as The Don pours his heart on this track
How could I just stand there an' not react?

An' I'm just about sick of all you sideline niggas
You know, do anythin' for the limelight niggas
I'm defendin' your honor, my brother from anotha Momma
I never thought I'd see the day they tried to send you [Incomprehensible]

Shit is realla then you think, man, you must not know
It takes a lot to walk a day in the life of Fat Joe
The place I'm from, MTV don't wanna film
Just a simple dice game will get a muthafucka killed

The ghetto ain't a place that you wanna take lightly
Same cat that'll spill you an' end up with your wifey
I've seen it all, that's why I've picked up the pen
To keep your boy from servin' life in the pen, ya heard?

Fuck the flu season, nowadays it's sue season
Can't even go to the clubs an' show my people love
'Coz soon as shit pop off an' niggas knuckle love
Niggas accusin' me of fuckin' 'em up

I'm like, ""Hold up, ain't they supposed to be dogs?""
Part time live niggas, dabbelin' drugs
See a rapper think of a lucrative deal
But you'se a bitch if you choosin' to squeal

It's more than obvious, you don't know a thing about honor
But what goes around comes around, you'll soon learn about karma
As for me I stay being the realest
Admired by politicians, street thugs an' killers

I keep feedin' the street but the street feed back
Is that police tryna see Joe back in green slacks?
But never dat, see, I keep long money
An' if you lookin' for dat
You'll never see a cent from me, muthafucker

Shit is realla then you think, man, you must not know
It takes a lot to walk a day in the life of Fat Joe
The place I'm from, MTV don't wanna film
Just a simple dice game will get a muthafucka killed

The ghetto ain't a place that you wanna take lightly
Same cat that'll spill you an' end up with your wifey
I've seen it all, that's why I've picked up the pen
To keep your boy from servin' life in the pen, ya heard?

Yo, I stay grindin', everybody counted me out
Now I'm rewindin' in my summer beach house
If I'm not in the studio, I'm out on tour
Bustin' my ass to make my fans' future secure

Nowadays everybody want somethin' for nothin'
All of a sudden niggas talkin' like, ""Joey be frontin'""
The hood screamin', “Crack done changed, he don't holla”
I know now Big, 'Mo Money Mo Problems'

Jealousy's a muthafucka
Who'd a thought the same niggas you be feedin'
Be the muthafuckaz comin' for ya?
I'm not stressin', I was born a warrior
Plus I'm too big, too wise, too strong for ya

When it's all said an' done, I follow my dreams
Could have ended up dead or in jail given the scheme of things
To let you know I'm the reason you still walkin'
If I said somethin' it was me, not the liquor talkin', muthafucka

Shit is realla then you think, man, you must not know
It takes a lot to walk a day in the life of Fat Joe
The place I'm from, MTV don't wanna film
Just a simple dice game will get a muthafucka killed

The ghetto ain't a place that you wanna take lightly
Same cat that'll spill you an' end up with your wifey

Fish Scale ta Heron, live well from here on
Half a mil in ya grill, of course we bare all

You must not be reading it right
Ice so bright, we don't need headlights at night

She can't keep up to mah speed.
She's weak, she don't need to smoke weed
And wherever she's at
Is where she should be.
Now, where's your wife, I don't care

Feed 'em with trays the size of light bulbs
Coke so bright, it shine like white gold

And the hoes like Joe way before this rap shit
Before the Versace floors and the Rolls to match it
Joe's a bastard, I sell pussy for cheap
Make my bitch walk the strip with no shoes on her feet

Don't front for me, you kids is not ballin'
If you is then why is your wiz on my dick like I'm Jordan'
Ties swollen for no man with bold plans
Sick of this rap shit, why' Listen to 'Slow Jams'

I'm a grown man, the talk of the strip
Niggas think I'm Kev Childs that way I boss the fifth

You dudes see, I'll put in an order for you
I'll let the water boil, cook a quarter to the oil

I had it for sell but y'all fagots would tell
Go to jail and start singin' like Patti LaBelle
I ain't gon' back in a cell, you rat and you did
Fuck a vest, put a bulletproof hat on your head

When I'm clappin' the lead, I'll murder a nigga
And if he say he not the feds, then I'm servin' the nigga
I'm thirsty for the change, playin' games ain't a issue now
A bitch would give you AIDS nowadays if she kiss you now

I got that coke and that haze on my gristle now
We goin' to war, you gonna need more than a pistol now
They throwin' missiles 'round, you still tryin' to get a nine'
Uh, it's the last days, end of time

The terrorists jackin' planes, sendin' bombs to the Pentagon
They off the hook like intercoms
We just had a bad wintertime
So you know they gonna start to rob
And steal for a mil' when it's dinnertime

You still spendin' time focusin' on dumb shit
On the block smokin' but you broken on some bum shit
What the hell' You might as well put a suit and tie on

Just give me a minute and I'm gonna flood you with rocks
I gotta wicked jump shot but let's be real
Ain't no scouts gonna give a sad nigga a deal

And I know it ain't about the chips
Just my way of sayin' thanks for the years you put up with my shit
I had to change like the chorus said
And I'm reminded why every time we do our thing in the waterbed
To me this is more than head
It's more than a crush

Gon' make me damage abrasion my attitude is very impatient

Yea he used to be my dog, but fuck a relation
Once he get money and fame, everybody starts aging
Shit ain't no longer the same, your own niggaz be hatin'
Can't see another brother succeed
So you backstab 'em just to see how long he'll bleed
But I'm a strong man, pops always told me never fear no man
That's why I'm scarred up on both hands
And never love a bitch, hell naw I can't trust a bitch

Competition stand 'em in line, cause without permission
I'm handling mine, occupation scramble and grind
Stop your facing, shank you with knives
You're missing a born soldier, operation declined
I'm like a optician, with a vision to shine
A hundred steps ahead of y'all, ain't no getting behind
Say what I choose 'cause I done payed my dues
Came from an error of pain and terror, a lot of rainy weather
I learned to survive through the hatred and lies
That's why from far away, I can spot a snake in disguise

Only half of what you see
A promise is a promise, not a guarantee
Nothing in this life ever comes for free

Drunk with desire, hearts on fire
When you look into mirror are you looking at a liar?

Let the power of example take you higher and higher

Attractin' them niggaz I go against, the money was his
One nasty unit of murderers, all type of Goons'll watch
Then four minutes later they burgulars
I heard from the grapevine mine made it
Elevate the name up, this gift gotta reign and his game went up
And now he's stronger than ever, Nike jackets and Classics
Go against it and it's instant vendettas
He run things, gun down Kings, check the joint the kid flyin' in
Crib in Africa with two lions
Somethin' like the Prince of a jewel thief, so smack the millions
Came back wrapped it up, too sweet

Made him watch me on the couch havin' fun with his kids

Or you in the box laid under the floor?
Or keep you alive blow torchin' ya balls?

Twist the blunt, sat back, son beepin', we drove off

This motherfuckin' point of this crunk juice shit. (what?!)
But we done got to the last motherfuckin' song niggas
(last shit niggas!) and I got five of the hottest motherfuckin'
Emcees in the world, givin' you that gangsta shit!
It's the motherfuckin' grand finale!

We growin' doja in the basement in that underwater garden (okay)
When hereon in the bank shed, dry it 'til it harden
Make it hash up in the oven (man), put yayo in the hot plate
Drain and dry in the freeser, it's obvious we got weight
I said hard work, that's soft work even with wet work
Built-in clientele so we ain't gotta network (let's go)
We always got work, so we ain't gotta get work
And if you ain't gettin' your work from us you bound to get jerked
We yayo experts, we been whippin' the yola since the crackas decided to
Take the coke from coca-cola
Hold the rollers, the king of the trill
The underground as well, you can step in the ring when you feel
Nigga just sound the bell
Can't sound the heaters in this game, but the grind I'm lovin'
Nigga we passed all that pushin', man it's time for shovin'
I got the mask, I got the strap, soon as I find the gloves
We gonna start exposin' off like farhrenheit 9/11

I'm a speak clearly 'cause I don't think they hearin' me
A nigga only fear's gettin' charged with conspiracy
I'ma get it right to ya, sticky green white to ya
Wear whatever you want, bullets goin' right through ya
If you stressin' to get buried
My niggas'll send you back to the essence in a hurry
Sippin' crunk juice, blowin' dutchies in the chevy
Try to figure me out dawg, I'm light but I'm heavy
Yellow lemonheads in the bessie of the presi'
And yeah, anybody can rock but d-block rock steady (d-block!)
Fed's don't need no warrants 'cause y'all all informants
So I get higher than new york insurance
Try to keep shit clean like florence
Moved on up on the east side 'cause I never lost endurance
And it's all real niggas, if I ever get a license to carry
Shit, that's a license to kill niggas

I refuse to lose, I rather give these weak dudes the blues
And separate them from they jewels, teach 'em don'ts and do's
I raise tools, make crews make decisions confused
All spectators can say is, ""this lil' nigga's a fool""
A short fuse with some loose screws, some unscrewed
Better prove, you niggas pussy as the moulan rouge
So who guardin' who, you know who to you know what
To you know where, goin' 'gainst 'em's too unfair
'cause everywhere you do a show he got kinfolk there
Now you know I ain't no ?, I got ten folk there
They ain't powerful as the one at the end of your prayer
Got you runnin' for your life without a minute to spare
Catch you dead to the granite, melt the grease in your hair
When I go, them boys is gonna be indecent affair
Guarantee you nah a real nigga breathin' accounted
At your funeral, just your parents and the preacher was there
Hollow, television name-dropper reachin' for help
So I ain't gotta say a word, pimp you beatin' ya'self
You gon' get what you deserve for disrespectin' the game
Any nigga with the nerve to say another man name
When that other man ain't even present
And deny it when somebody ask him about it
That nigga's a lame, you like to lie on the mic
Hide behind fame, I was a g when I came
That's the way I remain

Who besides the egyptian-walker, fuckers have a conniption
My existence persistent to bring foes misfortune
I dassle 'em, like the alderman, billy dee in mahogany, minus the perm
From the tiniest sperm that the mightiest the almighty can muster
Project prophet, chronic blockage gives alzheimer's to youngsters
Amongst them is me, can't remembers my beefs
With who? for what? they screw-face me up, my boo laced me up
Bolinsiaga, flimsy condo with bimbos in south of kalan gro in pimp mode
The inf' glow on his clothes and you know it's over
Hammer hit pin, pin hit shell, from the shell the slug gonna chew ya
Try not to lose me, I try not to lose'ya
Mama say mama sa mu makasa, fly to cuba
To chill with some politi-kill niggas who ill
'cause y'all niggas are losers, don't get comfortable nigga
Say hello to mr. bad guy, get that cash par, I'm the last don
You'll ever know so, here you go y'all can take these thoughts
Anyway I'm chargin' emcees a late fee cost
So when y'all done with my style, please break me off
But never make nas mad just in case cross
'cause ah, lately y'all don't make me happy
To calm my nerve I need the herb gnc don't carry

Who the fuck is that? it's ice cube motherfucka'
He's a maniac, no I'm a fool motherfucka'
Old school motherfucka', blow through a motherfucka'
What you heard about a nigga so true motherfucka'
See I'm ugly and prettay, I'm polished and grittay
Shoot better than that nigga that tried to kill 50
See, niggas get shittay when I come to their cittay
When I hit the spot that bitch they like, she cummin' with me
Cause I got an ego big as to, but I'm not an eagle
Bitch, I roll with rigo 'cause gangstas don't dance we boogie
I told you motherfuckas kobe didn't take that pussy
Get money, get paid, you can beat that shit
Even if the da is a piece'a shit
Colorado got movatos, don't eat that shit
Another white bitch lyin' on thee black dick
I keep it flippin' like flapjacks, pimpin' like black 'lacs
Give niggas flashbacks, they sweaty as ass cracks
When I hit the tar mat, it feel like a carjack
Niggas get out and vanish like star treks
So fuckin' incredible, I'm so fuckin' credible
No matter what happen, I'll never turn federal

Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-40-fizzive 
And I just bought a bike so I can ride till I die 
With a matchin jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion 
My niggaz in the club, but you know they not dancin 
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance with boogies 
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies 
Listen we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us 
And we - walk around the metal detectors 
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section 
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it 
Said he - liked my necklace, started relaxin 
Now that's what the fuc* I call a chain reaction 
See ""Money Ain't a Thing"" nigga, we still the same niggaz 
Flows just changed now we bout to change the game nigga

Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now 
And that G4 can fly through any weather now 
See, niggaz get tight when you worth some millions 
This is why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelings 
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit 
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit 
If Five-o boy come, then they'd proudly squeal 
Cause half these rappers they Blow like Derek Pharrell 
If you cross the line, damn right I'm 'gon hurt ya 
These faggot niggaz even made gang signs commercial 
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin it up 
B2K crip walkin like that's what's up! 
Kay keep tellin me to speak about the Rucker 
Matter of fact, I don't want to speak about the Rucker 
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this 
My niggaz didn't have to play to win the championship, come on!

Half a mill for the charm, nigga this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a young'n, was too much to cope with
Why you think mu'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit
Shoulda been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was 'gon bubble

why'all n****z is p****, poonani, (Vagina)
Your (Monologue's) getting tired, now it's time to ride
You're print distrified, you're no longer desired
So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire
I'm on fire, holly dipped in octane
Let each coast bang, let west coast bang
And Rule gonna bring the ghetto gospel
To every 'hood possible, pushin through in the sky blue
Back with the gods you now, preferably the 4 pound
Slugs flyin at the speed of sound
Tryin to catch the ears of n****z that's runnin their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn n****z to run in your house
I don't really understand what the runnin's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airin our prey out
Leavin 'em laid out, dead, in just a sport
'cause we ain't playin up here in New York

This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe

But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a menage
And everybody talkin crazy how they're AK spit
But we know this investigatin, and they ain't spray s***
Not me, I'm the truth homie, got the industry shook like
""Naw n****, Joe gonna let 'em loose on me""

Even Roy Jones was forced to (Lean Back)
My n**** Dre said grind cook
Now we killin them Howard n****z, who said I must of found Pun's rhyme book

It's guaranteed you gonna die, you might get missed

And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken
And you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold a title, because I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids, hoppin out with them old rifles
Just doin s*** for nothin, it's so spiteful

A double shot of yak and the purple is in the air
And I'm not c***y, I'm confident

Nigga get your cake up, want to get bling'd out
Whether sky-blue or chinchill, I'm minked out
Down in Miami, bitches say they love me
Niggaz gettin mad cause the bitches want to fuck me
Always lend an ear when they man ain't listenin

She pimped out with Senior, it's the good limp with the Nina
How I spit the 'caine game like I came from Yale
How the cops can't hold me, my name is bail
She tryna get up now, and zip to white-on-white Uptowns
to that white from Uptown that got her like what now
Got her tryna wine-dine, grind a little what now
Got her with a eye on eye in every club now
How I'm on the street with the steel
How I ain't gotta play the role; I'm bein myself, just keepin it real
Is it cause I'm givin her somethin that she could feel
Or how I get that change or is it just that name - JOEY!

Mean-mugging all you niggas like I hopped up out your dame

Slipping and sliding, look how he riding pass the po-po

Since he fronting like it's nothing, let a grand hang out
Fuck a handout, I been getting ? since way back
Can't wait to see they faces when I drop the Maybach
You lying, you claim you buying but you renting and leasing
If you pimping and niggas spending, where's the paper you seeing?
Stop stalling, I'm balling, call me Sheryl Swoops
Can't stand the backseat driver, that's why I cop the Coupe

Asked for my paper, said, ""There's nothin' he can do for me""

Better yet that like takin' a plate outta Ryan's mouth

That'll never happen, over my dead body
Feds got me plastered on the wall like I'm the heir to Gotti
I swear to Mambo and Nore and all the left wreck
A nigga try front on his body he gettin' sent back
Don't resent crack, I'm just what you wanna be
Young, rich and famous bitches can't get enough of me
And they runnin' up on me usually in groups of them
But not just everyday but you could never be too used to them
I be abusin' them squeezin' fresh oranges
Breakfast in the mornin' get some strength and then it's on again

I just had to bring 'em back
Word you definitely know what I'm about
You know I had to bring 'em back yo
All my friends call me stout
I just had to bring 'em back
Flamboyant baby
You know I had to bring 'em back yo

When I cruise through the ghetto I drive slow
I'm quick to buck a duck and I don't give a fuck about five O
A hard core life I toast to ex-flaw
Therefore I live raw and went to war with the law
My only pencil was a mug shot slugs were thugs got pot
Get swellin' hops from sellin' tops to da drugs spot
G's was clocked fat knots was in the socks
And cops who tried to stop shop, got knocked when I popped the glock
Shit was ran right by me and my man Mike
'Cause I choose to use a gun don't mean that I can't fight

'Cause we put the guns down and go one round
With the hands but man I ain't the one, you'll get done clown
I can inverse my style, 'cause I'm versitile
Quick to burst a child I'm livin' worse than foul
I pack two techs in case ya crew flex
I wet up the set in a second yell who's next
To feel the wrath of a psychopath shoots it up like shaft
Turn ya staff into a blood bath to laugh
You'll get smashed like a deli snack, you softer than jelly Jack
I attack in black with a gat and a skully hat

I just had to bring 'em back
All my friends call me stout
You know I had to bring 'em back yo
Flamboyant baby
I just had to bring 'em back
[Incomprehensible]
You know I had to bring 'em back yo

No doubt I'm from the X and I seen it all
Shorties with dreams of playin' ball
For Seaton hall turnin' fiends a full
From me the word to Sacuon the same sad song
Is bein' sung, its like gimme a gun and I'm back on
Joey crack, Pun, TS, Bronx regulators
Stomp little niggaz to death for tryin' to imitate us
Y'all could never see us, be us, TS, kill the BS
'Cause Pun got more guns and funds than ideas
Un be us, I'm from the BX so I have to roll

Blastin' for crash ya door, smash ya hoe
Hack off ya skull, I'm stackin heads like totem poles
Blow a hole in ya colon throw you from here to Forden Road
Blow for blow, I toe to toe with the toughest
Bring the ruckus to the roughest motherfucker
It's nothin' but illustrous
My crews are cussin' to bustin' ass crushin' glass
In niggaz faces leavin' traces of red out this bloody bath
I want the cash off the jiddump, I cock and blast the piddump
At any piddunk tryin' to laugh at the briddonx

You ain't no kiddon for the terror squadron
You feel the fear of God when I steal a car
And flatten ya Pierre Cardin
I peirce ya noggin' if you startin' trouble
Spark the dot above you
And watch it blossom like a flower throughout the borough
No doubt I'm thorough with a parascope rifle extended rycle
Cycle that'll tear the whole Bible out
I'm sweatin' no idols a title's all I request
Best rappers know that pun and why the chaperones of death

I just had to bring 'em back

Fat Joe,"I don't give a fuck about your faults or mishappens nigga
We from the Bronx, New York, shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mill for the charm, nigga this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a young'n, was too much to cope with
Why you think mu'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit
Shoulda been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was 'gon bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty with the logo kid!

Said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

R to the Ezzy, M to the Yzzy
My arms stay breezy, the Don stay flizzy
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-4-fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride till I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance with boogies
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we, walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See Money Ain't a Thing nigga, we still the same niggas
Flows just changed now we bout to change the game nigga

Said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back

Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come, then they'd proudly squeal
Cause half these rappers they Blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm 'gon hurt ya
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up!
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about the Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship, come on!",Lean Back,2004

She want to take me home, lay me up inside her home
She want to turn me on, breakfast in the mornin'
She said ""daddy let me take ya home, papi let me take ya home""
And I said ""Mami you can take me home if you let the whole crew get on"" (bitch)

Verse 1:
I got this chick from Cali, profilin', she's whilin'
She's gangsta, she knows that she's got it like that
We was drivin on Crential and cruisin for food when she pulled up beside me sat off in the lap
And I said ""damn girl you actin like you don't know, never seen me before,
never see the crins on MTV video? what you think TS stand for?""
She said ""Terrific Sex"", yeah that's who and the diamonds is no vitar
Used to be a broke nigga from the BX, now I'm rich got the world screamin Terror Squad
Think about it now, everywhere we go, every other city we tour, they never say no
Seems like every other night I got a different chick beggin me....

[Chorus]

Verse 2:
I was up in the club right as I'm Remy in my cup right
And that's when I peeped him, he was lookin so fresh and so cleaned up
From the fitted down to his sneakers
I really do mean this I ain't never seen this, there was some people standin in between us
I had to go over there so I could meet him I had him pimped up in the cut near the speakers
If he got a girl I know she's heated 'cause right now I'm all he needin
If he, crush me then trust me it's a guarantee that he's not leavin
Told me he heard of me but don't know me and I liked him for some reason
Invited him to my place, sat on his face and I ain't got a man so it ain't cheatin
Think about it now, I don't gotta stress, I don't never really gotta press, they always say yes
It seems like every other night I got a different nigga beggin me....

[Chorus (phone call)]

[Verse 3: Armageddon]
Yous a big girl, eat it up, now tell ya friend to hold your hair while you eatin' up
A little hot, little drunk, little weeded up
We in the truck and freakin off while the speakers bump
I'm steady speedin up swervin the bumps
I'm trynna fuck but I ain't trynna fuck the 23's up
So I ease up, drunk and focused
Trynna watch the road but yo the back seats heatin up
And so I'm keepin' them, wish you could see them
I know you hear them breathin like you been possessed by a demon
I know you heated, wish you was here but, gotta go now have a good evening
Hang up the phone now, have a good weekend
Shorty just called the boat the front seat
And I think she's about to go down for a season
I know the horn ain't beep for no reason
3 in the mornin and actin indecent
She so horny damn this shit seems like every other night I got a group of chicks beggin me....

Couple bricks of that yay and it's Philly-bound, feel me now

Live my life in the kitchen, into bakin' pies

You know I walk when I talk when I sleep with the girl
One squeeze and you gone

Cold turkey come back and fly lears off
Cats front leave them leaning like Smirnoff
If haters wanna hate then its their loss
Come up in the Rucker with all my Jake's on
Car grills so big you can cook a steak on
People hear Ma$e call em' wanna get their mase on
You hot 16 I'm a very great song
Been beating on the DJ before the Ma$e song
You play Clake Kent you better have your cape on

You don't want no problems with the boogie down Bronkster
You don't want no drama with the blond bomber

The model from white America
Then Joe the spokesperson for the Latino
Then we got Ma$e back to represent everything else in between including the
Percentages of the press we don't
The best from each coast
The midwest to the dirty dirty
Even further to Miami
All the way back to Californ-I-a
It would probably be best right now if I warned Dre to get on the horn and
Tell him about the storm coming all our way
So tell him pack grab a gat right now get on the floor I'll wait
Shake that ass a little more my way
But baby I don't dance not that I can't there's a pistol in my pants

Said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants

And you know I got enough goons to crush a country,
Any dude disrespectin' Pun he better play the run c,

I don't care, I just wanna be yours
I know I told you I'd
Never love you the way that I did again
After all that you did to me
But I got to say
I don't care, I just wanna be yours
And I am trying everything in my power
To never ever say
Please come back to me
But I got to say

Promised me
You'd always be
You'd never let me go
You took the ring and
All the things that came with being my girl

The tragedy as I walked through that door
You had your feet up over the seat
All I heard was screaming
It was just like a movie
Too real to be
That just can't be my bride to be, no

I was shocked this could be
Never thinking one day I'd take
This blow blow blow
I was starting to feel like
I should kill everything that was moving, whoa
Never been in hell like this
Somebody wake me up

[Chorus]

Crazy boy was he just kept going
'Cause she was the only one that had noticed me
Staring into the eyes
That I will one day call my babe
How could I've fallen so in love
With someone I'd known for years
Not even know that
She'd be the one
To reveal my worst fears

It was just like a movie
Too real to be that just can't be my bride to be no

You know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put to on a show to get patience
Take it to court and go through litigations
And I respect ya gangsta
Treat you like a princess
And put something on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitter
When the starting lineup ain't playing right
I come off the bench wit her
It might sound like I'm gassing ya
But it took time to get from the back seat to the passenger
We been creeping and sneaking
Just to keep it from leaking
We so deep in our freaking
That we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey
A little bit uptight
Wondering why he coming home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight
But I said it'll be alright

I really want to be with you (be with you)
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)
I can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I'm living wrong
But I can't let ya go
Your the one I want in my life (want in my life)
Already got a wife (got a wife)
Can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I'm living wrong
But I can't let ya go

You ain't ever step out of line
Or get out a pocket
So I made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you, I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket
Oh, you gonna play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through
So I cop her one, and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
I worry about you telling the whole world I'm your new Allen Springer
At first you were something I denied
Something I would slide
Just do something in the ride
But shorty
There's something that you provide
Cause the entree ain't as good without something on the side

I really want to be with you (be with you)
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)
I can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I'm living wrong

Already got a wife (got a wife)
Can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I'm living wrong
But I can't let ya go

Uh oh, I might be leaving the earth soon
My girl gonna kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume
Its gonna be a clip towards if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper
If she catch me with an empty magnum wrapper
So keep it on the down low call the carsely
You seen what happened with Mr. Big and R. Kelly

You know I get from you
Anytime this chick is there for you
Feelings I'm'ma share wit you
Which makes it a Lil Mo clear for you

I really want to be with you (be with you)
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)
I can't leave you alone (lone)
And I know I'm living wrong
But I can't let ya go

And we grindin' everyday like the money ain't comin'

Half a mill for the charm, nigga this is life

Why you think mu'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit
Shoulda been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny

With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion

We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance with boogies
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us
And we, walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he, liked my necklace, started relaxin

Flows just changed now we bout to change the game nigga

Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come, then they'd proudly squeal
Cause half these rappers they Blow like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm 'gon hurt ya
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up!

So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire

And Rule gonna bring the ghetto gospel
To every hood possible, pushin' through in the sky blue
Back with the gods you now, preferably the 4 pound
Slugs flyin' at the speed of sound
Tryin' to catch the ears of niggas that's runnin' their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the runnin's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airin' our prey out
Leavin 'em laid out, dead, in just a sport
Cause we ain't playin' up here in New York

This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find god
But now that Ma$e is back, I think I'd much rather find a menage
And everybody talkin' crazy how they're AK spit
But we know this investigatin', and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth homie, got the industry shook like
""Naw nigga, Joe gonna let 'em loose on me""
True Story, I'm bringin' the T back
Even Roy Jones was forced to (Lean Back)
My nigga Dre said grind cook
Now we killin' them Howard niggas, who said I must of found Pun's rhyme book
Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling, like the ring around Saturn
Cook coke, crack, niggas fiend for that

I swear it couldn't be sweeter, Life's a bitch
Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gonna die, you might get missed
For maybe 2 or 3 hours, 'til they light their spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time
But when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken
And you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold a title, because I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids, hoppin' out with them old rifles
Just doin' shit for nothin', it's so spiteful
Ha I'm just like you
Word that niggas want to murk you is in the air
A double shot of yak and the purple is in the air
And I'm not cocky, I'm confident
So when you tell me I'm the best it's a compliment

[Verse 1]
Stop the presses I'm back! Cook Coke that is
Crack, ain't been gone before a week
And still the fiends line up for blocks till it ain't no space
Pile high to the top of the Empire State
Crack! (Crack! Crack! Crack!) Once again so you know it
Ain't been this much hype since that Nas and that Hov shit
Coke spit, the fo' fifth chrome spit
Doe getter since I was small, no better than yours
Truly just check the suicide doors
Thirty inch grill and that black mink floor
Lookin' back I did the shit to death
I guess I ain't killin' it this rhyme I'm here to raise the dead
I'm here to raise the stakes this time it's ten mill
Supply the sink ill, ship five and then build
And I'm, Joe Crack BX finest
Do rewind this Terror Squad behind this

[Chorus]
I got the streets on smash, niggas on the corner watching me roll past
The bitches they all gasp saying!
""Once again back is the incredible"" (damn right!)
""The incredible, the incredible""
I got the heat on blast, love the seats reclining on that mean G4
Cause down in New York they saying!
""Once again back is the incredible"" (damn right!)

Dope man dope man, I got that coke man
Brother Joe man the king of the streets
TS we incredibly credible like Stun said
It was inevitable the metal was 'gon bump heads
And you know that K go chop chop chop
In broad day right in front of the One Stop Shop
I'm from Misery Boulevard, right across the street
From I Hope You Die Place, in school study the crime rate
That's when it became apparent to me
That the pimps and hustlers be apparent to me
I plead innocent your honor
I'm just a product of the streets, product of some beef
Product of that Cappadonna Armani three piece
Problem is when I win, my team eats
But wait, just think the opposite of that
You'll be starin' down the opposite side of them gats nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yo! Now have you ever felt the metal to your melon, it just cock back
Ask for the money and drugs, say you ain't got that
Where the cops at? Prayin' that they comin'
Just a few seconds your brains be layin' on your stomach
On my waist you know I got keep that oven
For ya ginger bread pie ass niggas the heat's running on high

Verse 1:
I got this chick from Cali, profilin', she's whilin'
She's gangsta, she knows that she's got it like that
We was drivin on Crential and cruisin for food when she pulled up beside me sat off in the lap
And I said ""damn girl you actin like you don't know, never seen me before,
never see the crins on MTV video? what you think TS stand for?""
She said ""Terrific Sex"", yeah that's who and the diamonds is no vitar
Used to be a broke nigga from the BX, now I'm rich got the world screamin Terror Squad

Seems like every other night I got a different chick beggin me....

Verse 2:
I was up in the club right as I'm Remy in my cup right
And that's when I peeped him, he was lookin so fresh and so cleaned up
From the fitted down to his sneakers
I really do mean this I ain't never seen this, there was some people standin in between us
I had to go over there so I could meet him I had him pimped up in the cut near the speakers
If he got a girl I know she's heated 'cause right now I'm all he needin
If he, crush me then trust me it's a guarantee that he's not leavin
Told me he heard of me but don't know me and I liked him for some reason
Invited him to my place, sat on his face and I ain't got a man so it ain't cheatin
Think about it now, I don't gotta stress, I don't never really gotta press, they always say yes
It seems like every other night I got a different nigga beggin me....

Yous a big girl, eat it up, now tell ya friend to hold your hair while you eatin' up

We in the truck and freakin off while the speakers bump
I'm steady speedin up swervin the bumps
I'm trynna fuck but I ain't trynna fuck the 23's up
So I ease up, drunk and focused
Trynna watch the road but yo the back seats heatin up
And so I'm keepin' them, wish you could see them
I know you hear them breathin like you been possessed by a demon
I know you heated, wish you was here but, gotta go now have a good evening
Hang up the phone now, have a good weekend
Shorty just called the boat the front seat
And I think she's about to go down for a season
I know the horn ain't beep for no reason
3 in the mornin and actin indecent
She so horny damn this shit seems like every other night I got a group of chicks beggin me....

That would be my mother Maria Cartegena

[1st Verse]
Ay yo, she's the best sister
One man love her
And if she died her tombstone would read
The world's greatest mother
August nineteenth she birthed me
I came out
Put her through hell but still in all she couldn't help but smile
I resemble my mama to be truthful
And I ain't got to describe her
You know she beautiful
Shit, I always love my mama
Blow holes through a Nigga if he touch my mama
You did whatever it took to keep the supper hot
And I remember when you worked at the number spot
Once the cops caught you I skipped school
Yeah I guess the cops was cool
They let me feed you
I cryed for hours till they finally freed you
Drop to my knees and screamed Mama we need you
Then you went back to school and got a job that's legal
Maria

[Chorus]

Yeah Mami, I love you so much
For this pain, this love, you've been through so much,
And I thank you for everything you done for us
You've been a survivor and we love you so much
I had to dedicate this song to you Mami
I had to tell the world how much I love you

[2nd Verse]
Ay yo, yo yo
I never forget the night that changed out life
A neighbor was screaming Maria come out side
Something's wrong with your son I think he's getting high
Then you replied not my son he don't be getting high
Then you bathed him and tucked him to sleep
Yeah I knew from that day life wouldn't be sweet
He got in trouble with the law
Then you bailed him out
I got in trouble with the law then you bailed me out
It was one July the fourth
They tried to take me out
Shot me right in front of my mother
By Tracy's house
Now its time to change my life I think Rap's the answer
Same day I got signed you was diagnosed with Cancer
Doctor said it'd be a miracle if you survived
Then you looked in my eyes and said
Joey I don't want to die
I pray to god that he show us a sign
Now its fourteen years later and you still alive
Thank you God

[3rd Verse]
God I thank you so much
My Mother has so much to see
So much to do
She's had such a painful life
Many nights I argue with you in my prayers but I know you're the boss
You kept her alive for a reason
Mama I'm a ride for you
I swear
Yo, I bet you proud of your son
He's a rap star now
Took you out of them projects and bought you that house
Got you that housekeeper to manicure the grounds
And I bought you that car that breaks the barrier of sound
You take care of Joey and I love you for that
And you raising John John and we love you for that
I guess Lisa was an Angel
God wanted her back
Damn I really miss my sister
Guess she's better where she's at
Mammy I love you
I want the world to know I love you
And every chance I get I'm a kiss you and hug you
Life wasn't easy everyday is a struggle
But like my niggaz from Chi town say
It's all bubbles

Hoping my real mo'fuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote

It's that shit right here
Took me like ten years to do

You know I cried doing this song
Man, so much pain
Mami you such a good woman
You a classy woman
I know you a private person
You don't want the world to know all your business
But I had to let them know how strong you are
I love you so much

Fat Joe,"You know one man's treasure is another man's cash
Speak on it, speak on it, listen
And you know the man that sleeps on the floor
Can't fall the *** off the bed
Pop your collar to this, it's grills mania, ya heard me?

She's my mami, she's my baby
I love you so much, you drivin' me crazy
Wanna be down? Jump in the car
Rollin' wit me, I'll make you a star

Now she was only sixteen, I had to nurture that
Give her some growth, waited 'til I touched the cat
Told she goin' have to work if she gon' get ahead
Then she drove me berserk when she gave me some ***

She told me that she learnt that from the porno flicks
I said, ?Mami, stop talkin', just suck on this ***?
I ain't say her name yet, so let's say she nothin'
Now watch me turn this nothin' into somethin', get it?

Mami, get in that kitchen, this is free base
Just cook it 'til it's hard, then cut it in eighths
Take the trip cross town to see Tru
Just get the money, don't listen, that *** think he cute

See all this money we got, we goin' shoppin'
Louis Vitton and Pucci, we get it poppin'
We hit the club on some clico s***
See the respect that you get from just bein' my ***

Look, see 'em, they sick, they wan' be in your shoes
That's the game that I hit her wit to leave her confused
I'm just usin' her for paper, she want a man
I'm 'bout to see my other *** but she understands

'Cause she's my mami, she's my baby
I love you so much, you drivin' me crazy
Wanna be down? Jump in the car
Rollin' wit me, I'll make you a star

She's my mami, she's my baby
I love you so much, you drivin' me crazy
Wanna be down? Jump in the car
Rollin' wit me, I'll make you a star

Ay yo, I met her at the Rucker Park watchin' the stars play
I knew she was a Terror, she was watchin' the Squad play
I knew she had her own, she was pushin' the bubble X
Type of eye candy that you see in a double X

Fat ***, long hair, short like Nia Long
I knew she was a victim from the start, my G is strong
And then she said she ain't felt this good in ten summers
Gave me credit cards and debit cards with pin numbers

I'm lookin' at receipts, she spent G's on the kid
I'm pushin' her V, even got keys to the crib
I needed to bag up, I bought G's to the crib
I got knocked, what she did? Put up the deed to the crib

But now she got a new gig at Chase Manhattan
Look my *** is wit ma, let's make it happen
So I burst through the door 'bout a quarter to four
And told every nosy ***, 'Get the *** on the floor'

Then she opened up the bag and started to fill 'em all
Makin' sure that she left the marked money in the drawer
Told security, ?If you move this goin' be your last night
I'm workin' with this Mack 10, you workin' with a flashlight?

I'm walkin' backwards, nobody moved, word to mother
Tryin' not look 'cause I don't want to blow her cover
That's when this *** winks and blew a kiss at me
I don't believe this *** took all them risks for me

That's why she's my mami, she's my baby
I love you so much, you drivin' me crazy
Wanna be down? Jump in the car
Rollin' wit me, I'll make you a star

She's my mami, she's my baby
I love you so much, you drivin' me crazy
Wanna be down? Jump in the car
Rollin' wit me, I'll make you a star

And his rep kinda crazy, known for slingin' them Macks

Got a baby with Sandra, he named him K-Sacks
'Cause that's where he did his first bid way back
Now this nigga Sha' got like a memory lapse
Basically you give him work and he ain't payin' back

Now with some connects, you could away with that
But he must of fucked wit the wrong Columbian cats
Now these niggaz comin' strapped and they want they money back
And you can't tell the difference 'cause some of them look black

Now Sha on the block thinkin' life's a joke
And his mama just had a dream that he might get smoked
But he don't give a fuck, he been through the best wars
Knife to knife, the yard to the mess halls

And these niggaz here got somethin' else in mind
Like a hundred shots fired at a pretzel less spine
Uh huh, you guessed it, just a matter of time

Me lo dice todo

Cuando te miras de espalda y me rozas tú
Me lo dices todo
(Oye baby, déjate llevar y Los Extraterrestres)

Me le pegue y siento como va calentándose
Me le pegue con sus movimientos cucándome
Me le pegue y ahora no quiere soltarse
Me le pegue y hasta que amanezca y voy a quedarme

Ella es un crimen organizado
Y nadie está preparado
Para aguantar lo que esa gata da

Es una fiera en celo que sabe a caramelo

Y si la cucas y tú le gusta se va

Delicada mariposa, sin duda toda una Diosa

A ella le gusta el foot
Tan cochina aguantando el sex
Le encanta el dembow duro en la disco pa' soltarse
Está buscando pretendiente que la ayude a alegrarse
Un pasa tiempo sólo con que entretenerse

No te cohíbas por orgullo si es tuya la noche
Vamos a cerrar con broche y no con el que le quiten el coche
Oye uuu, me gusta ese perfume dolche
El que tenia aquella noche couche
Y yo buscando información

Ya sé que se llama rubí
Usa ropa interior de encaje y crema de tutifruti
Productos caros pa'l ciuti
Todos los viernes pa'l beauty
O a la disco su cutí y a mover el booty

Coca Bitch!
Here is something you can't understand.
How I can just kill a man.
Shame what the mack can do, K's spit faster.
I'll make an ass of you, save the theatrics.
Watch like a quarter mil, chain like double that.
I ain't gotta to talk about the half up in the duffel bag.
Stunna my brother, Weezy Wee the syndicate.
Hundred Phantoms, hundred Maybachs, I guess we're nigga rich.
I'll yellow bottle your face in, trust me.
Look at all the shit I be talking and no one touched me.
""Pray and pray for my downfall""
BIG said it, so I made it rain till it poured.
Speak from the heart, this emotional rap.
Catch feelings when you hear me, I'm supposed to do that. Crack!
A G what the streets done made me.
And the only language I speak is ""Fuck You Pay Me!""
Bitch!

A man no fear no man, man no fear no one!
Man a real Islam, man a get down done!
A me no hear them talk, me eat in me car!
Respect a soldier, him in a middle of war!
Me I'm a Babylon gangster, holly grove monster
You no look familiar, roofers them kill ya!
Gunshots I will cut then open toolbox and drill ya!
Jump off body and let the mailman meal ya!
Me think I'm gon need the almighty one to heal ya!
And me behind the jungle with the lion and we killa!

Yup! Put it in the air nigga.
Light your lighters in the air.
This for my dead homies.
Yeah!

""Gangsta Gangsta"" that's what we yelling!
Shoot him in his head, let his bitch go and tell them!
We in the hood, getting money, we swelling
Bigger than life, you know it's the cheaper price
Bigger your stripes, you know what we doing tonight
We getting it right, we plan, then hit, then flight
We know the rules nigga, live by none
Get it by none, bitch I'll kill for my son

Yeah! Gangsters don't live that long.
That's why we gotta party everyday like Frank came home.
And it's hard for me to say that my heart ain't yearning.
To walk up in a church and believe the sermon.
But instead, I spark up and relieve the burning.
Hoping that he understands my reasons for it.
No, I ain't evil, I'm equal.
And nigga I ain't sweet, motherfucker I'm diesel!

Fat Joe,"Ready for war Joe, how you wanna blow they spot
I know these dirty cops that'll get us in if we murder some wop
Hop in your Hummer, the Punisher's ready
Meet me at Vito's with Noodles, we'll do this dude while he's slurping spaghetti
Everybody kiss the fucking floor, Joey Crack
Buck em all if they move, Noodles shoot that fucking whore
Dead in the middle of Little Italy little did we know
That we riddled some middlemen who didn't do diddly

It'll be a cold day in hell the day I take an L
Make no mistake for real I wouldn't hesitate to kill
I'm still the fat one that you love to hate
Catch you at your mother's wake, smack you then I whack you with my snub trey-eight

I rub your face off the Earth and curse your family children
Like Amityville I drill the nerves in your cavity filling
Insanity's building a pavilion in my civilian
The cannon be the anarchy that humanity's dealing
A villain without remorse, who's willing to out your boss
Forever and take all the cheddar like child support

I support Pun in anything he does, anything he loves
My brother from another mother sent from the above
A thug nigga just like me, one of the best -- might be
Even better leaving niggas kneeling on they right knee

Spike Lee couldn't paint a better picture
You small change, I'm blowing out your brains getting richer

Hit you with the Mac, smack your bitch, nigga what?
You getting stuck, my trigger finger's itchy as a fuck!

Truck jewels, cruising in the Land, pumping ""Cash Rules""
Last crew to want it caught a hundred trying to pass through

Yeah, and you don't stop!
It's still one-eight-seven on an undercover cop

Fuck the police, I squeeze first, make em eat dirt
Take em feet first through the morgue, then lodge 'em in the deep earth
The street's cursed, the first amendment's culturally biased
Supposed to supply us with rights, tonight I hold my rosary tight as I can
I'm one man against the world, just me and my girl
Black Pearl Latina mas fina but keeps it real
You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it
Peep it it's no secret, watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it

Creep with me, as I cruise in my Beemer
All the kids in the ghetto call me Don Cartagena
Kicking ass as I blast off heat, and
You never see me talk to police, though
You should know that I really don't care
Pull you by the hair, slit your throat, and I'll leave you right there
So beware it's rare that niggas want beef, Big Pun speak
And let these motherfuckers know how we run the streets

Fuck peace, I run the streets deep with no compassion
Puerto Ricans known for slashing catching niggas while they sleeping
No relaxing, keep your eyes open, sharp reflexes
Three techses in the Jeep Lexus just in case police test us
Street professors, Terror Squad, ghetto scholars
Full-a-clips mob, inflicts the fear of God when the metal hollers
Better acknowledge or get knocked down until I'm locked and shot down
Heather B. couldn't make me put my Glock Down

We lock towns like rounds in the chamber
Boogie Down major like Nine, I bust mine
Every time plus I'm the crime boss of New York
Where we taught to walk the walk, all my niggas carry chalk
And stalk, I prey like the Predator
Whoever want it, go and get it set it baby and I'mma bury ya
So remember the Squad that I'm repping
I fill a clip of my weapon and Punish niggas 'til it's armaggedeon

Yeah, and you don't stop!

He's just what you're lookin' for
The only problem is, that the man's not sure
Another guy'll give you everything

The only problem is you don't feel a thing
Well I know from experience
Nothin's ever gonna make perfect sense
Oh, one day you get what you want
But it's not what you think
Then you get what you need

Well, oh, that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches
That's the way it goes
You gotta bend when the wind blows
You live you learn
You crash and burn
It's hit or miss
And that's the way it is

Yeah they say your soul is growin'
But sometimes I feel like throwin' somethin'

Well, oh, that's the way it is
You gotta roll with the punches

Can anybody tell me where is San Tropez

Everybody beefing it's the same old day
All these mix-tape rappers now want to claim king
Everybody saying they are bringing New York back

You should feel sky plenty like pistol, fuck a phone call I barely got a whistle

Throw a banks and invite your friends

See I've been getting money since who knows when
These other niggas just all pretend
You've been bamboozled diz duzu say thugs
Love at Madison Square they givin' group hugs
Now let me take you to the streets of darkness
Where I keep your favorite M.C. underneath my armpit the bronze kid
I'm only speaking the truth

But anyway, back on the real side of things
My niggas sling cracks and wear fat diamond rings
Not only is it inside the songs that we sing (kid)
Everything is real not just a song that we sing (word up, it's real)

Give you all of my two so maybe you can three
Prodigy will forever will S-H-I-N-E (shine baby, just shine)
My shit attract millions like the moon attract the sea
How dare you ever in your life walk past me
Without acknowledging this man as G-O-D
I shot ya fagot ass

Now who the fuck you think you talking to, I pay dues I spray crews
Look I'm Joey Crack, motherfuckers be like he's bad news
Running this racket, from New York to Montego
Slaughtering people, bring a ton of keys from Puerto Rico
I'd rather be feared than loved because the fear lasts longer
These bitch ass niggas know we stronger
Than these weaklings, seeking, for respect that ain't there
Knuckleheads beware, there's mad tension in the air
Tommy guns for fun, shotties for block parties
While fresh lead heats up your insides like a fifth of Bacardi
Call the ambulance, this man's wet
Bullets cut him down from the root up just like a Gillette
Razor, which I keep hidden in my oral
Ready to spatter, at any ad out, that wants to quarrel
These feds want me for some tax evasion
Now that the fact that somebody's getting lucci that's not Caucasian
Bullets be blazing through these streets filled with torture (what the deal pop)
Joey Crack, a.k.a. Kaiser Ceaser

Thug niggas give they minks to chinks
To' down we sip drinks rockin minks, 
Flashing rings and things (what the deal)
Fronting hardcore deep inside the Jeep, macking
Doing my thing fly nigga you a Scarface king
Bitches grab ya ta-ta's, get them niggas for they cheddar
Fuck it, Gucci sweaters and Armani leathers
Flossing rocks like the size of Fort Knox
Four carats, the ice rocks, pussy banging 
Like Versace locs pops (what the deal)
Want ta the creep, on the light raw ass cheeks
I'm sexing raw dog without protection, disease infested
Italiano got the Lucciano
I gets down fucking with Brown Fox extra keys to the drop
Boo I'm Jingling Baby, I got crazy Dominicans who pay me
To lay low, I play slow
Roll with the Firm, Mafiaso crime king pin
It all real nigga what tha deal
I shot ya!

What the fuck? I thought I conquered the whole world
Crushed Moe Dee, Hammer, and Ice-T's girl
But still, niggas want to instigate shit
I'll battle any nigga in tha rap game quick
Name the spot, I make it hot for ya bitches
Female rappers too, I don't give a fuck boo
Word, I'm here to crush all my peers
Rhymes of the month in The Source for twenty years
Niggas scared, I'm detrimental to your mental state
I use my presidential Rolex to be debate
Niggas fight, glock cocked ya temple gets fucked
MC's, that fuck with LL they gets bucked
That's real, what's up with that I Shot Ya deal?
Light shit, niggas slip now how the bullet feel?
New York appeal, in L.A. they gang bang
But if you touch a mic your motherfucking ass hang
That's facts, niggaz don't receive no type of slack
Cause if they do, they ass is always running back
Not this time, but next time I'ma name names

Fat Joe,"You know
What you gotta understand is that it's a drug
that affects the brain chemistry of the user
and it causes things like paranoia, euphoria, insomnia, loss of appetite
and this really insatiable craving for more cocaine
People who smoke crack, they get this immediate
and intense release of dopamin in the brain
and once those dopamin levels plummet after just a few minutes
the smoker feels compelled to take another hit
just to ease the feelings of depression and sadness

chronicling a deadly epidemic sweeping the nation

Or even in the daylight, even though it ain't right

I'm better than a protein shake to lose weight

Something like dirty Diana, body dope as heron

It's too strong, you said the drive stick

Your body shivers and troubles with each and every stroke

Double cup with ice, man, I think she got some drink from me
Ever since I came round
She say she feel wrong, 'cause her boyfriend listen to me

Entre las sombras de la gran ciudad
Calor de hombre me perseguía

Me lo decía con una canción

Tranquila el no lo sabe mi vida
Es solo una noche prohibida
Nadie más se enterará
Tranquila baila conmigo sin prisa
Date una noche prohibida
Mañana lo olvidarás

No me sorprende lo presentía
Tarde o temprano sucedería

No preguntaba, el lo sabia
Podría ver cuanto lo quería

When you rollin with the don
Got the stars on the roof

Uh, I let her know off the bat
I'm used to getting passed first base thats facts
I'm used to playin' tag on the sands of Anguilla

Tranquila tu muévete tranquila

I don't give a fuc* about your faults or mishappens nigga 
We from the Bronx, New York, shit happens 
Kids clappin, love to spark the place 
Half the niggaz in the squad got a scar on their face 
It's a cold world and this is ice 
Half a mill for the charm, nigga this is life 
Got the Phantom in front of the buildin, Trinity Ave 
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad 
As a young'n - was too much to cope with 
Why you think ? mu'fuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit Shoulda been called Armed Robbery 
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny 
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle 
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was 'gon bubble 
Came out the gate on some Flow Joe shit 
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo kid! 

[Chorus: Fat Joe] 
Said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants 
And do the rockaway, 
now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back 
I said my niggaz don't dance we just pull up our pants 
And do the rockaway,

My arms stay breezy, the Don stay fizzi 
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-40-fizzive 
And I just bought a bike so I can ride till I die 
With a matchin jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion 
My niggaz in the club, but you know they not dancin 
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance with boogies 
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies 
Listen we don't pay admission and the bouncers don't check us 
And we - walk around the metal detectors 
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section 
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it 
Said he - liked my necklace, started relaxin 
Now that's what the fuc* I call a chain reaction 
See ""Money Ain't a Thing"" nigga, we still the same niggaz 
Flows just changed now we bout to change the game nigga

Now we living better now, Coogi sweater now 
And that G4 can fly through any weather now 
See, niggaz get tight when you worth some millions 
This is why I sport the chinchilla to hurt they feelings 
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit 
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit 
If Five-o boy come, then they'd proudly squeal 
Cause half these rappers they Blow like Derek Pharrell 
If you cross the line, damn right I'm 'gon hurt ya 
These faggot niggaz even made gang signs commercial 
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin it up 
B2K crip walkin like that's what's up! 
Kay keep tellin me to speak about the Rucker

Fat Joe,"I know it's been a while since you heard it like this
The boy can't miss, Rolex on the wrist
Bezel on brisk, 'bout time the real returned, we still exist
Now you weirdos return to when you wasn't risk
Tight jeans for boys wasn't popular
Unless you was in the boy's, man, stop it, bruh
Too much fashion rats sayin' this and that
No clothes in facts, everybody's in the trap
But they ain't never sold no drugs, for really though
'Cause they was dead broke in they first video
YouTube don't lie, sort it like numbers
I been gettin' money for the past eight summers
Bought a Benz all cash, ho picked up a Hummer
And to think, we wasn't even twenty-oner
It's not a word, now you know how I feel when these absurd
Rappers talk about things that never occurred
Damn it, the nerve, you ain't never brandished a bird
Or guns on your enemies and gave them what they deserve
Let a nigga try me, they die, B
Ain't nothin' sweet, I be on it like diabetes
Givin' shots, gave in, was givin' props
Sometimes I had to take them in the form of blocks
Properly, buy and sell like Monopoly
No top hat, top back and she toppin' me
She bein' a vixen, all-star attender
Cake like my birthday, that's in November
23, I'm a Sage, I'm a swerve
Whole lot of horsepower, parkin' on the curb
Hoes want to floss out a coupe wit' a bird
Cold like the Porsche power, meetin' every word
I do this, might change my name to Brutus
Cut down the beef, now the money flow fluid

Bunch of Louis luggage, still your boy never trip
Gettin' chips, so it's only right I come through all dipped
Oppies get the lip and get a whole entire clip
Don't start nothin' and it won't be no shit
I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it
I'm 'bout it, and I have no limit when I give it like, 'Uhh'

We made it, yeah, motherfuckers, we made it
I can't believe this shit
A hundred on the wrist, two hundred on the neck
Yo, five on the whip, three milli up in escrow
I been flippin' bricks since Nas was called Esco
(All eyez on me) like a nigga on Death Row
How to ring shots at niggas, the Bronx Lebanon
Draped in the bias, popped the seeds from Lebanon
Joe been a don, shit is realer than you think
Still ain't seen a nigga dive in a pool in a mink
Fuck you done to that shit? That ain't really chinchilla
This is Joey Crack shit, ain't a nigga been realer?
And I'm 'bout it, 'bout it everyday, three burners
Dare touch the powder, or you gon' see murder
Ever had a bitch bustin' off from givin' head?
Woke up in the Ritz, ten bitches in the bed
Niggas rockin' Jordans, but you ain't never meet the brother
You ain't that important, (shit, I still got his beeper number)
Medellin cartel, never leave a witness
Everythin' must go like you're goin' out of business
Trips to Dubai, bedrooms on the first class
Showers in the sky, reminiscenin' on my first pack
Far as projects, tryin' to get it all off
You can get it hard white, or you can get it all soft, it's cold

Bunch of Louis luggage, still your boy never trip
Gettin' chips, so it's only right I come through all dipped
Oppies get the lip and get a whole entire clip
Don't start nothin' and it won't be no shit

Der Einzige, der beim Kampf mit Fäusten antritt
Und verlier' ich mein Gesicht, dann nur per Säureangriff
Schwesta S in FFM auf Alk und Beyda
Der einzige Mann, der sie anfasst ein Altenpfleger
Viele wollen Fuß in dieser Szene fassen
Ich mache sie mit Kugeln kalt wie bei Schneeballschlachten
Farid trägt 'ne Waffe, du trägst Southpole, du Bitch
Der erste deutsche Rapper mit eigenem Auto im Clip
Trifft deine Freundin Backstage
Und es ist wie das Leben von David Bowie, es endet mit 69
An alle, die im Herzen hofften, dass ich stürze
Wenn ihr kein' Respekt habt, solltet ihr mich fürchten
Ich dreh' mehrere Dinger, Rapper heben den Finger
Bin kein Marsmensch, doch du siehst mich mit Venus-Gesichtern

Kriegen sie ein Meet-and-greet im arabischen Café
Wenn ich deine Schulter mit der Tec-9 streife
Zeigst du Heimweh wie Tupac beim Westside-Zeichen (Westside)
Deutsche Rapper machen nichts außer Minus
Mehr Cash auf der Bank als du Klicks auf dei'm Video
Ich hau' Picos in Ohnmacht
Und mein Rap spricht Jungs von der Strasse an wie in Malle Discopromoter
Mittlerweile interessieren deine Alben kein' Menschen
Anstatt in Alben solltest du dich in 'nen Galgen reinhängen

Another nigga gotta die, won't be the first (Nah)
Won't be the last, all we see is cash (Yeah)
Your real story don't match what you rappin' 'bout (Liar)
So keep the movies in, stop actin' out
And I ain't talking 'bout no watch or no cars neither
Everything will get copped at Allah's leisure
Was a crack monster, I had that hard fever
Switch from the bald head to the dark Caesar
Used to be the capsules, now they love the plastics
I ain't tryna get caught up in this thug-rap shit (Never)
Rather be bumper to bumper in drug traffic
Cash on deck whenever the plug ask it
You don't sweat the small things, they become drastic
Next thing is cremation or a casket
Fuck fallin' back, I need all of that
I need my name in the cocaine almanac (Jada)
Real dope boy put me in the hall of smack
Went to job interviews, they ain't call us back
Either way I ain't never evil
Why you think the streets love me? I ain't never leave 'em
My heart stops, but the words are forever breathing
You hatin' 'cause we the best, find a better reason

First thing first don't ever play yourself (Ever)
Oh another thing, I ain't ever play myself (Never)
Even when they all changed up, I stayed myself (It's me)
Did what worked for me, then bossed up and paid myself
See I'm showin' up a K off, gain a Rollie, a day off
Still got that work, I don't know about no layoffs
Team still ballin' so I guess we in the playoffs (Swish)
Team full of baddies, all my bitches in a slayoff
See we be in the party wasted, no part of fake shit
Nothin' but love 'round me, Cartier bracelets
I feel like Frank White walkin' into Arty Clay shit
You niggas got fat while everybody starved
My city don't sleep, I ain't ever noddin' off

And some day soon we'll all be gone

But remember the bite of those November nights when we rode out
To fight for the light of our lives to be turned out
Sweat and perfume and new bread as the moon faded
Stumbling home spilling out stories we wouldn't forget in a hurry
But then we weren't in a hurry
Our faces are mirrors lines and scars that we've earned
All the classes we missed all the lessons we learned
All the roads that we took that took us apart
Now you're sitting there saying, ""Let's go back to the start.""
And he says, ""Lose that luggagge let it all go

Let's climb into my car
Drive away in my car.""

And my ship finally came in
I was flying head in the clouds
And you were back in Providence
I crawled out of my ark of doubt
Stepped up to claim my prize
A fingerprint in the mantelpiece paint
A letter of just three lines
I played hard I played hard to get
And hard to understand
And every night was a fight to the death
And every day was planned
Where were you when I finally knew
The truth that you'd always known
No matter how far you travel away
You always end up home
Where was this place where I finally fell to grace
And found you'd faded out
Now all the rain that's fallen on me
The sun that's worn me down
But I'm still walking in this same old pair of shoes
I'm walking on the same ground
Oh yes I know nobody chooses anybody
And no one means to lie

Walk upon England's mountain green

Shine forth upon our clouded hills?

Among those dark Satanic Mills?

Bring me my Arrows of desire
Bring me my Spear: O Clouds unfold!
Bring me my Chariot of fire!

Are you living your teens in a shed?
Is growing up giving you the bends?
My little sunshine getting jealous
Of the moonbeams feeling gloomy
In your bed?
Left your friends
Where the pavement ends
Little broken bones begins
But can you hear me now?

There's glitter falling
And a banner that says
Welcome to Hell
Make yourself at home
Leave behind free will
Can you feel me now?

You know I can't feel this pain in my heart
Because it's honestly been falling apart
Maybe I'm too blind to see
Why trouble finds me
But if it's here I'm gonna see where it leads
Call me Mr. Lonely

You can call me anything
Call me if you know me
You can call me King
I don't know if you think below me
You can call me anything
Call me if you know me
You can call me King
While they're hanging out below me
You can call me King
I don't think you wanna know me
Don't call me
Call me Mr. Lonely

The stars are falling
And I bet they got some stories to tell
Been not long ago
When I knew you well
Listen for a change
Can you hear it now?

You know I can't feel this pain in my heart
Because it's honestly been falling apart
Maybe I'm too blind to see
How trouble finds me
Well if it's here I'm gonna see where it leads
Call me Mr. Lonely
 
You can call me anything
Call me if you know me
You can call me King
I don't know if you think below me
You can call me anything
Call me if you know me
You can call me King
While they're hanging out below me
You can call me King
I don't think you wanna know me
Don't call me King
Call me Mr. Lonely

Whisper our dreams to the dark (hello?)
You know that song in your head
The bitter past sleeps
And the pity on believers
And we're lookin' for the way
Under there
Beautiful things
Where the pavement ends
Little broken bones begin
But can you hear me now?

Broken promises
Alcohol anonymous
Inducted in the hall of fame for vomitin'
I've puked round the world
I'm the Duke of Hurl
I used to have a girl
But she wasn't happy
She left me naturally
She left with Natalie
They left in the back of a taxi
They was laughin' at me
So I lit the club
Bottles up, poppin' shit
False sense of happiness
Perhaps I'll take what I get
I guess it's better than nothing, right?
At least I got this blunt to light
I'm doin' what I want tonight
Tomorrow I might fuck my life
Laugh once, cry twice
I'm bad at takin' good advice

N****z betta see a n***a roll
Shorts down and I'm rollin' on 84's

Chorus (Fat Pat)
Swang-swang and I swang and I swang to the left
Pop-Pop my trunk yep, yep, yep, yep (x4)

Verse 1 (Trae)
I'ma swang I'm a swanger slab lean to the left
Pop my trunk and show what I'm about so Houston, Texas gotta be felt
I'm a vet so it's automatic when I be swingin' my wide frame
4-4's to 24's I'm subject to glide man
Like a pimp without the numbers still so fly when I slide man
Plus I'm lethal fully loaded ain't no takin' my ride man
We gangsta 
And it ain't too much you can do to stop us
Don't try to knock us 'cause these diamonds got boppas try'na jock us
We the best and what we gon' be and these haters know it
So haters hate us to death and I know 'cause these haters show it
I only ride alone so they can picture me rollin' 
And for them jackers thinkin' fly just picture what I be holdin'
Them hollow points'll make you picture just how fast they'll be foldin'
A few of them'll have you leakin' 'til you dead or you swollen
But still I ride like the law
Floatin' above everything
I'm Screwed Up Click until it's over n***a fresh off the chain
Beat the slang

Chorus (Fat Pat)

Verse 2 (Big Hawk)
I'ma swang and I swang and I swang to the left
Pop my trunk for Fat Pat's death
I would give my last breath if I could bring you back
Bring Screw back
Matter fact bring the whole crew back
Only God can do that so I'ma leave it alone
Movin' on
Groovin' to this soothin' song
I'm cruisin' along
Still got a Screw tape on
Still in the zone
Wishin' Cory Blunt was home
Ridin' on chrome
Bangin' with my bub lights on
Ridin' home
South east of the astrodome
I'm Fat Pat's clone
It's J go see Harry's own
His heartbeat pumps through my flesh and bone
Flippin' with Trae
Mobbin' down MLK
He's blue up with grey
On tint on southern deuce today
It's Dub K
Chiefin' on some lovely
And we on the boulevard actin' ugly
We gon'

Chorus (Fat Pat)

Verse 3 (Trae)
ABN is my type of nature my understanding is nothin'
Stacks in the back of a 'Lac on this glass you finna see me struttin'
Cuttin' corners on a daily basis
Move fast like Kanye West samples when I be chasin' faces
I'm known to tip like a waiter when I be leaned to the left
I brung the city through the dark with a fifth of boppers and belts
I'm ABN the Impala 67 Chevy be spinnin'
Invisible set displayed everytime they catchin' me grinnin'
Off in they face it ain't too much that they can do to a G
But try to hate me
Every second due to the fact who I be
And it don't bother me
'cause I still be toppin' my game
Just don't come off the side of my range I might be leavin' a stain
Whether my slab or beam 
N****z gon' respect that we gangsta
T-Shirt and Dickies plus the kicks that I lace up for you wankstas
Everyday is still the same
I be so loud when I bang
And thanks to Screw and P-A-T we got 'em diggin' our slang huh

Verse 4 (Pimp C)
I'm a Screwed Up affiliator strictly rollin' red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn heads
I've been watched by parole, task force, and by the feds
'cause they know I got 'em for 10 and they know the game ain't dead
It's too late
I'm deep up in it ain't nuthin' about me scary
Chiefin' in the club try'na find me somethin' hairy
Dippin' at the bar 
Smokin' on the stokey
Since I came home from the pen seems like everybody know me
You got lots of friends when you up and when you ballin'
Just like Pookey all the haters started callin'
They see the diamonds and the Bentley and the candy thing
They know I'm mob stompin' Texas they know that I'm rollin' with Jane
They know it's UGK for life and that I'm down with Bun
They know we grindin' bitch'll hitcha with another one
It's UGK records right now we need distribution
Since Laura Rebel free the pimp is goin' down in Houston

Fat Pat,"My life
My life, really feelin hard times

Lookin' out my window, holdin' my weapon like Malcolm X and
And it seems I'm over-stressin', feelin' like hatin' is your profession
And I know a couple Texans that got killed for over-reppin'
So I never be oversteppin' boundaries bounded to my weapon
When they ask me how I'm doin, I just tell 'em ""I'm doin' super""
I got a date with Destiny, allow me to introduce ya
Her little sister Fate told me I'm gon' be the future
And legacy's everything to a Martin Luther King Koopa
This recession is so pathetic, got me feelin' like I'm athletic
And success tryna get away from me and I ain't tryna let it
When they told that Pimp was gone, my reply was ""I don't get it""
And I'm still havin trouble believin' it happened the way they said it
Had to cut some partners off, swear to y'all it ain't my fault
I've been grown since I was seven and I was born to be a boss
But I know there's a bunch of haters tryna see me take a loss
So I be sleepin' with one eye open and put cameras in my vault
I've been thinkin' and gettin' deep and they tryna tell I been preachin'
But I know that they can't see how much of the world that I be reachin'
So stop reachin, stop leachin, I'm a fade 'em out like bleach and
In the spots where they can't get out to is the spots I visit frequent
Europe to UK and Germany, travellin' currently
Made so much in millions that I could cash out in eternity
Accustomed to hittin' customs with that duffle full of currency
When God created hustle, looked at the world and he inserted me, Koopa

[Chorus: x4]
I'm just livin' my life, so cold
In the streets so I'm takin' it slow

Uh, yeah
I'll tell you my story, I only speak the truth homie

It a terrible situation, throwed on the curb within the hands of time
But since I'm blistery breathing I guess a nigga livin' fine
I live a life that's filled with dramatistic people cryin'
And since the hood depend on me, they'll never lose a hand of mine (I gotcha)
I'm paralysis when it come to the good times, I'm used to the pain
Feelin' like a bum under the bridge, I'm so used to the rain
Anything I do is from the heart so it reflect my name
Forgive me for my sins father, I feel like I'm goin' insane
Media criticizing me for checking niggas, fuck it, oh well
I just wasn't raised a little pussy disrespected nigga
I'm tryna live on my own by the ways of a gangster
So every time I leave out I pray so I'm prayin' for a gangster
It's bad enough the world we livin in all about money
Since we runnin' out I choose to believe it ain't nothin funny
I've been stabbed in my back so much I deal with it
I'm tryna kick it with my life before heaven come chill with it

[Chorus: x4]

Last year was a hard one but life goes on
Thinkin' bout my nigga Pimp while I write this song
And the list goes on, all my niggas is gone
I'm tired of hearin' bad news, scared to pick up my phone
Got a call, my nigga Eddy died from Acres home
Just seen him at my video shoot, now that shit wrong
Kelvo, Arborea, even my girl Shantz
I just heard word she got stabbed to death today
Dear Lord, I pray that you take away the pain
From their family and their friends, please help us change
Still warm my niggas sleep dog, stessle and stank
My girl Dee Dee, they got me pourin' out my drank
It's fucked up, all my friends is dead or in the pen
Seem like soon as your life begin it's beginning to end
I'm frustrated, but you gotta smile, your time is dated
You never know when showin' your love might be related, ha ha

Fat Pat,"Don't come around my way, cause I don't need a
'Nother fat weather friend, with a trick up his sleeve
Acting like you really my nigga, but he after my cheese
Y'all niggaz get me congested, move around and let me breathe
I remember when you niggaz, ain't want me to hit the weed
Now that I'm rapping, you see me and tell me to hit the weed
Thinking you can get a VIP pass, and get in free
But Joseph McVey, is enough company for me
Wanna kick it with me, cause I kick it with the high class
Y'all didn't wanna kick it, when I was down on my ass
In my cordoroy britches, y'all was in Louis Vatone
Laughing and pointing at a nigga, trying to ruin my fun
For using the millennium, or money by the ton
You niggaz ain't help me get it, I did it with no one
Fuck showing love back, I ain't showing none (y'all niggaz don't have to)
Come to none of my shows, or buy none of my tapes
'Cause who the hell should I support, I'ma still be straight
The less niggaz around me, the better I can concentrate
When I came face straight, or open up my chest plate
It could be ya death date, get beside yourself
We ain't cool, I think you better rewind yourself
Before a cemetery, be where you can find yourself
So beat your feet, and let the do' close behind yourself
I don't need no friend, I don't need no broad
Only thing I need, is the help of the good Lord
Trying to kick it, but motherfuckers sing to hard
'Cause I'ma be keeping it real, they gon be keeping it fraud
A hundred and fifty-two percent, are real with me
So instead of keeping my niggaz, get the steel with me
I can do bad one deep, so I chill with heat (fuck y'all niggaz)

I don't need no help my nigga, I can do bad on my own
And I don't need no company lil' mama, stop ringing my cellular phone
When I be down and out, nobody wanna come and kick it
I'm a nobody, until I can shine
So when my money is long, I don't need nobody to visit
Leave me lonely, like you did last time

I'm a asshole, and I ain't trying to be rude
But I don't really give a damn, about none of y'all
You use to hate a nigga tough, from way back in the day
First off, fuck each and every one of y'all
I be a loner on my own, alone hang with my chrome
These motherfuckers play, life so fraud
I peep game, to the T
'Cause I don't want nobody, to catch a nigga slipping on the Boulevard
And on the other hand, just to make matters worse
I feel, they want me headed to the grave
And I ain't ready to leave, I got my back planted against the wall
With a nine, about to misbehave
Same old shit, with a friend or a foe
Pack your shit, and get the fuck out the do'
Ain't no way, you hoes finna be a part of my life
A.B.N, is all that I know
You can try what you wanna, but I ain't gon fail
Look at me now, and all the shit that I sell
I'ma beat a nigga trunk off, coast to coast
And everybody who doubt that, can go to hell
Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong
And I don't give a fuck, cause I'm in my zone
All that hate you got, it only make a nigga strong
So I like how it feel, when I'm left all alone

I don't need no help my nigga, I can do bad on my own
And I don't need no company lil' mama, stop ringing my cellular phone
When I be down and out, nobody wanna come and kick it
I'm a nobody, until I can shine
So when my money is long, I don't need nobody to visit
Leave me lonely, like you did last time

You must of thought I forgot, when I was stuck on the block
And I was broke, everybody laughed a lot
And now the tables have turned, you niggaz fraud
And you know see Trae, with his foot up on the gas a lot
'Cause I don't trust you niggaz
Give me fifty feet, 'fore I rush you niggaz
Move it around, cause I don't fuck with you niggaz
To tell the truth, I'm allergic to you niggaz
Asshole for life, until a nigga fly
Nigga don't stop, better go on pass by
And hoes, don't call my cellular phone
The only thing, that y'all know how to do is lie

Why y'all niggaz wanna rob wanna steal, that ain't real
How the fuck I'ma kick it with you, you ain't gon get me killed
I done seen a lot of blood, on the battlefield
Even though I'm tired, I be climbing up the ladder still
Ain't nobody words gon hurt me, even if they dessert me
I'ma still be grubbing, and drink a drink when I'm thirsty
Just to be in my position, motherfuckers ain't worthy
So they feminine conversations, don't even disturb me
I'm a gangsta, don't need another nigga to grade me
If I'm in trouble, don't need nobody to save me
Steady losing composure, like my kon folk Trae be
I'ma handle my bidness, ain't nobody else made me

I don't need no help my nigga, I can do bad on my own
And I don't need no company lil' mama, stop ringing my cellular phone
When I be down and out, nobody wanna come and kick it
I'm a nobody, until I can shine
So when my money is long, I don't need nobody to visit
Leave me lonely, like you did last time

I don't need no help my nigga, I can do bad on my own
And I don't need no company lil' mama, stop ringing my cellular phone

Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby

March 11, 1981
My momma gave birth to a hell raising heavenly son
And my daddy was a fool addicted to brown
So he wasn't ever around, but my momma held me down

When me and big sister had nothing to eat
My momma gave up her last trying to make ends meet
She was a school teacher, working to provide for her fam'
Struggling in AA, to submit to gods plan

Them long twelve's steps of hardway are all on your own
No family, few friends, my momma was all alone
She did it for her children, struggling to make a living
And some how we still had food on thanksgiving

When I can barely talk momma taught me to pray
And right then I knew that we'd have a better life some day
She still give up her last just to see me smile
That's the definition of love for you child, I love my momma

[Chorus]

My momma was my role model, I had no father figure
Just a bunch of pipe dreams of being richer
But as times got tougher my life just got rougher
It hurts so bad to see me watch my momma suffer

Its so hard to cope when you so dead broke
So momma used to make me memorize the song quotes
In the middle of a session momma gave god praise
I knew what it meant to struggle at such an early age

Remember them days she barely earned minimum wage
But made sure I had new cloths to start the seventh grade
She met my step father, and walked down the aisle
I praised he sent somebody that would make my momma smile

He raised me as his own, he taught me to be a man
Adopted me and Anne, and gave momma a hand
I just love to see that beautiful smile on momma face
My momma could never be replaced, I love my momma

[Chorus]

20 years of struggling, done came to a close
No more old, torn up, and hand me down cloths
She deserve the best, and never nothing less
No stress, give my momma that Gucci dress

The times were hard but we done made it out the rain
The storm was severe but we overcame the hurricane
Them rainy days seem to last so long
When them times got hard my momma told me be strong

My number 1 supporter ever since day one
And still till this day momma would die for her son
No more slumz, all them rainy days are done
No a days we taking trips to Disney world just for fun

I put you in a Benz take you out that nova
Its been a long rough road, but that bumpy rides over
You raise me from a baby, my number 1 lady
And until the day I'm in my grave, ima stay mommas baby

Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home

Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude

Sexy and real slow

Fat Tulips,"Look at me with starry eyes
In the second scene the hero dies
Prove you're not invincible
Forget the basic principal
Your carry on can make my day
Experience the hands on way
What do you think you're doing now
It's obvious you don't know how

Cut me, cut me
Cut me with your chainsaw
Cut me, cut me
Cut me with your chainsaw
Why do I still love you
When you broke my heart in two?

Tearing me limb from limb
I'm weakening for your sin
Tiring of your attitude
Not gonna stand here being used
I'm sending you away
Going to find a new game to play
I'm rejoining the human race
But first I'm going to smash your face

Why should I care if we're together?
Why should I care for you at all?
I think I'm leaving you for better things
I think I'm leaving Mr. Small",Chainsaw,1994
Fat Tulips,"While you're thinking it over
Spare a thought for me
Little boys make so much noise
About nothing, naturally!
I try to cling to your love, but I know
I'm always letting go

It's just like sand-grains slipping through my hands
I tried to work it out
But I'll never understand
And just when I think ""At last I've caught hold!""
I lose my grip and let go

There's a light in the distance beaming down at me
Lights up things I'm looking for
But I'm too blind to see
I'll return all the love that I stole

I'm always letting go
I'm always letting go
I'm always letting go",Letting Go,1994

All this drinking going catch up
And all this smoking going catch up
But some niggas just really don't give a fuck
But some niggas just really don't give a fuck
And all this drinking going catch up
And all this smoking going catch up
But some bitches just really don't give a fuck
But some bitches just really don't give a fuck

Now let me be quite Frank
Cause I'm that crazy nigga Luda
Always got a drink
And I'm steady smoking buddah
I do the
Evil that'll bend you when I get you
I'ma sit you down
Then take it to the mental and essential and clown
Every chance I get
Bitch I'm hit
Not by no bullet or no pellet 
But the smoke from the can a beer shit
I might just be too high
Then I put my middle finger up when I'm ridin' by
And say hi to plenty liquors and I know it's a sin
And if ya tell me stop drinking I'll just do it again
So when I get old I'ma rock, roll, shake, and shiver
With some blacked out lungs and a fucked up liver

[Chorus]

Hey yo I do this for bluntheads and whinos 
Steward Ave. Homes
Niggas from G-Ro committed to slanging blow
Doublin' dough 24-7
Fuck po-po's I'm blowin' dro out the Ac Legend
Running wit 2 strike felons
And I pack 4-4's like Hank Aaron
Then'll smoke a L
Bust shells
And dare ya to tell
Walk up in the club
Pretty thug
Fucked up off head shots
Sippin' Courvousier watchin' hoes drop it like it's hot
Shaking tits and twats
Placing big face 20's and cock
Loading clips and glocks
Knowing we got the haters hot
The ballin' don't stop
Just drop more G's on drink and drugs
Live it up young nigga cause it's gon' catch up

[Chorus]

Now wit the help of Hen and Coke
I grab my pen and pad and wrote
Something that I knew was dope
And represent for my kinfolk
Pimp a hoe until she broke
Wit mo lines than chopped coke
Hey yo it's 2-0 I'm Eastside's King
But I'm a writer with a twist of Amaretto
My shit even come out better
Grab a blunt put it together
What a nigga really need
Run up in the club and blow a motherfucker til he
bleed
Could it be an Icehouse put his lights out
Or the club get closed out
If it's hoes out I show out
Call Tyheed get Dro'd out
There's no doubt I love my life
Love the light
Love to write
Love the mic
So take a drag
Grab a bag and match up
Hennessey and bad weed
Believe me it catch up

Fat Wilson,"[Chorus: x2]
I hate it when it's too many niggas, not enough hoes
Too many rookies, not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all y'all can suck my dick, bitch!

I got a whip like Miracle Ludacris lyrical FOOL
We dirty south shut yo' mouth we rock jewels
No holds barred but obey the block rules
Cock tools put chlorine in record pools
Are there anyone like ya (Hell no!)
I treat humans like students (Fail y'all)
So turn ya books to page 69 and start sucking
When Organized drop the tracks then start ducking
When Ludacris get in the bed start fucking
You wanna be starting something Get out the booth 
And lemme tell y'all the truth, we kick down do's
Save all the H20 for front rows
Live in the bank and watch for stank hoes
Stay chromed out and that's on or off road
If you know what I mean proceed to stay clean
Light skinded nigga turn red but get green
Inhale some of that 'dro but blow steam
Love a combination big ass and tight jeans

[Chorus]

Boy you done lost yo' mind
No I've lost my virginity
And I shot click like that fool shot Kennedy
What's the remedy Hennessey Coke
If you cut all your money you'd still be half broke
Ashes to ashes smoke or get smoked
We come by the masses you come and get choked
If you take me for a fool I'll take you for a joke
Tired of fast food so they cooked up dope
So now we eating lobster shrimp and things
And watch for impostors that's been in the game
We invented the game and y'all just got hip
(Man what's that smell) Probably your upper lip!
Cause I love to walk around like my shit don't stank
Even if it's cigars and that purple color dank
Chilling in the gut with no trace of Tom Hanks
So put this in yo' jaw like wieners and beef franks

[Chorus]

I put too much sugar in my Kool Aid
And party like a kid wit a high top fade
Arrive to a show and I like to get paid
Arrive to a hoe and I like to get laid
Ride up on my back like rugs and floormats
I'm on the right page but what's my format
I wave to the ocean cause I'm where shores at
And women go nuts just like my bozack
Did you know that?  Man I'm the gift of change
Electric stoves so give me the keys to the Range
Shagadelic, beautiful but strange
Went to Magic City saw Nikki and Blue Flames
Rearrange, same broad different night
Pass the E&J and let a nigga get right
The bomb threaten dude that's on yo same flight
The highlight's that I live a high ass life

Erst sind wir Feuer und Flamme, dann sind wir Asche und Staub
Klammern verzweifelt am Papier fest doch die Glut frisst uns auf
Ein kleiner Funkel wird zum Feuer, heiß wie eintausend Grad
Verbrennt Benzin, verbrennt dein Kiez, verbrennt dein Lean, verbrennt deinen Arsch
Es regnet Asche und wir laufen durch den mattschwarzen Rauch
Klammern verzweifelt am Papier fest doch die Glut frisst uns auf
Ein kleiner Funkel wird zum Feuer, heiß wie eintausend Grad
Verbrennt deine Nikes, verbrennt deinen Hype, verbrennt deine Likes, verbrennt deinen Arsch

Es begann mit uns im Dunkeln damit mein' ich ganz unten
Da wo die Augen der Dämonen beim Mondschein funkeln
Die Taschen höher die Akten voll
Doch Familie ist, wo die Jungs sind
Damit die Ablenkung stimmt
Dreh den Beat auf und lass pumpen
Wird er rausgehen in den Dschungel
Schon als Kind dann als Junge
Doch raucht jetzt als Mann stillt nur Papier den großen Hunger
Aber wenn die Hände glühen wie Feuer, dann verbrennt da jeder Schein
Die Kohle kommt viel zu schwer, aber geht viel zu leicht
And Handgelenken Tic Tac Toe in rosé gold und weiß
Und der Diamant und nicht der Charakter sind dir noch lupenrein
Ich nehme das Blutgeld von dem Business, kauf' meinen Brüdern neue Nikes 
Und das Geld verbrennt nur langsam auch wenn man es teilt (ja)

Erst sind wir Feuer und Flamme, dann sind wir Asche und Staub
Klammern verzweifelt am Papier fest doch die Glut frisst uns auf
Ein kleiner Funkel wird zum Feuer, heiß wie eintausend Grad
Verbrennt Benzin, verbrennt dein Kiez, verbrennt dein Lean, verbrennt deinen Arsch
Es regnet Asche und wir laufen durch den mattschwarzen Rauch
Klammern verzweifelt am Papier fest doch die Glut frisst uns auf
Ein kleiner Funkel wird zum Feuer, heiß wie eintausend Grad
Verbrennt deine Nikes, verbrennt deinen Hype, verbrennt deine Likes, verbrennt deinen Arsch

Wenn du mit dem Feuer spielen willst, dann verbrennst du dich Junge, das ist sicher
So wie das „Amen“ in der Kirche oder dass dein Leben enden wird, Junge
Brüder stechen sich wie 'ne Ghettobitch, Junge 
Sind zusammen damals aufgewachsen, ist ein Zeichen dass die Welt am enden ist, Junge
Literweise Blut klebt auf den Batzen, hingen nächtelang, labbern von Straßen, ja
Ab Tag eins war unser Name laut
Die Vergangenheit hinterlässt Spuren wie vernarbte Haut
Sie verbrennen Scheine für Rolex Uhren, aber können sich keine Zeit kaufen
Du kannst bleiben, kannst hier einkaufen 
Aber eintausend Euros reichen aus und ein Verrückter erschießt dich über einen Haufen
Miese Junkies gehen sicher Stein kaufen und verbrennen ihren Existenz 
Und Frauen gehen raus ihr Fleisch verkaufen für die AMGs (?)
Ich dreh' die Runden, seh' die Kunden
Lassen die, die tief im Schnee verschwunden sind 
Und jeder ist an eine (?) gebunden kurz bevor er so tief in dem Höllensumpf versinkt

Erst sind wir Feuer und Flamme, dann sind wir Asche und Staub
Klammern verzweifelt am Papier fest doch die Glut frisst uns auf
Ein kleiner Funkel wird zum Feuer, heiß wie eintausend Grad
Verbrennt Benzin, verbrennt dein Kiez, verbrennt dein Lean, verbrennt deinen Arsch
Es regnet Asche und wir laufen durch den mattschwarzen Rauch
Klammern verzweifelt am Papier fest doch die Glut frisst uns auf
Ein kleiner Funkel wird zum Feuer, heiß wie eintausend Grad

So viel hier draußen, was du nicht siehst
Ich reiß' deine Augen auf und du ziehst
Einen tiefen Atemzug aus meiner Stadt
Jeder macht, was er kann oder muss, um zu überleben
Aber dieser Druck, der sich aufbaut, Hass, der sich aufstaut
Kennt leider kein Ventil
Viele von ihn'n schwimmen mit der Fackel in der Hand
Durch die Dunkelheit der Nacht in 'nem See aus Benzin
Betäuben ihre Sinne in dem weißen Rauch
Die Steine eng, Kapseln machen sie taub
Träumt der weiße Nachschub sich aus
Dann fliegt schnell mal eine Faust
Wegen einer Frau oder wegen einem Blick
Einem falschen Wort oder wie du sprichst
Über andere zu reden, mach lieber nicht
Und am Ende kümmert man sich besser nur um sich
Sag mir, was bleibt dir, wenn du keine Batz in der Tasche
Oder vor deiner Tür einen Benz hast
Ohne Familie, was ohne Liebe?
Na, dann bleibt nur der Respekt, Mann
Versteh mich nicht falsch, aber ist so
Unten hat man leider nix
Also gib jedem seinen Respekt
Und man gibt ihn dir zurück, ah

Alle wollen Respekt
Aber selber keinen geben, denn dann nimmt man deinen weg
Wird man zu frech, macht es click-click-brrt
Und die Schüsse sind echt und dann ist Krise
Es geht um Respekt, dann herrscht auch Frieden
Respekt muss man sich verdienen
Respekt heißt nicht zu kriechen
Aber lässt dein Ego nicht zu hoch fliegen

Hab Respekt
Hab Respekt
Hab Respekt
Hab Respekt

Hab Respekt
Ohne Respekt auch keine Liebe

Eyy, eyy
Besser zeig Respekt, zeig Respekt
Besser zeig Respekt

Soziale Medien, Pisser sagen Ausdrücke 
Bis wir sie nach Haus schicken (bis wir sie nach Haus schicken)
Halt deinen Arsch raus bitte, wenn's nicht deine Suppe ist
Oder du musst austrinken (oder du musst austrinken)
Leute kommen solide (solide)
Leute kriegen nur Liebe
Doch manche Leute drehen auf und schieben nur Filme
Ist der Moment, wenn ich deinen Arsch unter meinen Schuhen finde
Zu viele Rapper haben Anus-Probleme
Aufgrund von den chronischen Nasenproblemen
Und gestern wart ihr noch die größten Feinde
Die sich Mutter-ficken, heut' ist alles okay
Es ist gar nix okay
Pack' einen Warnhinweis auf deine arme CD
Denn vom Hören des Tonträgers kriegt man Ohrenkrebs
Weil alles, was dort gesagt wird, ist fake (fake)
Mein Vater hat mir gesagt
„Schenk den Menschen ein Lächeln, doch
Kommen sie unverschämt, hau einen Brett an Kopf
Denn sie lernen nur, wenn die Schläfe pocht“
Kleines Einmaleins
Dass auf Hurensohn auch ein Echo folgt
Und ein Playerhater tropft den Teppich voll
Besser du kommst mit Respekt

Alle wollen Respekt
Aber selber keinen geben, denn dann nimmt man deinen weg
Wird man zu frech, macht es click-click-brrt
Und die Schüsse sind echt und dann ist Krise
