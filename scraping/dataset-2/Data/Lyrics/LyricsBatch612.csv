LoCash Cowboys,"I hope life goes how you want it,
And you find roads if it don't.
And you won't pass up a second chance
No matter how bad your heart's broken.
I hope you always stand up
For all that you believe,
'Cause that's what makes you who you are
In this world and not who they want you to be.

And I hope you know,
I'm thinkin' of you,
Wherever you are,
Whatever you do.

So go and chase all your dreams, all you want, everything, you believe in I hope
You'll find the one that you need that you can't live without, you, love and I hope
You reach for the sky, try your wings if you like, fly high and I hope
Like every time I've ever had to let you go, I hope.

You'll find your way around,
When you run into walls.
And if you need someone to talk to,
I hope you know that I'll be waiting when you call.
And every day is one day closer
To all your dreams come true.
And those lucky breaks
See your smiling face and follow you.

And I hope you know,
I'm thinkin' of you,
Wherever you are,
Whatever you do.

So go and chase all your dreams, all you want, everything, you believe in I hope
You'll find the one that you need that you can't live without, you, love and I hope
You reach for the sky, try your wings if you like, fly high and I hope
Like every time I've ever had to let you go.

Like I always have,
Like I always will.
All I want for you,
Is the best.

Go and chase all your dreams, all you want, everything, you believe.
Find the one that you need that you can't live without, you, love.
Reach for the sky, fly high and I hope.
Like every time I've ever had to let you go.

So go and chase all your dreams, all you want, everything, you believe in I hope.
You'll find the one that you need that you can't live without, you, love and I hope
You reach for the sky, try your wings if you like, fly high and I hope

Lock Up,"Stuck in a stalemate
The struggle to breathe and live
We increase the dosage
To cope with the pressure
Free me from the pain
Never again
That's what we say
Delirium
Nauseous convulsions
Deflecting our fears

We stare at the answers
But swallow the questions
Take me away
Cannot resist
Day after day
Delirium
Life is hell
Bitterness is all I taste
Drug hazed memories
Of how I think I was",Delirium,1999
Lock Up,"Seeds of aggression
Enemies that we cannot conquer
Demon possessions
Science feeds our eagerness
Greed for attention
In life the knife now is the saviour
We disregard conception

Fever landscapes shape our heartaches
Media interest feeds the interest
Fever landscapes grow the sadness
Designs that twist our fertile minds
Wrath of addiction
Witness to their own mutation
Extracting the weakness
Journey's through the darkened path",Fever Landscapes,1999
Lock Up,"Shall we condemn ourselves
Knowing the shit that goes on
Fooling yourselves to the point
That you just don't belong
Bring me the head of the one
Who decides what is right
Then we'll exist to resist
And exist to persist
Unclean - Censor claims axe the choice
Obscene - Silence falls upon no voice
Controlled views, faceless acts butchery
We'll decide this is called maturity
Come out from the darkness of ignorance
The dirt ridden stench of censorship
Come out from the darkness of ignorance
This dirt ridden stench is choking me
Words are spoken often but are backed by nothing
Since dawn of time, hate, murder, rape and pain
Still we point the finger in the wrong direction
For years it seems to me they're hidden from blame




",Darkness of Ignorance,1999
Lock Up,"A race for time
Or so it seems to be
Stress outweighs
What pain I even feel
Can't decide If life is worth a shit
Shelter me
Before the vultures sing
This frightening vision is breaking me slowly
Belief is fading shaping my failure
People stealing promising nothing
Time not healing raping my future
The dreams are sacrificed
The dreams are sacrificed
Pushed aside
My heart is torn to threads
Faith subsides
My body feels like lead
On and on
Deceiving circles spark
Toss the coin
Or feed me to the sharks
This frightening vision is breaking me slowly
Belief is fading shaping my failure
People stealing promising nothing
Time is not healing raping my future
The dreams are sacrificed
The dreams are sacrificed
Lost all forms of respect
Just another lamb to the slaughter
Just a code to be misplaced




",The Dreams Are Sacrificed,1999
Lock Up,"Sick of being used
Trapped inside this shell
Years escaping time
Fear reshaping lives
These ego pawns who call the shots
Torture architects of fate
Are we born to soil the rot
Ego Pawn
Memories fuel the fire
Have I got the strength
Resistance breeds acceptance
Impatience feeds reluctance
Show me the sign
Ego Pawn




",Ego Pawn,1999
Lock Up,"Death in the air, on the land, in the sea
Stockpiles of waste carving the holes in the sky
Conspiring a myth that for now all is well
Meanwhile all set for a sleigh ride to hell
Leech eclipse
Earth's bloodstained kiss
Eclipse
Millions of self-righteous wimps point the blame
It's our generation that ought to feel shame
Neglecting the fact that the damage is done
We've been here before and will be again
Leech eclipse
Earth's bloodstained kiss

",Leech Eclipse,1999
Lock Up,"I reject your stance
And all your points of view
Come out from where you hide
And be who you want to
This double standard tease
Which set of friends to please
What morals to defend
Who not to offend
Pretenders to the throne
False Messiahs
Pretenders to the throne
Leave your safety

Who's to judge what rules
Somebody's sense of worth
The conflict in your eyes
Those blatant alibis I believe what I want to
My mind's my own
No compromise
No white lies",Pretenders of the Throne,1999
Lock Up,"Fused with this
Systematically existing
To resist
Like pawns on a chess board
Power sadists
Engineering loss of hope
Fortune seekers
Treading you beneath their feet
Submission is your god
A karmic debt repaid in blood
Hate in excess
Feeds their will to make you weak
Empty shells cast into the fire
Submission is your god
It makes you feel safe in the notion
That you're nothing
Just to be used
Raped of being
The sterile tools that carved you blunt
Persecution
Just a frame of mind?
[repeat chorus]




",Submission,1999
Lock Up,"Chasing down and taking out
Another life, a personal theft
To live among the dead remains
Is tragic faith and tempting fate
The dotted lines and blotted frames
Betray the agony and rage
Lies a strategic blindly placed
Feed a nation's voyeur traits
Rumours bleed in every shape
Faking cause for no one's sakes
The dotted lines and blotted frames
Betray the agony and rage
The dotted lines and blotted frames
Betray the agony and rage
For all we know it could be us
Who's next to be the tabloid slut
The tragic faith is shedding tears
For all the pretence all the years
Caring when you should feel guilt
Demanding more blood to be spilt
For all we know it could be us
Who's next to be the tabloid slut
Chasing down and taking out
Another life, a personal theft
To live among the dead remains
Is tragic faith and tempting fate
The dotted lines and blotted frames
Betray the agony and rage

Take a swig off that bottle of vodka I tried to finish off this mornin' man. 
I was pissed as a fart. 
Yeah so what did I do, chucked the bitch out from the night before dint I?
Open the door, I forgot to take a shower but it don't matter anyway. 
I love that smell of sex. 
So I thought I'd follow that smell down to the beach. 
N' on my way mate, you should a seen the babes. 
What all ova the place, 
Left, right 
And in the middle. 
It was wicked. 

In the distance I could hear this beat sort of .
Buildin' up. 
In the background people screamin' at the tops of their voices. 
It was an amazin' feelin'. 
The sun was shinin'. 
It was shinin' so fuckin' bright I had to put my sunglasses on dint I? 
Yeh, so, 
Yeh so that was the way it was on that 
Sunny 
Little 
Morning. 

I entered the center of the hullamaboo. 
Those people were gettin' down man! 
They were movin' their bodies. 
There were so many gyrating bodies, getting down. 
And they were getting down 
To that phat dope shit. 

Oh yeah, I've had some of that. 
So I thought ""right it's time to go home"". 
But on the way I nick a bottle of vodka off somebody innit? 
Yeah. take the taste away of all the sweet shit I had the evenin' before. 
So I did. 
And as I was going to the bar, 
To nick the splash, 
This baby grabbed me between the legs 
And pulled me back on to the dance floor, 
Cause she wanted me and only me 
To get down with her

Samian, Loco Locass, il était temps que l’union se fasse, qu’on remonte la vraie histoire pour qu’on puisse y faire face,
On veut mettre un pont entre les nations, confondre la culture, ignorer les préjugés, laisser parler la nature

La barrière entre les peuples, on veut plus la casser, on en a plus qu’assez, on est placés pour parler,

On fume le calumet de paix, sans rancune, on est capables de rester vrais même si on porte plus de plumes

Un peuple oscille entre le rien et tout ce qui brille
Je pose des mots garrots gare au flot hémorragique
Ô ma rage gicle par tous les pores de mon cœur spongieux
Sur ce son long jeu conjure ma mortelle nature

Et nous disons que la parole est une sage-femme
Qui tire des limbes un monde à naître
Fort de cette maïeutique aux forceps

Loco S.A.B.,"Here's the latest
From the king of badness
I got the shit that makes niggaz want to flip
G'd up all better wit beanies
Sweatin' all the bitches to blow are weanies
Niggaz all getting drunk, and smoking a bum bud
Oh wait here's a punk, pump the trunk
'cause it's a gang of jackers in the front smoking
All the hump, some shit was said about blue and red
But I'm color blind and I gotta nine
Threw up the sign I cock the 9, I cock the 9.

Well nigga pop the 9and let it holla
Test drive wit a neighborhood's scholar
Black Impaler, blue chucks on gettin outta
Sucks on hip hop thugsta get the fuck on
Niggaz looking shifty, do they want to diss me, lick me
Show me love or peel my cap quickly
My six sense won't let me slip don't puff wit the draggin' 'em
I'm still toe taggin em, hit the spot wit a don still baggin' 'em
It's the low call, S.A.B on the vocal, blast my way out eazy pay
The way, all you bitch niggaz stay out

[Chorus: x2]
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 ( and everything is fine)
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (my homey pop the 9)
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (my homey pop the 9)

It's like dice game, dice game niggaz get they roll'on
Everything's all good till niggaz getting sold on
Here we all get together and shoot, fuck
I grab my gun then I picked up my loot
But I didn't lose shit so it's all good
Leavin pumpin Eazy-E ""Boyz n the Hood""
'cause I'm a gangsta so I can relate, most of these
Niggaz is fake and tryin to hate
I put a buster in his place, I put one in his face
Obey my first and give him the taste
That's how I does it, that's how I do it
And the murder weapon that I use you know I threw it
He kept persuading so I had to do it, 'uh' play
For keeps that's the rule of the streets 'uh'.

Dick Tracy all on my nuttz like Cagny and Lacy
And don't faze me, Ruthless is the label that pays me
But this one H.K weighs a ton, words are yellow wit
The ? freaks on a run, bring ya condom in the kingdom
Huh ho from the ceilin to the floor, info red at ya window
Plus the E go hangin out the beamer tho
Drop shit like a seagull, for the people
Ho's make a contribution, but y'all don't hear me tho.

Tuck ya legs to my dick with the wrap em real tight
Just encase its on and a nigga gotta fight, an a
Nigga gotta bust, but who in the fuck said in god we trust
The shit went down everybody start runnin'
Bitches screamin' and the bullets still comin'
Run into a nigga tryin' to save mine, reach for my gun ah shit!

Once I felt the same as you
Doomed to eternity but it's not true

Now our bus run far away
To hide from the things I did on that rainy day

Ow!

I don't know if I will have the time to write anymore letters
Because I might be too busy trying to participate.
So if this does end up being the last letter,
I just want you to know that I was in a bad place before I started high school
And you helped me.

Even if you didn't know what I was talking about
Or know someone who's gone through it.
You made me not feel alone.

Because I know there are people who say all these things don't happen.
And there are people who forget what it's like to be sixteen when they turn seventeen.
And know these will all be stories someday
And our pictures will become old photographs
And we'll all become somebody's mom or dad.
But right now these moments are not stories.

This is happening.
I am here and I am looking at her
And she is so beautiful.
I can see it.
This one moment when you know you're not a sad story,
You are alive.
And you stand up and see the lights on buildings
And everything that makes you wonder,
When you were listening to that song
On that drive with the people you love most in this world.

The rest of the block started showing on up, ran outta charcoal

But if you bought two you gotta free bag of ice

Momma's on the mandolin

You ought-a see 'em pick and grin

To the sound of the guitar strums
And everybody starts groovin'
To the beat of the rhythm and drums

While the feeling is good
Just sip that wine, have a really good time

Knocking on the old back door

Who's dying in to himself, duh

Happening before my very eyes.

Ruining the air up in the skys,

In the rivers and trees,
I want to spend the days making wine and be free, 
Be free (Be free, be free)

Come on down i can feel you falling,
Happening for all of us to see.

See the deepening cement hollow,
Reaching out for those who follow,
hunkering on far too many lies,
Its no surprise.

I want to get away and live my life,
In the rivers and trees,

And be free (be free, be free) and be free.

Ive had an inner vision,
Ive seen the universe unfold.

I can hear the school bell ringing,

Selling slow and ship to others,
Aiding those whos songs have turned to crys,

To keep you on the road
And moving day to day

Is fresh on my face
As the songs of the night puts
The ring in my ear

Then don't feel alone anymore
'Cause when we're together then you've got a lot
'Cause I am the river and you are the shore

Further and further from things that we've done
Leaving them one by one
And we have just begun, watching the river run
Listening and learning and yearning to run, river, run

Winding and swirling and dancing along
We passed by the old willow tree
Where lovers caress as we sing them our song,
Rejoicing together when we greet the sea

And he likes to take it slow and easy,
You need a man,

I'll give a two pound pearl,

And likes to take it slow and easy,
You need a man,
One with lovin' on his mind
And all he wants to do is please.""

And if I can, you can no doubt

One day

And the police they rushin'
Go to my head like concussion
I'd rather not have this discussion
My mind racing for the elevation of the toxic in my blood
Where my mind, don’t know now
But I know where it was
I need Nikki, where is Nikki
Baby girl please come and get me
Now I’m old and shit is trippy, but I know that god is with me
This that baby mama drama
Give a fuck about a man I know Imma
Be there for my son, talking with my sister it begun
End of the month, that’s the worst of the month
But the first of the month put the weed in the blunt
That welfare check, check, won’t ever bounce like my daddy did
But I’m glad he did cause it made me strong
Made me help somebody with this song
Paint the picture of my life
Growing up what it was like
Section 8, grab a plate
Food for thought, gravitate
Food stamps, social services tryna take me away
My mama locked up, I pray to god that I see her today
Maybe not, maybe so, West Deer Park that’s all I know
Just me and my homies, people that know me
Only ones that know
Around my way, living day by day
Corn rows and hang time, automatics and gang signs
Five-O with them K-9's
Manhunt when it's game time
They was robbing the ice cream man in broad day
Now I’m running from the police, don’t know how but I got away
Selling weed to my homies, and a girl in the building that know me
At 15, such a fiend, for the shit, that I seen
All my homies smoking green, fucking bitches, sipping lean
It was king, it was cool, seemed like something I should do
Such a youngin, such a fool
Now I’m breaking into school
Cause my homie told me to
What to do, what would you
When will I lose my anonymity and become one with the enemy?
Tell me would I be the enemy, feel like nobody in front of me
I can feel the vibe

Bobby what are you thinking?
What are you dreaming about?
Bobby, what’s inside?
What are you thinking right now?
What are you thinking?
Go to sleep

I guess that I was just thinking things would be different now
Cause when I wake up my dreams fade
Everything cascade
In this vanilla sky, I feel like David Aames
Why must I open my eyes
I wish that I could stay asleep forever
Attain every goal I wanted and watch it repeat forever
Will it happen, maybe never
Maybe so, I got to know
But tell me why
I picture myself at the top but I know that I’m dreaming
Will I wake up before I finally confront all my demons
Maybe not
All I know is this life I live I can’t live it no longer
Wish I was stronger, wish that I could survive
Turn on the TV let it wash my brain
Pretend that family’s my family to avoid the pain
Hello children, how was school?
It was good, how bout you?
I love you (I love you son)
I love mama too

From Reggies to The House of Blues, progress is the model

All that competition right there is dead to me

This shit right here, I've been at it for ages
Feels like I'm running through mazes, everybody has they phases
Yeah, vibe with this, bad bitch in the whip and I ride to this
And I'm feeling it uh, hope when I'm forty I'm still in it
One of the few that be killing it uh
Yeah, young motherfucker that be giving what he living
On the road to success you know that I'm driven
But they didn't wanna publish it, but right now I'm on some other shit
I'm in a different world, I'm with a different girl
I'm with the same team, but it's a different scheme
Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills
And I'll never forget how that feels back when I would

Been on this plane way too long, I can't wait to see you again

Crazy racist white bitch looking at us like ""who are these niggas?""
First class, on they ass, all complain that's when I dash
Just landed in Europe and this model bitch is tryna smash
Now I'm riding on the train, all this shit inside my brain
Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane
Smoking blunts in Amsterdam, oh my God this is my jam
May-December by Mos Def in my headphones, that's the man

I know, I know that I got it if I, do what I gotta do to get by

The thoughts inside my mind, be fuckin' with me when I'm all alone
I really like this girl she bad as fuck, why must I run away?
It feel like self assassination, I can't put this gun away
God damn, what's the plan, not complacent where I am
Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van
Broke as fuck, not a dollar, whipping that Chevy impala
Praying that we make it out this city, Lord willin', insha'allah
Up to date the couple years, now my idols are my peers
I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer
Put my everything into this shit, you know, I know you know this
Used to give a fuck what people thought, hoping that they would notice
Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive
Mind racing on and off the track, I'm going locomotive

I can't believe you don't like Tarantino
Ugh, I don't like him because, like, when it's non like non-tarantino-esque
I think it's a good movie
You mean like Inglorious Basterds?
I didn't see that
What?!
I didn't, I don't know
Oh my god, have you seen Pulp Fiction
Yeah, but I don't really remember it
What you talking about? Have you seen uh
This is funny cause we're on the train, have you seen, fuck! What's his name
The guy from the movie, in the place on the on the train? With the scenery?
Uh, I'm tryna remember right now, dammit, Source Code

Chillin’, sippin' Sinatra from a flask
Little bobby, just a youngin’, skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery
Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the store
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door
Can’t take no more, momma on drugs, daddy M.I.A
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day I pay homage to the Gods, to the greats
Never stolen, I’m from Maryland
Where they shoot you in the dark of the night
Like Christopher Nolan, for talking out your colon
Catch me rollin’ with the realest
Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, sub zero
Far from a hero, bitch, I’m De Niro in Goodfellas
If your bitch around me best bring an umbrella
Let me tap into my inner southern killer, another illa
Murder the game and then resurrect it like Thriller

Word to my homies up above, we slinging like drugs
And overdose 'em like the dealer does

I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seeping, I'm like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer
Even though heaven sent him

See my vision as I've elevated and risen
Open your eyes, despise lies with deadly precision
I finally made my way up out that section 8 division
Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersing these feelings
While the label only care about making a killin'
Feel my energy, I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G
That's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy, number 1 I better be
Bitch, I said I bet I be
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me
Tell me how is they gonna remember me
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me
Just because I was different, just because I was doing what I love
And the fans they say they love you, but they push and they shove
Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hundred
I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry about bitches and getting blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference is I'm stronger and better from when I've begun
So when people that never knew me they tell me that I changed
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged?
I just stop, and do my best to refrain
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane
Will I die? Will I live?
Give the world everything I have to give
This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage
Even though it's in the millions that shit don't define my brilliance
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
Of people that separated, but all equal
To know the ending one must understand the prequel

Love life even though I'm stressed

Tell def jam if they don't cut the check, I'll send chris to go cut their neck

That's radio, that's tv, but visionary got the internet
If yall fuck around or try to throw the ball to another artist, imma intercept
It's my time, put half a mill of my own money in this album
That's my dime
No rap features, just my rhymes
My story, it's all mine
From the basement to the stadium
From the roxy to palladium
I've been there and I've done that, yes I run that
With this pretty girl on my floor, half naked playing connect four
But I've been trying to throw sex out the window just to connect more
She so fine, type of girl I wanna fuck her mind and then unwind with some slow head
All my homies like go ahead
Anyway, it's been a long time
And this here has been a long rhyme
So I gotta go, it's logic
The one nobody would vouch for, how's that shit for an outro

Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
This is my story, til the end
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
This is my story, til the end
Yeah yeah

Every day that they live and breathe is extended to them
They may be misinformed about the truth
They may be misguided
Somebody has led them on the wrong path
A path of corruption and destruction
But yet god's mercy every day that they live
Is extended to them and they have another opportunity to be saved

I've been living life, and I hope that you do the same
Cause if you ain't doing what you love it's only you to blame
Come on I've been through the game
By that time they know the name
Numb it down for the pain
This music my novacaine
Lord Willin' we over came
It's time to get over man
I've been around the world and back and I swear it's all the same
And what I learned, A profit don't do it for the profit gone get off
Check the topic watch me drop it, can you stop it
I don't know I've been at it on the low
Never did it like this here before
But I'm still here and I just hope I'll make a difference make a killin'

Lord willin'
Make a difference, lord willin'
Uh, lord willin'
I tell 'em hold on
And yeah you know I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em hold on
I don't understand whats happening
And So I tell 'em hold on
And yeah you know I gotta bring it back again
And I tell 'em hold on
I don't understand whats happening
So I tell em

I guess I'm back at it
I ain't done I ain't had it
If I was underground before then this is me in my attic
For this rap shit I'm an addict
But can't fuck with that dramatic
I've been busting my ass
They probably think it's automatic
Yes sir I've done this shit before like your baby momma momma
Imma tell 'em like it is, Imma tell 'em like it is
Life isn't picture perfect
We use the negatives to develop
I'm well up I'm way up
Nothing but ? fuck the layup, I'm way up
Bitches losing calories out here jumping to conclusions
Can't fuck with they delusions
I'm on that 101 cruisin'
Okay, way back in the day I rap in a way
But no not quite like this live it like that
In a way yes you could say
Made me wanna write like this
Not quite like this on my level
I'm unique and I'm a rebel
Are you listening
I hope that you're listening
This feel like it's summertime
Waiting for the bus number nine
Through the city all alone
Not a worry, not your phone
We just vibing maybe flying 'round the world
Man, I hope you see the world
And all your dreams will unfurl
Just don't never cash your pearl
Go out there and make a living
Take this advice that I'm giving
Make a difference make a killin' make a killin'

Lord willin'
Make a difference, lord willin'
Uh, lord willin'
I tell 'em hold on

Logic,"I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

You ever wonder what it all really means?
Heart full of dreams, I know I'mma do it, get it by any means
Serving food for the thought like it's rock to the fiends
I said this shit for years boy, this life ain't what it seems
Sayin' that you can't just solidifies that you never will
Said you would, said you could, but you ain't got the skill
You gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill
You gotta climb over your ego to master your will
Gave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension
God damn, I hope you're here for the intervention
You say you would if you had the money, don't make me mention
That it'll cost you nothin' but time for you to pay attention
Now don't get me wrong, I know there's people out there hatin' on ya
And it feel like your self-esteem is breakin' on ya
All they ever seem to do is hate when you speak
They spend seven days preyin' on the weak
I know the world sleepin' on ya like a sedative
Talk all you want about me homie, I'mma let it live
Hater this, hater that, say I sound repetitive

This is dedicated to everyone that never made it
And the people that persevered even though they was hated
They had a dream and a vision that they follow like a religion
But on the real the road to success is prone to collision
And every now and then something happens that's unexpected
Like that newborn in your life because you fuckin' unprotected
And I swear nobody perfect, hell I know I ain't
Yeah I know this verse is heaven sent but I'm far from a saint
Live a life with no complaints, tryna do just what I can
Learn from my father's mistakes and become a better man
Now plant a seed and watch 'em grow, teach 'em everything I know
Show him how to fight his battles and always go toe to toe
And this I know cause I been high, low, right, wrong
But I had to do it all just so I could write this song
I spit knowledge like the listener is my only son
And grip the mic like I'm at war and it's my only gun
Sometimes this journey to the top can be a lonely one
Yeah, and this victory lap a lonely run
While my hometown screamin' you the chosen one
Tellin' myself, don't choke, don't be the frozen one

I wonder where is this, hold up
Get the fuck out my business, show enough
We roll up then load up
Just a bastard born in a wedlock
Close to the Earth like a dreadlock
Got my sites on deadlock
Visions of my enemy in a headlock
Feel like I'm livin' in Bedrock, surrounded by rubble
Just a youngin' in trouble
Took a shot and then made it a double
Took a shot and then made it a double
This that food for thought, my school ain't tought me good
No one greedy inside my hood
But a tablespoon of this baking soda gon' make it good, like it should
That's ignant isn't it
Hold up now wait, take a look at my pigment
Tell me again, we can never be kin based on the color of my skin
Matter of fact your lips ain't thin
That's a club I don't wanna be in
My DNA get done integrated
My God it's innovative
That's a million miles away from administrative
I fuckin' hate it, anyway
Long ago, way back in the day in a place called West Deer Park
I was like 5, sit in my mama lap while she would drive
Police would knock on the door, I would hide
Then they would talk to me and I would lie
Hopin' I, don't die on this side of a .45
Then they would handcuff my mama and take her away
Over down on the driveway
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm bumpin' that Sade
Fast forward a couple of more and I'm bumpin' that ""My Way""
By Sinatra, so high, so high, oh my, God damn
Now I'm a grown man, oh man
With the fuckin' habits of a the plan
I know, as soon as I write this I might just go crazy
Anything but lazy, I can't sleep
'Cause if I do, there's another motherfucker wide awake on the creep
Tryna kill you and he will too
We livin' like civilized people, but far from equal
I hope I live a long life and get to see my sequel
My son, my seed
Watch 'em grown and then watch 'em lead
Let me proceed, bumpin' that that Californication, by the Red Hot
Fuck around and then hit 'em with a red dot
Y'all better not me fuckin' with me
Who, him? Yeah, me, I be the God MC

Follow me to paradise
Follow, follow me
Follow me to paradise
Follow me to paradise

I remember my life long ago in my adolescence
I could feel the presence in my residence
Hesitant even thought it was evident
I should get the fuck
I know something is wrong
Yeah, I know something is wrong
Feel like my mind gone
I know I play along, I might drown in this song
Huh, I'm so focused, huh, I know you know this
Uh, when I make a move and feel like no one notice
Uh, when I quit my job, uh, I fuckin' noticed
Shot made me been unnoticed, huh, but maybe not
Feel like this minimum wage is contagious
So outrageous my age is on my mind
Walking to work and I go blind
Sippin' on that Koolaid, gettin' big wig money, that [?]
Look around and see people with no class, like snow on a school day
Y'all can't do what I do, do what I do
Starin' out this window like, like Erykah Badu
Livin' life how I do is crazy
This shit never amaze me
But I still let it phase me and I don't know why
All I know is my mind racing
A million miles a minute, the second I'm in it yeah I be pacing
Bitch I'm back again
Been here since way back when, now let that shit begin

This album 2 but this song was written before the first
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
But it only makes it that much better when I rise

This for the people that been through it and couldn't do it
Had a vision but blew it, while haters screaming ""I knew it!""
This is real, so real
The type of shit that make you feel like you gotta kill
Most of these people will never hit fruition
Paying tuition when they should've just listened their intuition
Now they wishing they was switching up their lifestyle
All alone with no one to dial
I'm just a man, I got problems, understand
This is all I ever wanted, yes I do it for the fans
And I ain't perfect
I've questioned if this life was even worth it
'Cause all the people care about is what lies on the surface
And my purpose is to do it like it ain't never been done
Always keep it real and remember where I'm from, now

Logic,"Me and my team gotta intervene
What's the point of livin' if you ain't livin' a dream?
We live in a era where everybody want everything
Everybody want a better thing
Tryna feel ya like it's picture perfect but it's just the editing
Man, the game been waiting for a better king
I've been posted with my Queen like Coretta King
Screaming ""Money ain't a thing"", cause it ain't
Man, I never knew livin' out a dream meant livin' out a suitcase
I've been working at a new pace
So much money on the road I ain't even had a minute
Not a single second chilling in my new place
Motherfuckers getting two-faced
Cause a brother finally eating
Not to mention everybody gettin' two plates
You know I only got two traits
Drop hits, get money
Run it

What the fuck is there left to talk about
I told them my vision, let 'em know what it's all about
Industry only respect me because I'm ballin' out
You never know who there for you until you fallin' out
And that's the reason why I've been in the kitchen
Working on that nutrition
I let em listen, boy this been my house
This is merely an addiction, fuck 'em and their permission
They was killin' the game, who the one that gave 'em remission?
You know the name
Who else you know wanna come up, do it like I does it
Lyrics all up in your scull like when the barber buzz it
Say my last shit a classic, and I wonder was it?
Come to think about it everybody seemed to love it
I was workin' on a budget
Second time around shit is different cuh
They know that boy good, know he does it
I've been at it for the people that been lovin' my shit
Not the people that been hating, they can suck my dick
Run it

I'ma do somethin' different for the last one
I'ma go in

Feelin' like Matthew Mcconaughey on a Interstellar
Mission in Chicago at the bottom of the Riviera
I wonder who I would be if I wasn't in my era
I got a berretta for people but I take care of the
People when I jump in the cockpit and rock it
Been done, had this in my pocket
I had to wait to unlock it
Open that locket and see the picture I painted
No we ain't never aquainted
On the rise, look at defending
Now we trial for possession like an exorcism
My division is solely my vision, God damn
Can you feel it? Uh
I had a dream I would run the game and kill it
Had a dream, can you feel it?
Motherfucker wanna push it to the limit
Get up in it, make the shit infinite
Yeah you know I wanna win it, on my independent
I've been at it like an addict
Never at the party like I'm democratic
'Lotta static on the radio
Fuck everything that they represent
This right here is heaven sent, never irrelevant
No never when I slide up in the spot, just a youngin' in the game
Tryna show 'em what I got, way back
That was the mentality, never truly reality
Looking for validation
With all the wrong things on my mind for motivation
Just chillin' at the crib on a Playstation
Cause I never thought about it, never thought that people
Would have a song like mine in their rotation
Til I wised up, got 'em sized up
Ready to go, I'm feelin' fired up
Man it's been a good ride up
Everybody want me to lace 'em, I'm too tied up
This a ransom
Fist full of money then we had back to the mansion
30 Thousand people in the crowd, we expanding
Couple years back you ain't give a damn
All the grass off the plane whenever I land
All part of the plan
And anything you wanna do you can
You go and get it, fuck 'em if they don't love 'em
Be above it 'less you're thinking your profession gon' be rap
Matter fact you should take a step back
Cause I run it",Run It,2015

(Might not be the)

I know my mind is sober
But I'm so high, its sober
I Know my mind is sober
But I'm so high, its sober
And I want it ?

Everybody wanna live lavish, a million in the bank on average
They cutthroat yeah they savage
They riding round with the baddest bitch
One day, I woke up, and said I'm bout to do for the rest of my life
No question it's right
Waiting for the bus at a stop light looking
At the cop right in front of my eyes
Living in a world of lies
Where the truth dies and hatred multiplies, mu-mu-mu-multiplies
I said I can't take it
I remember if I would ever make it
But as I reminisce I realize it was all irrelevant, it's evident
I'm getting money for the hell of it
Never fuck around until the flow celibate
Speaking for the people like a delegate
And when the situation's delicate
I execute it with the proper etiquette
Everybody wanna get ahead of it, no
I can't take the time to stop
It ain't all about the money so I'm headed to the top
But I'm still getting guap never stop unless a body drop
Metaphorical motherfucker to get it in
While the whole world spin for the dividend
But I'm in another system
Everybody hate till he dead then they miss 'em
Why can't we relax and listen
Stop spending money on things that glisten

I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding an Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppeto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
'Cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me
Different stances
I used to spend all my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Shit is too big, but let's be honest, man
It's kinda bittersweet, besides the shows and meet and greets y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rare, I just don't go outside
'Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide

Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now
Just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' that by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
'Cause people don't buy music in this day and age
They buy the brand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong
But back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I would've sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass

I wish had a lot of money
Had a lot of dough, had a lot of paper you already know
My life would be so much better with cheddar
Only work as hard as I do for vendetta
'Cause my ninth grade teacher said I wouldn't be shit
Wouldn't be nothing
Working that minimum wage and cooking McMuffins
So I'm puffing on this green
Wishing I had more money than I do

And so I'm all about my business, is there anyone who witness?
Can a brother get a witness like ah, ooh?
Aah, ooh
Wassup with it come and get it
Tell me now what's on your mind
I ain't talking bout that shit you post up on your timeline
Speak to me in real time, open up and redefine
Open up a motherfucking book for once and read a line
Somebody tell me now what done happen to society
My happiness is gone and it took with it my sobriety
They say that money cannot make you happy
Do not lie to me, whoever said that shit was never broke and wouldn't try to be
Who is you to try with me?
Why you trying me?
Like aah!

Now I'ma tell 'em what makes me happy
This what makes me happy, right here like this

Jump up on that MPC, like a boss MVP
Cook up shit that make other producers wanna envy me
Master it then set it free, turn it into MP3s
Spin that shit up in Serato, I can feel the energy

This shit is deeper than money, deeper than money, deeper than money
Deeper, deeper than money
This shit is deeper than money, deeper than money, deeper than money
You know it's deeper, deeper honey, this shit

Off the top off the dome
Gotta get it, go home
Hella late, feeling good, got a lot on my plate
What the fuck is on my mind?
I just, I just want to rhyme
This the type of shit I got to do
Oh my God, what's the time?
Can you feel it right now?
Can you feel the whole style?
It's the type of shit, I gotta get it, gotta get it
I've been vibing out here in Malibu
Would you come through?
Tell me motherfucker, truly what it do?

L.A. where I'm at, M.D. what I be
All that, all that, god

I put that on everything, I'm just being honest, shit

Should have had this verse to your ass a long time ago
When I put that on everything, I ain't had a minute to myself

I ain't focused on no wealth
I been living good, I been feeling fine

Ain't nobody gonna stop us, nobody gon' top us

Leave 'em with no oxygen, leave 'em with no problem

When I see these street shockin'
Easy if it need be then I just eat beats
And I'm Eazy-E, Compton
I eat meat like I'm EBT shopping
Credit Card Max, bend the bars back
Fuck your hoe, get brain and all that
Run in your house and bring your whore back
Sever your face and dead the doormat
Who got the keys to the rented Corvette
Can't catch me, I'm the man in all black
I been a nice chap since Catman on crack
Fuck that, I been nice way before that
Can't ignore that, you can try though
But you gon' end up next to Dido
I'm that pen that wrote the Bible
I'm on your skin like vitiligo
Sing for the moment, I hit the high note
Someone please let Elton John know
Tell the lieutenant I'm Hect Camacho
With a Catholic priest and the Pentecostal
Why you niggas wiggidy wiggidy wack, gettidy get in the back
With a umbilical patch, jump in the middle of the track
None of y'all niggas can act so y'all niggas are packed
Come and get it again, fuckin' a bitch in the whip
Give me your moment to fall, I'm gonna fit in the car
I can do better than yours, I can be ready to brawl
I can be shattered and all, nobody want to be hard
Better be ready for war, tell me who ready for more

All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater
Wondering what’s gonna happen
And how the world gonna treat her
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever
How could her momma mislead her

Oh my

So what now?
What advice can you give me?
What advice can I give humanity?
I suppose so
Live your life
Don’t waste your days on the negative energy of others
Remember that you’re not your salary
You’re not your house you’re not your car
And no matter how big your bank account is
Your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s
So enjoy the days you have
Worry not bout the days that came before you
Nor the ones that will follow you in death
Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed
And the fact that you are living is what life is all about
So live your life to the fullest
According to your happiness and the betterment of all

Damn man, we’ve been walking forever
Well, Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour
Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Oh no, man
I’m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one

One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact, I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas, Cole, and Hov
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic could rap
When it all goes back to a childhood, need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God, learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone, accept Him",AfricAryaN,2017

It was December of 2015 in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
I stood next to my wife 
In a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
As my body began to fade
In this moment my mind was full of clarity
But my body insisted it was in danger
I looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine
But I was convinced that something was wrong
Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
Fall and fade away
My body grew weak
And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed 
Being told what I went through was anxiety
I refused to believe this story
I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
I began to feel detached from reality
I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
I got blood work done
Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
The doctor said it was anxiety
But how could it be anxiety?
How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?
How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world 
And on the brink of death?
Derealization
The sense of being out of one’s body
I’m not here
I’m not me
I’m not real
Nothing is
Nothing but this feeling of panic
Nobody understands
Nobody knows the sufferings
This physical feeling
It can’t be anxiety
It can’t
Or can it?
Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body?
Yeah, of course
I’m so in control of my mind and my body
But I’m subconsciously forcing myself into a state
Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
I am unhappy
Not with life
But with this feeling
I am scared, I am human, I am a man
But I look in the mirror and I see a child
I am an adult who recognize grown ups don’t really know shit
And they never did
And it scares me
Because now I’m just a grown up who doesn’t know shit
But one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me
No, no this feeling
This anxiety is nothing
I have anxiety
Just like you, the person I wrote this for
And together we will overcome this feeling
We will remember despite the attacks 
And constant filling of our mind and body being on the edge
That we are alive
And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
We will rejoice in this gift that is life
We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
Starting with mental health
We will accept ourselves as we are 
And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror
We will accept ourselves
And live with anxiety",Anziety,2017

Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland
7:36 am. Where a biracial baby was born
To a black father and a white mother
Father that wasn’t there, addicted to 
Crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs
Same as his mom
(Way, way back)
So I’m gonna tell you about that, I’m gonna tell you about how
All this young boy ever wanted was happiness
All he ever wanted was positivity
All he ever wanted to do was entertain
And this boy went through hell
You gotta understand, his mother was racist
Which is crazy
'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have 
All these black babies with black men but you racist
Like bitch, that don’t make sense
But it is what it is
You know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger
The kids at school callin' him a cracker
Identifying as black, looking as white
Being told what you can or can’t be
This kid went through everything
He went through
He saw narcotics in the household
Violence, murderers, drug dealers
He was kidnapped, there was crazy shit that happened to this kid
And he persevered while the whole world said
What they said?
Said, said, said ""you wouldn’t be shit!""
You ain’t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
And I, and he, he said fuck that, I’mma persevere
And that’s why the message is always peace, love and positivity
See, he always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that the message
Everybody, was born equal
Regardless of race, religion
Color, creed, and sexual orientation
He knew that because he saw that
Because he was stripped 
And torn down by his black brothers and sisters
That were uneducated and that did not know
And he was stripped 
And he was torn down by his white side that did not know
These people that are ignorant, they cannot see the bigger picture
That must fight, and kill, and murder each other
But once again, all he ever wanted to do
Was spread a message
Of equality, for every man, woman, and child
Regardless of race, religion
Color, creed, and sexual orientation
Now imagine this child growing up
And seeing the craziest shit
Being a part of the craziest shit
Running around with the wrong people
Running around with guns and knives and fighting and stealing and
All this, because he didn’t know, he didn’t know!
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn’t right
And he knew that he needed to get away from it
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
And then he would then come home to about 8 or 9 hours of sleep
But spend 4, 5, 6 hours of that working on music, persevering
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
Just chanting his name
Hoping that it would happen
But the, but the, but the world said no!
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no no, no no, no no, no no
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka
No no!
And he said fuck that
He said peace, love, and positivity
He said equality for all man
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
Yeah
Now I also want you to imagine 
People telling him that he did not live this life
“You just a white boy.” “You ain’t never experienced that shit.”
“You from Gaithersburg, Maryland. Nothing happens there.”
“Oh no, no, we no, we weren’t there
We didn’t live with you, in your Section 8 household
We didn’t live with the narcotics and violence in your household. 
We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside.” 
“And since you white, you gotta have money, right?”
And this young man persevered, in spite of what people told him he was
Wasn’t, would and would never be
And that man is here today, proud
A lover of all human beings
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
Yeah, yeah
And he’s here to say
Even though we’re all born and created equal
We're not treated equally
There’s extremists on every side
And you should just do your best to live life 
And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
As long as they’re not hurtin' anybody
You can believe they’re going to hell
You can believe it’s not right
You can believe you’re superior, fine
Just stop killing each other",Take It Back,2017
Logic,"So, we waiting for what?

Excuse me?

So you sittin' here telling me, this place is a waiting room, right? What are we waiting for?

Rebirth

Rebirth? Like reincarnation?

If that's what you wanna call it

What the fuck you mean “if that's what I wanna call it?” either this is what it is
Or this is what it ain’t

Sure

Chu mean? Ughhh, this muhfucka

Aight, lemme get this straight, every time I die
I come here, we talk, and you send me back to earth to be reborn?

You know the last time we had this conversation it was in mandarin and you were 13

Mandarin?

And a girl!

What? Nah, bruh, you fuckin wit me
You’re, like, Jesus Christ

He was here too!

What? Wait, wait, so the Christians got it right?

Well I’m about to reincarnate you Atom. I’d say everyone kinda got it right

This is a whole lot to take in!

I know trust me, I’ve been there

So, how many times have I been reincarnated?

Many, many many many, many times

If it’s so many times, why don’t I remember?

If we stayed here long enough, the lives you have lived
And the knowledge from each of them would return

What?

I’m actually about to send you back to 1736 as Bryan Fairfax, the 8th lord Fairfax of Cameron

Word, ayy, that sounds important

Oh yes you own 40,000 acres

God damn! Oh, I’m sorry

Ha, it's quite alright

Well at least I’m not poor no more

Well sure! with all that land and the hundreds of slaves you’ll own

Slaves? Aw hell nah, nononono, look look look
How you gonna take a black man, send him back in time
And now I gotta own slaves?

Well if it's any consolation, your son Tom, the 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron sets them free!

No! That does not make me feel better at all

Wait hold up, I just realized you said you’re gonna send me back in time?

Well, I’m not really sending you back in time
That doesn’t exist where I come from, only in your universe

Well, where are you from?

Honestly Atom, even if I explained where I came from
Or told you about the others like me, you just wouldn’t understand

But if there's others like you, how can you be god?

Atom, I said you wouldn’t understand!

So what's the point of doing all this?

Really?

What?

A little cliche don’t you think?
Essentially asking Me the meaning of life

Well I figured I would ask before you send me back and I can’t remember none of this

Atom come here. The meaning of life
The reason I created this place, is so that you can grow, and mature

Like the human race?
Like this is how the human race is supposed to grow and mature?
Mature into what? We can’t even get along

No Atom, you! It’s for you, YOU to mature

I don't understand

I created this place for you, Atom
This entire place was made for you
Every time I send you back, every life you live, you grow
And mature and understand the grand meaning behind all of this
Just a little more each time

Just me? Wait, what about everybody else?

Atom, there is no one else

I don't understand

Atom, you are every human being who has ever existed since the dawn of your kind on earth

Wait, I'm everyone?

Aaahhhhh yes, now you are beginning to see it

So I’m like, everyone that ever existed on earth, ever?

Earth? Ha, that’s cute
Earth was just your birthplace
Let us not forget all the stars humanity will colonize over the millennia

Wait, that is so much
Too much to take in!
I’m every human being that ever lived?

Or ever will live, yes!

I’m Jesus?

And all of his disciples

I’m Hitler?

And the millions he murdered

That's deep

You see Atom, every act of hatred and violence you committed against another
You were committing against yourself
And every act of love and hand of kindness
You also extended unto yourself

God, why do all this?

Someday, long from now, you will become like me
You will mature to become what I am

I’m a god?

No, not yet. You see, I was once where you stand right now
It is not until you have lived every human life inside of your universe
That I may take you from this place
Once you have walked in the shoes of every race, religion, gender, sexual orientation
Loving and hateful person
It is only then that you will understand how precious life truly is",Waiting Room,2017

Jump in the whip, gotta get this gas
Put that shit in drive, I'm live like ammunition
No permission needed

Had days with hella' hate
But gotta let that anger migrate
All this shit that's on my plate
That food for thought that can't be bought
But only taught and on the real know

I can't get much higher

Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me

We be havin' a OG Kush meetin'
If we smokin' that dope it's a reason
Eyes so low from the chiefin'
I be getting high when I wake up
And roll me one more 'fore I'm sleeping
Man I be smoking so good that I be forgetting the past
It don't even come to my house if it ain't wrapped up in a turkey bag
We roll up the herb and laugh
Kick back, blowing zip
Take it on a plane, know I smoke the same when I'm on a trip
Niggas like me always got weed on 'em
Try to tell me that she don't smoke, later on she joinin'
Ain't no point goin' back, keep going in

Fuck a pill, only numb the pain
Man, you know how much that shit cost?
I ain't talking 'bout your pocket, no I am only talking about the mind
When the cannabis combine with the brain it be like everything you seen just seem to shine
Smoking that golden state, everything going great
Got a lot on my plate
Not a single complaint
Stacking money in the bank
This that RattPack and that Taylor Gang
They know the face and they know the name
I'm a married man with a bad wife
Never fuck around 'less it's Mary Jane

Buyin' fake chains at the mall so girls be like, ""Ooh, he clean""
Day dreams that my life is like a movie scene
Sippin' liquor, puffin' green so obsene
Riddin' 'round the city with my homies in a gat
We was lookin' for trouble now where's it at
Paint the picture like Picasso, matter fact like Sam Spratt
Even younger I was trippin' skippin' school writin' raps
Never on the road but on the roll like them craps
Check the facts
Endless rhyme books in my back pack
Like that, uh
I guess I acted out from lack of a father figure
Go figure performin' at open mics wishin' I could go bigger
I was never in it for the money like a gold digger
Every time my daddy call me he be like, ""Ayo nigga, where the money at?""
Now that's what he say, little boy you know you know I saw you on a PJ
When you gon' fly me out, when you gon' smoke me out
Always throw the mans out, motherfuck a hand out
All I ever wanted was a daddy
But that man priority was huggin' with a fatty
But I'm glad he did, 'cause that made me who I am
Now I'm the man I always wish he would've been
And never started smokin' crack, imagine just what could've been, damn
Always felt like somethin' it was missin'
Wish we could have played catch, had talks, and went fishin'
But had no one there to listen
Now I feel like my life mission is to be the best dad when the time comes
For my daughter and my son when the time come
Teach them 'bout their heritage and where they come from
Teach them 'bout their family history and then some

I've been on the grind tryna find my way
People come and go but I'ma be the one to stay
People tell me I should let my light get away
Heaven knows that I'm gonna make it one day
I've been on the grind tryna find my way
People come and go but I'ma be the one to stay

Yeah, yeah
Bobby don't do it to 'em
You're beautiful and you don't gotta prove it to 'em
Come on, come on, Bobby you ain't shit though
Why your personality be split though?
One minute it's PLP, the next that shit be slit throats
Devil and an angel on my shoulder that's my conscious
Greatest rapper alive but never actin' Pontius
Keep yourself in check like a dollar amount
You ain't better than nobody based on your dollar amount
Yeah you've grown accustomed to the lifestyle but you're never boujee
Now you never brand new, no it's never who's he
See I hate when I get recognized
And while the fan is hypnotized
I'm approached by random guys who feel the need to emphasize
I don't know who you are
I reply, ""I'm a gentlemen and a fuckin' rap star""
Put your lighters in the sky if you got 'em
This for anybody that feel like they at the bottom
Nobody to tell 'em they special, you know I got 'em
Nobody there to tell them they love 'em, well I got 'em, uh
No matter where you go you gotta persevere
Ain't no fuckin' around, ain't no makin' a sound you just gotta murder the fear
Yeah I've been thinkin' about it, been tryna get out of it
Fuck what I'm thinkin' it's time to break out of it
Findin' myself in the thick and the debt of it
Had a bit and I knew wanted to murder the son
And I'm ready to get it, motherfuck a critic, I'm livin' my life and

I've been on the grind tryna find my way (yeah)

Everybody know that Bobby will body anybody Like Gotti did Gambino, from Maryland to Reno
We know Tarantino a killer
But the Young Sinatra got you by the neck
And the spirit the second they hear it

Gold chains wrapped around my neck like pythons

Yeah! Greatest alive, I'm the greatest alive
I'm the greatest at being me, ain't nobody seeing me
So, check it like CMB, thats word to the DMV
I'm straight from the basement, I made it like a villain
I'm hated Word to Jermaine, this shit just ain't been the same
Never simple and plain like a bullet to the brain
I'm blowing minds, yeah I gotta kick shit with this rhyme
Second I spit it so divine thats word to your mom
Sweeping these rappers up like it's a chore, who want more?
I'll leave anybody two times four
Dropping pounds in London like I lost weight
My mindstate, is like a freight when I rhyme
Check the state of mind
Yeah, my train of thought is never off the track
When I drop it, so stop it I'm killin' 'em like a virus
After they dead I'm still in 'em, who feelin' 'em, everybody now
It's never nothin' like the first time
Nothin' like your first rhyme Nothin' like you're in there nuttin' for the first time
That's the type of shit they never tell you now

This shit right here on the real, I can't get enough
God damn, uh, I'm the motherfuckin' man
Went from gettin' close to the gang
To sipping champagne on a plane
Do what you love in life and never second guess it
Even when haters protest it now
You ever wonder what it means to
You ever wonder what it, uh
You ever wonder what it means to finally limit your dreams
Then realize that everything, it just ain't what it seems
Uh, yeah, I thought I wanted to be the greatest alive
Until I realized that being the greatest is just a lie
Like the opening words in this verse
That as soon as they disperse make other rappers converse
I'm glad to put in you a hearse, real talk fuck rap
I hate and I love it 'cause it's so negative
Everybody selfish, nobody wanna give
A helping hand to the next man, well fuck you then

Logic,"Ayo real talk, 6ix
As soon as you played me this joint I already knew
Yo this some fucking, Last Call shit
And it got me hella excited 'cause I always wanted to do like
A Last Call, I remember the first time I heard Kanye's
I thought that shit was so tight dawg
And I was like, man I'm tryna tell my story, you know what I'm sayin'
And then uh, I remember Cole did it, when did he do it?
He was on Friday Night Lights?
Nah nah, he did it on The Warm Up yo
When he did the Last Call on the warmup I was like ""Damn I'm tryna do mine
So since this joint got that vibe I'ma do my Last Call right now for y'all
And my voice is messed up too, this is the last track of Young Sinatra

Yeah, yeah
Back in the day I wasn't shit, homie
Penny pinching I couldn't even pay the rent, homie
Thinkin' 'bout it I'm wondering where the years went, homie
Just a youngin' tryna survive, they was hatin' on me
I was working that nine-to-five, I was waitin' homie
I was bussin' tables fantasizin' 'bout cakin' homie
Letting them slip away, my dreams wasn't waitin' on me
This for anyone with ambition, calling anybody that'll listen
I'm wishing all your dreams come true, 'cause mine did
And yeah, you know I had to put that in the rhyme kit
But that shit came from sacrifice
Not on the corner selling drugs and smackin' dice (listen)
Yeah

Someway somehow, I understood finally
If you want to come and get it you know where to find me
'Cause I don't got no time for anyone who be tryin' me
Know if they don't understand I'ma leave 'em behind me
Obviously
I ain't got no time, no no
I said obviously
I said I don't got no time, no, no, no

Yeah, yeah
I treat the beat like it's my only son, my DNA
And this that southern playeristic like we was in the eight
Back in the day, I was young, broke and infamous
A Young Sinatra, that was undeniable
Who welcomed you to forever while Under Pressure
And told you The Incredible True Story of Bobby Tarantino
And Everybody in the Ultra 85
Goddamn it feel good to be alive
And all these bitches that I passed up
Couldn't fuck witcha 'cause your hair was too gassed up
'Member creeping with the gat, masked up

Goddamn it's kinda crazy to reminisce on all this shit man
What it was like growing up, damn man, just, motherfuckers running in and out of the crib
Doing drugs, selling drugs, all types of stuff
Meanwhile, I was just tryna keep it together
I was tryna make sense-sense of all this shit around me
I didn't know how to take it, how to perceive it, you know what I mean
And then meanwhile I'm supposed to be going to school and getting good grades and shit
But I'm seeing like, domestic violence in my house, and just, so much going on
And I'm sure everybody was probably like, damn, yo

""Why little Bobby didn't come to school today?""
On the real, I was doin' anything to run away
And that's the same reason kids join gangs every day
'Cause they wanna be accepted, but at home they too neglected
Meanwhile, white America quick to call him a thug
But all he ever wanted was a father to give him some love
Tell him that he love him, that he need him
Promise he won't ever leave him
Never smoke crack, never lie, and will never beat him
It feel like all my life I been needing a break
Looking at my family, I ain't wanna make the same mistake
And I know that shit sound fucked up but they not all doin' great
Oh my God please, can I have a conversation with a
Member of my family without it endin' asking me for five G's
To pay they bills or they lawyer fees (huh)
I learned something, I ain't giving y'all a dime
I'll give you something worth more, that's my time
I ain't dropping stacks, I'm dropping knowledge
Unless it's for my nieces and nephews to go to college
And hit me on the phone, hit me up
Like ""Uncle Bob, where you at?
Yeah I know your pockets fat but I don't give a fuck 'bout that
I'm glad we family"" (uh)
We a half breed family, yeah, yeah, uh

Man see I remember when I was like fifteen years old and my dad took me to the studio--
I know this is random I'm just trying to take you guys through it, right
And, I'll never forget it I had like eight rhyme books--he'll tell you, he'll tell you man
I just, I went through them motherfuckers I was rapping for like fifteen minutes straight
And that was my first time yo, I was like tenth grade, in the studio
And I knew that this was what I wanted to do 
I knew it

I knew it ever since I first saw Kill Bill
I been flowin' like that blood, Uma Thurman spill
None other than the RZA, yeah he did the soundtrack
And then I discovered Wu-Tang soon as I found that
And then Big L, Mos Def, and Nas, there ain't no turning back
Couldn't change it if I tried, homie, how 'bout that
See I'm a student of the game, so simple and plain
But I'ma to take it back to before I ever sat first class on a plane

I was in College Park, right
Well I guess technically, if you wanna go before that
I was uh, I was living in Germantown, uh no actually it was in Montgomery Village
Back in Maryland I was living in my sister's basement
Then some shit happened, you know, she kicked me out, it was Christmas
Whatever I love you Genie
Anyway, so shit happened, and then I just kept it pushing
You know, I was homeless for a little while, whatever, you know, I went, uh
I stayed at my mentor's house, Solomon
And then I stayed back at my Godparent's house, Mary Jo and Bernie, I love ya'll
Uh, Mary Jo, I'm sorry back when I used to smoke, I would steal the shit out of your cigarettes
I love you, I'm sorry about that
But, you remember, always you would let me record
I'd always be recording in the attic or wherever I could so, I love you
I thank you for supporting me there
But then, she was like, ""you gotta get the fuck outta here"" too, after a while
She gave me some time, but like, I was twenty years old at this point
She was like, ""nah, you gotta get the fuck outta here and do something with your life.""
And this was right around the time I opened my first show ever for Ghostface Killah man
In Gaithersburg, right in Old Town, the shit was insane
I'll never forget it, and that's where I met my boy Lenny, Big Lenbo, wassup! 
That's right man, we just started kicking it and hanging
He lived in College park and before I, before I knew it I was living with him in his basement
And this is right around the time I met 6ix
And 6ix was going to the University of Maryland at the time, which is right down the street
So I'd always go to their dorm room
I remember there was nights I would just crash in the dorm when we was making beats
We was doing all types of shit man, when we first got out we did the first Young Sinatra
And now we on the fourth Young Sinatra motherfucker that shit is crazy man
And I remember like, I used to steal quarters from Lenny just so I could go to the 7-11 to eat 
And he was like, ""you idiot why are you stealing, just ask me bro,"" 
And I was supposed to get a job, I was sleeping in, uh, his basement on the couch
Which is the cover to my first album, Under Pressure, shout out Cathy, shout out the Rosado family
All my beautiful brown people! We made it, it's crazy, but nah nah, listen
I'm getting ahead of myself, I'm getting ahead of myself
So like, I was staying with him and I was supposed to get a job, right? 
And he was like, ""Yo, you gotta get a fucking job bro."" 
Things were going so good with the music that we kinda stopped talking about it
It seemed like every week something new was happening
And I just sat him down one day and I was like
""Look bro, please, like, can you just give me one year
Like just give me one year, man, let me put everything into this
And if I don't get it, fuck it, I'll just submit, and I'll just blame it on society."" 
And he was like, ""Bro I'ma give you one year,"" 
And for one year him, his family, all his homies, Benny, everybody man! 
They took care of me, they put, he put clothes on my back, he put food in my stomach
You know he helped me with microphones, and recording, and yo, almost a year to the fucking day bro
I signed to Def Jam
And my man, he was a land surveyor, out there making sure all the buildings get built
Rain, snow, sleet, all that shit for twelve years dawg! And when I signed my deal I said
""Fuck that! Quit your job, we're moving to LA!"" 
That shit was crazy, so we get to LA, we're staying off Coldwater Canyon
Alta Mesa, in studio city man, and I'm going to the studio with No I.D. Every day, and like, 
Shit is crazy
That's the first time I met Cole, yo shout out Cole, that's my fucking boy
Big Sean, all these homies man that I met, it was crazy, Don Cannon, everybody
That's when I first met Kev, Bobby my engineer, what up Bobby? 
It was just like, life was insane
I dropped Young Sinatra Undeniable, and that was crazy, that was insane
'Cause that was the first time

Me and my boys ever hit the road
On the real you know we went from zero to overload
Performing in front of the fans, they had their hands waving
This is all I ever wanted, this is all I'm craving
Me and my boy Chris shot the game
Two visionaries on a mission, shit ain't been the same
Some ups and downs came around, had a lot of problems
But no matter what happened you know we always solve 'em
We always solve 'em, like

Man, it's kinda crazy thinking about it though
Like so much has happened yo, and I mean shit, by the time y'all are hearing this
I'm 28, I'm 27 while I'm recording it
I mean right now literally I'm working on Bobby Tarantino, Ultra 85, Young Sinatra 4
And a whole bunch of other shit, man this is crazy! Acting, writing
Like I'm just so, I can't believe I'm here man, we grinded for so long, we worked for so long, yo
And motherfuckers they hate you man, they try to make me feel bad about how I look, how I speak
How I rap, how I act, my race, my everything, they just, they they fucking hate you man
They'll hate you when you're in this position
But you can't let 'em, you can't let 'em, you can't let that shit get to you, man
Continue to persevere, continue to be the best you you can be
'Cause I'm here right now man best friends
I got everything I could ever want man, even though you always want more deep down
And you got goals deep down, that's great, but fuck that shit, I'm so happy, I'm so blessed man
So if you're listening to this right now, no matter how old you are, how young you are
Whether you on a school bus headed to get your education
Or you driving home from work pissed off at your boss
Just man, just please do what you love in life
So many people, they always say, ""Oh I would do this but,"" or ""I can't because,"" 
And you already fucking lost, they lost, and I felt bad for that person 
'Cause that person will never make it. ""I would, but I don't have the money,"" 
""I would, but I don't have the time,"" Fuck that, you gotta do it man
You gotta do what makes you happy, you have live selfishly in that aspect
Stop worrying about others, stop freaking out, just focus on yourself man
And your own happiness, that's the realest thing, and that's all I can tell you
Because you can't help anyone else until you can help yourself, you know what I'm saying
So please, put the mask on first, like they say on the airplane, cus'
Put your own motherfucking mask on, and go do it man, go do it, just live your life

I love y'all, thank you so much for tuning in, uh
I hope you've enjoyed this Young Sinatra experience, I know I have
Uh, this is prolly gon' be the last one tho, uh, this gon' be the last one for sure
I'm coming back with some fun, but, I don't know. I love you guys! Ultra 85's gonna be crazy! 
I mean crazy! Bobby Tarantino's that trap shit, whoo! 
We took 'em back with this boom bap, now we finna head to the future
We ain't scared, we makin' music for everybody, you know what I mean? 
I love you, look at that Maryland accent coming out
I don't know why, every time I get on the mic that Maryland accent
Go ahead cuh, job like all day boy, you sound like Wale, back of your neck
I love y'all so much, Rattpack, yeah, yeah, yeah!",Last Call,2018
Logic,"How do you want to be remembered?
Being rich?
Yeah, yeah, uh

Visions of seeing my self as some what different
Reality got me feeling indifferent
I'm lifting this weight of my shoulders
But how older I get
I reload the clip and sip on something
I feel good for nothing
All my glory days behind me or beyond me
I’m folding like origami
My tables turning like interior decorating
Levels like elevators
These haters got me questioning my judgement
Tried by jury of my peers but where the judge went?
What will my legacy be?
Who will my enemy be?
In due time as I write this rhyme
I don't know
Flash before my eyes, yeah, uh
And on my deathbed what will I say as I pray?
And reminisce of another day
I came from nothing, a child born in poverty
Went to college to gain knowledge
So they would acknowledge me
Honestly I got a good job
I found a woman made her my wife
But spent more time at work
So we could have a stable life
And when my son was born
I had to work even harder
Before I knew it my wife was giving birth to my daughter
Went from 40 hours a week to 80
Ain't nobody going pay me but myself
Sacrificing my time and health for wealth
I missed a birthday, miss a anniversary
There’s lots of people in this world that are worse than me
I wasn't there for my son's first words
But he ain't grow up in the hood like me we in the 'burbs
Sacrifice a couple years he can have all the money when I'm gone
What a fool I was I missed his graduation I missed her a wedding day
I didn't even get to give my little girl away but
I paid for the honeymoon, yeah, I paid for the honeymoon
I'm not there right now but I will be later
I'm working on something that’s greater
That’s my legacy
Uh, I'm gon' be remembered by generations to come
Damn, you dumb
You won’t be remembered by your son, uh, yeah
To be remembered by generations to come
You a fool
You won't be remembered by your son
Nonsense, nonsense
I said to the man with no money, nonsense, uh, uh
Step back who running from me I don't know my own identity
I look in the mirror- look in the mirror, I ain't clearer
I’m just trying to be free, who is that, it surely ain't me
As I lay on my deathbed I realized I was wrong
I have been the richest man in the world all along
A beautiful family that all I did was ignore
For financial stability and the fear of being poor
'Cause when I was a child knew I always wanted more
When I was a child knew I always wanted more, more, more
And now I got it
And now I'm laying in this bed, cancer spreading through my lungs
Looking at my family like, ""Damn y'all were the ones""
I sacrifice my life for 100's 50's 20's 10's 5's and 1's so dumb
I'd give it all if I could do it for my heart again not my wallet
I hate to recall it but it's gone now
Legacy is gone now
Sacrifice my health for wealth no it wasn't worth it
But as I take my last breath I know that I deserved it
Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy
The legacy you gon' leave behind you forever
Is the blood in your veins
Wake up, daddy, now is the time for change
And as your child I'm telling you I don't give a damn if we living on change
Daddy just as long as we livin', just as long as we livin' daddy
I just want to be happy I don't give a damn if we livin' a shoebox
Now my mama going to tell you what you got
I love you, I love you, I love you, I want you, I need you, I crave you
Why you throw away this pussy that I gave you?
Why you fucking around behind my back?
While I'm home raising my children
Feel like a single mother even though a ring up on it
Supposed to be like husband and wife you more like my opponent
Finger fucking myself because fucking fidelity
I'd rather look in the mirror be happy who I see
Sometimes I want to take my babies and go to my mama crib
Can I live?
Can I have a life away from my life
Be the woman that I would have been if I wasn't your wife
You know I love them but if that test wasn't positive
I would have had a lot to give
Sometimes I want to divorce your ass and take half, motherfucker
But I stay 'cause I love these children
And I love you deep down, that's why I stick around, but
You never there because you just want to be the best
You just want to make this money
Come get this pussy motherfucker
Come get this pussy and love your children
Fuck your legacy
Fuck it
Float in the abyss of nothingness my consciousness remembers a life before it hits black
I wish I could get back and then I realize that all this shit is just a daydream
And there's only like four of us in a tour bus and I'm in the back, how about that?
Think about my legacy
And as how we as human beings sacrifice health for money, ain't it funny?
'Cause in the end we spent all our money on repairing our body and mind
When we really should have just spent time
Fuck a legacy
I'ma go live my life

And I tell her that she lovely
But she know that's it's all for show, it's all for show

It was an ordinary day

And the night goes

On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, and on

Oh, alright, alright

So I don't wanna let them bring me down
It's an ordinary day
I'm gonna live it how I like

It was an ordinary day

Logic,"Uh, suddenly I'm in the whip
With the gat, full clip
Out the blue, like a crip
Doin' 90 on the backroad
Outta nowhere my girl hit me on the bat phone
I could hear it in her voice, know she just wasn't alone
Then a voice I didn't recognize
Said, ""If you wanna' see your wife alive bring a million in cash and she's gonna survive""
Look at the clock, pitch black, it's 11:05
Hung up the phone you know I put that shit in Hyper-drive
Then I call my homie 6ix to tell him I'ma need his help
I'ma be outside in five get the gat under ya belt
Then I felt the sweat from my palm on the steering wheel
I tried to shake it, man, I can't believe this shit is real
Heart pumping on the 101
This shit right here ain't no fun
Live and die by the gun
Get you some
Yeah, I pull up to the crib, pick up 6ix, now we out this bitch
Only thing that's on my mind is, ""Put this fucker in a ditch""
As soon as I get there, boy I'm lightin' up that ass I'ma fill him with lead
And they never finna count the cash 'til I look up at the dash and realize I'm out of gas
So I stop at the station
Piss like probation
Tell my boy to fill up as I head inside to pay
Open the door and see a white guy at the counter named Clay
Pull out the $50 and told him to hurry
He movin' slow, like he ain't got a worry in the world
And the attitude, maybe I was actin' rude
Hold up, if the person you love was kidnapped what would you do?
He saw my gat and my jacket and froze
I told him I ain't want no problem
But he chose to reach for the shotty anyway
So I blew him away
Just tryna get some gas now his brain blast (uh)
Frozen thinkin' about what just happened
Now it's in the past
Jump in the whip 0 to 60, yeah we out fast
See that red and blue flash, damn the cops is on my ass
Hear them sirens, flashing lights in my rear view
This shit like a movie in a theater near you
120 now, I feel like OJ
(The cops are gonna get us)
No they won't, everything'll be okay
Swerve left, swerve right
Now they almost outta sight
Finna pull under the bridge, they won't spot me here at night
Slow it down, play it cool
Mama she, ain't raised no fool
Sit back breathe slow
(Holy shit) There they go
Man they found us
I don't know how but they came around us
Fuck the police, no they never do astound us
In the back of my mind I know I gotta get the cash, it's in my secret stash
Wish I had another path
Out the window I can hear the bullets blast, wish I had a mask (*Gunshots*)
Make it to the crib, that's my only task
Adrenaline in my body could take on anybody
Coming down to the wire, they blew my tire and then we flip

Freeze you motherfucker!
6ix come on get up!
I'm shot, I'm shot, what, I'm shot!
Get the fuck on the ground!
Aww fuck
They got me

He's bleeding slow, blood dripping from his torso
Will he ever get to see his son grow?
What's the picture they gon' paint after he go?
Last song he ever sung when the bullet hit his lung
Man I should've never called, he'd be alive if he ain't come
All he tried to do was help save my wife
Wish I could've saved his life
I wish I can take it back
Now my best friend's life curtain call fade to black
It just ain't no turning back
Pulled out the gat and put a bullet through the man
The blew in and came out his back
Jump in the whip, no looking back
First time in the front seat of that white and black
Side streets through the city, ain't nobody fucking with me
Yeah you know I had to duck 'em all
Screaming, ""Motherfuck the law""
Next thing I saw was a block from my crib
Thinkin' 'bout my shorty, she my rib
Pull up in the driveway
No cops in sight but might just somehow pull 'em my way
Open the stash, get the cash
Now I'm back out so I put the Audi in reverse and then I back out
Look at the addy in the text with my girl whereabouts
Five minutes later now I'm creeping in a warehouse
Lot of goons, lot of guns
Now I'm shooting just for fun
I don't give a fuck where they come from, I'm killing everyone
Finally make it to the back all alone pitch black
Hear a sound, what was that?
Think it came from over there
Lights on, now I see my wife she's tied up to a chair
With a gun to her head and a man gripping her hair
All I did was stop and stare
He took the gag out of her mouth and she started calling my name (Bobby!)
But didn't seem to be in pain, really shaken up (Bobby!)
I felt like I was waking up
So I shot him quick in the neck and he hit the floor
Before I untied her I shot him four more times
Put a bullet in his spine
Was he dead? let's see
Staring at the man, gun in his hand, it couldn't be
The man who kidnapped my wife was me

Bobby!
What?
Man get your ass up nigga, we at the studio
Say what?
Damn man. C'mon, hurry up man. What's wrong with you?
Wake up, here. Come on
Wait, we're at the studio right now? We're here already?
Damn man since you started smoking weed you always fucking late
Man shut the fuck up Kev
Stoney Bob neck ass",Street Dreams II,
Logic,"(This concludes the program)
Damn man, we been walking forever
Well, Thalia's tracking system says we'll be there in just over an hour
Shit, at least we got good walking music
Or is that it?
No man, I'm queueing up the fourth album now, his final one
Nigga, what the hell are you talkin' 'bout? Man, he has like a million albums
I mean the final Young Sinatra, the fourth one
Aww shit man you had me trippin', I was about to say (yeah, yeah)
Let's get back to this boom bap shit

Yeah
So we just gon' let this shit breathe one time
Shout-out my boy Henry right here in the studio
Ayy
Yeah
Check, check, mic check, one, two
Alright this is classic shit

Yeah, I could've never imagine that this shit here could happen
Went from the basement to thirty million just off of rappin'
Young Sinatra, that boy that brought you so many classics
Ain't never comin' with nothin' less than the illest tactics
Thought the series was over, but we just gettin' started
I won't ever leave this rap shit, no I can’t depart it
From the trap to the boom bap
Young Sinatra, to Tarantino
We know he do that
Bitch I got that flame, who dat
I'm the new Kanye when they was like, ""Who Kanye?""
I got that fire in my soul to make these classics, ayy
I decided to write this letter on a private jet
'Cause in many ways it still feels like I ain't made it yet
For every goal I attain I set like ten more
But I had to take a break to write you that's for sure
Take a moment and celebrate how we all alive
Had to write this letter here over a Nujabes vibe
Fuck that rapper shit, fuck a punchline
This for every single fan that know every single line
So I'm saying thank you for loving me
For setting me free and letting me be me

Thank you, thank you
For lettin' me speak my mind
And puttin' it all on the line
Through the sunshine and the rain
Through the good times and the pain
And never stayin' the same
And havin' the courage to change
Through the sunshine and the rain
Through the good times and the pain
For never stayin' the same
And havin' the courage to change
Thank you, thank you
For lettin' me speak my mind
And puttin' it all on the line
Through the sunshine and the rain
Through the good times and the pain
For never stayin' the same
And havin' the courage to change
Through the sunshine and the rain
Through the good times and the pain
For never stayin' the same
And havin' the courage to change

Rest in peace Mac Miller
It's been like ten years
Here we go, yeah

Visualizin' and realizin' my life is fuckin' crazy
Poppin' like Jay-Z
Dirty Dancin' on the game like Swayze
I'm one of the illest and bitch I've been ready to kill it, it's so amazin'
Bitch, I've been blazin', I'm talkin' grass, I ain't talkin' grazing
They just hit the tape while I sip scotch let the haters kick rocks
My shit is tip top and never flip-flop
Why? 'Cause my soul too strong
Did this all on my own, 'cause waiting took too long
The flow sophisticated, all these youngins do is rhyme like they inebriated
I'm hated but yeah, that's how you know I made it
I'm one of the illest, I'm one of the realest, I'm ready to kill this
The people, they feel us, me and my team made millions but you know we still us
That's why they wanna kill us, that's why they wanna kill us
RattPack real all the time, we never phony
I'm single-handedly running the game like a Sony
While the rest of these rappers is acting
Pass 'em the Tony, pass 'em the Oscar
From the new school rappers, yeah I'm the illest on the roster
Smoke like a rasta
Black and white like Bob Marley, yeah, like Bob Marley
These racist motherfuckers hate that last line
Probably haters on the internet ain't got nothing to bargain
Said I'd never make it, bitch, I just sold out the garden

Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we sip scotch
Like Sinatra, screamin', ""Motherfuck the cops""

They say they want the old Logic, the one that flow like a faucet
I'm still the same me, they just don't believe it like they Agnostic
If I spit over the Boom-Bap, then they perceive it as nostalgic
But the truth is, my subject matter has been the same
And my production selection is still flame
But they love you on the come up 'cause you ain't tainted by fame
And you still they little secret
That's the type of bullshit that they frequent
From 19, to 2019, been murderin' this shit for a decade
From the Boom-Bap to the Trap, I let my shits cascade, listen, yeah, yeah
So what's the dilly, pass the Phillie, get silly, that's on the really
We snappin' like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill, I'm talkin' achilles
Try to play me like I ain't me, but I provided all the deets'
Who you know worth fifty million, still rappin' on break beats?
From Nasty Nas, Big-L, Tribe, The Roots, and many more
Of course we could never forget Biggie and young Shakur
Fuck the police, no we ain't fuckin' with Al Pastor
I'm the bastard that mastered the flow, I said it once before fa sho
While 6ix produce the kicks from the soul, you already know
Fuck these youngins talking outta they ass with no class, I'm here to school 'em
This that real shit, I'm never foolin'
I'm killin' these squares, we call it a mass-acre
I got the bread, but these fuckers needs the dough like a baker
The legends above me love me like the RZA, like Nas, like Jay
'Cause I mastered the flow from back in the day
Respected by my peers from Drizzy to Cole to Kenny
Thank you for the love and inspiration, plenty
Yeah I'm loved by many, and only hated by a little
Now I think it's time to switch the lyricism, peep the riddle
I was born in mint condition, I'm everybody's life's mission
Alright, listen, put me 'round your neck and I might glisten
The ultimate connect, I'll get you anything you need
From good credit, to good weed I can make any woman suck seed, control you with high degree
Along with anybody that's in need, I'll make 'em beg and plead
I'm in the pocket of mafia crime lords and presidents
Without me, they'll evict you from your residence
Hov wrote about me on Dead Presidents, never irrelevant
Not a soul on earth would love me if I weren't me
No matter what year I'm in, I'm current, see?
People that have me, yeah they power's so immense
But people without me make no sense, god damn
Yeah, the world revolve around me, the law evolve around me
The shit people do to get a piece of me astound me
Blood stains my face when drug deals go wrong
I'm given to the greatest athletes when they go long
You could put me in check, but I'm still laughing all the way to the bank
I'm the reason that the Titanic sank
I'm always there for you, yeah, when it comes down to the wire
And some people even tuck me away 'til they retire
I usually come around on the first and fifteenth
If you owe me to somebody then they'll leave you beneath
People go crazy when they feel me, in the Middle East they drill me
If you let your guard down, then some people'll steal me
I knew these two dudes that's always been homies since fifth grade
Always schemin' on the block, selling crack to get paid
Now they never graduated, thought that shit a charade
Only thing on they mind that wasn't me was get laid
Then one day, they had a falling out on the block
See, one thought the other one had been stealing his rock
'Cause he coulda sworn he had more weight in his stock
Pulled out the Glock and his homie yelled 'stop!'
But before he had the chance to pull the trigger, oh shit here come the cops
They saw the gun and blew them both away
Now there's two more kids dead in the street all before twenty
Over me, the most important thing to man, money!

We just some motherfuckin' KIDS
We love and miss you Mac
For those of y'all who don't know man
Mac is the whole reason that I started doing this Young Sinatra shit
I remember I loved Lord Finesse, all the shit he did with DITC, Diggin in the Crates
Hip to the Game, one of the illest beats ever and
I remember when Mac flipped that shit for KoolAid and Frozen Pizza
I thought it was the dopest shit man
Mac showed me that I could just do it all on my own
Me and all my boys, all my homies and if it wasn't for him killing that beat
I would have never got on that beat for my very first mixtape Young Broke and Infamous, damn
It's like 2010 And I titled the track Young Sinatra
And that was the birth of all this shit
So, thank you, I appreciate you, love you and miss you, yeah

Logic,"En garde, I'll let you try my Wu Tang style
I'd like to try your Wu Tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu Tang could be dangerous (yeah, yeah)
Do you think your Wu Tang sword can defeat me? (Ayo, ayo)

Ayo, Wu-Tang forever
Who rhyme better?
We too clever, the boom bap's back, harder than ever
R.I.P. O.D.B
Comin' through like Killa Bee
Ever since I heard Enter the 36 in '93
You cannot defeat my Wu-Tang style, I leave 'em all dismembered
Fuck a mumble rap, that shit won't never be remembered
Not even a contender, no, pretender, best surrender
My agenda is killin' shit, they feelin' this (Sinatra)
Yeah, we live and thorough
Assassinatin' every single muthafuckin' borough
From Staten to Brooklyn to Queens, the Bronx and Harlem, all the way to Maryland
Yeah, we comin' for all of 'em

We gon' let these muthafuckas try this Wu-Tang style
Yo, yo, yo, yo, kaboom!
Guess who stepped in the room?
It's Ghostface, gold plates, old truths, more K
'Telligent brothers with nine hoods, movin' snowflakes
Guillotine your head, last scene in the showcase
Push weight, this Colgate
Tre-eights and old gates
Exfoliate those we most hate, we don't associate
We wear robes that you can't even pronounce-iate
We eat foods where you can't even pronounce you ate
Cribs where the floor just rises up and rotates
Locations low-key, can't even locate
Twin nina sisters with the beam, we all soulmates
Tea makin' us so much cream, we bought gold plates

Yo, mountains of haze in the crib of my blades
It gets messy underneath the dresser, the gauge
Five-seven MB, yo, metallic green
Seats is piped off
Seize them old tracks, unite through 'em
The kitchen is my palace, get your dance on
While we just levitate with trees, get your branch on
I'm known to wile out, put the cams on
Jewels down, the sets dip, my gems got grams on
A specialist when I'm bakin'
Rhymes be comin' out, we makin'
We challengin' these chumps for lumps
Here's the statement: stop hatin'
The crew is all about gettin' this cake in
You know about me, you relatin'

The enigma, the stigmas that the RZA and the GZA
Both lyrical prolific, fixtures of rap scriptures
Mixtures of hipsters, weed smokers and beer drinkers
Prince and the Pauper, spiritual clear-thinkers
Cake in the oven, Superbad like McLovin
Huggin' all four boroughs
Puffin' herb with my cousin
Academically speaking, rap vocabulary's weakenin'
I felt it comin' like the Weeknd when these starboys start tweakin'
Sporadic pill-poppin' of OxyContin
Ill-gotten sexual intercourse make shorty wop feel rotten
The travesty-tapestry of microphone mastery has been refuted
Diluted, broken down to a catastrophe
But cats still get the trophy
Hit y'all with their ""Okie-dokie""
Burt Reynolds, Bandit, goddammit
Where the fuck is Smokey Bear when you need one
I got a light-beam gun
I'll blast a hole in your chest that you can't bleed from
But you'll die through iniquity, plus stupidity of that trickery
My verse got it hot up in here, not the humidity
You can never get rid of me, step back and consider me
Wu Killa Bee, but I'm not big on bigotry

Old-school on this track, I feel invincible
This new school ain't really got rules and lacks the principles
Got mo' clowns than the Motown, they puttin' critical
The gun smokey, Robinson, you need a Miracle
Go back, homie, back when rappers used to be lyrical
When nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminals
The stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals
Y'all don't even smile in your pictures, you dudes is miserable
We're the unpredictable, torture over your physical
Drop a bar, used to pour water over the cereal
Another bar, reppin' my squad, not individual
But one Nation under God, that's indivisible
My time critical, hands-off from digital
Me and my lady bark, back when the Planets was Digable
I'm cool like that, my cash rule like that
I'm classic, Patti LaBelle, Voulez Vous like that, come on

It's only Logic, we got 'em mobber than the mosh pit
Fifth Brother, INS hotter than the tropics
The hot shit I drop quick
Major player, watch my stock lift
Razor-blade sharpness regardless to whom or what
Sound boy, turn that music up
Naysayer, you ain't even got a clue what's up
Deadly melody, the sickness, the remedy
Everything circulate back around eventually
Witty, unpredictable, talent all-natural
Gain, Wu-Tang pumpin' through your veins
Twenty-five years, still more of the same
The flow like water with the boilin' flame
INS, your highness, they callin' my name
Boy, I wet the scene similar to fallin' rain
In our own lane, y'all soundin' all the same
Tell 'em Wu-Tang is on your brain

Survival of the fittest in cold days with no money
They don't want me with stacks, they better take it from me
You know the currency gone soon as you break a twenty
So I ain't down if you ain't talkin that band language
Dear Lord, I'm tryna buy me a train with it
An airplane, see me flyin' to Spain with it
But money don't make me, and I ain't gonna change with it
I'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it
Do it for the Cs, they understood the game with it
We gave birth when we understood the pain with it
When we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger
We killin' each other, but we all got the same anger
Never go against the grain, homie, that's hateful
Another day in the life for us to be grateful
Spread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful
It's better to stay full, so let's make moves
I know your momma told you that I was a great dude
These dirty-ass cops, they kill and rape you
On some Jason shit, might Crystal in the Lake you
What? What what? They might Crystal in the Lake you

Boom bap blast'll blow your sleeves off
Our Flashback Jacks are somethin' to feed off
Smoke and roast ya, the No.9 Potion
Pull that shit, son, we open the ocean
Who gives a fuck who's snortin' and drinkin' and smokin'
You get killed for jokin', everybody's hopin'
That's another level of emotion
Food stamps niggas doin' grocery
Police wanna grope me, perp walk, then nigga street-talk
We bury niggas in see-saw
I carry the torch where I leave off
I'm givin' bitches somethin' to breathe on
I rip off a shoulder to lean on
It's fair game, it's two in a lane, she took two trains
And none of my rhymes are two and the same
Nigga get cooked on an open flame
I'm a hillbilly, Park Hill-trained

Thirty-six million and countin'

To hold my microphone you need iron palms
Remain calm, just mellow out
Big wise chief Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah

Enter a world of a universal mind of one kind
A thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme
Food for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning

The uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz
Self-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts
A point-of-view of the thinkers
Monumental architecture, amazing as the Incas

Loïc Nottet,"My mother told me not to go near mirrors
For it seems that one day
A young boy died through looking at himself for too long

People say that they are ravenous
That they hunger for perfect reflections
That their insatiable appetites can even kill

Many are those among us who lose themselves in mirrors
Too many who only live for appearances
Aware that he is not the fairest of all, man is jealous and evil
And aware that he is not the ugliest of all, man is boastful and arrogant

The mirrors distort us, they hatch outsized egos inside us
Selfish. Self-centered
This is what they are reflecting from mankind
Why help someone if his misfortune allows us to advance?

Because it would seem that the more we look in them
The more our ears stop listening and our eyes stop seeing

Lois Andrea,"À Marseille, y’a des beaux quartiers et des bâtiments pourris
Y’a aussi plus de clandestins que de touristes
Chez nous, c’est tranquille. Ça sert à rien de courir.
Sauf quand le vendeur à la sauvette dit Hakhay à la police
Les gens sont ouverts, tout le monde se fait la bise
Ça squatte le P.M.U. tout en espérant rafler la mise
Le ciel bleu, O.K., ça fait plaisir
On est loin du stress des métros parisiens, de l’humeur dépressive
Une chaleur étouffante, tous les jours
Y’a des journées merdiques, comme quand une mouette te chie sur tes shoes
C’est plus l’époque de Marcel Pagnol,
C’est l’Algérie, la Tunisie, les Comores, le Sénégal et le Maroc
C’est très cosmopolite
Tu peux serrer des minettes avec de la tchatche ou bien avec un gros bolide
On est tous fiers de Zinedine et de Basile Boli
Quand tu lèves les yeux au ciel, c’est Notre-Dame qui domine.

Si tu veux faire ta vie à Marseille
Viens faire un tour, l’ami, c’est mortel
Y’a la mer, le soleil, l’O.M. et les collègues
Le beau temps règlera tes problèmes

Le soleil, c’est bon pour se détendre
Prends ta serviette, on va s’étendre
Ici c’est le foot ou la pétanque
Les taxis ont la chemise ouverte, la chaîne en or qui brille
Les contrôleurs se prennent pour des civils
Les chauffeurs de bus prennent vingt minutes de pause au terminus
Et les mythos te font avaler la pilule
Le sport que tout le monde pratique, c’est coureur de jupon
Ne sous-estime pas l’intelligence du plus con
Tout le monde sèche les cours au mois de mars, en classe il fait trop chaud
Ça se taille à la plage entre potos
Ça klaxonne dans les rues après une victoire de l’O.M.
Les deuils tournent, parfois les nouvelles sont mauvaises.
Y’a des mariages, des cortèges, c’est un peu comme partout
Les daronnes dans la rue en djellaba et en babouches
On exagère, on parle sans tabou
On avance quand ça roule
Avec la fougue, les soirs de match, on se retrouve tous dans la foule

Si tu veux faire ta vie à Marseille
Viens faire un tour, l’ami, c’est mortel
Y’a la mer, le soleil, l’O.M. et les collègues
Le beau temps règlera tes problèmes

Y’a que des filles sexy, des mecs bronzés sur des gros cubes
La routine du quotidien nous occupe
On parle de la vie sur une terrasse de café
On est pépère, on est entre amis, c’est parfait
C’est toute une ambiance, un état d’esprit, une manière de vivre
Même en hiver, la chaleur nous enivre
Ma ville a ses qualités et malheureusement ses défauts
Bienvenue si tu veux passer à autre chose
Viens, viens…

Viens faire un tour à Marseille
Le sourire est au bout des lèvres
Viens faire un tour l’ami
La misère est moins pénible au soleil, moi j’y crois
On oublie le manque d’oseille
Les soucis et les galères
Y’a tout pour s’y plaire
Eh ouais mon pote

My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again

Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong

Is living again

Lois Sage,"Honey come here
I have something to tell you
It won't make things perfect
And it may not make sense
But someday you'll see it as clear as my smile
Do you know the word temporary ?
It means only for a little while 

And everything is temporary
A friend moves, a tooth aches
A pet dies, a toy breaks
The detours a life takes
Temporary

Everything is temporary
A storm clears, a tear dries
A wing heals, a brid flies
The trust lighting in your eyes
Temporary

I know you want things to stay the same
I know it's hard to watch a childhood
Going up in smoke
It's hard for me to watch a child
Who's growing up
And choke back all the warnings
I could scream
To protect you from the things
That aren't as solid as they seem
But then, I'm only temporary

Everything is temporary
A child leaves, a heart breaks
A love dies, a world shakes
The difference one life makes
Temporary

The trick is:
Hold it now as tightly as you can
Whether it's your favorite toy
Or a sad little boy who's trying hard
To be a brave little man
Hold it tighter 'cause you know
You'll have to let it go

If you learn this, though
You won't feel so sad:
A playmete, a tearstain
A Christmas, a dad
The best times
The worst pain
All temporary

Lois Williams,"Why don't you haul off and love me one more time
Why don't you squeeze me until I'm turning blind
If you don't cuddle up and love me like I want you to do
I'm a gonna haul off and die over you

They say the love bug will get you at the age of forty-three
Well I'm not telling my age but something's got a hold of me
I'm just craving some lovin' in that old fashion way
Honey linger near and listen to all I had to say
Why don't you haul off...
[ steel ]
Now darling come a little closer put your little hand in mine
Let me feel your arms about me honey please don't change your mind
Cause my lovesick heart's a troublin' as I hold you close to mine
I'm bout havin' lot of lovin' waitin' for me on the line
Why don't you haul off...

Loisiana's Leroux,"There's something happening here 
What it is ain't exactly clear 
There's a man with a gun over there 
Telling me I got to beware 

I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

There's battle lines being drawn 
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong 
Young people speaking their minds 
Getting so much resistance from behind 

It's time we stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

What a field-day for the heat 
A thousand people in the street 
Singing songs and carrying signs 
Mostly say, hooray for our side 

It's s time we stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 

Paranoia strikes deep 
Into your life it will creep 
It starts when you're always afraid 
You step out of line, the man come and take you away 

We better stop, hey, what's that sound 
Everybody look what's going down 
Stop, hey, what's that sound

Dark waters rise, and thunder pounds

The wheels of war, are going round

And all the walls, are crumbling
Shelter me Lord underneath your wings, shelter me Lord underneath your wings 
The wind can blow, the rain can pour
The deluge breaks, the tempest roars
But in the storm my spirit sing
Oh shelter me Lord underneath Your wing
Shelter me Lord underneath Your wing
Now on the day, You call for me
Someday when time, no more shall be

Loktavious,"I'm more addictive than the strongest drug, or so I'm told
I've made a lot of enemies, I'll probably never see until I'm old
Giving this concoction life, a portrait of a simple beast
Human nature corrupted by manufactured disease
Should I dumb it down, or can you all maintain your focus
Surely you don't admire those who only preach what's bogus
Yea I like a drink or two, but you kids are a little crazy
Down a fifth of vodka, then pray y'all don't make babies
Are all the parents in the country Tied up and left for dead?
I doubt it, but c'mon folks use what's left inside ya head
Teach your children how to think, don't force upon them how you see
If you push 'em to the darkness, it will be I who sets them free

Everybody got a song about drugs, sex, and no control
Sure it brings the bread, but at the price of ones own soul

Than a million boring tracks that don't describe an ounce of me

I'd rather have a single song that changed a persons destiny
Than a million boring tracks that don't describe an ounce of me

A monster, a mongrel
An outcast among rebels
Heart cut up and stepped on by strange, hypnotic devils
Not about this charismatic speaker, though the description fits well
I'm just trying to relate to those stuck within their own hell
Introductions over, I am glad you all came
Utilize serpent mentality, make em remember my name
More wicked than the wicked ones, inflicting your pain
More stranger than the strangers
Who reside in the rain
I can be the you come to when your depressed/down/sad
I can be another soul lost in a riot seething mad
I can be the one you pray to, or the one you hate with all your heart
I can promise nothing, but I'll listen and I think that is a start
I see so many kings, ripped away from their throne
So many battered women scarred, confused and alone
I see so many children lost in this twisted maze
What we call life, some seen as pawns to be played
I see the masses gathered, drowning in sorrow flavored liquor
You claim to love life, but I've never seen you pass it quicker
Altering your brainwaves the anti-hitler
I'm hitting close to home, and you've never heard it sicker

Too long have we been stuck on this same page
Now turn it, and burn it, and never ever look back
Move forward my son, even if the future looks black
Too many young lives tainted and too many lost
Some relish in their mortal triumphs, ignoring the cost
This is my rebellion amongst the rebels, I'm lashing out
You're either with me or against me, ain't no room for doubt
I'm declaring war on the system and all who reside within it
I'm here to corrupt your mind and push myself up to the limit
You see I'm stranger than you, uh, think you are
And I know what I need to do to pretend to be a star
I'm evolving slowly, but it's just enough to make a splash
I grab the mic, and spit a flow and knock you on your fucking ass
Really? You getting sad? And this was a big surprise?
Were you expecting the same old shit when Loktavious Rise?

Well sorry to disappoint, I mean I am here to please
But it's hard when the masses have the attention span of fucking fleas
British Petroleum still on our land, and our soldiers still over seas
Fukushima getting worse, and notice the lack of all bees?
We eat food-like products, and all complain of health
All working like machines just focusing on wealth
A constant battle to conform
Not concerned about ones self
I'm disgusted by the world, and I think I need some help

Ya, have heard the rumors? Yo,have you heard the flow?
Have you seen the bobs and weaves, a walking shadow at the show
Sending shivers down your spine like a deep dark winter snow

I'd like to talk imaginary value, and profiteering off false crimes
About old white folks fighting to keep it like old times
About generation hip-hop, sentenced to harsh fines
Like shady predicted, a million of us, just trying to spit dope rhymes

We just trying to get drunk and get laid, that shits hilarious
Transcend corporate mind state while the sophistic stay nefarious
You're all common whores, I'm the next ripper and I'm the scariest
I diss you then drive off in my funky ford focus chariot

My intentions are to bury this
Rhyme into your skull
Send you into carelessness
With a single chakra pull
Rappers say they goin hundred
Looks like they goin null
Many said they was the sharpest
But when I try to feel em it is dull

Step back, reload, ragnarok commence
False-flag, breaking news, all rights suspend
No terrorists attacking, so they play pretend
Capitalistic diplomats making foes from friends

Meanwhile, the citizen is expected to conform quietly
A few billion souls trapped inside of rothschild's monopoly
Using black magic rebranded as politics and economy
Cameras two four seven, so I ask you why not be an oddity?

Now question authority, im backed by minority
And in all truth, we be the majority
Sorry man, I just go into rants
I start talking bout noise, then the hours have passed
I like joints, blunts are just too much paper
Don't give me grief, or I call you darth hater
Little dog syndrome with your limp lightsaber
Me? Sex with your sister while you jerk it to your neighbor
Yea, because I'm twiztid just like this
Rippin every one of you out of your ignoratic bliss
Do you wanna be, like mommy and dad?
Or do you wanna remain stuck in the toybox land?

Cause sickology 101 is now in session
Teaching you how to flow, like a pro, in your dimension
With verses that go and echo in your reflection
Now add verbs to adverbs to make sure you are heard
And research your topics like you was some nerd
Push back, stand strong, use the beat as a shield
Then cut them all to pieces with the blade that you wield
Cause in a war like this, the mic is so much more
Leavin every punk bitch with they jaw on the floor
Another underground sucka getting up in the fight
Y'all be dissin while I'm spittin and im like

Took some shots with Miley
Bought a boat and took it all and that's why you feelin smiley

Deny me
Individuality of my peers
Control me
Until I'm lost in the years
Guide me
Right into my deepest fears
I don't wanna think, I wanna dance and party
I want deep bass so you can hear me hardly
I wanna get drunk, high, thizzled, zoned, gnarly
Stuck, fucked up, heaping up wheat and barley
Scar me
Direct me to your ego bubble
Harm me
Tell me that I cause no trouble
Make me give ya

Now anti-po assemble, it is you who i choose

Tie em down, slice em up, from they head to they feets
One thousand little cuts, drag they ass down the street
Burn off all they clothes and fuck they corpse to the beat

so I chose the last compartment

I felt someone get in behind me
but I never caught their eye
but I thought I heard I heard a woman''s voice
whispering goodbye

So I lay down in the darkness
with the beer and coffee stains
and I stared out at the thunder
through the broken window panes
And although the storm was booming
like an engine in the sky
I''m sure I heard a woman''s voice cry

Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb
it''s over and done
I''ll never be under your thumb forever

So I rolled myself a cigarette
and smoked it on my own
but it didn''t stop the whispers
or the smell of her cologne
Then she rose up out of nowhere
and her hair was full of steam
and she stuck her head out the window
and screamed and screamed, she screamed!

Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb forever
Don''t wanna be under your thumb

and I noticed something very strange indeed
So I looked a little closer
and it chilled me to the bone

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same

Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me

Turn the radio up real far
To shut out the noise
So I can hear my voice

There's a party on down the street
But nobody invited me and I got a gig
Babysitting my uncle's kids
Why me, I just wanna see

Don't you know that I'm a hip hop queen
A rock and roll dream it's all bling bling
I'm the star on the scene
Yeah, check me out see what I'm all about
I'm the one that you want the one you can't have
The girl that you call who doesn't ever call back
Just look at me I've got everything
But then I woke up

I was lying on the couch
Drool coming out my mouth
Turned on the TV
Dr. Phil won't you please fix me

I'm waiting for the phone to ring
Flipping through a magazine
Why doesn't he call
Guess I'm the loser down the hall

Cerrado nunca y estar mirándolos

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Finding another world.

A Monday, a Monday is very, very good
Or you can kiss me on a Tuesday
A Tuesday, a Tuesday, in fact I wish you would
Or you can kiss me on a Wednesday
A Thursday, a Friday and Saturday is best
But never, never on a Sunday
A Sunday, a Sunday, 'cause that's my day of rest
 
Most any day you can be my guest
Any day you say, but my day of rest
Just name the day that you like the best
Only stay away on my day of rest
 
Oh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day
A wet day, which everyone you choose
Or try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day
A pay day, and see if I refuse
And if you make it on a bleak day
A freak day, a week day, why you can be my guest

But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""

You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance with You,2005
Lole,"I'm in the mood for a sad song, one that cries on it's own
And we can sing it together, so I don't cry all alone
Seems I don't know where to go, since she went away
And the room's spinning faster, as the record plays
It's the one that reminds me of much better days
I'm in the mood for a memory, one that lives on and on
If I relive the laughter, then it won't feel like she's gone
I can't remember when I smiled, since she went away
I keep reaching behind me, today's so hard to face
And the silence reminds me of much better days
And it's too long to morning, since she's not in my sights
She's the one that could move me, but she's out of sight
Why am I holding on, I should let it fade
Take me back to better days
Take me back to better days
Take me back to better days
Take me back to better days",Better Days,2008
Lole Y Manuel,"El sol nos olvidó ayer sobre la arena, 
nos envolvió el rumor suave del mar, 
tu cuerpo me dio calor, tenía frío, 
why allí, en la arena, entre los dos nació este poema, este pobre poema de amor para ti. 

Mi fruto, mi flor, mi historia de amor, mis caricias. 
Mi humilde candil, mi lluvia de abril, mi avaricia. Mi trozo de pan, mi viejo refrán, mi poeta. 
La fe que perdí, mi camino why mi carreta.
 Mi dulce placer, mi sueño de ayer, mi equipaje. 
Mi tibio rincón, mi mejor canción, mi paisaje.
 Mi manantial, mi cañaveral, mi riqueza. 
Mi leña, mi hogar, mi techo, mi lar, mi nobleza.
 Mi fuente, mi said, mi barco, mi red why la arena. Donde te sentí donde te escribí mi poema.

I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power
Just like a prayer you know I'll take you there

I hear your voice, it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice, I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes, Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky, I close my eyes
Heaven help me

When you call my name it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there

You're in control just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream, no end and no beginning
You're here with me, it's like a dream
Let the choir sing

I'm down on my knees, I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour I can feel your power

Loma Mar Quartet,"Volver a los diecisiete después de vivir un siglo 
Es como descifrar signos sin ser sabio competente 
Volver a ser de repente tan frágil como un segundo 
Volver a sentir profundo como un nino frente a dios
Eso es lo que siento yo en este instante fecundo 

Se va enredando enredando, como en el muro la hiedra 
Y va brotando, brotando como el musguito en la piedra 
Como el musguito en la piedra, ay si, si, si 

Mi paso retrocedido, cuando el de ustedes avanza 
El arco de las alianzas ha penetrado en mi nido 
Con todo su colorido se ha paseado por mis venas 
Y hasta la dura cadena con que nos ata el destino 
Es como un dia bendecido que alumbra mi alma serena 

Se va enredando, enredando, como en el muro la hiedra 
Y va brotando, brotando como el musguito en la piedra 
Como el mus guito en la piedra, ay si, si, si 

Lo que puede el sentimiento no lo ha podido el saber
Ni el mas claro proceder ni el mas ancho pensamiento 
Todo lo cambia el momento colmado condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente de rencores y violencias 
Solo el amor con su ciencia nos vuelve tan inocentes 

Se va enredando, enredando, como en el muro la hiedra 
Y va brotando, brotando como el mus guito en la piedra 
Como el mus guito en la piedra, ay si, si, si 

El amor es torbellino de pureza original 
Hasta el feroz animal susurra su dulce trino
Retiene a los peregrinos, libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros, al viejo lo vuelve nino 
Y al malo solo el canino lo vuelve puro y sincero 

Se va enredando, enredando, como en el muro la hiedra 
Y va brotando, brotando como el mus guito en la piedra 
Como el mus guito en la piedra, ay si, si, si 

De par en par la ventana se abrió como por encanto 
Entro el amor con su manto como una tibia mañana 
Y al son de su bella diana hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín al cielo le puso a retes 
Y mis anos en diecisiete los convirtió el querubín 

Se va enredando, enredando, como en el muro la hiedra 
Y va brotando, brotando como el mus guito en la piedra 
Como el mus guito en la piedra, ay si, si, si",Volver a Los Diecisiete,2002

Et faire du lèche-cul à des gars mielleux pour gagner peu
J'ai fini par changer les rôles, quoi
Ce rythme va m'enlever des forces, moi
Je ne risque pas d'accepter d'vivre mal
Allez, j'me tire de là sans traîner, au revoir
J'aurai moins l'impression d'encaisser gauches-droites
Dans la face comme un boxeur poids lourd
J'changerais bien leurs têtes en donuts

J'suis prêt à tout laisser derrière même si la route est périlleuse
J'garde cette idée précieusement, j'étouffe à l'intérieur
Ça fait trop longtemps que j’attends ça j'en deviens très sérieusement désireux
J'emmerde les cadres en costard fiers de leurs apparences
Nan, j'attends plus rien des passants qui veulent savoir c'que font mes parents

Petit à petit je m'sens bouillonner, c'est comme si mon corps était envahi par du soufre et du feu dévastateur

Rester en caleçon, glaçon dans un ginger ale
Ou même un spliff de verte sur un balcon
Hé garçon, c'est pas compliqué d'atteindre le chill de rêve
Je ne laisserai jamais la vie me faire les fessiers
J'y ai remédié pour un salaire de chien à quoi sert de saigner?
Le paradis m'attend, alors dis moi qui va m'empêcher d'y mettre les pieds, putain!

Moi, j'passe pour le bouffon en donnant plus de vrai love
Même si j'en récolte peu, j'reste calme et si les autres
Sont remontés, j'vais pas m'rabaisser à faire comme eux

À dire vrai, au fond, je n'ai besoin d'rien
Les besoins n'sont rien qu'des barrières en plus
Le bout de route qu'on a, il faut le faire bien
Et nos ennemis n'sont pas des cerbères en peluche
Ils ont le pouvoir et le fric dans le barda
On vient d'là où les mômes planquent un pompe sous le parka
On m'a tant répété que taper c'est normal
Les faibles ne le font pas, que l'vice m'a happé
Persuadé d'être le juste dans ma tête
J'suis devenu, de fait, le lion dans la steppe
Quel fou, certes, maniant un couteau
Inconscient d'être un mouton dans le troupeau
Souris sincèrement parce que les gens je les aime
Amour, amitié vraies m'ont changé les ailes
Chaque jour, j'en appelle à ce côté sobre
Bien rapper, est-ce vanter le côté sombre ?
J'pense pas et dans le fond du puits
J'ai fait les cent pas, loin, si loin des sommets
Il zigzague ici, illico et comé
Chez nous, on parle pas de crimes, on les commet
Pour qui jure d'être bon, c'est pour les cons
Bien, saisis ces mots
Laisse-moi essayer d'être un idiot
Un type bien comme je l'imagine
Nage libre dans ces vers et ces mélodies magiques
J'passe au-dessus même quand la vie me provoque

Un jour je m'réveille, merde, il est pas trop tard
J'veux pas être rongé par la Haine comme Hubert, Vince et Saïd",Passe au-dessus,2014
Lomepal,"La plupart des belles choses que j'ai vu sont des mirages
J'ai tout à fait conscience que je vis dans un monde imaginaire
J'ai fermé les yeux sur l'enfer et tous ses visages
Sur le chantier du paradis tous les rêveurs peuvent devenir architectes

Moi je sais très bien tout ce qu'ils cachent
Je vois tout ce que ces faux anges me prennent
Les écouter serait trop dangereux, ils voudraient m'ouvrir les yeux
Mais leur monde est plus beau quand je rêve
Les démons font du forcing, je m'échappe de l'ombre avant qu'ils n'interviennent
Dès le matin j'ride ce monde en faisant comme si
Chaque seconde était la dernière
Le grand départ se rapproche, j'garde la gorge nouée
J'essaie de méditer parmi les donneurs de leçons
Je sais qu'ils se tairont tous si je sors une arme de ma poche
Ça y est je commence à perdre la tête, merde
La névrose m'a rendu peut être amer, merde
Moi j'ai rien contre toi mais pour un détail on pourrait se faire la guerre merde
Chérie je sais tu as besoin que j'prenne plus souvent soin de toi
J'essaierai d'être moins distant
Je sais que je suis sur une autre planète
Mais sur Terre je me sens coincé et ce n'est pas une coïncidence
Je dois comprendre la raison de ma venue
La vie est trop courte pour rester en place
Et si un jour la mort me donne rendez-vous
Peu importe, j'ai toujours été en retard

Je m'détache de cette planète, le sentiment le plus pur de ma vie
Sur Terre je suis chez moi mais les étoiles et la lune me fascinent
Ici c'est toujours plus de misère, plus de crasse
Mes voisins l'ont accepté sans verser une seule larme
Je suis peut être du mauvais côté du mur de l'asile
J'essaie de m'éloigner du danger mais c'est long
L'eau a bon goût et l'alcool est meilleur
Mais quand j'en bois je joue à colin-maillard
Avec des anges et des démons
Seigneur sur terre, majesté dans mon monde
Des fois j'me perds dans mes pages, J'deviens trash
En oubliant c'que mon image et mes chansons montrent
On m'a souvent dit que cette passion m'allait bien
Le rap m'a fait perdre ma réputation de galérien
Mais j'sais qu'un beau jour ça disparaîtra comme un avion malaisien
Je ne suis pas un frotteur de pompe, non
Je ne suis pas un donneur de leçon, non
Pardon à mes fans, j'ai arrêté d'écrire des textes naïfs contre l'horreur de c'monde pour que le bonheur se montre, non
Ça sert à rien, le futur ? on verra bien
Pour l'instant j'écris des rimes jusqu'à devenir complètement maboule
J'sais pas si je continuerai demain, mais ce soir je vais plonger dans la foule
Dans la bonne direction depuis le départ
Sur mes gardes je ne perds pas de vue ma trajectoire de jeune prince
Mais si un jour je m'égare, pétasse, rappelle moi ce refrain

La plupart des belles choses que j'ai vues sont des mirages
J'ai tout à fait conscience que je vis dans un monde imaginaire
J'ai fermé les yeux sur l'enfer et tous ses visages
Sur le chantier du paradis, tous les rêveurs peuvent devenir architectes",Avion malaisien,2015
Lomepal,"""J'crame le cro-mi à pas de lièvre"", c'est là que débute l'histoire
J'n'ai pas encore une vie d'Roi, j'ferai en sorte que ça l'devienne
J'trouve l'inspi' après quatre bières, ma vie est presque accomplie
Mais j'n'ai même pas encore un quart de siècle
Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire?
Est-ce que les autres rappeurs flippent?
Dois-je me méfier d'un empoisonnement à l'arsenic?
Dois-je surveiller ma tasse de gin?
Mes gâteaux, mes pâtes aux beurre, tout ça juste parce que je représente l'avenir
J'vous fais parvenir une info, le monde s'est trompé
J'ai enduré la vie dure d'un autre
En vrai, j'suis pas né pour rester debout
J'suis né pour rester assis sur un trône

Appelez-moi Majesté
Appelez-moi Majesté

Appelez-moi comme vous voulez mais rappelez-vous que Lomepal a les dents longues
Vous devez prendre ce paramètre en compte
Parallèlement, j'ai perdu trop d'temps à taffer dans l'ombre
Si vous n'avez jamais rêvé d'palaces et d'rentes
C'est qu'on ne parle pas la même langue
Meilleur de jour en jour, plus j'améliore mes atouts
Plus je crains de les perdre, l'avenir est souvent flou
Et le passé tourne en boucle et les chemins se répètent
J'entends encore les cris du jeune prince que j'étais
Rendez-moi ce qui me revient de droit
Le trône, le sceptre, la couronne, un royaume, une forteresse
De l'or et un trésor secret, il me tarde de briller
J'essaie de m'calmer mais le jeune prince n'arrête pas de crier
Rendez-moi ce qui me revient de droit, mon empire doit naître
Je le répéterai jusqu'à ce que justice soit faite
Miroir, dis-moi que je vais devenir roi, merde
J'ai bossé comme un chinois pour que l'histoire
De ma victoire devienne une histoire vraie
Plus tard, j'aurai des dragons que j'apprivoiserai
Et un palais avec plus de pièces qu'un tiroir caisse
Miroir, dis-moi, foutu miroir
Ah et puis merde, je brillerai jusqu'à c'que ce miroir pète

Appelez-moi Majesté
Appelez-moi Majesté
Appelez-moi Majesté
Appelez-moi Majesté

J'ai toujours su que je ma vie valait la peine
Déjà petit, c'est moi qui avait la fève
J'ai toujours su que je ma vie valait la peine
Déjà petit, c'est moi qui avait la fève

J'refuse de faire partie du commun des mortels
Putain, j'ai connu la poisse, moi, promis juré
Mais j'me suis pris en main comme la crosse d'un revolver
Juste pour avoir droit à la vie de Roi, quoi?
Qui va m'empêcher de l'atteindre, c'est
Toujours plus dur quand t'es près d'la fin, j'ai
Tellement traîné qu'ça m'pince, aujourd'hui j'me sens baisé
Ça accapare mes pensées dès l'matin, bref
Ma vie un film, j'sais pas qui est à la réal
Mais j'sais qu'son succès est prévu
J'vais pas faire comme si ce n'était pas agréable
J'ai toujours su que j'étais l'élu
Mais j'ai quand même traité les autres d'égal à égal
Ouais, alors où est leur gratitude?
Dites-leur bien qu'je n'suis qu'en partie humain, merde
Mon putain d'blaze figurait déjà sur les premiers papyrus
L'histoire d'un modeste peintre de Paris Sud
Qui a la magie du pinceau, je m'habitue à ma future vie
Les risques d'échouer sont quasi-nuls
Bref, je récapitule, chaque putain d'être humain
Est né dans ce monde avec une aptitude
La mienne c'est d'être assis sur un trône

Appelez-moi Majesté
Appelez-moi Majesté
Appelez-moi Majesté
Appelez-moi Majesté

J'ai toujours su que je ma vie valait la peine
Déjà petit, c'est moi qui avait la fève

Désolé, rien ne peut empêcher ça
À la base j'ai pas d'talent, j'ai pas d'don mais personne ne reste esclave de son destin

Bientôt 8 ans qu'ce jeu m'a charmé
Mais moi j'suis pas un chanceux j'suis un jeune acharné

Pourquoi tous les enfoirés frustrés veulent me faire des ennuis 
Comme si je méritais pas mon siège
Comme si j'étais né pour rester debout

Tout nu sur le trône le tissu royal me caresse les deux boules

J'attends la fin d'la tempête
J'aurai encore décuplé mes forces dans l'heure

J'ai plus le cul entre deux chaises j'ai mis les couilles sur la table
J'veux faire le bien mais parfois j'y pense après
J'ai bien écouté tout ce que ma madre m'a dit (maman)

Une centaine de tours de soleil ça passe vite, hein mon vieux?
En plus c'est dur de voir son blaze vivre, hein mon vieux?
Il est, il est 5h, Paris s’éveille
J'allume une trompette sur une place vide
Est-ce que tu me sens?
Suffit d'oublier les angoisses qui font des barrages
L'alcool les fait fuir, bon débarras
Je suis seul à faire la fête quand il se fait tard
Là où le présent peut se diviser en une dizaine de futurs
Est-ce que tu me sens?
En vadrouille jusqu’à l'infini
Chaque jour je paye le prix de la vie libre
On m'a dit que tout irait bien
Mais j'ai quand même un mauvais feeling
Est-ce que tu me sens? (hey)
J'essaye de comprendre les règles du jeu
Même quand je suis défoncé je dis ""bonjour"", je suis bien éduqué
Pourtant j'ai des absences comme un député
Est-ce que tu me sens?

J'rallume ma trompette, je me pose des réponses
Je trouve des questions
Mais je tire quand même une autre latte
Shit plein de plastique comme l'eau de la mer
On fera des meilleurs choix dans l'au-delà
Sur ma planète, j'ai vu la braise et le verglas naître
J'tiens pas en place mais je peux pas blâmer ceux qui choisissent de planer toute l’année
Toute façon si j'impose ma liberté qui va m’obéir?
J'ai que des idées, je peux pas contrôler tout ce qui arrive à mon pays
Intelligent sombre, tout le monde se tait quand l'or parle
Les gens sont plus égocentriques qu'une chanson de Lomepal
Promis, Antoine connaît ses défauts
Mais avec le temps les promesses se déforment
Qui peut m'faire la leçon?
Vie rapide et inédite, au travail en caleçon
Chaque matin j'ai des idées de hit, j'aide le monde à ma façon
Toute façon je sais pas quoi faire d'autre
Un remède pour chaque douleur : mélange les pilules dans un verre d'eau
Putain est-ce que tu me sens?

Est-ce que tu me sens?
Est-ce que tu me sens?
Est-ce que tu me sens?
Est-ce que tu me sens?

Solo depuis 5H (seul)
Je me suis senti seul quand j'ai vu les autres y aller
5h40 je parle à mes ombres, c'est l'heure de renter à la maison
J'assume les bugs de ma vie sociale et j'ai pas l'intention de chialer, nan
Je veux profiter de la vie, devant moi cette fille elle est belle
Pour pas me faire voir je la regarde dans le reflet de la vitre
À quoi bon faire partir les malheurs du silence
Ça revient comme les regrets à l'heure du bilan
Est-ce que tu me sens?
Avoir des regrets c'est de la merde
Je veux pas voir où le train m'amène
Avec ma sœur on pense qu'on est des génies et ça fait rigoler ma mère
J'ai une famille qui m'aime, je perds pas encore mes cheveux
Je suis grand et j'ai pas complètement grandi sans père
J'ai pas une peau à boutons et j'habite pas dans un pays en guerre
Je respire un bon coup, une bonne dose de vent froid
Yes, je respire donc j'ai au moins quelques secondes devant moi
Non je suis pas immortel même si j'ai un peu de succès
Chérie c'est peut-être la dernière fois que tu peux me sucer
Est-ce que tu me sens?
J'arrive chez moi, 6H18
J’écris je me cale sur le tempo du robinet qui fuit
J'attends le lever du jour pour aller m'affaler
Je suis pas pressé de sortir
Je viens de voir quelques dragons survoler la vallée

Est-ce que tu me sens?

Un peu d'huile de coude et quelques coups d'avance (bingo)

Vu qu'c'est dur j'saigne
Paris Bruxelles, vos rappeurs sont brusqués
C'est juste des branleurs qui parlent de luxe
Et qui s'branleront plus que jusqu'au poignet luxé

Mes adieux sont loin, je bouge pas d'ici, ô Dieu soit loué
Les doutes les plus odieux sont loin
J'ai confiance en moi, ô Dieu soit loué
Qui veut jouer à chat avec mes limites?

Yo, c'est pour tous les flemmards qui pissent assis
Ceux qui boufferaient tous les jours des pizzas si ça rendait pas leur bide acide
J'ai commencé l'rap pour dédicacer les potes, yo
Ok j'ai p't-être continué pour les pétasses et les podiums
Si j'veux j'peux les monter tous, célébrité moderne
Maintenant dans les soirées mondaines, tout l'monde aime Doums

Il m'dit qu'sa vie est sucrée comme un Mountain Dew

Bientôt les gens goberont les boules de mes plus fidèles fans
Y a des princes qu'on n'a pas le droit d'humilier

J'prends d'la place, faut être aveugle pour me voir en retrait
J'oublie tout, j'me sens fort en bandant pendant ma sieste
Mais y'a pas de gentille fée qui vient remplir mon assiette
Le jour où j'ai des millions, je mets beaucoup de gruyère
J'aime pas quand la bouffe invisible a un goût de cuillère
J'ai promis d'rappeler cette fille en réouvrant mes yeux
J'l'ai pas rappelé, j'ai pas menti, j'suis debout depuis hier
J'ai l'impression d'avoir une vie bien remplie
Alors que je passe toutes mes journées défoncé
J'oublie toutes les filles, je me souviens que de l'ordre
Des morceaux que je joue à mes concerts
Pour baiser tout les types de femmes, faut des siècles
Pour trouver la bonne, faut pas moins de patience
Je comprends mieux ta langue, quand tu parles avec ma
Parle moins de passion

La nuit n'a plus de limites quand je ferme les stores
Ma vie est nulle sans musique et je suis le seul otage
Couché par des beuhs phénoménales, je perds un siècle à piger où je vais
Tout ça réduira mon avance
J'ai dépassé les limites depuis l'époque où je descendais les doubles G
Pour moi, flyer c'est des vacances, hey
Ma folie s'égare quand je vois des gens
Qui connaissent toutes les putains de paroles à mes concerts
J'sais pas combien j'en ai fait cette année
Ça commence toujours dans la peur et ça finit toujours défoncé
Pour arriver au bout du rêve, faut faire une croix
Sur les après-midis de merde qui vont freiner les vacances

Nail me to a cross
And bite and scratch and make me scream

London After Midnight,"Twilight the leaves fall,
The ground is oh so cold
Sing about God,
Sing on his death
Sing about love
And sing about sex
Your great mystery's a lie
Hypocrisy's the rule
Sing on
The Death of God

Of darkness and light,
Of heaven and hell,
Of sinful delights.
Beneath our feet lie shattered wings,
Our screams bring the awakening of God

So say goodbye to torture and lies,
And if there's a God pray he opens his eyes
His angels aren't the master race,
We'll tell him when we're face to face with God",[Untitled],1998
London After Midnight,"Oh the witching time,
Like a blackened pearl.
Oh how useless seem
The offers of this world.
A shroud is wrapped and bound,
To Gallows led away
Though innocence is mine.
The dog will have his day.

All the Love turned to Hate,
The blade is in too deep and your repentance comes too late.

Oh wits misery,
The madness of your stay.
The best revenge,
A price which you must pay.

The children hide behind,
Behind their little masks.
They are, at their games,
The only ones who laugh.

All the Love turned to Hate,
The blade is in too deep and your repentance comes too late.

So did I deserve,
Your lies and treachery.
The curtain closes now.
The bell, it tolls for thee.

All your lies, all your shame.
And it drives you even madder that you've got yourself to blame.

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

And we dance on, dance on, we gonna dance on 
Ain't gonna work for life when we know we can dance on 
Everything's gonna be okay

No flowers bloom

No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves

No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new

And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",The Windmills of Your Mind,1998

London Festival Chorus,"You tell me that you're leavin',

Whistling to the wind
As nature bows down ahead
See what tomorrow brings

Crashing, all fluid in the air
In a cypress glide, no reason to hide
The wave from the suns blinding stare

London Festival Orchestra,"Of things I should be thankful for I've had a goodly share 
And as I sit here in the comfort of my cozy chair 
My fancy takes me to a humble eastside tenement 
Three flights up in the rear to where my childhood days were spent 
It wasn't much like Paradise but 'mid the dirt and all 
There sat the sweetest angel, one that I fondly call 

My yiddishe momme I need her more then ever now 
My yiddishe momme I'd like to kiss that wrinkled brow 
I long to hold her hands once more as in days gone by 
And ask her to forgive me for things I did that made her cry 
How few were her pleasures, she never cared for fashion's styles 
Her jewels and treasures she found them in her baby's smiles 
Oh I know that I owe what I am today 
To that dear little lady so old and gray 
To that wonderful yiddishe momme of mine 

My yiddishe momme I need her more then ever now 
My yiddishe momme I'd like to kiss that wrinkled brow 
I long to hold her hands once more as in days gone by 
And ask her to forgive me for things I did that made her cry 
How few were her pleasures, she never cared for fashion's styles 
Her jewels and treasures she found them in her baby's smiles 
Oh I know that I owe what I am today 
To that dear little lady so old and gray 
To that wonderful yiddishe momme of mine",My Yiddishe Momme,1995
London Festival Orchestra,"Is this the little girl I carried?
Is this the little boy at play?
I don't remember growing older,
When did they?
When did she get to be a beauty?
When did he grow to be so tall?
Wasn't it yesterday when they were small?
Sunrise, sunset.  Sunrise, sunset, 
Swiftly flow the days.
Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers,
Blossoming even as we gaze.
Sunrise, sunset.  Sunrise, sunset,
Swiftly fly the years.
One season following another,
Laden with happiness and tears.

What words of wisdom can I give them?
How can I help to ease their way?
Now they must learn from one another,
Day by day.
They look so natural together,
Just like two newlyweds should be.
Is there a canopy in store for me?

Swiftly fly the years.

Laden with happiness and tears.","Sunrise, Sunset [From Fiddler on the Roof]",1995

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

London Festival Orchestra,"We meet, and the angels sing
The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard
You speak, and the angels sing
Or am I breathing music into every word

Suddenly, the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

You smile, and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss, and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart.",And the Angels Sing,2000
London Festival Orchestra,"O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining 
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth 
Long lay the world in sin and error pining 
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth 

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices 
For yonder beams a new and glorious morn 
Fall on your knees 
Oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine, O night when Christ was born 
O night divine, O night, O night divine 

Truly he taught us to love one another 
His law is love and His gospel is peace 
Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother 
And in His name all oppression shall cease 

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise me 
Let all within us praise His holy name 
Christ is the Lord 
Then ever, we will praise thee

O night divine! O night, O night divine",O Holy Night,2001
