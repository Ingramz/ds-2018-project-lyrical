Rick Cartey,"They say for every boy and girl
There's just one love in this whole world
And I know I've found mine
The heavenly touch of your embrace
Tells me no one could take your place
Ever in my heart

Young love (young love), first love (first love)
Filled with true devotion
Young love (young love), our love (our love)
We share with deep emotion

Just one kiss from your sweet lips
Will tell me that your love is real
And I can feel that it's true
We will vow to one another
There will never be another
Love for you or for me

Another year over, a new one just begun.

And so this is Christmas, I hope you have fun,
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young.

A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fears.

And so this is Christmas for weak and for strong,
The rich and the poor ones, the road is so long.

And so happy Christmas for black and for white
For the yellow and red ones let's stop all the fights.

Rick Culver,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul,2000
Rick Culver,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When,2000
Rick Culver,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Rick Culver,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do

Rick Culver,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Rick Dakotah,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just a Friend,2003
Rick Danko,"Stopped by a diner, and the blond behind the counter
 Asked if she could help in any way
 I could tell by her smile, her number I could dial
 If I was in the need of company
 I asked her for some Java
 Instead she brought a cup of chickory

A taste of Java is like a volcanic rush
 Nobody's gonna stop me from drinking too much
 Costs many more than you care to pay
 But money is nothin, compared to a fired-up day
 Don't try to cheat, it's impossible to beat
 The only pick-me-up that's here to stay

Java Blues... coffee's got me
 Java Blues... coffee coffee coffee
 Java Blues... well the coffee's got me
 Java Blues... coffee coffee coffee

You know that I'll stay high
 Drinkin coffee till I die
 Java blues

Won't you boil me water, fill up my cup
 You know it takes a lot to keep me up
 Down in Bolivia, the people are insane
 They want as much for Java as they do for cocaine
 Don't try to cheat, it's impossible to beat
 The only pick-me-up that's here to stay

Java Blues... coffee's got me
 Java Blues... coffee coffee coffee
 Java Blues... you don't know what it does to me
 Java Blues... coffee coffee coffee

You know that I'll stay high
 Drinkin coffee till I die

Rick Danko,"Ten years ago
On a cold dark night
Someone was killed
'Neath the Town Hall light

Few were at the scene
But they all did agree
The slayer who ran
Looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""son
What is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else
You won't have to die""

Well I spoke not a word
Although it meant my life
For I had been in the arms
Of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high
And eternity near
She stood in the crowd
And shed not a tear

But sometimes at night
When the cold wind moans
In a long black veil
She cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me",Long Black Veil,1997
Rick Danko,"Go out yonder, peace in the valley
Come downtown, have to rumble in the alley
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

Has anybody seen my lady

I'm going to go down by the water
But I ain't going to jump in, no, no

Out of nine lives, I spent seven
Now, how in the world do you get to Heaven
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

I just spent 60 days in the jailhouse
For the crime of having no dough
Now here I am back out on the street
For the crime of having nowhere to go

Save your neck or save your brother
Looks like it's one or the other
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

Rick Danko,"Now deep in the heart of a lonely kid
Who suffered so much for what he did
They gave this ploughboy his fortune and fame
Since that day he ain't been the same

See the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might
And he got caught in the spotlight
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again

I've got fire water right on my breath
And the doctor warned me I might catch a death
Said, you can make it in your disguise
Just never show the fear that's in your eyes

See the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might
He got caught in the spotlight
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again

Now if he says that he's afraid
Take him at his word
And for the price that the poor boy has paid
He gets to sing just like a bird, oh, ooh ooh ooh

Your brow is sweatin' and your mouth gets dry
Fancy people go driftin' by
The moment of truth is right at hand
Just one more nightmare you can stand

See the man with the stage fright
Just standin' up there to give it all his might
And he got caught in the spotlight
But when we get to the end
He wants to start all over again

You wanna try it once again
Please don't make him stop
Let him take it from the top
Let him start all over again",Stage Fright,1997
Rick Danko,"Over by the wild wood
Hot summer night
We lay in the tall grass
Til the mornin' light

If I had my way I'd never
Get the urge to roam
A young man serves his country
And an old man guards the home

Never gave a second thought
Never crossed my mind
What's right and what's not
I'm not the judgin' kind
I could take the darkness oh
Storms in the skies
But we all got certain trials
Burnin' up inside

Don't send me no distant salutations
Or silly souvenirs from far away
Don't leave me alone in the twilight
Twilight is the loneliest time a day

Don't put me in a frame upon the mantel

Don't leave me alone in the twilight
Twilight is the loneliest time a day",Twilight,1997
Rick Danko,"Ramblin' around this dirty old town
Singin' for nickels and dimes
Times getting rough I ain't got enough
To buy me a bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Little hotel, older than Hell
Cold and as dark as a mine
Blanket so thin, I lie there and grin
Buy me little bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Aches in my head, bugs in my bed
Pants so old that they shine
Out on the street, tell the people I meet
Won'ch buy me a bottle of wine

Bottle of wine, fruit of the vine
When you gonna let me get sober
Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Teacher must teach, and the preacher must preach
Miner must dig in the mine
I ride the rods, trusting in God
And hugging my bottle of wine

Leave me along, let me go home
I wann'a go back and start over

Rick Danko,"So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free

When you saw me I was broken
I was scattered in the dust
Like the way you feel sometimes
when you feel too much
You put your hands around my face
like a circle 'round the sun
When I thought that it was finished
it had only just begun

So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free, again

You shine across the morning
as I turn to face the east
You told me how to give away
things never meant to keep
Your love is rolling like a wave
that breaks right over me
One hand can hold the ocean
but will never stop the sea

So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free

Your skin it looks so golden
standing naked in the sun
Your soul it feels so holy
as close as the earth can come
A wave can cut a stone to sand
and the wind can break your bones
I'm wondering how you're doing now
when you are alone

So lie with me and be my love just for now
Stay with me all through the night
Be as close to me as you can be
Til morning sets you free, once again, once again

He was just a prisoner
Prisoner of your pain
Whose sentence was to serve you
Let you love again
If you go away
He'll still be singing in his chains
Behind the walls of knowing
There was no such thing as blame

Deeper than the ocean
Wider than the sea
The loneliness you harbored from
A love that was deceived
How did you ever know
What the answer couldn't be
The dying's almost easier
Than trying to believe again

Your eyes they are so empty now
So pale in the sun
Your heart it is so weary
From not wanting anyone
With every breath you take
It's for the love that didn't come
Still longing for the day
You thought your life had just begun",Lie With Me,1997
Rick Danko,"They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Well, I bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an 'Oscar', you can never tell
The movie's gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Well, I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And beggin' down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part and I won't need rehearsin'

I don't want to be the one to throw it over.
I don't want to be the one to feel ashamed.

I don't want to be the one who thinks of nothing.
I don't want to be the one to tell you what you have seen.
After all this time, well I thought that you were mine.
I just want to be the one who would share this dream.

[Chorus]
All our past times should be forgotten.
All our past times should be erased.
I don't care how much it costs;
Cause I don't count the loss
As long as I can see your face again.

You don't have to tell me when you're leaving,
If it's half past one, if it's maybe four.
It makes no difference where you think you're going,
But please remember not to slam the door.

Rick Derringer,"I thought she noticed me when I saw her
She seemed to check me out right away
So I 
Asked her name
I played the old game
Her reception seemed to be ok
She was a cute little thing about fifteen
And she liked to make the schoolboys stare
It was an instant cosmic need
A Teenage Love Affair
It was getting hotter minute by minute
As each second brought her closer to me
And then we 
Finally touched and
We touched and we touched
And her hands felt their way over me
So we made love there in the daytime
When her mama left, we went upstairs
It was a total cosmic deed

Teenage love affair,
A teenage love affair
Teenage love affair,
A teenage love affair
Teenage love affair,

Then I heard a strange rumor about her
And i didn't know just what to say
It really 
Brought me down
You know it turned me around
Cause no girl had ever done me that way
But it didn't take long til I found out
That there's a lotta sexy girls out there
And I've got a built-in cosmic need

Rick Devin,"There is a young cowboy, he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear

Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James

Now the first of December was covered with snow
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
The Berkshires seemed dream-like on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me

So goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rockabye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rockabye sweet baby James",Sweet Baby James,2000
Rick Devin,"Well I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee
And I'm bound for Louisiana, my own true love for to see
It did rain all night the day I left

The weather was bone dry
The sun was so hot I froze myself
Suzanne, don't you go on and cry
I said, oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee

Well I had myself a dream the other night
When everything was still
I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
She was coming around the hill
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye

I said, that I come from Dixie land
Suzanne, don't you break down and cry
I said, oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me
Cause I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee","Oh, Susannah",2003
Rick Devin,"A long long time ago
I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin'

This'll be the day that I die

Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
And singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie

Singin' this'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Yet He could stop the rising storm 
With a gesture of His hand 
But He chose to use His hands to heal 
Hearts of darkness, hearts of stone 
Just like mine would be revealed

He was a man of no reputation 
And by the wise, considered a fool

But this man of no reputation 
Loved the weak with relentless affection 
And He loved all those poor in spirit just as they were

That He'd achieve his ends by any means 
And the truth that it brings revolution 
And for once they were right

And the powerful knew their days were ending

And the Prince of Peace will come back for His bride

Where push always comes to shove 
And it's said love's never enough 
Where a prophet in rags gives hope to a fearful world 
No injustice, no heart of darkness 
Will keep this voice from being heard 
He was a man of no reputation 
And by the wise, considered a fool 
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness 
In a time when the strongest arms ruled 
But this man of no reputation 
Loves us all with relentless affection 
And He loves all those poor in spirit, come as you are

To a fallen race
Through Christ the savior of all men

Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

It's power is eternal, eternal
It's glory is supernal, supernal

There'll always be the love of God

It goes beneath the deepest stain
That sin could ever leave
Redeeming souls to live again

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I'm not going nowhere till I concentrate on one

I pay my dues, I pay my rent and have some left for me

Balance of your MasterCard
There's gotta be some mistake

In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me
In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude 
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine

Rick Holland,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2002
Rick Hollander,"It's not the pale moon that excites me 
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
It's just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1994
Rick Hollander,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Rick Hollander,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994

Rick Hollister,"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod Race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace.
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A.

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up.
That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup.
It's got eight cylinders, uses them all.
It's got overdrive, just won't stall.

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust,
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost.
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared.
The brakes are good, tires fair.

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shining bright.
We was driving up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still.

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by.
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see.

Now the fellas was ribbing me for being behind,
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind.
Took my foot off the gas and man alive,

I shoved it on down into overdrive.
Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end.
My foot was blue, like lead to the floor.
That's all there is and there ain't no more.

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence.
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck,
Crossed my fingers just for luck.
My fenders was clicking the guardrail posts.
The guy beside me was white as a ghost.

Smoke was coming from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac.
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass.
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames coming from out of the side.
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by.

Now all of a sudden she started to knocking,
And down in the dips she started to rocking.
I looked in my mirror, a red light was blinking
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail.
And called my pappy to throw my bail.
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop driving that Hot, Rod, Lincoln!""",Hot Rod Lincoln,2006
Rick Holmstrom,"Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing, ring-ting tingle-ing, too,
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand

Well, I've just been doin' the same ol' thing I've always been doin', you know
I've got a new lady now
And it's a little different then it was when I was with you
You know, I think back to when we met
The way I used to be and the cold way I used to act
But more than that, I think of how you changed me with your love and sensitivity
Remember when I used to

That's what I used to do
Use and abuse them

They say Obie Trice gone, look at em
Back then I was Mike Jones, who would even look at 'em?
Now I recite songs with icons, see I come from convicts and crumbs
My nigga, listen, his transitions shows his ambitions
Nuttin less then the man getting off his ass and vanishing
Into the world of ass kissing, witness him with Ashton Kutcher
Now they ask for pictures, autographs, signatures
Went from rags to riches to getting ass from bitches
It's hard to grasp the situation at hand
When you used to have to ask for digits
Now they pass em to you like easy fast for tickets
Classic isn't it? Coming from a past with a casket
Dips from beneathe the grass, so you're cremated to ashes
Nigga, created from the Craft, this is past fictious

And now the spotlight's on Trice
But back when the spot life was Trice
I always kept beside a spot for a mic, despite
Wrongs and rights, I would write after I slung white
To homes on the pipe, I had a notion I would be bi-costal
But being across the ocean is la vida loca
And vada loco, I'm in Janayo
Konecheewa in Tokyo, it's sushi with eel
I got a taste for that pompies chopping up in Brazil
Drinking the finest wines in France on the hill
Now how real is he to come from where we get killed
To having all his dreams fulfilled, look out
I got fantasies of being in Italy where the women be
Offering me the cooch-o, eating on ossobuco
Awesome, I know, so often, we just reach the coffin
And never get to see what the world's offering

Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be

And a beautiful babe to squeeze my lime
In my simple way

I was young and crazy (in the ghetto)
Didn't know what my life would be (in the ghetto)
I was dumb and oh so lazy (In the ghetto)
Something had a spell on me (in the ghetto)
You all know what I'm talkin' bout (talkin' bout ghetto life, talkin' bout ghetto life) 
You all know what I'm singin' 'bout (talkin' bout ghetto life)
Ghetto life (talkin' 'bout ghetoo life)

(In the ghetto) Sure we be takin' them chances
While we search for the answers we be smokin' them cancer sticks
Police provokin' motherfuckers, we dancin'
And we be dodgin' them bullets they be poppin' off at us, shit
But yet we always romance the street
And fall in love with the hood 'til somebody come blast the heat
Always up to no good, so all of my fam could eat
See in the hood we hungry, hey nigga we playin' for keeps
My soldiers on the block get on it
It be good if you flaunt it, we will take if we want it
See nigggas from the ghetto got a different state of mind
With a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind
And develop our muscle 'til we sicker with the shine
In the struggle, thus our money come quicker doin' crime
I see the way we rep the hood, gotta love me
You can take me out the ghetto, but you can't take it from me
Gotta love it

Ghetto life (talkin' 'bout ghetto life)
You all know what I'm singin' 'bout (talkin' bout ghetto life)
Ghetto life (talkin' 'bout ghetto life)

(In the ghetto) that's where we get into that street shit
Hustle hard, try to get money quick (in the ghetto)
That's where I got my name from
I learned to get money and I all got my name from (in the ghetto)
That's where you eat with a bunch of the wolves
And get to hustlin' as hard as you could (in the ghetto)
Until your cake stackin' shit'll get good
Throw a block party for the whole hood (in the ghetto)
With them burn out cellys
Talk crazy, sell drugs in front of Pancho Deli
Crackhead chicks still smuggle babies in they belly
And they pis sin elevators 'til the lobby all smelly (in the ghetto)
That's where I keep my ratchets
Get my instincts and survival tactics
Ain't nothin' like a hood nigga, I don't care
You survivin' in the ghetto, you can make it anywhere
Gotta love it

[Chorus]

To my east coast niggas', rep yo' ghetto
West coast niggas', rep yo ghetto
Midwest niggas', rep yo' ghetto
Down south niggas', rep yo' ghetto
To my east coast niggas', rep yo' ghetto
West coast niggas', rep yo' ghetto
Midwest niggas', rep yo' ghetto
Down south niggas', rep yo' ghetto

(In the ghetto) even though they act rude
You'll always find a good hick to hold a brick for they dude
Behind the bullshit, me and my clique on the move
We honor the code of the street and live by the rules (in the ghetto)
Is where, all of the hood's at
Find the most crooks and they sell the most drugs at
Where you find beautiful women and rugrats and some of the most powerful people, I love that
C'mon

Oh, hi Rod!

ROD
Hi Nicky.

NICKY
Hey Rod, you'll never guess what happened to me on the subway this morning.
This guy was smiling at me and talking to me --

ROD
That's very interesting.

NICKY
He was being real friendly, and I think he was coming on to me.
I think he might've thought I was gay!

ROD
Ahem, so, uh, why are you telling me this? Why should I care?
I don't care. What did you have for lunch today?

NICKY
Oh, you don't have to get all defensive about it, Rod...

ROD
I'm NOT getting defensive! What do I care about some
Gay guy you met, okay? I'm trying to read.

NICKY
Oh, I didn't mean anything by it, Rod. I just think it's
Something we should be able to talk about.

ROD
I don't want to talk about it, Nicky! This conversation is over!!!

NICKY
Yeah, but...

ROD
Over!!!

NICKY
Well, okay, but just so you know --

If you were gay
That'd be okay.
I mean 'cause, hey,
I'd like you anyway.

Because you see,
If it were me,
I would feel free
To say that I was gay

ROD
Nicky, please! I am trying to read...
What?!

NICKY
If you were queer
I'd still be here,
Year after year
Because you're dear
To me.
And I know that you
Would accept me too,
If I told you today
""Hey! Guess what,
I'm gay!""
(But I'm not gay)

I'm happy
Just being with you.
So what should it
Matter to me
What you do in bed
With guys?

No, it's not!

Rick Margitza,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Rick Margitza,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1995
Rick Margitza,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Rick Margitza,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Rick Margitza,"Without a song the day would never end
Without a song the road would never bend
When things go wrong, a man ain't got a friend
Without a song

That field of corn would never see a plow
That field of corn would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good no-how
Without a song

I got my troubles and woe but sure as I know that Jordan will roll
I'll get along as long as a song is strong in my soul
I'll never know what makes the rain to fall
I'll never know what makes the grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all

Rick Marotta,"My telephone rang I was too late
Why did I stop to hesitate
On my way home
Take my hands let me confess
'Bout loving and hating and all of the rest
And ideas I've roamed

Then I saw a brilliant sign
And let it slip behind
And search again and
Find I'm blind

My thoughts they make a tender smile
My hands they move and in a while
I've got what I want.
That tenderness that you insist you feel
Ain't worth a damn 'cause it ain't real
Lord it sure does haunt.

Then you saw a brilliant sign
And let it slip behind
And search again and find you're blind.

See me in a lonely Sunday
If you've got the time
And don't surprise me or you'll find
That I'm completely blind.

Now I'm so sick of what's being said
My thoughts they burn inside my head
There's not much untouched.
All of my children begin to cry
They clutch at me demanding why
Tell 'em 'bout loving and such.

Then they saw a brilliant sign
And let it slip behind
And search again and find they're blind.

Rick Marotta,"Yes I'm Falling
Oh oh falling
Falling in love with you
Was easy as the day
A down man looked up to see
Nice things in his way

Was like that first sunrise
Was it in my window
Or was it in your eyes

And I call myself an island
And luckily I find
That you're the sea around me
And are with me for all time

Falling in love with you
Was learning how to cry
And telling you I'm all alone

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

Dearest the shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is Sunday, with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart, here
Darling, I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you

On a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
Bells on bob-tail ring,
making spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago,
the story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed bay
two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Or the outline of your silhouette when you step into the light
Is it in the things you say or the message in your eyes
The urgency you feel from me cannot be denied
I wanted freedom, not some ball and chain
But now I feel like giving in
And I know what's to blame
It's just desire burning up my heart
I never want to let this feeling go
It's just desire
That makes me want to love you
All night long
I feel like there's a spell on me
That words just can't describe
It hit me like a ton of bricks
Right between the eyes
I swore I'd never take the fall
Now I'm hanging on the edge
Could you be my destiny
Or something I'll regret
This temptation just whets my appetite
I ain't hungry for no lasting thing
It's clear to me tonight
It's just desire burning up my heart
I never want to let this feeling go
It's just desire
That makes me want to love you
All night long
All right
Come on baby, oh, whoa
I don't know what possesses me
But every time you're next to me

WRITERS BURCH BACHARACH, HGAL DAVID
COPYRIGHT 1966


You should have been there when I was twenty
You never heard such applause
Now I'm twenty-five and hardly anyone knows I'm alive
But there's no use in lookin' back
Because they don't give medals to yesterday's heroes
'Cause yesterday's over and I've got to live for today
I'm goin' to a place and nothing can stand in my way
Yesterday is over
No they don't give medals to yesterday's heroes
I know my way now, I'll never look back from this day on
Yesterday is over, can't you see it's over
And I begin livin' today
I mean to borrow one day from tomorrow
And I'm gonna spend it on sunshine and things that I love
I'm gonna reach out and touch every star above
Yesterday is over
No they don't give medals to yesterday's heroes
So wrap up that lovin' cup
I'm a winner from this day on
Yesterday is over, can't you see it's over
And I begin livin' today

The way my broken heart is hurting me

I'll do my crying in the rain

Will never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun

A chance to share old memories and play our songs again

But it's all right now, i learned my lesson well.
You see, ya can't please everyone, so ya got to please yourself

People came from miles around, everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air
'n' over in the corner, much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in dylan's shoes wearing his disguise

Lott-in-dah-dah-dah, lot-in-dah-dah-dah
Played them all the old songs, thought that's why they came

Rick Nelson & the Stone Canyon Band,"The darkest house is a lonely house
The warmest house is my song
And if it makes you, all but happy
Let it bring you along

The sweetest room is a lady
The softest tune is goodbye
Is she real or just an image?
Did she leave satisfied?

Life you lead is uncertain
How long has it been since you've heard 'Hello or goodbye'
Streets are filled with many people passin'
My eyes, they are closed but still you hear them cry

The darkest house is a lonely house
The warmest house is my song
And if it makes you, all but happy
Let it bring you along

Silver and gold are treasures
To many people this is why they've dared the tide
The thought of fortune pulls them through tomorrow
Is it worth the feeling when you fall into her eyes?

",Let It Bring You Along,1972
Rick Nelson & the Stone Canyon Band,"With handmade silver sparkles
Like a well-dressed sequined whore
Your lady-like deceptions
Keep reaching out for more

And you ask me for nothing
And nothing's not enough
And the fisherman, he puts a claim on you
But it's nothing but a bluff

So with jealous hands tied 'round my back
I stumble 'cross the floor
Not knowing how to speak
I keep reaching for the door

""I know, you know me, well"" I say
""'Cause I'm the palace guard
Remember me, we made love today
At the King's bazaar""

And you look at me
With eyes that never see
I can feel something start
To die inside of me

And you speak
In wordless freedoms never seen
Now I realize
To you it's all a dream

So before you show me everything
There's something I must know
I've worked with your friend John, the geek
And his sidewalk trav'lin' show

I know your childhood tailored dreams
Are very well disguised
So you don't have to fake it anymore
It's all been memorized

And you speak
In wordless freedoms never seen
Now I realize
To you it's all a dream

And you speak to me with feelings
As real as sealing wax
As the nearness dawns, the moth is gone
Leaving trailless tracks

That'd be an understated fact
I'd get more lovin' from an iceberg baby

Get out your spring-a-later shoes
Start payin' your own dues

Rick Orozco,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart

Aint get my message, was a signal when I was texting
The niggas I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson
Now I move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon
Cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions
So throw that pass, I’ll be the corner back
Me and Folarin MMG gon bring that Warner back

For my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it
They gon love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it
They gon love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it
Look, they gon love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

(It speaks for itself. Define Ambition for me?)

My ambition to win, just to get me some ends
Help me pay my little rent, maybe sit in a Benz
I saw momma praying as she wait on results
It was hot in the kitchen can I wait on the porch
My father was missing, War Lord Oliver North
Life was diggin’ me deeper, I kept on coming up short
Breaking so many laws, waking up in the dark
Who cut my power off? It’s time to move that powder soft
Not too many options when you coming from the projects
Sittin’ in the trap now you moving Cyndi Lauper
Girls wanna have fun, and a nigga with some change
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is priceless that’s something thats in your veins
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is my shit and I put that on my name
And I doubt that ever change

For my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it
They gon love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it
They gon love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it’s harder to live it
Look, they gon love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

Well wishes to my opposition
You niggas probably cop a plea before you cop a pistol
I got nothing against them, they got fucking potential
But every nigga who can read gotta get his issue
Subscribe niggas reside where all the lions and killers be
And I aint spend a minute up in the streets
But I’m limitless mentally, I’m lyrically the MC
Lebron shit, I was heading six after twenty three
And family is everything and money is less important
Long as your mama love you, don’t ever love a woman
I got a lot of bitches, they got a lot of feelings
But I got that green on my eyes
And that ain’t no Donnie Simpson
I retire you niggas, fuck you and your position!
They play surface so slippery niggas can’t even kick it
Y’all rambling, talking shit to these bitches
You know you real you don’t say it
You know you real, we gon feel it
Ralph!

Fuck around and knock the emblem on the caddy off
Four-shooters buggin' out, blickin' at ya caddy doors

Niggas tryna get at me (dawg) I ride for my niggas

It bothers me when the Gods get to acting like the broads
Guess every team doesn't come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y'all
I just ask that when you see me you speak up niggas that's all
Don't be ducking like you never wanted nothing
It's feeling like rap change, there was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach, just to sell they record
Spaguetti bolognese in apollo lounge
Me and my G from DC, that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think drake would pull some shit like that you never know
Million dollar meetings in apollo lounge
Me and my man Oliver North, that's how I roll around
Shorty wanted to tell me secrets about a rap nigga
I told that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe about to lose a hundred fifty M's
Kobe my nigga I hated it had to be him
Bitch you wasn't with me shooting in the gym
(Huh!? bitch you weren't with me shooting in the gym)
Tell lucien, and I say  fuck it
I'm tearing holes my budget
Bag it like we in Publix
And take her ass out in public
Order her a filet told her butterflies, she'll love it
She's used to soda and nuggets, she's really just out here thuggin'
I'm just here in my pinnacle, you and pussy identical
You like the fucking finish line, we can't wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that young rich motherfucker
Getting mine off rap, with my niggas! (Huh)

Niggas tryna get at me (dawg) I ride for my niggas

For new the coupe to the Ghost dawg
Pigeons on the roof like ghost dawg
Dwight Howard on the post dawg
My niggas got the powder through the post dawg
Watch the body tilt when you hit the head
Niggas lost mills tryna beat the feds
Ten grams off my last two fifty now
Big ass crib, two fifty down, damn
Gave my nigga Max seventy five 
Then gave my nigga penthouse in another thirty 
Fuck got me thinking like I'm seventy five 
Damn, nigga ain't even seen thirty

I apologize I don't recollect your name (Ooh, baby I don't know your name) 
But lemme tell you that them heels really compliment your frame (Look at your body baby) 
Girl lemme get them ooh aahs then I gotta catch my plane 
Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time 
Girl how could we get that way? 
 
Look, another day another dollar 
She hate me when I leave cuz when I leave I never call her 
That's life shit, alright, shit, I could call you right quick 
But if I call you gone be like ""Boo why we haven't Skyped yet?"" 
And I Skype, bet you say ""Lay where my flight at"" 
If I decline then you inquire on where I spend my nights at 
Shit this life gets overwhelming and more than hectic 
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort 
Just look closer my life is quite deceptive 
Women will sell they soul just to buy some attention 
I need something to hold fuck that passive aggression 
And when I'm back from off that road don't ask me no questions 
Please, fear watchu don't know 

[Chorus]

Don't remember how I met her but I know I won't forget her 
If loving her is wrong then I just know I won't see heaven 
She say she from Seattle, she twenty and some change
Before I get to T.I.A. I'm sure to make her rain 
Then I'm back up on my plane Chi town over here 
We spend some time and get some wine have some miles from Harrod's 
I told her this here's overrated but I love your city baby 
Gotta get back to the D you know we finally famous 
Driver drop me off in Dallas I'm headed to some money 
TSA be laughing all them rubbers in your luggage 
I know Ima always leave em but I swear I'll always love em 
Tell her you'll probably find someone but you'll never find another

Got on my suede shoes, I'm in a great mood 
That baggage claim awaiting miss thang outta St. Louis 
Know she shining bright, got on my Cartier, 
She my Billie Jean we Minaj with Mary Jane 
See we city hop, Vegas to LA, brings a lotta joy Bugatti boy that's Laina Lane 
Our faucets used to drip, I used to ride the bench, 
But it was written in cursive for this king to exist 
Packed her bags now she live amongst entrepreneurs 
Marc Jacob the makeup Gi-Givenchy consumer Gianni Versace connoisseur a carnivore 
Accountable for half a million uncounted for

With them luggers from they rugers on they deserts

Watch my n****s bring the riot

Came from the heavens just to sing a song for you
To the rhythm of my love for you,
And now it's beating slow, and you know
This the end of the road when I sing this slow song for you you
And love was nothin' but another gun for you
And I would hide it in my hopeless soul
I'm not afraid to go down the road where we go,
I don't know, you can hear them callin, don't you,
When the angels call like

Calling, for you, I will tell the angels now
Let them turn back in to stone
I do, love you, it's true

Even though I know how men be talkin'
I just know that nigga wanna be me
Came in here and fell in love with a bad bitch
Back then she ain't have shit

Wanna know where she got that ass at
She hit my heart, a toot, toot on it
She got a dump truck, I put a boot on it
Don't mind spendin' this loot on it
Treat her like my whip, I put some shoes on her

Got a dump truck, put a boot on her
I don't mind trickin', spendin' loot on her
Walk up in the club, and toot, toot on her
She's a bad bitch, put shoes on her
God damn, fell in love with a bad bitch
Said, ""French, take me to Paris""
Dominican mami from Cali
I said, ""Gon' bend it over, let me grab it""
I said, ""Gon' bend it over, make it nasty""
Walked up in the club, rollin', Stevie Wonder glasses

Red light, green light, no it ain't Gucci
Used to walk up in the store, couldn't afford that
Now I walk up in the store, buyin' all that
Drink it to the head, man, nigga feelin' woozy
Pull up in the old school, boy I'm on some new shit
Red to the head, man we gettin' all that
And shorty phone answers, she don't ever call back
And I can see why these niggas hate me
Pull up in a drop and the watch 80
Pull up to the front but a nigga faded
Got a new crib and the shit gated
Came from the bottom, watch a nigga ball out
Drink it to the head, smoke 'til you fall out
Countin' up this money, nigga, keep the door locked
All my niggas gettin' to this money, no lie

Rick Ross,"Learn to walk a tightrope
Ever seen a rich nigga go broke?
They putting liens on a nigga things
Publicize your demise, and by all means
Your family fortune is forever what you stood on
Sold dreams, fantasies that put the hood on
You reap what you sow, and they speaking repossessions
To the culture itself, these are powerful lessons
These niggas always smiled when I came around
They let you know my reputation when you in my town
A real nigga, you gonna know that by the contract
Bottom line blood, show me where them one’s at
That paper it get funny when publishing is involved
Mechanicals never mattered because that was your dog
Now you hands-on, but things don’t ever seem right
You make a call to give your lawyer the green-light
He look into it then hit you up with the bad news
It’s so familiar, he did the same with the last dudes
Mafioso, baby girl, cash rules
Every dollar accounted for, double M the crew

Death Row, fast life
Foreclosed on my past life
The white man call us stupid niggas
We spend it all, nothing for our children
Had it all, now it’s repossessed
Can’t feed the clique cutting bad checks
Time to learn boy, that cash rules
Success is a precious jewel

Planting poison in a nigga mind
Chilling with your boys when it’s time to grind
We both come from those humble beginnings
Still can’t believe we never followed each other on Twitter
Funny thing is the animosity money brings
Real niggas out of style we may be one in three
Back against the wall outnumbered by fuckboys
One bullet, one target, one choice
You can take an L or take the shell
It's still double M still making mills
Made niggas respect my hustle on both coasts
I put the word out to see who hit back with the lowest
I need a hit handled, put me in touch with the closest
You still digging through ashtrays killing the roaches
And I never took an L back when Meek fell
Just drove the numbers all the way back up at retail

Death Row, fast life
Foreclosed on my past life
The white man call us stupid niggas
We spend it all, nothing for our children
Had it all, now it’s repossessed
Can’t feed the clique cutting bad checks
Time to learn boy, that cash rules
Success is a precious jewel

Can’t be writing checks with your eyes closed
While you living out of homes in different time zones
Mind blown finna strip you out your rhinestones
Pistol to your ear, this that level I’m on
I apologize woadie but this all I got
Everybody in this office we could die tonight
I never met an artist who fully recouped
These the deals the deal dealers wanna deal to you
Young niggas, time to act your age
Buying belts you seen on other niggas waists
Hoes fucking for follows, they wanna post online
Whole time, shorty knowing I’m the gold mine
Put it on all he needed was a co sign
Black minks and gloves, nigga, the whole nine
TV on the Rolls, shit, I had to hold mine
You’ll foreclose or fold just for soul signs

Death Row, fast life
Foreclosed on my past life

May your love come down so my mind might have you
You designed my imagination
Let me redefine foreplay so you need five and
Tell me shorty you got it baby
If its not it baby, hope its progress baby
Let it all drip baby
If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby, no more talking baby

Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples that my baby tastes the best
I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex
Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check
Leave my cars at her crib I'm just stuntin' on her ex
Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess
I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh uhh
Sex all night couple shots of Ciroc
Crib on the water got LeBron up the block
Money ain't the thing baby welcome to the Mark
Diced pineapples talking diamonds by the jar
Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sign her
Uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team
Double MG them other niggas fell off, baby girl I just wanna see you well off

[Chorus]
Call me crazy shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl
Know its easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say its cuz you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night til things get right
Then we fuck all night til things get right

[Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples I just bought my girl a set
I know my lifestyle wild I just do it for the set
She know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex
Pop bottles, make love, thug passion, red bottoms, Moncler, high fashion
Belt buckles, door handles, gold plated. Bal main rich denim, out Vegas
French Riviera baby girl lets take a trip
Im'a trip go to Cannes France to catch a flick
Baby listen, this position is a blessing and 
With your permission hopefully you'll learn a lesson
I'm so fly that I shouldn't even walk. She so fine she ain't even gotta talk
Diced pineapples talking diamonds by the jar
She never wrote a song but I know that she's a star

[Chorus]

Something about her probably can't live without her
Roll up some sour, let me kiss on a fountain
Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate
And I won’t ever rescue me the peak of your mountain
Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you
And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you
Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia
Hol' up, showing off some Asian provocateur
Rushing you out your draws
Though patiently get you off
Hate when they get too anxious though
Hate when they be too dull
Like to get too deep
But I hate to get too deeply involved
How sweet is you
Let me see some proof
Fuck making pussy talk
I like to make it sing a tune
All we need is weed
We don’t need no room
Right now I’m trying eat
We don’t need a spoon

I'm as real as they come, oh it's a wonderful dream
On the phone Farrakhan gave me my first Quran
We joined hands, said a prayer, may Allah bless the don
Ain't nowhere to run, already sold out the seats
We been them niggas, better go ask them freaks
Lipstick on my cheeks, extortion all through my vows (my vows)
They say it's suspicious all this money I found
Go give me the crown, you niggas been in denial
We the hottest niggas out, my nigga Kanye'll vouch
The devil in a dress, Rozay in the chest
Push it to the limit it's a OG in the flesh
Countach on the prowl Lamborghinis I fiend

Pimping these hoes like Joseline, ""why you do that Stevie?""
Play no games with these bitches, they treat me like I'm Tony
I put cheese on you rats, get hit with that macaroni
Bout them collard greens all these rappers be acting phony
You sold your soul for some food and went broke, now you salty
You want your cornbread?

I graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed perico with baking soda
I made a million on that corner
Going Donald Trump numbers on the corner
I made a million on that corner
Graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed perico with baking soda

Young rich nigga, I flex, look at my neck
Look at my bitch, look at my wrist, got these niggas upset
Who you know blow a mill? Don't even think twice, no sweat
And these hoes around me?
You don't fuck, you don't give them no check
Cause ya'll niggas lame as fuck, none of these chumps can't hang with us
All these chains getting tangled up
And my clique armed and dangerous, and we'll flame you up
You get smoked mothafucker like angel dust
Start the Rolls Royce with the angel up
All these niggas on angel bruh, but I got stripes like a bengal does
And my wrist look like the flash on
Come that ho and bring that ass on
So I can beat it up like you stole something
Might pop a perk, go mad long like skrrt
Been through your hood in a wraith, niggas is jealous, just look at your face
.357 get put in your place, follow my lead all you niggas is late
Like hold up, hold up, I done made a million on that corner
I bought some coke but couldn't deal with Arizona
Them yellow diamonds looking clearer than Corona
And if they act like they ain't with it

I graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed perico with baking soda
I made a million on that corner
Going Donald Trump numbers on the corner
I made a million on that corner
Graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed perico with baking soda

I'm on the corner gettin' cake
I'm talkin' like it's 88
Givenchy all I really play
Kingpin status when I swerve up on the block
A nigga like you, you wouldn't even get the cock
Get my money dolo, I just need some help to count it
I'm the richest nigga outta Dade-Broward County
Feds know my game, they keep it raw, we all at odds
Repossess my Lambo cause they wanna build a charge
When they got my Chevy, got it runnin' like it's 'sposed to
Hit up on my niggas, let 'em know my shop reopened
We rockin' everything, till I'm right back on the top
Nasdaq hustle bitch, come get your ass in stocks

I graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed perico with baking soda
I made a million on that corner

But I don't think I can handle her pain
So messed up and I'm too busy just running my game
Oh, girl after girl, mistake after mistake

I've tried to change but they always around, pulling me down in bed
Gave you my word but they were just broken promises
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex

Wouldn't believe it, so I used you

Conversation, she lick every tattoo that's on my face
Like a thug, I just wanna fuck, that's every day
Temporary separations, confessing my mistakes
She packed her bags and left me home and I'm still hurt
You new pussy, but she can't tell me that it's real first
A lot of lies apologized, the thirst real
When she hit this thinking to herself, ""Damn this verse real""
Rehab out in Vegas, that made this a murdered sin
Send the bottles to her table then made love on the jet
Temporary thrills, all these women you think I tossed
My feelings genuine, disregard what you see on blogs
I been a boss before I recorded Meek song
Mill in cash on the gram, they trending Meech home
In the D, my G, he throwing that peace on
Every picture that you post leave comments on each one

I'm just a typical ordinary nigga
But I know that I can't change the rules
All this time I blamed you 'cause I know what I'm doing
Stepping on your heart again, relationship ruined
I tried to change but I'm always out, fucking around in the club

Every day the diamonds on you get bigger and bigger
Hustle from my heart so every night I can deliver
Saying sorry, laying up, way up in your liver
Boss, the red bottom's got you walking funny
Get you an agent, she balling and all she talk is money
Take her shopping, baby boy ain't no salary caps
She get it popping so you better bring battery packs
Perfect time to relax
Nothing is perfect other than being a perfect match
They all watch me 'cause the moves I make out they budget
Diamond district, six figures on my shorty nugget

Lets shoot them pussies from a block away
They wanna see a nigga in a cage
Baby mama garnishing a nigga wage
I just went and got the Chevy sprayed
Pussy nigga wanna scratch a nigga paint
Pussy nigga wanna see you fall
Just know to bring them choppers when you see me call
I tried to let them pussy niggas eat
It's time to make you pussy boys extinct
I took a quarter Key to Polk county
All my central Florida nigga straight 'bout it
Broke down the brick I'm back in Bartow
Belle Glade box Chevy on my car phone
J-Ville I went and bought a condo
Back to the crib where I get it by the car load

I started with a box Chevy
Then I got the blue Lexus
My bitch stay down with me
So now she got the new Lexus

I went and got my bitch her very own salon
Get her hair do everyday do the fuck she want
I started in a box Chevy
Now my watch a buck eighty
I heard the same pussy niggas hatin'

You fucks with T Double D then you fucks with we
Now you runnin' round duckin' me
Young nigga with a AK better than Ananda Lee
I send them killers where ya mama be

I be Money M to the izzay, are to the kizzay
Come through choppin' ya block I don't plizzay
Got dolo for the low, then hit the 2 Way
Peace to Uncle Lisle I miss him everyday, hey

Love dough and love to hate hoes
Love to pull nigga bout mine lil' nose
Nigga tryna hold me back, I'm throwin' 'bows
I'm a treal ass nigga, that's how shit goes

You can never fuck with me, I'll just flow harder
CL 6 sittin' low on those (?)
I'm a Philly man, but I don't blow garbage
Got sweet dick, most of these hoes got it

Ain't no love, you see how the Feds do us
want to eat like rust and some for tear Lucas
Haul that blunt to a nigga share mucas
Body on 'em so what, look up we had shooters

(?) Take all tinted route
Hand guns, razor blades comin' out of the mouth
Borderline rapper, come see me but twin 49 rapper
It's more to mine rapper

Saw that rhyme after, yeah, got the right gat
Eat with the 2 Way they scared to write back
Lay niggas down like this? No like 'dat
No whoever ran, make 'em come back like crack

You better worry bout you, don't worry bout me
I pop three, out the drop-e

Duece Poppi and T Double D

We got them AK shells and they hot as hell
Crackin' back to the white meat like lobster tails
Poppin shells, quick to crack your breastbone
Tore his head off 'cause he had his vest on

12 gauge, shoot ten times for haters
Niggas curlin' up like activators
Fake ass thugs, stop with them lies
You ain't rapped like that when Tupac was alive

I'm not gonna fuck with you nigga, 'cause I don't know you my nigga
So don't you fuck with me or my dogs
Nigga I'm for real about mine, and my dogs ready to kill bout mine
I chill, smoke crip and send orders

Off all those po-po's and armed forces, fuck 'em
They don't want to see me fly, I don't trust 'em
They probably want to see me die, that why
Hold the fire, and keep it closed and keep an open eye

For them haters and hoes, 'cause I don't play about mine
Goin' deep, pray about mine
Know baby had to spray about mine, AK about mine
Fuck that you've been warned too many times

How you feel bout yours, nigga I'm ten times worse
You gettin' revenge but nigga mine will get you cursed

And that Iceberg on the curve is thug animated
But first off this is T double
When I hitya with them k cutters

Rick Ross,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?

You looking for her in the daytime, with the light
You might be the type if I play my cards right

You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What's the problem, I don't see no ring on your hand
I'll be the first to admit it

Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?

Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team

My heart in the trap, got my money on my mind

By the bottles in the pail, and the models that we share
I'm in a realist state, and a realist state of mind
We came from trigger play, kill a nigga for a dime
I'm tryna chill today, I got a million on my mind
Dice in my hand, one roll, I blow your mind

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
More trips, more whips, more money, I'm more rich
More haters, more clips, more jewels, more Chris
Half a hundred grand and some rubber bands
? off fast in my other hand
On the other hand, I'm still pitchin' underhand
All soft balls, all bases covered man
More trucks, more bucks, more freaks, more butts
I see the vision, from club vision to ?
I get brain, I bust nuts in each states
Soon as I see what I'm lookin' for
I sit up in that seat and cut em' off on them 24's, there it goes
Baby girl, come talk with the boss
I pop a Jose bottle, you can kick your shoes off

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Ever seen a fat boy in a big body
Know you wanna sit by me, all you do is think bout it
Lease apartments to get kicked out it
Next day, buy a condo to get a kick out it
We don't take you for the view, this is what I do
When I'm on the beach, all my diamonds are water blue (Ross)
Let's party like the pack jam, Pac Man
Fifty grand, stacked in my lap man
Get a lap dance (and if you get my dick hard)
This your last chance (to hop up in that big car)
With the Fat Man (certified Hood Star)
But he a millionaire (look bitch I'm going far)
This the movement, a few niggas you wanna move with
Gucci on my feet, see I'm only in that new shit
Ha, they say life's a bitch
But close your eyes for a minute, and just bite this dick, it's Ross

If you ever cross that line
I guarantee ya there'll be nothin' to save ya
I got a whole bunch of gorillas ready to pull the trigga
And we all for that paper

But only if you cross that line

I was birthed in the crackhouse
But what made it worse every first is a??

Green cards for the free lunch

Got poor credit, got whore debit
Walk in the 40-40 I'ma score, bet it
Four tennis chains hoe, I'm progetic

A for the K. D ditch the car for the smooth get away. 
I'm bad, I poke yo ass in the nose wit a cold 44 now he cold on the floor. 
Laying on his back like he posed for a hoe, when you acting like a bitch gotta go gotta go. 
Tell the truth that nigga be ripping ain't it man. 
Just got a hummer and I got my shit painted man.

Now here are some interesting facts about the mastermind
Which give you an idea of how important it is
And how necessary that you embrace this principal 
And make use of it in attaining success in your chosen occupation

First of all, it is the principal through which you may borrow 
And use the education, the experience, the influence 
And perhaps the capital of other people in carrying out your own plans in life
It is the principle through which you can accomplish in one year more 
Than you could accomplish without it in the lifetime 
If you depend entirely upon your own efforts for success

There is no such thing as something for nothing
Everything, including your personal success, has a price that must be paid

I just upped my stock, fuck them cops
If you love hip-hop bust them shots",Intro,2006
Rick Ross,"It ain't a problem 'til I say it is
Handle my problem, that's the way it is
Always talkin' like a bitch but that's the way he is
After the ride, nobody'll know where he is, Triple C!

When you serve a cat a couple of times
Knowin' he serve in a couple of towns
Polaco, Pensacola, down to Duval
It put you in the midn of a pimp like Too $hort
Classy nigga walkin' 'round with stacks
But I'm gettin' word that he talkin' behind my back
Now is the time to listen, you gotta pay attention
He may pay a henchman, put him up on where you livin
Tell him all your cars, makes and models
Tell him how you on steaks and bottles
Opium Sunday, Oxygen Tuesday
How you go to the boxing gym tryin' to lose weight
He done told a nigga all your routes
And now you got a lowlife tryin' to figure you out
Catch you in the driveway, trigger you out
That's what killers about, that's what niggaz allow remember

Nigga please! You ain't a cap peeler
Save that  for your bathroom mirror
No platoon dealer; you niggaz baboons
Half gorilla, a camp of scrillers
Triple C stamp the trillest
I got B's I'ma spend it, I don't care what the bill is
Them hoes stay at the billets
And when they ask what year I tell 'em two thousand two million
A rider without a motor, you got it right I'm a solider
Long as it's loaded I'ma tote it
I told ya, flow so cold, below frozen
like ice water over the Pro Tools

I'ma show him how cupcake his squad is
Duct tape embalmers for makin' them comments

So I'm robbin' moms for that wake money

No polos 'til I started bag-gin' it

Ten grand for a pound of the bubble bud

Getting blessed on the ?, it's a way to reflect
Hard work pays off, I'm a boss, you can tell
By the bottles in the pail, and the models that we share
I'm in a realist state, and a realist state of mind
We came from trigger play, kill a nigga for a dime
I'm tryna chill today, I got a million on my mind
Dice in my hand, one roll, I blow your mind

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
More trips, more whips, more money, I'm more rich
More haters, more clips, more jewels, more Chris
Half a hundred grand and some rubber bands
? off fast in my other hand
On the other hand, I'm still pitchin' underhand
All soft balls, all bases covered man
More trucks, more bucks, more freaks, more butts
I see the vision, from club vision to ?
I get brain, I bust nuts in each states
Soon as I see what I'm lookin' for
I sit up in that seat and cut em' off on them 24's, there it goes
Baby girl, come talk with the boss
I pop a Jose bottle, you can kick your shoes off

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Ever seen a fat boy in a big body
Know you wanna sit by me, all you do is think bout it
Lease apartments to get kicked out it
Next day, buy a condo to get a kick out it
We don't take you for the view, this is what I do
When I'm on the beach, all my diamonds are water blue (Ross)
Let's party like the pack jam, Pac Man
Fifty grand, stacked in my lap man
Get a lap dance (and if you get my dick hard)
This your last chance (to hop up in that big car)
With the Fat Man (certified Hood Star)
But he a millionaire (look bitch I'm going far)
This the movement, a few niggas you wanna move with
Gucci on my feet, see I'm only in that new shit
Ha, they say life's a bitch
But close your eyes for a minute, and just bite this dick, it's Ross

I hit heavy in the trunk so I say I'm heavy hittin'
My car just got a Jheri curl the paint's still drippin'
My whip so clean I turn lovers into haters
Then I make 'em come around like curl activator
There are none greater; I'm the freshest on the scene
Rap gaming Jones I'm the freshest on the team
But really I'm a coach spitting game to the players
And I'm yellow with that purp like I came with the Lakers
I'm out to get that paper, the mule and the acres
I'm repping for the rich, red, monkey bathing apers
So catch a contact like you inhaled Luda vapors
Cause rapers get smoked like I rolled in some paper
Put 'em in a ash tray throw away the roaches
Move them out my pathway show them who's the dopest
I bring home the bacon and protect it with the toasters

With no losses we undefeated
Anybody think they can beat it must be on sherm
Got the streets on fire like raw scalps with a perm
I'm big worm and that big body slayer
Rip it open and you keep playing with my money
Smoke it like I'm a joke
I go for broke on the boulevard
In the paint and have a bitch nigga sliced from his eyes to his tank
You think I came at 225 pounds of trouble
Can't find a triller nigga than me if you had the Hubble
I been repping the dirty and I ain't finna to slow down
So if you ain't with it get out the way it's about to go down
You can get your issue like your ass subscribed
And when we ride there's nowhere that your ass can hide

Have you running up north like a runaway slave
Played pussy your bluff even if it's your period

?Cause they know my whips, my ice is brand new

Never drive the same car twice
You still buyin' chains, I'm in there chippin' ice
You know, is it real or fake, how much a killa make?
I'm ?bout ownin' somethin', ya dig, real estate

I'm in the '08 Escalade with brand new Gucci shades
I'm flangin' it and singin' it while stayin' up for days
You know my entourage, I does it extra large
Blue bezels for my nizzles, double what you charge

So whenever you see me, you know I'm Fresh2Death
French tip on my nails and now my hair is fresh
In some brand new clothes with some brand new hoes
Is that Phantom doors on that brand new Rolls

On another level, blue rose petals
And when I walk the block, I make everybody wanna talk a lot
To brag and boast that ain't my style, to high signin' and profile
I'd rather blow a pound with my pound and do what you say

It ain't my fault
(It's not my fault partna)
That everythin' you get is used
(You, you, you prolly can't help that, that, you know)
And I buy all my *** brand new

When I walk into the room they choose
(I mean, I'm Yung Joc man, come on)
?Cause they know my whips, my ice is brand new

I let her fantasize, yeah, I'm a fantasy, me
She couldn't fathom us *** on top of phantom seats

[Incomprehensible], now, can ya hang with it

I'm a boss girl, you lookin' for a job
*** me on your lunch break and you're sure to star
Get a raise when that brain keep me in a daze
Custom made suede Gucci shoes, I'm on another page

And my money so long, my money so long
I swear my money so long, ain't lyin?
Murciélagos, just for the car doors
This the main event, those *** is side shows

Where I reside, oh, you consider the side oh
Ashtray and peanuts, it's time to slide
Where I reside, you consider the side
Ashtray and the peanuts it's time you slide

My lifetime cases the street, my dime places the street
Until I wake and see another fuckin day is relief
I pray that he keep, I'm scrappin my knees from chasing this cheese
I had point guard dreams of playin for some team
Hit the block and made NBA money in one week
See I hussle in the hood and plus I fly birdies
And play the tracks out every month so I can ride dirty
Needed someone to manage my money I hired Shelly
But Shelly started talkin to much so she died early
They got me loadin up my Benz with my eyes blurry
I sent the message to the fucker at bout five thirty
Now if the bitch ain't got my dice for me then I'm sorry
But I'ma leave everyone who outside bloody
And then I go in the stash get the coke and the cash
I'm lettin niggas score it for half, I'm hopein it last
But still nigga don't, I might have to just go in the lap
And if its slow in the ass back to the rope and the mask

I'm a shark with the fork, microwave or pot
I'ma hit it with the Sprite and make that butter lock
Everything was cool, I was ice cold
Till I let that bitch get up in my nose

Cocaine, cocaine
Cocaine, cocaine
Cocaine, cocaine
Cocaine, cocaine
Cocaine, cocaine

They call it cocaine, cocaine, yayo
Coca leaves, whatever you wanna say bro
Cocaine is a hell of a drug, it ain't hum-drum
And we all know where it's at, but where it come from

The mountains of Columbia and Peru
Extracted from the coca leaf, but see that shit ain't new
It's been around for hundreds of years, exploited by the rich
They even use to put it in Coca-Cola, ain't that a bitch

You had kings, queens, princes and princesses
Even priests and popes fought to getting it in different instances
A privileged possession for dozens of centuries
Helped a few wars, legal and illegal industries

Grown by the cartels, protected by gorillas
Transported by the best to the ghettos to straight killers
The power of the powder pimping, you don't understand
Ask W man, he's a dealer and a fan of cocaine

Cocaine, cocaine
Cocaine, cocaine
Cocaine, cocaine
Cocaine, cocaine
Cocaine, cocaine

You chilling on the corner, looking cooler than a mo'fucker
Got a pocket full of hot, it's hotter than a mo'fucker
Living in that condition, my Phantom in the front yard
We them real dope boys, I ain't gotta front dog

Big dope in the trunk, following my Map Quest
Choppers in the White House, pistol on my lap, yes
I remember, when I first met that wonderful girl
Club Rolex, she fathered my mother a pearl

Spinning wild living foul, diamonds all in my dial
Pimping style, but they yayo got me wearing linen now
Getting paper, paper plates on convertibles
And my yayo to PA, that work'll move

Ricky Ross only fuck with legends
Pimp see, Bun be got the hustle perfected
I could ship it to ya or you could come and get it
Just bring the cool million with ya when you come and visit Ross

Ain't gotta prove anything to me motherfucker I know you ain't got no heart

[Chorus]
You say you got your money right
I don't believe him
You say you live the street life
I don't believe him
You say you got them killas with you
I don't believe him
I know a gangsta when I see him lil' buddy and
U ain't him
No, no, no
And u ain't him
No, no, no
And u ain't him

[Rick Ross]
When you keeping me trill
Suckers wanna ride
Cutting corners in the '65 hoes skinny ties
You telling lies
Selling pies
I'm selling mine
Shots fired but expired bout 7 times
How the fuck you cool
You don't even know the rules
He just flew the coop and got chickens he wanna move
But I'm a handle this
Show em how it's gots to go
Before you get to management you gotta mop the floor
He's not a hustler
He's not a gangsta
Go get your word let me tell ya so sucka thank ya
I'm a boss
You gotta grind if you wanna floss
Baby we boss buffing that pine as I'm peeling off

[Chorus: Rick Ross & Nelly]
They say you moving chickens right
I don't believe him
They say you got a meal ticket right
I don't believe him
Say you got a white phantom too
I don't believe him
I know a hustler when I see him lil nigga and he ain't you
You say you got your money right
I don't believe him
You say you live the street life
I don't believe him
You say you got them killers with ya
I don't believe him
I know a gangsta when I see him lil buddy and u ain't him
No, no, no
And u ain't him
No, no, no
And u ain't him
No, no no
And u ain't him",U Ain't Him,2008
Rick Ross,"[Chorus]
I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending
And thats all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your hear

I shed tears cause im told that they'll heal
You tell the truth I don't know how to feel
Never felt alone in a room full of friends
Got big plans but you leave em in suspense
Pray for me, patience wait for me
Pay dues, trust me they aint comin
Way back it was hoops, now its maybach coups
And we all took a vow, no squares in the loops
Now we lookin at each other, sittin in a court room
I'm laughin, cause its lookin like a cartoon
Never snitch, got it tattooed by kartoo?
(somebody switch) by my rules we all lose

[Chorus]
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control
You got it down, and your well on your way to the top
But there is something you forgot

Flippin through magazines, ridiculed for my life
But they keep takin pictures of my jewells in the light
100g's in the night, entertainin big timers
'Cause my 1 liners rude like don imus
Smellin ros on my breath, ex ? fell asleep in his bed
Habits we developed livin lavish stackin mail up
Clothes come from big n tall ?
Got live life, tryna live life,
Penthouse for a pimp, only drove the benz twice
Convertible to the cars, cause I murdered all of ours
Get 50 collect calls from dawgs behind bars

[Chorus]
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying
To keep it under control
You got it down
And your well on your way to the top
(trilllllaaaaaaaaaa..ross)
But theres something you forgot

Fortune n fame are pleasures you couldn't fathem
But fortunately for me my fortune built me a palace
Benjamins by the pallet, im spendin em mighty daily
I know I'm under sureveillance ( I look at it as a talent)
Millions a gotta manage, lil talents up in the rappin
Im such a threat to these n*ggaz (you never know what could happen)
I started without a coin, not knowin which way im goin
Now im chowderin ?, n readin em a few poems
Weathered all of the storms, now its time to see the light
I never felt this way bout anythin in my life
Determined to be the best, not lookin back at regrets
How many people you blessed is how you measure success

[Chorus]
I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart",Shot to the Heart,2008
