Bob Marley,"How Is There Going To Be Peace
When There Is No Justice, Oh No, Oh
Someone Is Taking More Than Their Share
Of The Bounties Of This Land And That´s Not Fair
So Little People Got More Than They Need
While There´s So Many Hungry Mounths In The World To Feed
And I Am Would Give My Heart So True
And I Will Give My Love For You, Tell Me
How Is There Going To Be Peace
When There Is No Justice Oh No, Oh
Someone Is Taking My Share And They Just Don´t Give A Darm
No They Don´t Care
So You Just Might As Well Face It
Cause There ain't No Other Way To Erase It
And I Will Give My Heart So True
And I Will Give My Love For You, Tell Me...",Peace,2004

Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

Woman hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

When I die, fuck it I wanna go to (hell)
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion

Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

I swear to God I just want to (slit) my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm (dead), a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't,
I can't believe (suicide's) on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

Woman hold her head and cry

But with all he possesses self preservation comes first
His damnation comes not from burning free
As destruction of the poor is their poverty, is their poverty

Ah, but in this he does rejoice
His burdens though heavy, he somehow bears
As for his seed, there's only one who cares
There's only one who cares

Though his pilgrimage extends, his progresses ascend
But as the prudent one exalts, he is gonna find his faults

Needed something to ease my troubled mind.

He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.

I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.
Folks down there tell me,
They say, ""give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by"".
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.
Listen!  it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.
Let me tell you about cloud nine.

And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free

Yeah! All around in my home town,
They're tryin' to track me down;
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy,
For the life of a deputy.
But I say:

Oh, now, now. Oh!

Sheriff John Brown always hated me,
For what, I don't know:
Every time I plant a seed,
He said kill it before it grow -
He said kill them before they grow.
And so:

(I shot the sheriff.) Oh, Lord!
(But I swear it was in self-defence.)
Where was the deputy? (Oo-oo-oh)
I say: I shot the sheriff,
But I swear it was in selfdefence. (Oo-oh) Yeah!

Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town, yeah!
All of a sudden I saw sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down,
So I shot - I shot - I shot him down and I say:
If I am guilty I will pay.

(I shot the sheriff,)
But I say (But I didn't shoot no deputy),
I didn't shoot no deputy (oh, no-oh), oh no!
(I shot the sheriff.) I did!
But I didn't shoot no deputy. Oh! (Oo-oo-ooh)

Reflexes had got the better of me
And what is to be must be:
Every day the bucket a-go a well,
One day the bottom a-go drop out,
One day the bottom a-go drop out.

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten, glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas

And the thing that will make them ring, is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you see

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling
Hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer's really know how to fly

To kids from one to ninety-two

Merry Christmas to you

Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I am telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

You may not believe this but
He is making a list and checking it twice
Going to find out who is naughty and who is nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Your town and my town

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you are wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I am telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Believe me I'm ready for him

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2009
Bob Meyers & the Rivieras,"Went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said ""Son, do you feel kind of warm?""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love""

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
Said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Much to my big surprise
The next thing I discovered
The fortune teller told me lies

So I ran back to that woman
Mad as I could be
Told her I didn't see nobody
How she made a fool out of me

Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.

It's been testing my patience

And I thought to myself ""hold tight""

I wanted to know her

Now everything is so expensive and complicated

Bob Mould,"Tell me that you're feeling trapped in this life, thinking of moving away
You say that it's all for the best, we'll both be better off that way
My jaw hits the floor as the words sink in
I didn't know you felt so strongly
Makes me wonder what went wrong

Trust barely drips through the sieve, and I still can't believe it
Our love fades and drifts away, stand by for the last refrain
The moving trucks are pulling up in our front yard

So this is the way that it feels, I wondered how this might feel
The sound of your voice fades away like an echo in some empty cave

The 411 in my area code has got no listing for me
All my mail sits there in the post box, it seems I've lost the key

Coffee, it comes to a boil, the percolator's making noises
No one left to blame, stand by for the last refrain
I still hear the moving trucks back up in our front yard

Today is the day I forget all about it, it's over, don't worry about it
Today I can open the window, today is the day I can fly

Today I am starting the rest of my life, today, I can touch the sky
And I can leave that beeping sound of that truck behind

No moving trucks to hold me down",Moving Trucks,1998
Bob Mould,"You, yeah, you always haul my ball and chain right
To there, the place where I get lost inside of
You, yeah, I see your face and hear your voice right
Through that which seems so hopeless and confusing

Sometimes I try too hard to separate the
Good times from sadness that we've had together
Balancing, I need to keep it all in some perspective
Calm me down, I need you more than you will ever comprehend

I don't want this to end, I can't lose one more friend

I go through my regrets and I return the compliments and
Hope I find that innocence, I've got to be here no matter what happens

Slow down, you say that time will tell the story, it
Goes around, but no one else could know what's here
Between us, I sense this tension that I know so
Well, but the calm I feel is being with you, near you constantly

I can't wash this away, it's here to stay

I need to cleanse my soul, these thoughts will make me lose control
So if I lose control, don't leave me, you've got to be here, no matter what happens

Trust me, I'm here for you with good intentions
Trust in me, despite some times when I don't trust
Myself, in myself, in my head, in my own confusion
My confusion gets the best of me, my illusions set me free

Free to dream about what I really need to set me
Free, is it you, is it me, what can I do to set you
Free, to be real, to be with me when I need you
Are you listening, are you listening to me

Forgive me when I lose control (sometimes I forget myself)
Forgive me for the thoughts I have (sometimes I think just like you)
Maybe I can't trust myself (I know that I can trust in you)
But I can't keep it to myself (I feel just like you)",New #1,1998
Bob Mould,"I stumble through this godforsaken
Uncertain of the path I'm taking
But along the way, I make a smile
I hope where I end up might be worthwhile

Holding in the breath of anger
Inside this old refrigerator
Those days are gone, there's more ahead
So concentrate on what's in store instead

A memory, a dream, or another crazy scheme
Then I find out what I want is something in between
Waking and repeating my routines
Walking circles, talk in circles to me

Words that tumble effortlessly from the lips of fools
Only cloud up what I see in my reflecting pool
Jumping headfirst into symmetry
I am splitting at the seams, hold me

In my reflecting pool, I look in my reflecting pool
This sole reflection is my own, the pool is still until the pebble's thrown",Reflecting Pool,1998
Bob Mould,"Floodlight, Arizona, the fire trucks rush in
Double wide double bed, specks of ceiling paint fall off the tin
And they're standing by, brow begins to moisten as you take
Another hotshot to stiff you up, the room is spinning now

That's it, man, inhibitions fall by the wayside
Happy man, you don't care what's happening
To you now, it's all one big blur of lights and action
Later on, you find out
You've been had, you've been tricked, you're exposed, you've got it

Made in the skin trade with your heavy head and heart, you fall apart
And the hole in your arm won't heal the pain you're feeling
Made in the skin trade, darling, every stitch of you has been revealed
And there's nothing left to conceal

Hemispheres so high and mighty, velveteen and chalk delight
You've become the new obsession of everyone that you've caressed
But you can't tell who recognizes you, can't tell who knows your face
Can't tell anything, can't tell anyone what you've done, you've got it

Made in the skin trade with your heavy head and heart, you fall apart
And the hole in your arm won't heal the pain you're feeling
Made in the skin trade, darling, every stitch of you has been revealed
And there's nothing left to conceal",Skintrade,1998
Bob Mould,"I needed the rain to wash away indifference
I needed the wind to air out the differences
I needed the sun to warm up my spirits
I need these elements to feel somewhat centered
I wanted some time without the impositions
I wanted a life beyond the Spanish inquisition
I wanted so little, but it seems I need so much
Too much to ask for, but I want what I deserve
I need these elements to feel somewhat centered

When I walk, I don't care where I'm going
All I know is the movement does me good
Gravitation, pulleys, puppet strings
Paper, scissors, rock me back to sweet serene

I could have stayed inside for another year
I could have died if I hadn't disappeared

Too much to ask for, but I want what I deserve
I need these elements to feel somewhat centered",Sweet Serene,1998
Bob Mould,"This fever on my mind, I'm burning down inside
My luck may never change, or so it seems that way
I know in seven years, this curse will disappear
Where has my ladder gone? I feel like I've been robbed

[Chorus]
In taking everything from me now
I'm making over what I hoped to be, I know
This is my only folder left with all these words
You've taken everything from me now

You take my license plates, you've taken everything
The place where I belong, you take all my songs
You've taken what I wanted, the few things that I kept
I turned around to help someone, and then you helped yourself

[Chorus]

So take away the skin, you scratch until you win
And in this lottery, what is the prize for me? 
I'd give you anything, but I can't match this happiness
What's right or wrong, where do I belong?

Where has my ladder gone? you take all my songs
Where do I belong?

Bob Mould,"Kept my heart locked away, kept it far away from me
Found a place by the river where nobody goes
Buried far beneath the levee

Places where I used to go, when it rained, my heart went deeper
Deep blue underneath the sea, washed away for no one to see

I don't have the feelings I'm supposed to know
I don't get the feeling that you understand
Only get the feeling that you're feeling sorry for me
That's never been the point of what I've said

Never really knew what love was, mixed it up with other thoughts
Growing up alone doesn't help one sort it out
Even when you're here, you're not

Never learned to trust another person
Never knew a person who could understand my words
Why I chose to share them, I will never know, but knowing
No one took the time to understand

Do I want forgiveness, or the thrill of maybe knowing
I could change direction, never caring where I'm going
Sometimes all the time it takes to make your destination
Isn't charted out as clearly as it seems

Now the smell of vaporub comes over me
All the shame of weakness builds again
Rules and expectations I can't follow any more
I became the person that I am

Wouldn't want to make you think you haven't found a way to me
It's only that it's not as simple as it seems to be",Vaporub,1998
Bob Mould,"Who was around when the world was falling down? 
Who turned away? couldn't bother to be around this now
Who walked away when the game wasn't fun to play? 
And my escape became my only game

Hand me over and hand me down
Get me out of your sight
No direction, my compass is broken
Where'd you leave me tonight? 

I was a child, and now it seems so long ago
Why'd you abandon me? maybe it's not for me to know
No explanation needed, nothing can change the way things went
You just weren't interested, I guess, I guess

Some days fine, others out of my mind
And the curse I curse is the worst it gets
I hold it inside as you sleep, as you hide from
The mess that you made of your life

(who was around when you were hungry? 
Who eased the pain of all your sadness? 
Who played with you when you were lonely? 
Who was around? )

What will your conscience say? maybe you'll change the channel soon
Or simply hide it in the chest of drawers inside your room
Like old linoleum, battered and worn beyond repair
Go burn the whole house down, like anyone cares

Maybe in time, these indelible lines will
Fade like the hopes and the fears you denied
These feelings are gone, they've been buried along
With the rest of the mess that you made in your chest of drawers",Who Was Around?,1998

If you make it clear

I did or didn't do enough

As you remain beside me muted and studying

In beauty and radiant heat
I will write the words I want to hear you say
On a page torn from my diary
I'll hand you the sacred text and wait for you to place it

Across the hole in my heart, smoothing the edges from the center
Affixing it in place with sugar water and saliva
I want you to read these words to me every day

And this is where the thought resides
Stuck upon my heart, on the outside
I am speechless in your beauty, you are flawless in my eyes
As your eyes show my reflection

I try to ignore the decay and listen harder to the tone
The pitch of your broad chest as it exhales into mine
Old highs, new lows. Ain't that how life goes.",Old Highs New Lows,2008
Bob Mould,"True blue star, would you stay in my heart?
Or will you fool me once again?

Time to remember and forget
The love you gave, the deep regret
And in the end, return to dust
And in the end, return we must

The verse, the bridge, the one refrain
The turn, the happiness, the pain
When I am stripped of everything
I have the plainsong left to sing

What do you want to be?
Will you grow up like me?
What do I have to defend?
Where will I go in the end?

Growing old, it's hard to be the angry young man
Turn away, turn and walk away

Beyond profane and holy word
A thought profound, but never heard
With all compassion in your eyes
You cast me downward from the sky

Feeling the earth moving under my feet
All that was firm is collapsing
Eyes going blind, all is silent. Peace.",Return to Dust,2008
Bob Mould,"Shelter me from everything you do
Shelter me I can't see the truth
Keep me from this pain I see
Keep me from the pain you deal
Keep me from reality

I can't see reality
I can't see the truth from your reality
Shelter me from everything you do

Shelter me shelter me from you
Shelter me sheltered from the truth

The slow romantic decay
As it resonates, reverberates, and trails away",Shelter Me,2008
Bob Mould,"There were trails of fallen trees
Deciduous and weeding marsh
The lowland birds and crickets roared
The final sound of fall
Along the banks of the river
We approached the footbridge
Entering the wilderness
Following my footstep

[Chorus]
The silence between us is the time
When I can't hear the thoughts
That's on your mind, yeah

Beyond the panic and worried that
Seems to consume most every thought
There lies a calm and steady hand
That someday you might see
Perhaps it isn't what you wanted
Or even what you're looking for
But once you see the symmetry
Once you see the you and me

[Chorus]

Winter lovers, we're so nervous
The words will disappear
What thoughts are on your mind, yeah

You park the car outside the Holiday Inn
We cross the highway single-file
And you were walking in a hurry
And there was me without water with a smile
Yeah!

Even as we fight, it doesn't matter to me
Here alone in this place, here alone in my bed
I feel your warmth on my face, and these thoughts in my head

Feelings that i shared with you are over now
Haven't I been enough of a fool for you?
Everything I say to you feels stupid now",Stupid Now,2008
Bob Mould,"If you want it to be, you've got to stand here by me
But if you wanted to leave, go on and make yourself free
If you want me to plead, you see me down on my knees
You can do as you like, but do you know where it leads?

When I wake from my sleep, outside my window I see
A little robin that sings a little sonnet for me
And every morning, I feel just like that bird in the tree
I'd build a nest out of weeds, but would you share it with me?

This is very temporary, but I can't do without having you around
If it's very temporary, tell me now
Just to please you, I'd blow my brains out, this is it
Cut my heart out with a razor now

You're the one in my dreams, how can I make you believe
It's all that I want, it's all that I want

Now I'm lonely, it's the yearning
You infiltrate my thoughts and places in my home
This is very temporary, I know that's all you want, I know, I know
You're the reason I keep breathing, and I'll give up the fight if you go
Cut my heart out with a razor now",Very Temporary,2008
Bob Mould,"You plead with yourself,
But it's me that you want
It's the same thing every time, every time
I am determined not to fall
Into that trap again
It's the things I need for myself
And not a way to validate

I'll partner up with some gray statue
That never moves or goes on dates
Chasing the one who's running away
While being chased by the one you don't want
It's the race to be whole and it's always unfair
It'll break your heart for a while
Break your heart for a while
Passion hoping wanted
To you to be
What you are Today
What you are Today
The shape shifting, weightlifting
And hope the presentation
Will catch his eye
And it did, and many saw the string
He grabbed it
And lead you on your leash
You are burning up
Sleeping with anyone but yourself
And Just the moment you break
And just in the moment you break
You're closing the deal
You walked it to the other side of the world, and closed it
The door, in your face

You never give me the things I need
And yet I stay here wracked with need
Hoping you will see the things I need
But I've come to learn, You don't even see, I am invisible to you don't even see
I am invisible to you don't even see
I am invisible, who needs to dream,
I don't want to dream about that future
I only hope, that I can make it till' tomorrow, who needs to dream

Right next to the bathroom

With the hardest of intentions
 
My will imposed on you 
You flail and crack my skull

Bad blood better no blood at all

Used me up without permission 
The taste of last night's sex in my mouth 
My breath is blood and sweat 
Choking like a tourniquet

Soulless feeling deep desire 
Destructive answer and call 
Break me break me over and over

And stop the world from falling 
How it anchors me now

Half the verse it disappears 
In the static and the haze

And the second refrain gets lost in the rain

I picked the lock and grabbed the pills
I found a friend and then we went and then we went and then we went

And we don't know what we're going to do
'Cause there's something in the chimney
And it doesn't move around
And it's been a week since Christmas

There's something stuck up in the chimney
And I don't know what it is
But it's been there all month long
Well, it's jammed up tight above the fireplace
Now the house smells funny; such a big disgrace
That there's something in the chimney
And it doesn't talk at all
And it's been there since last Christmas

There's something stuck up in the chimney
And I don't know what it is
But it's been there all year long
I'll been waiting up for Santa like I did last year
But my brother says: ""He's already here.""
And he's stuck up in the chimney
And he doesn't say a word
And he'll be there every Christmas
And we'll have him every Christmas",The Chimney Song,1994

Infiltrate our nation,
Foreigners...
Take jobs from Americans.

Hey, we want to be Americans,
But we're illegal aliens,
And we really like it here,
Though we don't speak the language clear.

Foreigners...
Stamping out our unions,
(What do you mean, man?)
Foreigners...
Take jobs from Americans.

We sneak across your border lines,
To stand in unemployment lines,
We chip in to buy a car, 
Drive back home to get some more

Foreigners...
Hide from immigration,
(Hey, you gotta' place to stay, man?)
Foreigners...
Take jobs from Americans

As soon as I can get out on parole
I'll hang out on your street 
Your kids I'd love to meet
As soon as I get out of this rat hole


And I won't mind just sliding down your chimney
Cause I just spent fifteen years a-shovelin' coal
I'm Dressin' Up Like Santa Claus on Christmas
As soon as I can get out on parole

I'm anxious to get out among the living
And I'm makin' up a list of those to see
Duded up in red and white
Instead of these old stripes 
Just think of how surprised they're gonna be

The old home town will sure be glad to see me
Cause by now it slipped their minds how much I stole
And I'm Dressin' Up Like Santa Claus on Christmas
As soon as I can get out on parole


I'm careful to be on my best behavior
Cause the warden's watching every thing I do
Thank God he didn't see
That fight in cell block 3
Or I'd be stuck here till I'm 92
Just a few more questions from that nice committee
Then through those rusty gates I'll proudly stroll
And I'm Dressin' Up Like Santa Claus on Christmas

Oh come get us some floor seats

Paint flowers on your van

Wear your bell-bottoms

We quit our day jobs for them

So I just walked inside
I took two steps and realized 
I'd been taken for a ride
I heard high voices turned and found
The place was occupied
By two nuns, three old ladies and a nurse
What could be worse
Than two nuns, three old ladies and a nurse?

The restroom door said gentlemen
It must have been a gag
As soon as I walked in there 
I ran into some old hag

He can't keep his mind on nothin' else,
He stay in the barn for the good thing he's found.

Road Island Red is his best friend, he can't put her down.

When a man wants a chicken, spends his very last dime
Buying her fresh corn down at the grain and feed.
He'll build a nest for her comfort, and sleep out in the coop
If she said that's the way it's got to be.

Well, this man loves his chicken,
She lays him all the eggs she has.
Tell the farmer there's nothin' going on.
Believe me, she's cluckin' just 'cause she's mine.

He shouldn't stick his beak in where it don't belong.

When a man loves a chicken
I know exactly how he feels.
He'll shack up in the hen house with the good thing he's found.
