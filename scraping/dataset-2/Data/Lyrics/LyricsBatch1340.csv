Boom Desjardins,"Pourquoi c’est maintenant 
Que t’arrives à bonne heure
Ça t’en a pris du temps
Pour me crier dans le cœur

Qu’est-ce que t’as foutu
Pendant que j’tentais ma chance
Comme une étoile nue
Qui en a marre de la souffrance

J’ai froissé tant de lits
En pensant à tes bras
Pourquoi c’est aujourd’hui
Que tu t’en viens vers moi

Pourquoi c’est maintenant
Maintenant et pas avant
Pourquoi t’es en retard
	Sur le coucher du soleil

Pourquoi tu viens d’m’avoir 
Pourquoi c’est maintenant
Qu’il faut que j’t’aime pareil

Je n’ t’avais rien promis
Mais j’te donne une chanson
Pour te dire que ma vie
Et la tienne se disent non

Tu serais venu plus tôt
J’t’aurais sûrement dis oui
Mais astheure sur ma peau 
C’est l’autre qui écrit

Pourquoi c’est maintenant
Que t’arrives à bonne heure
Ça t’en a pris du temps
Pour me dire que tu pleures",Pourquoi c'est maintenant,2011
Boom Shaka,"Yeah

I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes
And make it go away
How long?
How long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
'Cause tonight, we can be as one
Tonight

Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday, Sunday, Bloody Sunday (alright)

And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me who has won
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

How long?
How long must we sing this song?
How long, how long?
'Cause tonight, we can be as one
Tonight, tonight

Sunday, Bloody Sunday
(Tonight, tonight) Sunday, Bloody Sunday (let's go)

Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away
I'll, wipe your tears away (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)
I'll, wipe your blood shot eyes (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)

Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)
Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)

And it's true we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV reality
And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die

(Sunday, Bloody Sunday) the real battle just begun
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday) to claim the victory Jesus won
On

Sunday Bloody Sunday, yeah

Boom Shaka,"Man a mek move
Got to mek a plan
People find food to feed their families
Youths dey a streets
Man a plant food fe him livelihood
Brothers in the camp
Yet the people dance
Youth a preach lyrics
Man a lick shot
Dancehall youth just lick a shot
Some a build speaker box
Fe dem business that in a society
If not the shackle is the boot
If not the chain it's your brain
Lord what a strain, strain, strain
Say Babylon have the people rocking
Tell you know

(chorus)
Chain, chain, chain, we got to break those chains
Chains off my feet
Strange 20th century
(repeat)
Come again my love
It's been your love too
I believe it's this feeling child

The youth a get wise
The youth a get stronger
In a time like this no Uncle Tom business na goan so
Not so, oh come we come to shake the house down
Lord lick off some rooftop ka we need your attention
Rock some sound
Can't shut this down
Rock some sound
All the people rally around
Stop fight natty dread locks down, down, down
Babylon got the people rocking to and through
Turn them out inside

Ain't seen nothing like that 

Give I the drum and the bass
If I man thirsty
Give I the drum and the bass
If I man hungry
Give I the drums and the bass

Raggamuffin rock you all the while

Want to be riding with you natty riding through with JAH JAH
Hear me now oh you sons of men
Check how you standing on the razors edge
Violence and strife in the city
Oppression and fraud inna de market place

Got to get next to you natty riding through with JAH JAH
Want to be riding with you natty riding through with JAH JAH
Riding through hills and valleys
Trample down concrete and stone
Trodding through rocky mountains
Cause this city is really not my home
Hear me now oh ye sons of men
Surely there is a reward for the righteous man
JAH say justice an love would satisfy his soul
Justice and love ten fold

Boom Shaka,"She's got mystery there's secrets in her eyes
She's my soul satisfier she change my state of mind
Sometimes my spirit feels so strong
For me there is no doubt
Sometimes I feel so insecure
That's when she pulls me out
To free my frozen heart
Free my frozen heart

[Chorus]
What a rush she's rocking me slow
My girl she moves me like smoke
Can't live without you baby
Oh she's getting me red she's giving me hope
My girl she's mystic like smoke
Can't live without you baby
Inna this crazy world
She's an island in the sky

She give me shelter give me shelter
When there ain't no place to hide
She melt me like the candle wax too close to the fire
Then all my worries disappear in the flames of her desire
To heal my broken heart
Heal my broken heart

Boom Shaka,"Traxing from Cape Town to Addis Abbaba
Natty never cross no border
No border fence can separate us no
JAH love is everywhere
(chorus)
Let us unite come together do it right
Mek we unite come together do the right thing (x2)
So people get ready ready now
Tomorrow might be too late for you to make your moves
I got no time to hesitate JAH love is the fire
My love is like JAH fire
Is a long time poeple been struggling
Fighting to reach the shore
Fighting to even the score
(chorus)
Standing on the corner
Checking out the border clash
All this fussing and fighting
I don't know what they're fighting for
They claim its a different country
But its same blood run through all veins
Same cry in all a these ghettos
Babylon system dread

When you start from the bottom and you reach the top, 
that's the moment yuh ah go fall
You try to do your best bu everything is getting hard

Cause everything in this life has a reason

Boomdabash,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",Il  solito italiano,1956
Boomdabash,"Notti d'estate mi fanno paura se non sei con me 
Mi hai detto ""ritornerò presto, tu aspettami qui anche se 
Il mondo crollasse in un giorno 
Se tutto bruciasse in un secondo
Tu non sarai sola io sarò sempre a tre passi da te""

Ed è sulu na notte se nu stai cu mie
L'estate nu torna se nu tuerni tie
Perdonane a stu vagnone le magie
Ha fatte in passatu e ca ha fatte cu tie

Scalu montagne
Poi trovo il deserto
Sulu cu na barca
In mare aperto
Nu bisciu la fame, sconfiggo la fame
Ci me settu a mangiare

Notti d'estate assutta la luna
Parcheggiati assubba la duna
Te pensu sempre, a qualsiasi ura
Perché senza de tie me fannu paura

Mi hai detto ""ritornerò presto, tu aspettami qui anche se 
Il mondo crollasse in un giorno 
Se tutto bruciasse in un secondo
Tu non sarai sola io sarò sempre a tre passi da te""

She said she'd been missing me
Like the sun miss the moon
Like a child tell mommy ""please come back soon""
And when she talk like this
It's like she break my rules
I feel so young in love
And I return back school  
This time you're gonna crying me a river
Because distance is turning deeper
And it's not enough when you say, I miss you
Those summer days I will always remember

I don't care if life
Take you so far away
I'll feel you heart beating here again
You know that I belong to you
I know that you belong to me

Riguardo le immagini
Pensando a quegli attimi
Sdraiati in spiaggia
Aspettando l'alba insieme a te
E adesso che non sei qui
Ma a mille chilometri
Mancarsi fa male
Quando rimane la voglia di te
Come un segno indelebile
Quelle notti d'estate

Il mondo crollasse in un giorno
Se tutto bruciasse in un secondo
Tu non sarai sola io sarò sempre a tre passi da te

Appeso a un ramo d’ulivo

Con la mano di dio come Diego

Manco fosse un negozio di Gucci

Boomer Castleman,"Because he called the forest brother
Because he called the earth his mother
They drove him out into the rain
Some people even said the boy from the country was insane

Because he spoke with fish in the creek
He tried to tell us that the animals could speak
Who knows, perhaps they do
How do you know they don't
Just because they've never spoken to you

Boy from the country, he left his home when he was young
Boy from the country, he loves the sun

He tried to tell us that we should love the land
We turned our heads and laughed
And we did not understand
Sometimes I think that the boy from the country
Is the only one who sees
Because the boy from the country
Doesn't want to see the forest for the trees

Boy from the country, he left his home when he was young
Boy from the country, he loves the sun",Boy from the Country,1974

Boomkat,"Does anybody know what, what they have crazy love for? (I do)
If you do raise your hands up high for me if you got crazy love
'Cause I know I got a ton of it
I'm gonna be a little bit specific

I'm gonna break it down uno by uno,
What I got crazy love for...
So hold on tight, lets take a ride
I got crazy love

For my daddy, god rest his soul
And I got crazy love
For the height that I set my goals
I got crazy love for goin' out and gettin' loose

I got crazy love for break beats and drum loops
I got crazy love for rainy days, grande vanilla lattes,
And be in taryn age 22
I used to be crazy in love w/someone crazy as me

Course we broke up so then I wrote the wreckoning
Well let me bring it right back to where I started from
I gotta grip of mad silly stupid wicked kind of crazy love (crazy)
I'm crazy (i got crazy love)

Said I got crazy love (crazy)
For sleepin' in and eatin' out
And I got crazy love for my crew who I can't live without
I got crazy love for writin' songs for when I'm down 

I got crazy love for the boomkat sound.
I got crazy for my Adidas and my lawyer Greg Ladidas
Have you see the new car that I drive around!
Well you can lend it and spend it and give it away

You know it all comes back to you one day
And by the look on your face
I can see a trace of what appears to be a space in your heart
Feelin' it with crazy love

I'm crazy (i got crazy love)
Yes, crazy...
What's up kellin? how you doin'?

Yo, I got crazy love for makin hip hop beats 
I got crazy love for gettin' freaky in my sheets 
I got crazy love for the beatles and the stones 
But we ain't got no love for people who don't have any love shown 
I got crazy love for doin' tae-bo at the gym 
I got crazy love for my baby madison 
We got crazy love for our strong single mother 
We got crazy love for people helpin out each other 
I got crazy love for you, my crazy older brother
Yo, I got crazy love for you too

Well you can lend it and spend it and give it away
You know it all comes back to you one day
And by the look on your face
I can see a trace of what appears to be a space in your heart

Boomkat,"Crazy how time flies by so fast
We must all remember to enjoy the ride
For it's too late once you crash
Life's gone in a flash

Looking back through the years
Photographs and scrap books held dear
Roller skates, sleeping bags
First bike, 12 stitches to match
I pick myself back up again

Daydreamin's the way to visit the past
Those spaces and times
That we'd all hope would forever last
Don't loose who you are
'Cause that's who you are

Lazy days, summer nights, I crave
Just to be alone again
In my head, where it's safe to play
No bills to be paid

I remember braces, ice-cream night
Amazing how much we used to fight
Road trips, ...??... place, being a kid
Yeah those were the days
But life goes on and I'm on my way

Daydreamin's the way to visit the past
Those spaces and times
That we'd all hope would forever last
Don't loose who you are
'Cause that's who you are

Don't loose who you are
Don't loose who you are

And I felt a little crazy you know
Cause I could have spilled my guts to you

But boy ohhhh ahhhh I want you yes I do

Man this is so strange
I'm feelin somewhat drained
Take my mind away
Then clean up from yesterday
And just move on

Oh yeah, I'm gonna move on

So I proceeded to ask what you were up to that night, yes I did
And I was struck down by ""I like you""
When I found out you had another love
I let my heart go too soon
So please don't let it happen to you

Man this is so strange
I'm feelin somewhat drained
Take my mind away
Then clean up from yesterday
And just move on

I never look back
Don't expect a second chance
But oh you're killin me in your be-boy stance
Temptation it's just a word to me
Ya don't give in to the absurdity
I'm wanting something
I can never have
I'd rather paint my nails
Or draw myself a honey bath
Oh, what do ya know
Look who's calling me now that I'm moving on

I'm feelin somewhat drained
Take my mind away
Then clean up from yesterday

I can cut my tongue clean off
And smoke myself toothless
I still be on the mic

I go deaf dumb and blind in one ear
And be the dopes deaf dumb blind guy you ever hear

As I lay here in misery 
Literally hopin' some body would give me some kind of time
I'm I dead of alive 
Is this a dream or a sign
Is there a chance I can find my mind and rewind
But paint me behind blinds and find somethin'
Its like a game but nobody told me we were playin'
And the fact that I don't know if I'm alive and sane
And inside my brain only one thing remains
The fear of no knowing paralyzes all most everthin'
An second can be my last breath
And my best guess is nothin' with on memories left

But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew, Oh then I knew
That he won my heart

But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face

[Boosie:]
I been goin' thru some shit
From my niggas to my bitch
And these niggas wanna stitch
I wanna get rich
Plus sometimes I don't believe (why?)
Tryin' to sell 100,000
But they burnin' my CD's (thats fucked up)
Niggas and bitches
Please
Won't you get me help
Get your ass up off the computer
And buy this shit up off the shelf
Cause I wanna ride candy man
Just like the others
Sometimes I wish I shoulda take the good route
Like my brother
These niggas say they love ya
But they get dope
How you a rat like that
And try to steal ya ho
I still cope
And these niggas wanna rap about you
Know you a soldier
But they still wanna bring that savage out you
To get exposed
And these hoes they for the money
Tell your old lady dirty lies
But they know they frontin'
Check this out
In baton rouge
It's real wicked
And you can't go platinum now here
Cause this ain't New York City
And all my cousins doin' time
Thuggin' in the pen
I'm thinkin' bout em
Everytime I take a sip of henn
And I ain't gonna lie
I don't wanna be like cammaflogue
I met him one week
The next week he died
I almost cried 
Damn

[Chorus:]

I been goin' thru some thangs
And don't nobody understand me man
I want rock candy man
I been goin' thru some thangs
Hopin' my niggas stay the same
But they always change

They hatin' cause I'm VIP
Ride through my city
With my hat bent like TIP
I'm all G
They got a niggas signin a deal
But they can't talk like I be talkin'
Cause I spit the real
Till I get killed
These niggas changin' like a weather
Think he your nigga
But you lookin' at the fuckin' devil
Who want your bezzle
And that voice that he wish he had
Jealousy got niggas creepin' down to bust ya ass
We livin' fast
But you notice I got em B
Money cars clothes and hoes
Till they pocket me
This for my niggas down in Texas
All the fuckin' swingers
Who got the whole other side of town
Wanna thank em
I'm stressin' cause the things I did
Not wearin a rubber got me stuck now with three kids
This shit is real
Wish I had a real friend to holla
They tend to laugh 
When I tell em bout my fuckin problems
But I be stackin' the feds
So I be straight when I'm gone
I been prayin' for webbie
Cause webbie wild with that crown

[Chorus:]
I been goin' thru some thangs
And don't nobody understand me man
I want ride candy man
I been goin' thru some thangs
Hopin' my niggas stay the same
But they always change
I been goin' thru some thangs
And don't nobody understand me man
I want ride candy man
I been goin' thru some thangs
Hopin' my niggas stay the same
But they always change

[Boosie:]
I'm sippin gallons tryin' to ease the pain
Hopin my niggas keep it gutta
But they seem to change
That's why I'm solo
Blowin' dodo in a different city
Thinkin' these niggas tryin' to do me
But they rollin' wit me
My ho da sickest
But she listen to what the streets say
That got me stressin
Cause she might be leavin' anyday
I try to pray
But when I holla he ain't holla back
That's why I'm missin' prayer daily
Tryin' to get these stacks
Why that
The situation that I'm in
The judge tryin' to send me to the pen
And give me ten
And do me in
Got me stressin' on some major shit
My mama agin'
And my grandma and my baby's sick
This hatin' shit
Got me one step away from clickin'
This me against the world livin'
Got all my people bitchin'
I look my mama in her eye 
Told her respect the game
She like boosie leave it alone
Look at craig ganes
Damn

[Chorus:]
I been goin' thru some thangs
And don't nobody understand me man
I want ride candy man
I been goin' thru some thangs
Hopin' my niggas stay the same
But they always change

And don't nobody understand me man
I want ride candy man
I been goin' thru some thangs
Hopin' my niggas stay the same
But they always change

Bragging bout their hustle, ain't never cooked up a nine piece

The best times was on the block, was on the nickel spot
Gangsta P got 30 for a nickel rock, repeated offender
Should've told that nigga stop 'fore they ate him for dinner
The church ran by a sinner since his word didn't stop
When he finish communion he gon' get a nickel rock
Lou started with a nickel rock, started flipping plenty blocks
30 Years in cause he sold that first nickel rock
Got my first head for a nickel rock
Ain't gon' lie, that hit was hot

Put this pistol to your head, it's time to go to bed

One thing about it, we gon' get this bread
When you knew shit was real? When they found a rat dead
Right around the corner where us young niggas hustled at
Right by the stop sign, that's where they was bussin' at
When you come here with nothin', gotta learn how to provide
Carlo had a Benz 'fore he was old enough to drive
Losin' 10, 20 every night, gamblin' ain't nothin'
And ya nigga got killed takin' up for his cousins
When you knew shit was real? Drop outfit in the feds
Still 8 years and a nigga shot him dead

Daughter just had her period, ain't there for her
Know how to have a girl you know just gon' hold ya back
But the pussy so good you keep goin' back
Hurt when ya main man turned rat
Make the whole la familia turn hot like that
Any city, any block, any boulevard
I survive, no lie, I'm a ghetto boy
I could tell ya bout the dos and don'ts
I make it anywhere I go, so lose I won't

Tell her leave her boyfriend then she fuck her best friend
Had a face full of sympathy but heart cold-blooded
Stayed fresh all the time but her little girl had nothing

When kids was playin' with unicorns, I was washin' cars tryna blow
Take a loss, get up and shake it off, and water whip the coke
No shoo-shooin', no not Boosie, to your face I'll let you know
Treat a queen like a queen and a ho like a ho
Went to the pen and I stood on my own, too fat mouth
And slangin' shit, fist fights, bitch whatever that you want do
? back down
I'm beatin' your ass, no exceptions
Uncle told me ""Fight 'em
You can't beat 'em, go and get your weapon""
My homies died, I stood up like a man
Do what you did to them, put that on Pimp, I don't be playin'
Bossed up, every time some problems hit the fan
Me and my girl got a case
Your honor, that's mine, give me that 8

Since 15 been takin' care of my mama manly
Never say the word ""why"" when it's time to do for family
The way I was raised, my closest peers understand me
The man in my section like Glen Oaks is to Handy
You know they told me tell on Turk and Mel for lesser charges
Ask me what I want to say, I say I want to fuck your daughter
I was raised to get paid plenty ways like a man
Taught to get it out the mud cause they ain't puttin' it in your hand
Beef came, I bring pain, Lord knows I never ran
Whole code up in the street, you never see me on the stand
System tried to convict me off testimony and lyrics, but I'm a G
Came home with my chest out, and it's easy to see that

First and foremost, what's your definition of a man?
They call y'all lil' money, that don't make that boy no man
I be sittin' here countin' these racks all day, got it hard for me to stand
And I don't need no crutches, tell the ho bring them dutches
Hit her from the back, got the pussy screamin' like
Oooh, oooh, oooh, was a virgin 'til I got my first pussy like a man
Got locked up, was movin' too fast, won't you stick to the plan
Everything I do, boy you gotta know I do for the family
Gotta do it like a man
Mama ain't have no help growin' up so I had to step up like a man
Can't see my mama strugglin', I had to hit them streets like a man

Boosie Badazz,"Have mercy on my soul, shine on
Have have mercy, have have mercy
On my soul, shine on me
Lord shine on, oh

First off I wanna apologize
Every time I made my momma cry
Leaving these pussy ass niggas traumatized
All the bad names I called ya when Lil Bleek and Lil Ivy died
Bless me over and over again
I know he bless me the more I was sin
Guess I was moving too fast in the wind
Got tied and put my ass in the pen
Now I'm looking at the past, thinking 'bout the future
Glad I got another chance, see ya feeling's mutual
Protect me in the streets when the times got crucial
When niggas slung iron, you made me blind to the shooters
And now I'm all alone and I'm calling on you daily
Asking for forgiveness and I'm asking you to save me
Protect my T-lady , don't stress my old lady
And you and I know how much I love my seven babies

Have have mercy, have have mercy
On my soul, shine on me
Lord shine on, oh

Thinking 'bout them nights that my momma cried
Only son since my only brother died
Surgery on surgery, I can feel the pain
Have mercy on the Lord, please don't let her hurt again
God you blessed my auntie Brenda be the living proof
Had a tumour in the brain size of a grapefruit
It's for them ghetto saviours that's living major
Now they missing like the flight 370 to Malaysia
We was skinning and grinning, thought we was winning
Heard it's hot in Hell so I'm packing linen
And lately my conscience been shaking me, waking me right about my sleep
Keep it 100, I ain't slipping 'bout a week, hey look
Gotta do it for my little cousin Trasity
See her boyfriend took her life
When I think about the daughter that she left behind
Pardon me, can't let see a gangsta cry, Lord have mercy

Have have mercy, have have mercy
On my soul, shine on me
Lord shine on, oh

I was lost in a world-wind, now I'm sorry
Five different baby mama's coulda been on Maury
Staying up all night, smoking purp for hours
Can't even get my ass off to church a couple hours
Beefing with the enemy, teaching my son wrong things
In and out the hospital on that strong lean
Looking at the phone ring knowing it's my auntie
Knowing that she tryna pray for me, but I don't accept it
Now I'm selfish, not to others but myself
'Cause I'm feeling like nobody know my struggle, just my wealth
But that was then and this is now and since you gave me another chance
God man I'mma promise I make ya proud
Lotta times I screamed to ya, felt like you ain't hear me
You ain't heard me 'cause I wasn't worthy, sins dirty dirty
Thugs cry, no lie had to hit my niece
Like please please, have mercy on me

Have have mercy, have have mercy
On my soul, shine on me
Lord shine on, oh",Mercy on My Soul,2015
Boosie Badazz,"All I ever did was teach folk in the community
A place where ain't no lawyers, or ain't no 'munity
Talked about animosity and how to keep it gutter
Explain to in detail why you boys don't know my struggle
It's that real deal shit from a real motherfucker
My stomping ground make me a ill motherfucker
Somebody say you might not like my music 'cause you might get burned from it
Mr. Miyagi with this shit dope, you learned from it
It's that murder man music, it's that nigga Boosie
30 chains on his neck, look at him, that nigga stupid
He on parole but look around 'em, he got 22 toolies
I trained 20 niggas, to bust them 20 umph
I thought 'em how to sell, how to stack they mail
When they slip and fell, I got 'em outta jail
If that ain't real, what you call that? Came home got it all back
My line busy nigga, call back

I took niggas with no hustle, made 'em out a G
Ran with niggas like Busta and Tommy Smee
I took care of niggas, if I was sliding, they was sliding with me
Wonder why a nigga couldn't sit and testify on me
Fucking everything we did get up and lie on me
And that ain't how I raised shit, Mr. Miyagi
Fuck any nigga got my back, I know God got me
They said I wasn't coming home, card watcher
They say all my niggas looking like they got hard faces
Mr. Miyagi, why the fuck you think they couldn't break?
Something rouge, they was schooled by a mental patient
'Cause all they had was niggas brains on the dinner table
If they ever ever ghetto, they look up to me
Every baby just a letter, they won't fuck with me
If you's a animal, use a lama, then I'm fucking me

Feed me through the tray hatch, even took the telephone
Tryna holla at my kids, baby mama never home
Serg and his boys got a problem cause I'm Boosie
Surrounded by rats so they can tell on me, crew shit

With that picture in my head, was scared, I was gom' never touch

Working in a field, man over ya with a rifle
Letters get shorter, face get greyer
People ain't got no paper, we might die in this bitch
This ain't living, I wouldn't wish this shit on my worst enemy
Feel like the whole world envy me, know I'm talking 'bout

Two times faster than it did 'fore I was captured
I'm dreaming that I was free, I wake up like ""God damn""

I feel like Joe in the Bible, why is what I scream
My eyes don't even clear with drops of Visine
I'm mad for being Boosie, so sad my eyes hurt
Only way the sun shine, I get out the rain first
On the phone, son crying, and I wanna wipe his tears
Change his diapers, clean his ears, now you deep off in my eyes

Keep moving in slow mo' like the Matrix in my eyes
No sleep, no rest, so I'm feeling like I ain't blessed
It's true I got more than most but I'm caged up like the rest
The devil's tryna defeat me, my closest friends deceive me
Question marks behind my freedom and got me badly eaten
I wake up feeling delusional, thoughts surface my brain
Visualising my kids, them thoughts turn into pain
My passion ain't what it was, my faith medium-rare
People I thought loved me is saying like they don't care
I'm stressing, biting my nails in my cell in pain
Me and the thunderstorms in my eyes can't see the rain
I'm calling out to the man, impatient I gotta wait
I know he come when he want but I need him to come today
No one to kiss me and hug me and tell me it gon' be okay

Don’t put your faith in man, he will fail you every time
Put your faith in man, he will fail you every time, son

It’s like we can’t see it sometime, but momma be on it
We don’t want it to be true, we just enjoying the moment
We don’t really know who phony ‘til the phony go phony
And Momma words flash back when that phony your homie
Niggas talk behind computers, but they really don’t want it
“Shouldn’t have gave that nigga shit, son”, you’re right about that
Girl, we used to rock tough, live life like that

Fuck it, this the fourth verse, this shit will make my heart hurt
When the nigga who you really love in your paperwork
I got some niggas gone who used to move my paperwork
Early morning up, going and getting it, moving major work
I’ve seen niggas gunsmoke their own brothers
I’ve seen niggas steal from their baby mothers
Nigga changed in the rain when you no longer ball
How you gon’ make niggas real who ain’t real at all?
Same nigga you’re at the mall doing your thing with
Snaking on the cool and he trying to get your main bitch
Buster ass nigga, you ain’t nothing I want to hang with or talk to
Look, you gon’ stay from ‘round me and I’m gon’ stay from ‘round you

Ain't had a money order, since my sister passed lil daddy (You can get some of my food)
Long as I wake up every morning breathing
I'm still happy (Huh bruh)
I lost my Mama soon as I got my time man (Ya Mama dead too?)
The family blame me for her passing
And I ain't lying man (Aw man)
I lost some fingers way back picking cotton in the field
Say his case was kinda straight
But he done ran through his appeals
I'm almost in tears
Say he don't want no lawyer
Say he wish he had a daughter
'Cause his son heart been cold since 6 years old
Told me when I leave, can I leave my socks & my tennis shoes
Shit, even my state suite man
Wish I could save ol' man

Played on her, made other babies on her
In tha projects, me and you
Eggs and rice every morning
All night on tha corner sellin' D
Tryna buy something sweet for you
Then we elevated to a big ol' mansion
Ain't that some shit
Boosie tat all over her bodyframe
Ain't that my bitch
Gon' always love her
Sat in prison, and I was missin' her
Lookin' at her photos in my cell, a sad prisoner
Even though she broke the code
Ratted, and hurt my soul (Damn)
I'mma always have love for Walnita

She fucked up my whole world
Called me by my first name (Torrance)
Different from other girls
We both grew up around gangsta shit
So instantly we clicked
Fell hard for each other, so she was instantly my bitch
But she was slick, she was a cheater
But I looked over so much
Never could turn my back, like I was 'pose do her
We switched schools
I switched girls, she switched dudes
It was crazy
But when we see each other, she was back my ol' lady
And everybody knew about Boosie and Black
(Boosie mess wit Nicole)
Remember I cried to ya Mama, Ms. Debra
Tellin' her to tell you to come back
Couple years past, we moved in
I had 3, ain't want another so I'm like no
Now we ruined (Won't be the same)
The love we shared
I must admit, it was all that
Ain't shit changed 'cause when I see you, it come all back
You still my dawg Black
You got a fam, I got a fam
Gon' always love ya

Run from the gun claps, run three laps

Battle me, battle right here, and let's see
So we kicked a verse that didn't hurt
So I hit 'em worst, to let him know I don't play those games
Save 'em for the jerks, D. Verbs said ""Son, let me get some""
I said ""No, 'cause he's a victim, and he probably in my premises
You know when I open my book wit my lyrics I'm endin this""

Fuckin ejected, he can't hang wit my style

He was talkin about walkin, to the tree spot
We took the L to New Rox, we got stopped by two cops
Talkin about ""Where the two glocks?"", we doo wops
How was I two glocks? Man, it's too hot
And I'm cold, so let me go, I never hold
Whoever told you, that I do la?
Lil Sha, fuck a do or die
Nigga die, because of what they do
I do what I do wit my crew
Po-po was hype, they was like ""You bite, stick wit the mic device""
Drivin off, said ""Have a good night""
Personally I might, and all that shit I said was a psych'

My life feelin like a bunch of bullets racin through my chest
Time after time i felt the feelin that you feel when you lose
Sittin on my stoop cryin blues
Seekin refuge from these hard-time skits
Remembering days when I was literally penniless
And have to watch my people do it alone
I said it was the last time but this time I swear
I'll make it happen if I have to to lose all my hair 
For real

Eyes watch as I make moves
Livin proof that the struggle still continues
Who's out to gain for fame?
Let him not remain vain
Time will tell who fell
And who maintained
Finding my purpose in this life
Cause I ain't sure that we all promised paradise
Precisely I'm just like the seed
Planted in the Earth to bring forth new breed
Shall I proceed to manifest destiny
Surely me and all of my be	 and see
Will find our time on the line of history
Faithfully as G-O-D watchin over we
Created we so I satnd in my God Body
Hardly moved by those crews that try to charge me falsely
It won't be the first time and it won't be the last time 
I'm sure

No more pain
Only good times after this

I'm nice without dudes, on my motherfuckin' track
niggas call me Starang, others call me Jack
but if you call and I'm not home, you can call me back
but no matter where i'm at, I always rock the show
the niggas next up on the mic, y'all niggas gots to go
Phantom of the Opera, yo I blow scenes North, South, East
West, fuck your chest dukes, get it out your mouthpiece

[Tek]
(I was) laid back sippin' Beck's, gently cleaning off a black Tek
JP's cuban link got my neck laced (shine baby)
steal the show like a thief, blow without a trace
see so many wannabe's steadily tryin' to be me
act grimy, crimies constantly scheme how to fi me
out to get the bonus, becoming assed out like the homeless
no disresepct intended, but it's a fucked up world we live in

[MS]
My lust for hip hop got me strivin' for perfection
and when my inner glow shine, you vision my reflection
and now chumps had to get a closer glimpse at it
as sweat trickle down your face, you break into a panic

Two piece your man and let Big Noc put him in a sleeper
Then see ya, catch me in a club on a wall
Spliff in my hand, big-booty broad winin on my balls

Buckshot rock knots wit fists
Niggas stay high while I rock wit this
Mobb on why'all niggas like The Infamous
Too close wit the dillinger, two shots I don't miss
I'm wiggin out while I'm diggin out backs
Run from the gun claps, run three laps
Perhaps, them niggas you sent to carjack
Buckshot got stopped in they tracks wit macs
Now this is what I act like when I smoke on black
Stay high wit the lazy-eye, bomb wit facts
>From the, street Bible or the street Quran
Fake thugs ride the dick when my shit comes on

You can eat a dick while I eat a thong (CLUE!)

It's the wave-king, rock the two tone Wallees strip-ons

Tek is the shit, ain't nobody spittin like this
Deep impact steez been like a chromed out six
Wit the AMG kit, Ericsson wit the chip

I keep the livin quarter held down wit two nines
One in the bed, one in the bathroom at all times
So while I'm takin a shit, I'm at route and plan a hit
The amount we flip depends on what we get
It's like a Wall Street trick, dirty money move quick
My mans wear stones you can tip the scales wit
On they ears and wrists alone for every deaf one's bone
Look, ain't no tellin how many gats I've thrown

The moral of the story is this
I used to say get off but this time
Suck my dick!
I'm from BK home of Big and Aaliyah
Watch how the pound of the four-fifth leave ya

Open up for Buckshot and just rappin retarded
I hate the life that I'm livin I need it
Don't believe me ask my wife and my children
See I'm back on the street packin the heat
Royalty checks equal to crack in the street
Niggaz like fuck crack Ruck rap to the beat
I'm aight I'll be back week listen
From day one I had bad start
To eat moms stole meat out the path mart
I ain't playin I went from the prey to the street
To blazin heat to blazin heat to haze in street
Did a couple of months and came home
Thought about what I did
Did the same shit I ain't come back home

""I don't know,(shit..fuck)..I don't know""

Chart climbin y'all kind can get a ghat to ya ribs
There's a thin between what I rep and I live
When you violate mine I'm getting back at you kid
Don't let it get to the gun clappin and shit
Plastic wrap back smack you in the back of ya wig
I, make it so you won't get back to ya crib
Break ya wrist, never scratch you never wreck it again
Take a risk never steal from Steele and Tek again
Take the fifth, cock the hammer let it rest on ya chin

Where you was at that coulda been so important you couldn't fuckin call

That's where the fuck you went, right, to go get pampers
Where the shit's at?
You don't smell that shit?
You smell it, right, you smell the fuckin house?
Where the fuck was you?
Why you think the kids act like that when you come around?

Knowin that her daddy's a crook, word up
All the time I'm in crazy drama
When I pick up the phone call my baby's mama, aha
She try to tell my baby I'm no good
But she don't like to explain how Starang is so hood
Sayin money ain't shit, she don't know no better
She got a regular job, she don't owe no cheddar, aha
Fightin and fussin, she's sayin, ""Fuck Will""
But bitches always tryin to ice-skate uphill
But I'ma stay aggy to keep you happy
Knowin it makes you mad when bitches try to get at me
You only four, don't like your hair nappy
We both won't rock gators less they Navy's
I'ma bust my ass to make sure you have, girl
Cause right now you're all I have, word up

[ VERSE 2: Sean Price ]
Aiyo, daddy want to leave now
Your moms playin games and I feel deceived now
I gotta go when I do a show or leave for tours she hatin
Sniffin my drawers, ask me if I'm fornicatin
I'm like, bitch please, gone are the days of me
Trickin with chickens on the ave that striptease
Yo, and I don't like your moms
Gettin to the point where I want to strike your moms
And I know you don't want to see me fight your moms
Get hype and commence to lead-pipe your moms
And I ain't goin to jail
I'm packin my bags, I'm out the door, I gotta bail

[ VERSE 3: Buckshot ]
Sit you down on that stool, give you a jewel
And let you know you're never too young for that rule
Rule one: you must have knowledge of self
To know the only one you follow is self
Anything else is useless, the truth is the youth is wild
Growin up and they ruthless now
But you my child and I had you when I was half you
Now I have to show you how to follow no man and when they ask you
What you want to do when you grow, tell em blow
Let em know everything that glitter ain't gold
Never fold when you come against a obstacle
And know that nobody's stoppin you but you

[ VERSE 4: Tek ]
Damn, it feel good to have my son on my chest
See my features in his face and I love him to death
Show him how to move right, just right for a gang
Cause me and my father never did the daddy-son thing
While I was in the streets pitchin, he in the crib bitchin
Moms out workin, nobody in the kitchen
Now I got one of my own and my nephews is grown
Still I'm out grindin makin a house a home
From month to month, see, I live on the road
Give em jewels and heat the hole cause the world is cold
I put the joint in his hand so he used to the piece
Told him white man's justice is a black man's grief

[ VERSE 5: Top Dog ]
You could say I love my son more than I love my wife
Think twice, you be sayin Dog is trife
That's aight, it's a father and son type thing
I got to war for mines and that's word to everything
Know what I mean, daddy gon' make the cash cream
Whether fast or slow my son know about the dough
You know, some say the boy look like me
But if he look like me he gon' crook like me
He got a mind of his own, lighter tone like mama Jones
He love phones, the boy be buckwildin when I'm gone
He do the type of shit they say he been here before
I think he's 17 months but he acts 17
My first born, so I had to name him Dashawn
Jarel [Name] Yates, he look like he lift weights
When we stack this cake, we gon' roll like skates

[ VERSE 6: Steele ]
Daddy want to stay, but daddy gotta go
Daddy can't hang cause daddy gotta show
Poppa was a rolling stone
Daddy used to hold iron so I roll with chrome
I was named after pops but they called me Tone
Some ways like my pops, some ways of my own
Daddy didn't know I got stoned till I got grown
Had my own car, home, and my son to moan
Just like daddy he want to hang and roll
Now I pass on game how to gain and grow
I know hustlers that came, watched em go
I peeped dudes on the come-up, watched em blow
Give jewels to my little mens and watch em grow
Give em presents just to watch em glow
When I shine you shine, violate mine, you gots to go
Stay focused, there's a lot you sohuld kkonw
Study life, listen and learn, sleep long, miss your turn
Gotta get in where you fit in when a spliff gettin burned
When you see me on a mission it's commission I earn
Remember as a man think if the world turn
Daddy want a new six, ya heard, do tricks absurd
My little homie's too quick to learn, word
Daddy need bricks, my son need kicks
Tim boots, jeans suits, all that new shit
He watch me do this, he know his daddy a soldier
I rep G and Jah cause that's me all over

Kill all the beef, and send you to meet Jesus
Say y'all, rappers, can hate on
Waiting on my down fall, mad cause we stay strong
Most record labels too scared to deal with some real shit
Bet they all ride the dick when they feel this
Duck Down, bitch, you in Bucktown
Little homey playin' big man and got struck down
Ain't near motherfucker safe in this game we walkin'
Puttin' in work, til I'm layed in the coffin
Play hard strong, scrape y'all, thing on my waste y'all
Face off, BC, every thing we been through we still together
Keep sons on the block, guess to dead ya

[Buckshot]
Roll with me, ride with me
You can get dissed til ya side, or side with me
Whether it's raw or it's cooked beef, we serve fiends
Proteins in our hooks and beats, from the snow to the streets
Skeets of the rain, feet in the games
And every nigga eatin' the same, I can't quit
Drama then we handle it, cause any man'll flip with no prob'
Wanna play ball? Get ya squad
My shit is for niggaz behind bars, who do crime
Do time, and do time hard, play the yard
Lift heavy, get ready for the massacre
We came a long way after ya, I see them niggaz gashin'
Cause, you really ain't half the thug
You just an average nigga flappin' for love

It's a framalama thing
(Let's take a sec to think back)
It went like this
(Think back) (think back) (think back)
As we go back...

[ VERSE 1: Buckshot ]
1981 - the first year rap begun
The first time I saw a backwards spun
I was in my living room practisin
Watchin the tube, _Facts of Life_
_Different Strokes_ in the afternoon
_Scarface_ looked mean in the flicks
Everybody who pumped coke back then was fiendin for bricks
'86, no fades, afro tops
In those days your whole ave was the spot
The scene locked with Lee patches, Cazel glasses
Suede Pumas and rumors of rap not lastin
Till the class of '89 came through
High top fade, tailor-made Gucci suits
Jordan was champ, Mike Tyson was amped
Reagan was the pres and the border was a place to camp
Just think back like this
As you reminisce, reminisce

[ (Jahdan &) Tek ]
(Think back now)
When Erving said he had the monster
Baddest bitch in skin flicks was Heather Hunter
(Think back now)
Rosie Perez titties
_Def Comedy Jam_, the _Itty Bitty Titty Committee_
(Think back now)
When _Martin_ was on
Jazzy Jeff, Fresh Prince ""Summertime"" was the song
(Think back now)
Buffalo was the spot
Snitches got stitches and you got jumped 'stead of gettin shot

[ Steele ]
Zone with me
Come home with me
Come home with me

[ VERSE 2: Steele ]
Picture in your mind, a place and a time
Where we all can go, don't need dough to shine
All you gotta do is, be true to who you is
I'm original and God is my influence
Hip-hop, be bop, jazz, rock music
Palladium and Roof Top, Latin Quarters boomin
We keep it movin to the beats, tune in to the streets
The rumors and the passengers preach
Rap I master so I teach; each I touch
Respect the power of the microphone in my clutch
Say ma, your little boy's all grown up
Hey y'all, I told you all we got is us
I love pops, he raised me on some good old soul
Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield and Nina Simone
""Songs in the Key of Life"" to hold
When the streets get cold
Always focused when I'm reachin for goals

[ Tek ]
That's PNC right behind me
Let no man take us under, bee
And no bitch for that matter, ya heard me?

(Let's take a sec to think back)

[ VERSE 3: Tek ]
This is for my 18 and under, 20 and over
Walkin round with the weight of they clothing on they shoulders
Look at me, 26 year old, years enfold
Drive a ( ? ) 'bout a year old
Did the gold, stepped my game up to grade
Rosary throwback, exclusives and haze
Seen hoes and dough come and go
Rememberin the reign of crack and power of dope
Witnessed miracles of babies bein born, niggas bein killed
Niggas gettin killed, babies born again
Showed your block love, Tekno Marine Breitling
The class of Lockman, new Jacob thing
Benz, 4, 5, 6
Truck, Navigator, Escalade, bitches want dick
Took it from the end of '89 through '99
I'm the nigga 2000 and beyond

[ VERSE 4: Sean Price ]
Meadowlark Lemon
Wood-sevens on the god neck
They the ghetto park reverends (peace god)
Lee patches got snatched, d's in the hatchback
With ease, nigga, pass that
Bennetton bag ( ? )
Niggas like, ""Son, you fly"" Yo, I can afford it
Decept niggas, in the party we tangle
With anybody, jump on the train, punch Guardian Angels
Don't believe, we put a stack on it
Cops like, ""You can drink, put a bag on it""
Back in the days...

[ (Jahdan &) Tek ]
(Think back now)
What's today's mathematics?
Saturday Night Specials, now it's automatics
(Think back now)
When crack appeared
VCR's got stole, shorty asses disappeared
(Think back now)
IZOD, La Tigra, 8 ball coats
My man Earl ( ? )
(Think back now)
Karate flicks, Gucci kicks
Favorite team the New York Knicks

I used to say get off but this time
Suck my dick!
I'm from BK home of Big and Aaliyah
Watch how the pound of the four-fifth leave ya

Royalty checks equal to crack in the street
Niggaz like fuck crack Ruck rap to the beat
I'm aight I'll be back week listen
From day one I had bad start
To eat moms stole meat out the path mart
I ain't playin I went from the prey to the street
To blazin heat to blazin heat to haze in street
Did a couple of months and came home
Thought about what I did
Did the same shit I ain't come back home
Niggaz like ""why you done that homes?""
""I don't know,(shit..fuck)..I don't know""

Chart climbin y'all kind can get a ghat to ya ribs
There's a thin between what I rep and I live
When you violate mine I'm getting back at you kid
Don't let it get to the gun clappin and shit
Plastic wrap back smack you in the back of ya wig
I, make it so you won't get back to ya crib
Break ya wrist, never scratch you never wreck it again
Take a risk never steal from Steele and Tek again
Take the fifth, cock the hammer let it rest on ya chin

Retired enforcer for the New York based Gambino

Godfather comes out and takes a seat across from me
5 foot 9, medium build, look about 63

He said I heard you catchin' pressure
J'oo feeling the heat
We hear you're mobbin' in the streets

You got to set it off!!!

(Telephone conversation)
 Boss: Hello?!
 Bootleg: Hello boss I hope I'm not disturbing you
Members of d'cappo told me to notify you this morning about a shipment that's 
coming in. 

 Boss: J'yea, I heard there's a drought out there in Michigan where j'oo at
I'm gonna send j'oo a thousand kilo's of cocaine
I want j'oo to sell it all
And j'oo send me my money
Bootleg: Well lets get paid
(conversation ends)

Fuck what you doin' now I'm boss!!!
Sippin' on Remi
Making reservations for the weekend Korea
Drug keeping over see a

Dedication and loyalty
Is the key if you want to get paid like a G
Promotions cross oceans
Big bank keeping up with dope policy

Now when we 
Step off the plane
Keep cool and don't offend me
Never speak unless you're spoken to
This man has keys to send me

Take a wolf pack
Stay strapped and ready to attack on these coast guards
No mishaps!
Perhaps
You'd rather take a train with the 'caine I'll arrange that

Are you with that?
When you get back
Contact Texas and our L.A. staff
Never let that
Cocaine get out of your sight
Whole keys don't fuck with halfs

Now if you get stopped at the gate
there's one thing you must promise me
Before you cross me
Just think about death before dishonesty

Don't call me
Unless there's an emergency to attend to
I'll send you 10 niggas with fully automatics 
To defend you

In a few days that shipment should arrive
Better send some scouts out
Keep a look out
Send two or three niggas on the coast
Standing post with they glocks out

No problems
Just follow instructions everything comes out lavishly
We'll solve 'em
Our mission is to make money fast
And to make money flawlessly

Start stashing
When the coc's all home
Contact money paid workers and separate

Pimp action
20 steps from the club
And we cool, bring cheese to

Lead us to another Holocaust?
Are we so deep in it that we can't end it?
Stop, hold, ever call it off

And the holders of the molotov
Say that ""Revolution's right here, right now""
And they ain't callin' off

Wake up, roll an eighth up
Throw a double finger with a fist
Here at the abyss
I will be your tour guide
It is war time, check your wrists (Ready, kids?)
Over to your right, shine a light
Got a bevy ready for the fight
I just wanna live, I don't wanna ever have to load a clip
Only hunt bliss
I am still a kid in my heart
But these motherfuckers sick
They don't give a shit, not at all
They don't even want to let you take a little piss in a pot
Listen along
They don't want your love, shit is bugged
Motherfuckers steady getting rich from the blood
Love when you beg
Trust, I would sooner put a puckered pair of lips to the sun
Love will survive
Run out under iridescent lights for our lives
I will be surprised if we ever got the feeling so alive as tonight
Wild for the night
Look into my eyes
I am standing at your side for the fight
Minds over might
Swear to God
They could barely even see the dog
They don't see the size of the fight

Wake up
Drink water
Smoke blunt
Clean, oil my Kalashnikov
Stockpile ten for me and friends in case shit get to poppin' off
The evening news givin' yous views
Telling you to pick your master for president
Been behind the curtain, seen the devil workin'
Came back with some evidence
I'm here to tell you don't let em tell you what's right wrong
Make love, smoke kush, try to laugh hard, and live long
That's the antidote
You defeat the devil when you hold onto hope
'Cause kinfolk life is beautiful
And we ain't gotta die for them other men
And I refuse to kill another human being
In the name of a government
'Cause I don't study war no more
I don't hate the poor no more
Gettin' more ain't what's more
Only thing more is the love
So when you see me
Please greet me with a heart full
And a pound and a hug

Save my swollen heart
Bring me home from the dark
Take me up, take me up, take me up
Take me up, take me up, take me up

Up, up, up
Up, up
Up, up, up, up, up, up

Seen the devil give a sermon in the church
Seen an angel dancing in the club
Tryin' to feed a baby so I threw a thousand in the air
And blessed her with a hug
I done been down so many times
Walked on like a dirty rug
And now that I made it, can't fake it
Gotta give me what I'm truly worthy of
(Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy)

And I don't how much it really means to be right
(Means to be right, means to be right)
And what a joy it'd be to see some peace in this life
(Peace in this life, peace in this life)
And it occurs to me that maybe we ain't even really seein' it right
Here in the dark
Hoping just to see a beam of the light

Boots,"Smoke from the loosie drift
Hold it like a crucifix
Blow from the nose I'm a dragon to a gnome
Got a average of bein' excellent the median just dope
Like the ratio of heroin to laxative that's sold
Authorities have spoken, demanded your pure devotion
Get magnetized to the ground while the falcons of murder close in
I chose to go guano, y'all know, kinda bat shit
The bright lights of fuckery stuck in me automatic
I’ll tea bag a piranha tank, heart barely beatin'
A wild one who’ll swim like directly after he's eaten
While holding a toaster oven that's plugged with a fork in it
Cause death by electrocution's like life in New York, isn't it?
Shoulda been a dentist, mom said it
Pain's the way that my craft expresses
Born in a little shop of horrors that I can't even afford to rent in
Where's the exit?
Wanna talk shop I can chop it up with exacto touch, whats the rush?
Autograph skin flaps, tag em up
I don't brag enough you defacto suck
A lotta you new to the El Producto milieu
Kinda like “fuck is you?”
I'm a little black spot on a sun of lies
But I'm not too high to say I'm the truth
I line the booth to catch blood like a Bateman
Nathan sacred I’ll mace a play pen
Jewel runner bitch make the name stick
Not for sale but I'm takin payments

I’m fly as a pegasus, that’s no embellishment
I’m here to pain the whole game, where the Excedrin
Good pussy, good marijuana that be my medicine
And I’m a mixture of MJG and the Weathermen
A revolutionary bangin' on my adversaries
And I love Dr. King but violence might be necessary
Cause when you live on MLK and it gets very scary
You might have to pull your AK, send one to the cemetery
We overworked, underpaid, and we underprivileged
They love us, they love us (why?)
Because we feed the village
You really made it or just became a prisoner of privilege?
You willing to share that information that you’ve been given?
Like who really run this?
Like who really run that man that say he run this?
Who who really run that man that say he run this, run run run run this?
Like who really fund this?
Like who really fund who say he fund this?
Like who in the world gon' tell Donald Sterl who to put on the “you can’t come” list?
Now don’t be silly
Who the fuck gon' bully me if I got a billi?
If I got a billi and the bitch recording me I’m like who cares
What I wouldn’t be is on TV stutterin' ta-ta-talkin' scared
So the question is when Don’s at home with that traitor ass bitch alone
Who’s that voice on the side of the phone that shakes and rattles his bones?
Could it be the man behind the man behind the man behind the throne?

I could see my other kinfolk and hear my little boy as he screamed
As he ran toward the copper begged him not to hurt his momma
'Cause he had her face down on the ground
And I’d be much too weak to ever speak what I seen
But my life changed with that sound

Get out, get out, get out, get out
Feeling this, feeling this too early
Get out, get out, get out, get out
Feeling this way, feeling this way
Feeling this, feeling this too early
Feeling this, feeling this early
Early, early, early, early

It be feelin' like the life that I’m living man, I don’t control
'Cause every day I’m in a fight for my soul
All hands below, high seas in a rickety boat
Smoke o’s, so the kid might cope
You want cash or hope, no clash, matter fact get both
Go without get turnt to ghosts
You know that's the law, deal done by the shake of claws
It ain't a game if the shit don’t pause
And I find you odd, so convinced in the truth of y’all
That the true truth’s truly gone
And yes there's a they, any time a man say there's not
Then you know that he lost the plot, what can I say?
Truth’s truth when denied or not, like its true crews ride the cock
Fair enough, the way that the beat bump do sound tough
I made it in the dark like Civil War surgery
Woke up in the same air you huff, early
By twelve o’clock the whole Earth felt dirty
Street Lamps stare when you walk watch the birdie
They’ll watch you walk to the store they’re recording
But didn't record cop when he shot, no warning
Heard it go pop, might have been two blocks
Heard a kid plus pops watched, cop make girl bleed
Go to home, go to sleep, up again, early

Get out, get out, get out, get out
Feeling this, feeling this too early
Get out, get out, get out, get out
Feeling this way, feeling this way

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

That people are the same, they all share the same fears
Share the same tears, and I over the years

I been getting high for the last what 15 20 years
So I told myself I want to know what it feels like to be high fo life
And I mean man I tell ya it feels real good 
You know coaching them lil kids out there on the football field
Doing my thug thizzle still but you know
Just being high for life is a different feeling
You should try it my brother I'm telling you its a great feeling

Bootsy Collins,"People are talkin' '
Bout the way I'm walkin' 
Troubled by the change in my stride 
Everyone's askin' 'Bout the way I'm actin' 
Bothered by the look in my eyes 
They can see a difference In my way of livin' 
But they don't know the reason why I can't wait to tell them what is wrong with me 
Love without condition 
This is my addiction 
It's a need that only God can fill 
Once I got to taste it 
Nothing could replace it 
Now I've let it overtake my will I admit my weakness 
Craving it's sweetness I have givin' into it's control
Love has got a hold on me and won't let go 
(chorus) I'm under, under the influence I'm under, under the influence I'm under the influence of love 
Used to feel empty 
Now I have plenty 
Ever since I drank from the fountain 
With the Spirit in me And the strength it gives me 
A little faith can move mountains 
Take my life, use me Lord Shine Your light through me for 
All the world to see that I am not my own

What the world needs is love sweet love

Gives me butterflies
Feels like my first kiss

I just can't deny
I need this feeling to heal
My belief in the moment

My pulse flows to the tempo, oh I
I just can't escape
Feeling time and time again
Can't stop 'cause I've never felt so alive

Feels like some kinda rush
Yeah, yeah, so good
Wanna show you how I feel
Can't get enough, turn it up

A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

And it knows, won? t be long now?

As my dry tears fall and roll away.

I save the best for last - surprise

All these bitches wanna lick my ice cream
I'm telling you, son, I'm living your dream
All I wanna do is to lick your ice cream
Give us girls a little something that will make us scream
When I was a bachelor even hoes would turn me down
Honey you ain't funny but you acting like a clown
My dog walked around with a diaper just in case
I would be desperate enough to try and fuck him in the ass
But now that I have a girlfriend, all these bitches want me bed
They call me the ice cream man (and damn, your ice cream is nice)
I serve it on a cone with two giant balls
And you swallow it even if it comes up your nose

I ain't like those other girls that you been missin'
I knew it all along, queen of my throne

To savor every drop, remember every kiss
You'll only get one shot, and this is it
And I know you've been waitin', since you heard me on your radio station
You know the situation, so boy please

She haven't stopped eating since I have first met her
And I could have noticed her jeans screams surrender
I'm no Hellen Keller
She says we haven't made love for over a month
But head is the only way to shut her mouth
And if she didn't swallow then I'd leave the house
She says it's my drinking affecting my actions the way that I'm thinking
She threatened she's leaving
She heads to the door and all I could say is
Turn around

There's only one member so I guess we had sex and I don't remember

On Insta no filter
Left her a comment #TBT you looked fitter
She says I'm a child
Xbox all day wont get me a bride
I tell her she's childish not sucking dick will make her a side bitch

Even though your lifestyle looked kind of occupied
I never once thought twice about the way I feel
And the woman that I am I thought I?d keep it real

But then you sent me love letters saying love me today
Tall stem roses saying baby let's run away
I was mesmerized thinking that you want me to stay
And I couldn't quiet say the words I wanted to say, yeah

From the day that I saw your face, girl
You didn't need to hide I could see you were lonely
Even though you gave your heart to another
Well, it hurts even more to see you cry

Now there's nothing wrong
'Cause I know that it's been too long since you felt love
I want to take you out of this place
We can find a space well

We got nothing to be guilty of our love its one in a million
So, girl, let's ride tonight on a highway to the sky, oh yeah
Don't wanna hear goodbye

It was paralyzing running in the sand
Holding hands and the candle light dinners
Proved that you were my man
Now I can't deny just how I feel inside

I'm in ecstasy every time you get next to me
You tell me that you're lucky and I tell you back
Now I'm here to stay, baby boy and it?s a fact
That nothing could compare to the times we share a
And the love that we made was a sweet, sweet thing

We got nothing to be guilty of our love, it's one in a million
So, girl, let's ride tonight on a highway to the sky
I wanna ride ride, don't want to hear goodbye

We got nothing to be guilty of
At any time because we making love
We got nothing to be guilty of
We got nothing, we got nothing

We got nothing to be guilty of

Je ne veux pas la faire

J'ai vu partir mes frères

Mais il était râblé comme tout
Il m'a suivie jusqu'à ma piaule
Et j'ai crié vas-y mon loup!

Envole-moi au ciel Zoum!
Fais-moi mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
Moi j'aime l'amour qui fait boum!

Il n'avait plus que ses chaussettes,
Des belles jaunes avec des raies bleues
Il m'a regardé d'un œil bête,
Il comprenait rien, l'malheureux
Et il m'a dit l'air désolé :
""Je n'ferais pas d'mal à une mouche""
Il m'énervait je l'ai giflé
Et j'ai grincé d'un air farouche

Fais-moi mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
Je n'suis pas une mouche Zoum!

Voyant qu'il ne s'excitait guère,
Je l'ai insulté sauvagement,
J'y ai donné tous les noms d'la terre,
Et encore d'autres bien moins courants.
Ça l'a réveillé aussi sec,
Et il m'a dit: ""Arrête ton charre
Tu m'prends vraiment pour un pauvre mec,
J'vais t'en refiler, d'la série noire.""

Tu m'fais mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
Pas avec des pieds Zing!
Tu m'fais mal, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny,
J'aime pas l'amour qui fait bing!

Il a remis sa p'tite chemise,
Son p'tit complet, ses p'tits souliers,
Il est descendu l'escalier
En m'laissant une épaule démise.
Pour des voyous de cette espèce,
C'est bien la peine de faire des frais,
Maintenant, j'ai des bleus plein les fesses

For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Bringing life to our kingdom of doing
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship fantasii
All your dreams will come true, miles away

Our voices will ring together until the twelfth of never,
We all, will live forever, as one

Come see victory, in the land called fantasy
Loving life, a new decree, 
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty

Our minds will explore together, old worlds, we conquer, forever
We then, will expand love together, as one

Come to see, victory in a land called fantasy,
Loving life, for you and me, to behold, to your soul is ecstasy
You will find, other kind, that has been in search for you,
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize it's your life, now in review
And as you stay for the play, fantasy, has in store for you,
A glowing light will see you through

It's your day, shining day, all your dreams come true

Born 2wice,"6 in the morning, police at my door
Fresh Adidas squeak across the bathroom floor
Out my back window I make a escape
Don't even get a chance to grab my old school tape
Mad with no music, but happy cause free
And the streets to a player is the place to be
Got a knot in my pocket, weighing at least a grand
Gold on my neck, my pistols close at hand
I'm a self-made monster of the city streets
Remotely controlled by hard hip-hop beats
But just living in the city is a serious task
Didn't know what the cops wanted, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]

Seen my homeboys cooling way way out
Told 'em bout my morning cold bugged' em out
Shot a little dice til my knees got sore
Kicked around some stories bout the night before
Posse to the corner where the fly girls chill
Threw action at some freaks until one bitch got ill
She started acting silly simply would not quit
Called us all punk pussies, said we all weren't shit
As we walked over to her, ho continued to speak
So we beat the bitch down in the goddamn street
But just living in the city is a serious task
Bitch didn't know what hit her, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]

Continued clocking freaks with immense posterior
Rolling in a Blazer with a louie interior
Solid gold the ride was raw, bust a left turn was on Crenshaw
Sean-e-sean was the driver, known to give freaks hell
Had a beeper goin' off like a high school bell
Looked in the mirror, what did we see?
Fucking blue lights: L.A.P.D
Pigs searched our car, their day was made
Found an Uzi, .44 and a hand grenade
Threw us in the county high power block, no freaks to see no beats to rock
Didn't want trouble but the shit must fly, squabbled this sucker shanked em in the eye
But just living in the county is a serious task
Nigga didn't know what happened, didn't have time to ask

[Hook]

Back on the streets after five and a deuce
Seven years later but still had the juice
My homeboy Ken Gee put me up the track
Told me E's rolling Villain, BJ's got the sack
Bruce is a giant - Nat C's clocking dough
Be bop's a pimp, my old freaks a ho
The batter rams rolling, rocks are the thing
Life has no meaning and money is king
Then he looked at me slowly and Hen had to grin
He said, man you out early, we thought you got ten
Opened his safe kicked me down with cold cash
Knew I would get busy, he didn't waste time to ask

[Hook]

I bought a Benz with the money the rest went to clothes
Went to the strip started pimping the hoes
My hair had grew long on my seven year stay
And when I got it done on my shoulders it lay
Hard from the joint but fly to my heart
I didn't want trouble but the shit had to start
Out with my crew, some punks got loud
Shot gun blasts echoed through the crowd
Six punks hit, two punks died
All causalities was applied to their side
Human lives has to pass just for talking much trash
We didn't know who they were, no one had the time to ask

[Hook]

Swat team leader yelled, hit the floor
Reached in my pocket pulled my .44
Dove across the room peeped out the window
Twenty cops jumped behind a Pinto
Out the back door like some damn track stars
Broke down an alley jumped into a car
Suckers didn't even see us, they musta been blind
Black wire touched red the car was mine
We hadn't done nothing but some suckers got shot
Hit the first turn, goddamn road block
Broke through the block and we did it fast
Cops wouldn't shot us on sight, they wouldn't took time to ask

[Hook]

The rollers gave chase at a serious speed, one more conviction was all I need
This shit was for real, it was no La-Di-Da-Di
'Cause the boys had to pin the shit on somebody
And me and my crew, we were known to get ill
We carried heat for protection but not to kill
We bust a corner doing 60, one police car spun
And all I was thinking was, murder one
Bust a move into an alley and did it right
And me and my crew, we're gone into the night
Broke to my old lady's who drew me a bath
She didn't even know what happened, didn't care, didn't ask

[Hook]

We made love like crazy on top of the sheets
This girlie was my worlie, a natural freak
She ran her tongue over each and every part of me
Then she rocked my Amadeus as I watched TV
A technician with a mission that's what she was
If there had been a crowd she would of got an applause
This girl did everything on Earth to me that could be done
The she backed off and teased me so I couldn't cum
Then she cold got stupid pushed me on the floor
Had me begging to stop as I was screaming for more
After she waxed by body she let me crash
She knew her loving was def, she didn't waste time to ask

[Hook]

Up the next morning, feeling good as hell
Sleeping with a girlie sure beats a cell
Hit the boulevard in my A.M.G
Ho's catching whiplash, trying to glimpse the T
Ring on my mobile yes cellular
Got to have a phone when I'm in my car
Was my homeboy Red Some say he's insane
Broke his bitch jaw for smoking 'caine
Told me to meet him at the airport
Said he's jumping bail said he just left court
Caught the first thing smoking in a serious dash
Didn't know where we were going, didn't care, didn't ask

[Hook]

Fell asleep on the plane and so did he, woke up chilling in N.Y.C
Called up my posse when I got there, hit the Latin Quarter and Union Square
Rooftop devil's nest the rest we passed, back doored the Palladium just for class
About 4 a.m. we crashed the deuce, we never catch static cause my boys got juice
Deuced it to the Bronx to rest our heads
Where a shoot-out jumped off mine people lay dead
It sounded like it happened with a Mac-10 blast
But it was 6 in the morning, we didn't wake up to ask

Buying bootleg liquor, champagne and wine

I didn't have a friend, and no place to go
So if I ever get my hand on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till them eagle's green

Nobody knows you when you down and out
In my pocket not one penny
And my friends I haven't any
But If I ever get on my feet again
Then I'll meet my long lost friend

Nobody knows you when you down and out
I mean when you down and out

Mmmmmmmm, when you're down and out
Mmmmmmmm, not one penny

Ich trinke Ristretto und ich häng nur mit den besten Chabs
Wir soll’n euch respektieren, duch uns fuckten eure Fressen ab
Es fing an mit 13, mi’m Curse Gig auf dem Hessentag
Erster Zug am Jibbit und ich wusst, dass ich besessen war
Ich fand es nicht cool, andre Leute draußen abzurippen
Liefen durch die City, stopften ständig diese ekelhaften Plastikkippen
Holten uns Marker, kifften und begannen Parts zu spitten
Mit dem Ziel vor Augen, deutschem Hiphop in den Arsch zu ficken
Immer auf der Suche nach ’nem Turn
Dem Mut was zu versuchen und der Wut was zu zerstör’n
Weiß noch die Zeit, als wir in Finthen waren auf Überkick
Die besten Tage, traurig, dass es irgendwann vorüber ist
(vorüber ist, vorüber ist, vorüber ist)

Bist du unten mit den Straßenfights?
Bist du unten mit den harten Rhymes?
Bist du unten wo das Natz in deiner Nase beißt?
Bist du unten wo man Jägermeister trinkt?
Und wo du selber deine Lebenszeit bestimmst?
Über den Tellerrand - bist du unten mit den harten Rhymes?
Unten, wo du auf das Recht und auf die Strafen scheißt?
Bist du unten wo man Jägermeister trinkt?
Und wo du selber deine Lebenszeit bestimmst?

Feels like I'm in yo pussay........when your suckin my dick........
Gimme Head Hoe [repeats all through chorus]

[First verse (E-40)]
Smack it up flip it, rub it down
Feel so good when you go down town
I like it when you moan and groan and make that sound
I love to see your face when you do that frown
Don't hold back just do yo job
Lick it up and down like corn on the cob
Slob on my knob while yo pussy throb
Gimme head till I'm deader than a fuckin Doorknob
Theraputic and healin, couldn't fight the feelin
She pulled my dick back like a banana pealin'
Her throat game platinum worth a million
Put her on a track we can make a killin'
She can wrap her whole mouth around a fireman pole
Suck a tennis ball through a garden hose
Low cut jeans like to show that flesh
Pierced toungue ring big lips and breasts
Extasy, Hennesy
Broccoli, the remedy
Late night creepin at the Embassy
I'm hard like I'm out the penetentary
Baby got back like a slab of ribs
Dang near wanna make her have my kids
Take her home let her meet my mom and dad
Then introduce her to all my niggs
Front back, side to side
Gettin good head while I'm in my ride
Dip to the crib then we do it again
Have a deepthroat contest you and your friends
Like the 4th of July I'm tryin to reach my peak
Pull it out your mouth now its time to skeet
Shoot it everywhere while I'm beatin my meat
In your face in your hair all over the sheets

[Chorus x2]

[2nd Verse (Al Kapone)]
Up and down, in and out, 
Let me fuck you in yo mouth
Slow, dome head, that's the type of shit I'm talkin bout'
Gimme dat, Gimme dat, I'm so glad you into that
If chewin's, what your doin, then you best believe I'm comin back
Black, White, Asian, and Latino don't discriminate
Take it out, take it to the face, then ejaculate
Freaky bitch, nasty bitch my nigg I swear she love this shit
Don't trip pimpin she gon' swallow it if you bust in it
Look into her eyes, she gon' cum, in the process
Have her panties soakin' wet, try to make her choke on it
Deep-throat action hard, dick is what I'm packin'
When she coughin, when she gaggin' she get pimp satisfaction....
Got a nigga weak, in the knees uh
Speakin in another toungue, thank you mama cita
That's the way you freak her, Papita in her beak uh

And graduated to a Cadillac
But all that money don't mean a got damn thing to me
Cause we don't worship that
But like the Wright brothers, you gotta crash and burn
Before you take flight, I know ya heard that

February 28th, the day my daddy died
Well, not really, his energy passed to the other side
And ever since that day I've seen him fade away with my own eyes
I never doubted God, the Marine corps they say semper fi
My daddy fought in Vietnam
This is a fun fact for the bloodline of Antwan Andre
Just like this song say
I've suffered tremendous damage, got me tougher than a motherfucker
And since the days of Player's Ball
Y'all thought it was about all these broads and slamming Cadillac doors
Now your American idol is just a fraud
You kiss a man he's still gonna be a frog (ribbit)
A bitter old negro not at all
See, I look 26 and still hit your broad
Still pitch a ball, hike, pass, shoot, kick and all
Practice make perfect and first it was Bamboo now it's Cross

Drop a wicked bomb on my naughty nature 
I'm livin foul like a Nickerbocker (you livin foul?)
Bitch I'm not the woman to sleep but I'm lost (yo that's deep) 
Cause I be on some ole' I'm tired of niggaz 
tryin to come up off bitches type thing (""What can I do?"")
And if I don't react the way he want he might swing

I got you motherfuckers scared, in the midst of a dead heat
Back the fuck up, or get played like Monopoly
Bo$$ was the shit from the getty-up, yeah huh
The Dee was the shit, the minute my father straight bust his nut
He created a mad bitch, and now it's for the nigga to pitch a bitch
Cause I was known to be that misfit
Or the black sheep, of the family
Sent to reform school, since my parents couldn't handle me
I did nothin but.. dirt
While all of my homies played worse
I was hittin niggaz, where it hurts
In the back of they dome, I had a nickel-plated chrome aimin
I didn't have no home trainin
But back to the drawing board
Back in ninety-three, when I was released out the mental ward
For playin games with helter skelter
That's how his ass got, done - he caught a bad one
[Chorus]

The only shit I ever had a lot of in my life was some bank moves
I needed loot so I said fuck it, and started pullin gank moves
I ain't the type you want to trust or turn your back towards
So never slip you stupid bitch (or I'm gettin yours)
Schemin with my chrome, boy
The Bo$$ got an AK, aimin like a temp at your dome boy
So fuck a homeboy, we was never down fool
{We blazed blunts!} But that don't mean we fuckin cool
See I was taught at an early age it pays to get a gauge
In the streets, they try to play a nigga weak
I'm buckin 'em down with two shots
And fuck your road dawgs, got enough bullets for the whole block
And now the city bitch is pretty pissed, rollin in my Lincoln
Leavin blood scattered when I'm creepin (when I'm creepin)
Now everybody's scared - I fill 'em full of lead
Bullet wounds to head once I buck 'em dead
[Chorus]
[Dee]
Two to the head, that's exactly what you get
Whenever you fuckin with a lunatic
I'm out to be gettin deep down in your shit
See my sisters are easily tempered
Therefore I don't be givin a fuck
Anything that moves I'm buckin 'em down
[Bo$$]
You better duck duck down from the bullet
Real G's fingers on the trigger, and still afraid to pull it
Look around, bitches on a underground level
Listen to my cut as the buckshot settle
[Dee]
And the blow to the dome buck buck was the sound of my nine
Ringin out, then I draw them in the slaughterhouse
To get slaughtered, blow 'em out the water
Real quick in a hurry, cause niggaz be actin scurry
[Bo$$]
In my hood, wish you would, pull some punk shit
Bitches up to no good, niggaz better duck quick
Run up if they come, gettin paid by the gun

I was G'd up
From the feed up
Pushin the bent
With the midnight tint
Huh, heaven sent

[Mista Grimm]
I once met a girl in the valley and
Half black half Italian
Ass like a stalian
Coke bottles shake
As she likes to watch herself on tape
Breakin nuts shake, but wait there's more
She keeps my nuts in her mouth like a squirrel
Pranksta with a pearl
Held my balls so long
I call trouble when I'm with my girl

[Warren G]
There's a law for that
We ain't trippin, we hogs for that
Uh

[Chorus: Warren G and LaToiya - repeat 4X]
It ain't nuttin wrong with you
Me and you
(we do it nasty, nasty)

[Damone]
I met this Puerto Rican named Sehonnie
She was as bad as Carmen
Chillin in New York and I cracked her in Spanish Harlem
Straight dime
Body bangin like a baseline
And the face fine
I had to spit dip waste time
Mr. Passionate
Everything her body was immaculin
The presence like a gift to men and got packaged

[Boss Hogg]
Fuckin fabolous
She say ""damn he fat""
Then I still fuck the ass (how you do that)
Push up on 'em till they fall to the plot, damn it
Uh, hog 'em while they fuckin roll, goddamn it
Call me fat boy with a fat dick to mash
To lick me baby and I might lick you back

[Damone]
Lickin you back
She's gaggin with a dick in her trap
And stickin is fat
I'll pull it out and tickle your cat

[previous Chorus]
[Warren G]
I put the smash on her like Shaq
She want the cash on her
I ain't havin that
You need to check yo' trap
I got rose cap
G'd up, 213, please believe that

[Mista Grimm]
I stay pimpin in a bubble I Benz
With hoes stubbled up and cuddled in the back with my friends
I slide up on 'em like a cross fader
The hook up later
And serve this dick like a waitor
I ain't tryna date her

[Damone]
When it comes to bitches
I got more game than the olympics
I get up in their mind and analyze and twist this, psychology
For no reason I'm recievin apologies
Break her down mentally
Have her stockin and follow me

[Boss Hogg]
Trick be swallowin me
For a nine on the vein
'cause I'm the fuckin boss, she's my employee
I ain't hatin, I appreciate you freaky ass style
Yo nasty ass ?, eat a dick and smile

Do anything for her, as long as she ask me chick
Like flashy shit, DG Prada and Gucci clothes
And Victoria Secret silk panties, covers and ooh she knows
She never hang with movie hoes, dig dealers and X popping
She's not a bopper, that say she hop out of Lex droppers
She my sex doctor, good love she go hard in bed
Go down below my waist with her lips, and harden my head
I call her the warden in bed, she keep me on lock

Could be the house wife or the Boss type, it's crazy

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Boss Hogg Outlawz,"Yeah, huh..
[Kyleon]
Sometimes I ask myself, what is life like
What would I be without this rap, without a mic life
Or will I die young, like my partna Mike like
Won't get to see my girl grow, and see what a wife's like
But my life's alright, no I ain't finished yet
I just got started, I ain't ready to end it yet
I'm 24 years old, I ain't even beginned it yet
I just started having money, I ain't got a chance to spend it yet
I want to be a millionaire, but I'm losing my life line
My ticket out this ghetto, is for me to write rhymes
I know I can get this money, if I write rhymes
Opportunity knocked for me, at the right time
Cause I was losing hope, getting sick of this bullshit
Losing my faith, not listening to preachers and bull pits
God pulled my card quick, nope no more pain mayn
Sunshine for now, no more rain mayn

[Slim Thug]
I grew up around a bunch of gang bangers, and caine slangers
Stayed in danger, cause I played with strangers
Was born and raised by gangstas, taught by the hood
Proud of my block, everyday fought for the hood
Stand up kid, ain't too many did what I did
Saw half the shit I saw, or lived like I lived
When my mama went to work, my brother went to work
In the kitchen, pyrex shifting till it hurt
I watched him grind, fascinated by the cash
Patiently waiting, for my time to mash
Never tagged along, see I had my own gang
We had our own ideas, on how to get this change
We did our own thang, small time hustling
Some young niggaz, never asking for nothing
It ain't take us long, to peep what's going on
The broke niggaz was weak, while the rich was strong we got it on

By all means I had to get it, I'm a hustler black
This rap thing what I dreamed, don't want to fuck with crack
But damn, being broke I can't fuck with that
And being po' ain't what I hoped, so I hustled stack
Have nuts have money, that's the code in these streets
And when my money got low, I was holding the heat
I'm just a young nigga living, trying to sip and ball
And even though these streets wet, I can't slip and fall
I ran with killas pull triggas, up out they stacks fo'
And if they broke, they hitting your back do' with the Mackno
Fuck worrying bout haters, cause that'll freeze em up
That's what the heat is for, guaranteed to heat em up
These streets bad and yeah lil' daddy, from has-fect
A young nigga could lose his life, over a glass set
It'll take a cell in a jail, for us to do some mad thinking
That's how it is that's how it go, I know it's sad ain't it

[Chris Ward]
You gotta know, that you can't take your life for granted
Cause it's a loaded game, out here on this lifeless planet
Smoke till my eyes get slanted, just to focus better
Thinking over pass times, when I wrote this letter
I just hope it gets better, for the future's sake
Trying not to make the mistakes, that I use to make
Been out in the streets, since the age of 17
And witnessed all type of bullshit, most have never seen
Damn near homeless, I slept on flo's slept in cars
Been through all kind of battles, nigga just check my scars
My backgrounds my resume, and my repitwa
That's why I walk the way I talk nigga, and wreck this hard
Please God, no more rainy days just sunshine
Cause me and my homies tired, of ducking one times
If I could I promise, I will put this gun down
But how can I, when I'm a soldier on the frontline",It's So,2004
Boss Hogg Outlawz,"Close your lips and open your ears, for a change
You just might, learn some thangs
I don't understand your plan, let me get this right
You broke, but you grinding all day and night

You on the block pushing caine, with Jordan's and a chain
I know, everybody want to have nice things
But man, you must think the dope game is a game
Fuck around and have yourself, catching a chain

Better stash you some cash, for a rainy day man
Cause only God knows, what tomorrow bring
Better listen, I'm trying to stop a lot of sorrow and pain
'Cause falling on your ass, is a horrible thing

It don't take a rocket scientist, to get that bro
You can get that fast, get that slow
Hit licks with that grass, with that blow

Or with that pads, spit that flow
Or gamble with it, try to get back mo'
Uh-uh not me, I refuse to lose
You either got it or you don't, and I refuse to choose

And candy blue's I cruise, cause if I snooze I lose
And if I get out there bad, I just use my tools
My mind and muscle, that helps me grind and hustle
If it wasn't for this rap, I'd try to find a hustle

Why niggers sitting on they behind, steady trying to hustle
24/7-3/65, my time to hustle
I'd be a dealer out here, I got dimes and shuffles

You need to quit talking so much, for a minute and hush
Stop trying to throw down boy, why you in such a rush
You play the game, as if you got a royal flush
But if you don't cool off, you just might get touched

I grind against the grain, and your brain like a crush
'Cause for me to get mine, is a plus and a must
But listen, hustling ain't for everybody
Especially if you ain't got the heart, and you's a scary body

Oh but I know, you don't hear me boy
It's goin' take something bad to happen, for you to feel me boy
But I'm so sick and tired, of teaching and preaching
You ain't even meet me half way, it's like I'm the only one that's reaching

Pumped up, wrecked and crashed

You oughtta listen, 'fore you wind up on your ass

On how, I got this cash
I sold zones bled mics, moved rocks and hash
I click pro long, had to get on these blocks and mash
You want your do' long, try to hit these blocks and mash

Be careful though, you got niggers that watch your stash
And the second you slip get off his hip, goin' pop your ass
Get a connect cop a Tech, take your prize in the dash
We balling now, hit the lot put your ride on glass

You hard headed not heated, when you ride on glass
Left it at home, but you need it when you ride on glass
Knocked off your feet you looking weak, your boys slide on past
Had a high class bitch, now you collide with trash

Now you the hood rat plumber, pushing hood rat lil' mama
Laid up with the slut, and caught the high five from her

Watchin' the OG's in the hood while they flossin' in they rides
Candy paint, chrome wheels, and black magic on the attire
Me, yeah I was lovin' it, but not old enough drive
Parkin' lot pimpin' from the passenger side
I use to walk everywhere I had to show up
Shoe hills, one down like wheel rubber, man I was about to go nuts
Hopefully I would blow up in these rap game man
My people roll swanga's, I wanted to be rollin' the same thang
Never had alot of work, but I was doin' what I could
Movin' nickles, dimes, twenty's, and ounces all threw my hood
Since I had a one yolla fines cash me up
Mean while thumpin' for a ride my homies pass me up
It's all gravy, when I'm able I'm a showin' all somthin'
From a hopte to a foreign, I'm ballin' it's all or nothin'
Treat my feet with' designer to fine sneak's when I leave my home
Only place you catch me walkin' is to my mail box's
Cause on the streets I be on crome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rollin' chrome

Huh, I started off with' a canary yellow cutlass supreme on bald tire's
Yeah I know I was out of line
But that was all I could find
Or should I say that was all I could purchase for what I had to spend
But at least I had somthin' to go from point A to B and
No more offerin' gas money to get a lift
Besides when your driven it's easyer to get a chick
So ani't no more parkin' lot pimpin' at the club I'm up in there
Seekin' little mama, with' thick thighs, I hope she let me in there
Like swim wear, pull up to the motel, and we'll go in there
Nothin' left to do but comit a sin there
And that was in my hopte, but when I show up in my big body with' the gloss
All of the boppers was boppin' I just could'nt shake'm off
Sixteen switches, tewnty-two inches, trunk goin' to war
They don't want to lay here with me, they want to lay in my car
I was lovin' it back then and still love it today
Except I'm not yellow cutlase no more, I'm 300 blue over gray, on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rolin chrome

Finally I'm in the mix, ridin' twenty four's or twenty six
My neck and my wrist lite, with' out me sellin' a brick
Tv's in the roof and the dashboard and I'm watchin' a flick
Rollin' with my pistol in my lap and I'm cockin' if
I spy somethin' suspicious in my rear view mirror when I'm creepin'
If you plan on jackin' me I plan on leavin' you sleepin'
I be in different vehicle cause I'm havin' thangs
King of the ghetto entertainment got me havin' change
You can smell it on me, even tho quite, the way I live it be tellin' on me
Don't get twisted I'm still a felon homie
Thinkin' you goin' to rob me that's a N O
And when I'm in N O I roll with god and as always Mr.Marsello
And they be with me when they in Texas don't par take it as a spy
Harlum nights in stores where they drop it like it's hot
So if your tryin' to call me and I don't answer my phone
I can't hear it cause my music to loud I'm bangin' on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)

Boss-1,"Ça fait déjà, et puis je sais même plus 
Que j'aurais pu tout laisser tomber 
L'école m'a laissé assis sur un banc à la cité 
Élève trop agité, qui n'en faisait qu'à sa tête 
Je préférais les manifs au lieu d'aller à la bibliothèque 
Eh mec, les devoirs, je les faisais tard le soir 
Et le matin pour me réveiller, c'était tout une histoire 
J'ai jamais eu une bonne entente avec l'éducation nationale 
Le règlement intérieur et la façon dont ils travaillent 
Dans des classes surchargées, 
Toujours les mêmes qui vont au piquet 
Arrivé en fin d'année, pour passer t'as pas ton ticket 
La conseillère, veut de toi se débarrasser 
T'orienter dans un truc auquel tu n'as même pas pensé 
Et en rang jamais rangé, combien de matières j'ai dû sécher 
Entre mes premiers rancarts et mon goût pour le danger 
J'aimais aussi l'E.P.S, pour mâter les seins des gonzes 
Question bizness, toujours un kilo de pièce 
J'ai terminé mes classes dans la rue où là j'étais le bienvenu 
Mais ici les heures de retenus, c'est 24 heures en garde à vue 
Les études y en a ras le cul, le BAC je l'ai pas eu 
Je sais qu'au fond pour ma famille 
Pour ça, je les aies toujours déçus 
Aujourd'hui comme tu le vois 
C'est la musique que je prends à cœur 
Pour faire passer le message, remémorer mes erreurs 
Éviter les ennuis, même si j'aime traîner la nuit 
J'ai eu raison de l'école tant que l'école ne m'a pas nuit 

Les années passent, les regrets restent 
On cri en soi pleins de pourquoi? A quoi bon? 
Seule réponse, je sais pas 
Une chose est sûre, en cours j'ai jamais été bosseur 
Juste un acteur de plus, au fond un emmerdeur

Ce que je sais en connaissance de gosse
C'est clair on devrait te timbrer
Je voulais dire que môme, m'aurais vu conseiller à l’Élysée
On m'a poussé vers ce foutu CAP de menuisier
Pour eux, mon avenir se trouvait au Baumet ou à la Santé
A grand coups de ballet, mes rêves se brisaient
Que dire à ces mômes, les yeux pleins de sympathie
Qui m'envient d'abord qui je suis
Une chose est sûre c'est que j'ai jamais voulu lâcher l'affaire
Ils m'ont mis la pression,
Pressés de me voir gicler les cours de Mr CENSON 
Mordu à l'hameçon, pour être le couillon parmi les cons 
Les insultes pleuvaient vers ce t'enculer de profs de MATHS 
Il fallait jamais me prier pour foutre l'ahyate 
Avec les années tous se gatte, merde 
On se jette tous dans le même bizness effémère

Je suis dans le rap depuis longtemps pourtant je n'ai pas carrière 
Entre l'école, la rue et moi même j'ai mis une barrière

Combien de fois j'ai dû décevoir mon père et ma mère 
Je suis un jeune j'ai la vingtaine 
La cité m'a mis en quarantaine 
D'origine Africaine, je crois que j'ai pris une lourde peine

Devenus à notre époque braqueur ou buveur d'alcool 
Ou forceur d’antivol, à l'école c'était bénévole 
Recruté par la rue, à moi les grâces matinées 
Première matière, locas pipe pour pouvoir dîner 
On fait des matons content de l'oseille 
Et l'anatomie du poste, et l'éducation physique dans la rue 
A nous faire des bosses 
Devenir génie en herbe? Non! 
Mais fumer des gros joins d'herbe? Ouais! 
Avec les potes dans les chiottes de lycée 
Et faire la feinte aux profs

Et puis c'est, avec la tête baissée et les yeux plissés 
Qu'on revenait au fond de la classe pour oublier 
Attendant impatiemment la sonnerie pour pouvoirs se barrer 
Avec sa déguène de Barial le petit tape du crime 
Victime du système à la sortie sans des livres

E o sol
Beija o barco e luz
Dias tão azuis

Volta do mar, desmaia o sol
E o barquinho a deslizar
E a vontade de cantar

Céu tão azul, ilhas do sul
E o barquinho, coração
Deslizando na canção

Tudo isso é paz
Tudo isso traz
Uma calma de verão
E então
O barquinho vai
E a tardinha cai

Zickzack oder Kreis
Das Leben gibt mir Toast
Ohne Hawaii
Ich, Großbaustelle
Will nur Zen-Garten
Sch-sch-schotter lässt mich stottern
Auf den schiefen Bahnen
Ich sehne mich nach Noten und den Sätzen von Sonaten

Mein ganzes Leben lang lief
Eine krumme Symphonie

Immer noch nasses Haar da
Dann keine Zahnpasta da
Ohne Fahrkarte Bahn

Was ist immer mit meinem Leben los
Fuck!
Heißt es Oregano oder Oregano

Wer leiht mir einen roten Faden
Ich suche die Koordinaten
Und sehe nur Barrikaden
Alles hinkt, nichts grooved
Doch ich tanze
Alles leiert, alles hängt
Ja, ich tanze
Alles wackelt, Band pennt

Tryin' to find an explanation
'Cause it's gettin' aggravating
Why my relationships never seem to work out
Beginnin' to worry and doubt

If I'm even able to detect he's the one
When this day you're wonderin'
Why I haven't seen the sun
Shine his light on my heart and help me ease the pain
'Cause I'm gettin' tired of the rain

Get my hopes up when I'm in love
Until we break up then I'm back to the
Same spot, I've been lonely, drownin'
'Cause every guy turns out to be the same
So now I'm questionin' is it me to blame

Is it me? Am I so complicated?
Is it me? Or is love over-rated?
Is it me? 'Cause I don't quite understand
Why it never turns out how I thought I planned it

Is it me? Am I too independent?
Is it me? Not ready for commitment?
Is it me? 'Cause it doesn't seem to last
And it's the only question that I never asked

Maybe I'm longin' for it more than I should be expecting
All the standards that I'm settin', unrealistically I'm gettin'
Possibly in the way of what is left to have in store
Because I'm so confused and insecure

I permitted to prolong, tried my best to hold on
My Mister Right's probably hangin' round my window pane

Common factor and played a big part
In lettin' people break my heart

Never noticin' I was wasting time
Askin' the same thing every time
Who were you with? And where were you at?

I've been searching for someone to give me love
When I thought that all the hope was gone
A smile and there you were and I was gone
I always will remember how I felt that day
A feeling indescribable to me, yeah
I always knew there was an answer for my prayer
And you, your the one, the one for me

Your one in a million
Your once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us
Your one in a million
Your once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us

In the beginning I was cool and everything was possible
They tried to catch me but it was impossible
No one could hurt me it was my game
Until I met you baby and it wasn't the same
When you didn't want me, I wanted you
Because the funny thing about it is I like the show
I like it when it's difficult I like it when it's hard
Then you know it's worth it that you find your heart
(Whoa)

Your one in a million
Your once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us
Your one in a million
