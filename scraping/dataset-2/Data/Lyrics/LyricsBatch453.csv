Anja Garbarek,"In the end there was no one to see
No helicopters in the sky the next day
Or the day after no one was searching
'Cause no one knew he was missing

He followed me home
Can I keep him?
He followed me

A pretty boy like you
With hands that could break me in two but don't
Breaking away gently
Come on, let's go

He's still warm
And close to me
I can see tears in his eyes
And I feel better

He followed me home
Can I keep him?
He followed me

In the end there was no one to see
No helicopters in the sky the next day
Or the day after no one was searching
'Cause no one knew he was missing

",Can I Keep Him?,2006
Anja Garbarek,"There were buildings here long ago 
But now the blade of grass cuts my feet 
I proceed with caution and lay low 
Just visible through the trees 

Breathing carefully I crawl up 
Onto the surface of tension 
I glimpse the rocks from below 
What I see will never be mentioned 

Dizzy with wonder 
I shake my head to clear the view 
With a hunger to know 
I come to this place to be close to you 

Lit from inside 
I go to the switch 
I rise quickly from the dark 
Through white clouds that I tear apart 
Releasing drops of water 
All over 

Dizzy with wonder 
I shake my head to clear the view 
With a hunger to know 
I come to this place to be close to you 

Dizzy with wonder 
I shake my head to clear the view 
With a hunger to know 
I come to this place to be close to you 

Dizzy with wonder 
I shake my head to clear the view 
With a hunger to know 
I come to this place to be close to you 

Dizzy with wonder 
I shake my head to clear the view 
With a hunger to know 
I come to this place to be close to you",Dizzy with Wonder,2006
Anja Garbarek,"From standing to crouching 
Silently falling 
Falling from nowhere to nowhere 
Nothing between 
Nothing beyond 
Nothing behind the stars 

This is the last trick I'll do 
Sound can be seen 
This is the main title 
Briefly shaking 

This is the last trick I'll do 
Sound can be seen 
This is the main title 
Briefly shaking 

Remain for some time 
Down here below 
Allowing the doubt to feed upon me 
And even the ones 
Who've never been 
Are climbing the wail up ahead 

I get up start crawling 
Into the same 
Over and over and over again 
Smelling the plastic 
Smelling the spit 
And smelling my own breath 

This is the last trick I'll do 
Sound can be seen 
This is the main title 
Briefly shaking 

This is the last trick I'll do 
Sound can be seen 
This is the main title 
Briefly shaking 

The presence convincing 
The most of what I've written is false 
I mention this 
'Cause I'm talking in the light of what's known 
I get out of the sun 

This is the last trick I'll do 
Sound can be seen 
This is the main title 
Briefly shaking 

This is the last trick I'll do 
Sound can be seen 
This is the main title 
Briefly shaking 

This is the last trick I'll do

Anja Garbarek,"Pleasantly removed 
Into lush darkness 
Into the dreamless place 
I begin to sing this song 

Staying loud enough 
To drown out any noise 
In presence of strangers 
I begin to sing this song 

It appears to be done 
For the pleasure of the doing 
But I'm no better shape 
Than my fellow riders 

Every now and then 
I'm slipping back again 
Empty and mortal 
I begin to sing this song 

My mind is moving fast 
Trying to make connections 
Taking short-cuts 
Noting events 

Listing all 
Filing away 
Along with opinions 
Making connections 
Taking short-cuts 
Noting events 

Listing all 
Filing away 
Along with opinions 
Making connections 
Taking short-cuts 
Noting events...

Anja Garbarek,"The street's reaching up to the open window 
Too much information leaks in 
And shoots up my spine 
Lifting my head off the pillow 
And the dust rises 
When I set my feet on the floor 

I breathe in and out while I try to focus 
When I feel ok I twist my mouth 
To save what little air is left 

'Cause it's a question of constructing 
An imitation of conditions 
It's a question of constructing 
An imitation of conditions 
To survive, to survive, to survive 
This situation, situation, situation 
To survive, to survive, to survive 
This situation, situation, situation 

I keep far away but I'm missing nothing 
My eyes are an endless panorama of blue 
There's nothing here to block my view 
And with a sideways glance 
I am shown as much as I want to see 

'Cause it's a question of constructing 
An imitation of conditions 
It's a question of constructing 
An imitation of conditions 

In full motion 
No variation 
This need for speed 
The notion of convulsion 
This seed of greed 
Shock activities 
Lack of memories 
Don't wanna be 
Cannot see 
Anything wrong with the picture 

'Cause it's a question of constructing 
An imitation of conditions

Anja Garbarek,"And it is so strange 
With these eyes out into darkness 
And it is so strange 
All they want to do is sleep 
And it is so strange 
They want to sleep through silence 
And it is so strange 
'Cause I am wide awake 

And it is so strange 
How all this could be over 
If you would walk in 
If you put me to rest 
And it is so strange 
That my voice seems to've gone quiet 
And even stranger still 
That I never will be found

Is to drift away

All I want to do is go to sleep 
To sleep, to sleep",Sleep,2006
Anja Garbarek,"Hums of conversation 
Lip goes 
One leg crossed 
Driven back into this corner 

Is it the same when I leave 
As when I come 
On a higher or lower frequency 
It means nothing to me 

Watch me turn the volume down 
It's always cold before the last day 
Still guarding space 
Snow piled up by the road to my house 

The one time I tried 
It was a fine view 
Through and across 
Then there was restlessness 
And in that movement 
I dressed in the light from outside",Still Guarding Space,2006
Anja Garbarek,"On this momentous day 
Curious seduction 
The most striking thing 
Changes colour and its shape 
Hissing words of no safety any more 

On this momentous day 
Already in position 
So delicate so clean 
I forget to leave 
And my name has long, long gone 

Hey James, if you wish the race is on 
Hey James, if you please the chase is on 
I'm ready, ready, ready to recall 
I'm ready, ready, ready to recall the visual 

On this momentous day 
The story's in the background 
No need to tell 
I've got shadows crossing my face 
As I run my hands along 

On this momentous day 
Seems to've cracked wide open 
Leaving nothing left to dream 
I hear myself scream 
Is this land or more sky 

Did you notice that we moved 
Moved fast 
Along this thin strip 
Flashing 
Do you think we were followed here 
Follow me 
'Cause there'll be no flight there'll be a killing 

Hey James, if you wish the race is on 
Hey James, if you please the chase is on

Anja Garbarek,"Only for a second do they freeze 
It's too easy to do it up here 
Just a gentle push 
And you'd be over the edge 
So they let you slip in and out of sight 

There is no moon 
There is no breeze 
And this won't turn out 
The way you please 

This place has been crossed many times 
Never was there cause for worry 
But there's creatures living here now 
Who pray on anything that moves 

There is no moon 
There is no breeze 
And this won't turn out 
The way you please 

Stop and strain your ears 
It's scarcely more than a whisper 
Still the word is out 

You shoot to attention 
Recognition is immediate 
Answering is an instinctive reaction

There is no breeze

You know you're dead",Word Is Out,2006

Anja Nissen,"(Laying down my armour, laying down my gun)

You’re lost in my game but your love is repeating
Always around, you’re never holding me down
I know who you are, true colours are showing
Though my heart’s bare, always show you care

Putting up my walls so I last better
Don’t know why I do it because we’re together
Always holding back from you

Tonight I’m gonna try for you real harder
Show you all the love I’ve held inside
Show you all the love I’ve held inside
Let’s do it right

Tonight I’m gonna show you, show you what you’ve done
I’m laying down my armour, laying down my gun
Tonight I’m gonna hold you closer than before
So you know where I am, so you know where I am

I’ve known it’s not right, just couldn’t reveal it
Always closing up tight and never releasing
Afraid and I fear to love, but you never let me go
I’ve held it in my heart and now i’m letting you go

Tonight I’m gonna show you, show you what you’ve done
I’m laying down my armour, laying down my gun
Tonight I’m gonna hold you closer than before

Anjali,"Arabian queen right on the scene
Riding along in her cinematic dream
I am the queen of this harem
I got my veil on and I'm feeling serene

Arabian highs, bear the sundown sigh
Let's gather round the hookah
Blowing circles to the sky
Arabian dreams everybody seems ...
And she says ...

Hold on her heels taht swinging girl of sin
With her jewel-encrusted gown
And her belly swinging brown
Sold all her sins and everybody sway

Through the hazy days

With rubies on her toes everybody knows
She's the queen of the sand
The desert and the land
A breeze like mango kulli
A little hoochie koochie
And she says ...

Cocooned in silken shrouds
And jasmine scented clouds
She's the queen of the harem
You know who wears the crown
She teases and she sleazes
You know it never ceases
When she does her voodoo

This dedicated to everybody
That's lost somebody important in they life
Don't worry, they in a better place now

I fear not what the future holds
But more what the future unfolds
'Cause I'm dying each time
That I breathe in life without you, yeah

Every hour is solemn, I need you
I'm devoured, I'm fallen, now what can I do?
There's so much to give
If only I had my hands to fix what you did

So I hold it inside, watch as it dies
I can't even look at the sky, it's burning my eyes
Similar to cigarette smoke, I wish I could float
Far away from here

Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops, no, no
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops
Washing me away, washing me away
Washing me away, washing me away

I'm still dealing with the death of my father
Still dealing with the death of my best friend
Eddie, I'ma miss you, dog
But you know I'ma ride to the end, I love you

I ain't cry when you died
But I'ma let my tears fall on the track
My brother Uly just came home
And it feels good to have him back, welcome home, dog

See, everything happens for a reason
You don't know what you had 'til it's gone
That's why I'ma take advantage of the fact
I'm breathing and the words of this song

Are dedicated to Eddie and Barilla
But I know in the future, I'ma see ya
I know you both looking down on me proudly
I know y'all both love me

Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops, no, no
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops
Washing me away, washing me away
Washing me away, washing me away

See, in life, things go wrong
If it don't kill you, it's only gonna make you strong
So you must hold on
If everything was right, then there's something wrong

Ironic, ain't it?
That's just the way life is
That's why I thank God any chance that I get
For blessing me with beautiful kids

What's victory with no loss?
What's smiling with no tears?
What's love with no hate?
What's courage with no fear?

Just think about it and apply it to your life
And no matter what the problem is
Don't worry, baby, keep your head up
It's gon' be alright

Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops, no, no
Raindrops, I hope one day that this pain stops
Washing me away, washing me away
Washing me away, washing me away
Washing me away, washing me away

Eddie, I know you up there whiling right now
Probably in some angel's ear letting them know
How Cuban you are, probably get him drunk
I know you up there having a good time, my father

[Foreign content]
I love y'all, I miss y'all, I'ma see y'all
Don't worry about it though
Just see how Heaven ready for me

Love songs and limousines
Wishing wells and make believe
Disco balls and dancing queens
I fall so easy

Rich guys and candlelight
Telling me the things I like
I'm too young and they're too right for me

I fall so easy for cheesy things in life
Sad, sad movies make me cry
Pretty people I admire, I used to hate

I fall so easy for the stupid little lines
Hollywood and sunny skies
Fancy restaurants with three forks and knives
I fall so easy

Until you came my way
Turn my clouds to white from gray
Showered me with pink champagne
I let go so easier

That girl I used to be
Cynical and heartbreak free
Confidence exude in me now

I fall so easy for cheesy things in life
Sad, sad movies make me cry

Ankerstjerne,"For præcis et år siden,
Sad vi alle sammen samlet om det samme bord,
De samme samtaler startede med de samme ord.
Det er længe siden,
Godt at se dig, har du haft det godt?
Og hvad med karrieren, sig mig er der penge nok?
Vi kan det uden ad, og lytter til de samme toner,
Prøver at undgå at starte alle de samme
Diskussioner. Det' egentlig fjollet vi' skal spille alle
De roller, men sådan er det altid og der
Er noget vi lige skal komme igennem ,
Men det blir' mørkt og lygtepæle tændes over gaden,
Efter et par glas der får vi endelig brudt overfladen.
Ingen vil sige det først, men selvom
Alle kæmper er det svært at ignorere vores flok
Er blevet mindre. Der er tomme stole om bordet,
Stemmer der mangler,
En parfumeret duft der plejer at blande sig
Med de andre, året der er gået satte tydelige spor,
Og det kan ses når vi er samlet om et bord.

Og jeg vil elske dig om 1000 år, 1000 år.
Og intet aner selv om tiden går, tiden den går,
Ja jeg vil elske dig om 1000 år, 1000 år.
Du er væk fra mig, men stadig tæt på mig.

Der er gået et helt år siden du sad her sammen med os,
Svært at tro på, dit navn står jo stadig her
I min telefonbog, som om jeg bare kunne trykke på
Knappen nu og ringe op,dengang jeg havde chancen
Ved jeg godt jeg aldrig ringede nok,
Så jeg tænkte at jeg ku' skrive et brev I nat,
Som kun var dit. Fortælle dig om hvordan det er gået,
Både godt og skidt. Kan starte med at sige,
At dagen du tog afsked var smuk,
Og fuld af blomster og venner omkring dit gravsted,
Og morfar er stærk, vi ser ham knap fælde en
Tåre selvom han på mange måder ha' haft det længste år.
Camilla og min moster de har været ude af den,
Jeg tror det går lidt bedre nu, selvom de er udmattede.
Peter han forlod min mor,
Selvom det er hvad der sker så tacklede han det skidt
Og han bliver nok aldrig velkommen her,
Mette er her stadig, hende og jeg vi passer på min mor
Og igen I nat der er vi alle samlet
Om et bord.

Og jeg vil elske dig om 1000 år, 1000 år.
Og intet aner selv om tiden går, tiden den går,
Ja jeg vil elske dig om 1000 år, 1000 år.
Du er væk fra mig, men stadig tæt på mig.

Sidste gang at var samlet sådan her,
Det var I kirken da vi sagde farvel,
Og nu hvor lysene tændes og dagen går på had,
Byen sætter farten ned og roen sænker sig,
Så er det tydeligt at der er nogle ting der aldrig
Ændrer sig. På nogle måder er det som om der
Ingen tid er gået, kvinder I min familie piver stadig
Aldrig over noget, og selvom verden hviler tungt på
Deres skulderblade, sludrer de om vind og hver,
Bladrer lidt I ugeblade, sætter hinanden
Først og deres liv på standby, og noget siger mig det er
Noget de har lært af dig.
Året der er gået satte tydelige spor,
Men du skal vide vi stadig samles om et bord

Og jeg vil elske dig om 1000 år, 1000 år.
Og intet aner selv om tiden går, tiden den går,
Ja jeg vil elske dig om 1000 år, 1000.
Du er væk fra mig, men stadig tæt på mig.",1000 År,2011

Og nu er her så koldt, at jeg kan se mit eget åndedrag
Finder en kuvert med min adresse og dit efternavn
Min ører ringer stadig fra da døren smækkede med et brag
Og hele verden tav, og varmen den forsvandt

Jeg finder hadet frem, og prøver at lade vreden vinde
Måske det ville' gøre mindre ondt, hvis nu jeg bar' ku' hade hende

Vi ku' ha' siddet her, og holdt i hånd, sagt ting vi ikk havde ment
Har leget et glansbillede, det ved jeg godt du ikk fortjener
Og jeg forstår godt at du går, du var ikke lykkelig længere
Du hører til et andet sted, håber du finder det

With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind 
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye 
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart 
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping
You just say nothing's changed 
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

In the lane, snow is glist'nin',
A beautiful sight, we're happy to night
Walkin' in a winter wonderland!

Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird;
He sings a love song as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland!

In a meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown;
Hell say, â??Are you married?â??
We'll say, â??No man!
But you can do the job when you're in town!â??

As we dream by the fire,
To face unafraid the plans that we made

Only now I can see
How you dreamed and you planned all for me

I put the silver threads down
I don't know anyway 
I could ever repay

Ann Brown,"She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee, her dress has got a tear
She waltzes on her way to mass and whistles on the stairs
And underneath her wimple she has curlers in her hair
I've even heard her singing in the abbey

She's always late for chapel but her penitence is real
She's always late for everything except for every meal
I hate to have to say it but I very firmly feel
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

I'd like to say a word in her behalf then say it Sister Margaretta
Maria makes me laugh

How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
How do you find the word that means Maria?
A flibbertigibbet, a willow the wisp, a clown

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you make her stay and listen to all you say
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?

When I'm with her I'm confused, out of focus and bemused
And I never know exactly where I am
Unpredictable as weather, she's as flighty as a feather
She's a darling, she's a demon, she's a lamb

She'll out pester any pest, drive a hornet from it's nest
She could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl
She is gentle, she is wild, she's a riddle, she's a child
She's a headache, she's an angel, she's a girl

How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
How do you find the word that means Maria?
A flibbertigibbet, a willow the wisp, a clown

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you make her stay and listen to all you say?

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Who keeps me in this tourist town

Come on, Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on some silver
Oh you're a mean old Daddy, but I like you

Maybe I'll go to Amsterdam
Or maybe I'll go to Rome
And rent me a grand piano and put some flowers 'round my room
But let's not talk about fare-thee-wells now
The night is a starry dome.
And they're playin' that scratchy rock and roll
Beneath the Matalla Moon

Come on, Carey, get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
You're a mean old Daddy, but I like you

The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here
But, it's really not my home
Maybe it's been too long a time
Since I was scramblin' down in the street
Now they got me used to that clean white linen
And that fancy French cologne

Oh Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on my finest silver
We'll go to the Mermaid Cafe
Have fun tonight

I relived the roles I've played
The tears I may have squandered
The many pipers I have paid along the roads I wandered

I may have never found my way to you",On My Way to You,2009

Delilah came down on Samson's mind
First he saw a woman of the Philistines
She set down on Samson's knees
Tell me where your strength lies if you please
She spoke so kind, talked so fair
Samson told ""Delilah cut off my hair,
Shave my head, clean as your hand
And my strength will be like a natural man.""

We'll let the light of dawn get around,
We're really living, Jack, we're going on the town.
Stop fellows, what are we saying?
Look over there, the fleet, doesn't she look sweet?
What did we leave it for? What are we doing on shore?
We're simply crazy about the navy, (how's that?)
We love it more than we can say, (how nice!)
We get like a good fresh air, (uh huh) the ocean's everywhere (uh hum)
That's we hate to get leave and go away.
(It's just so touching, hear them say, take your leave and go away)
(Can't even leave the ship when life is play all the live long day)
Just think of what could we be doing today:
We could be swabbing the deck, sweeping the bunks with a broom,
We could be shoveling tons of coal, down in the boiler room.
Bad news, we got the shore leave blues,
(It just so tragic, hear him sob,)
(He would freak on a tricky spot

We got news, we have the shore leave blues,

Follow the fellow, follow the fellow,

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

Ann Murray,"If you ever go across the sea to Ireland 
Then maybe at the closing of your day 
You will sit and watch the moonrise over Claddagh 
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay 
Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream 

The women in the meadows making hay 
And to sit beside a turf fire in the cabin 
And watch the barefoot gossoons at their play 
For the breezes blowing over the seas from Ireland 
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow 
And the women in the uplands digging praties 

Speak a language that the strangers do not know 
For the strangers came and tried to teach their way 
They scorned us just for being what we are 
But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams 
Or light a penny candle from a star 

And if there is going to be a life hereafter 
And somehow I am sure there's going to be 
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven 
In that dear land across the Irish Sea",Galway Bay,1994

Which no colleen may own.

No other can take it,
No one ever will.

That shines in your hair,
And the brow that's all furrowed,
And wrinkled with care.
I kiss the dear fingers,
So toil-worn for me,

Ann Nesby,"When my soul was lost
There was no one around
But you were there for me
When the rain came down
Into every sunny day
A little rain must fall
And without the rain upon us
Would we ever grow
Like so many others
 I was too afraid of change
'Til I put my trust in you
You took away my pain
I allowed my fears 
To take hold of me
Had nowhere to run 'cause
I was too deep
Let the rain fall down on me
Let the rain fall down on me
Let the rain fall down on me
Let the rain fall down on me
Waited for a better day 
That seems so far away
Even though my faith was shaky, 
You showed me the way
I was searching for a way that 
I could make it through
Figured out what I did wrong
I didn't trust in you
I allowed my fears 
To take hold of me
Had nowhere to run 'cause
I was too deep
Let the rain fall down on me
Let the rain fall down on me
Let the rain fall down on me
Let the rain fall down on me
Doesn't really matter how hard 
The rain is gonna fall
'Cause through any weather, 
There's someone I can call
Storm clouds may rise
Strong winds may blow
You said you'd never 
Leave me anywhere I go
I allowed my fears 
To take hold of me
Had nowhere to run 'cause
I was too deep

I wish I didn't have to be here

It's not that bad..
Could always be worse, ya know what i'm saying?
All you gotta do, is stay in school
Anything you want to do you could do ya know what i'm saying baby?
No matter what though, gotta keep your head up to the sky

[Jadakiss]
This goes out to, all the infants
in this cold world that was born addicted
And to all the section eight kids
Just remember these four words y'all, we goin' make it
The government keep on trying to fool us
The system, keep on trying to lose us
And all we can do is keep buying computers
And ? all now 'fore it start going down
We gotta hold our head, keep our pride
Though it hurts when I see people sleep outside
Little babies with no socks on, eating popcorn
We all know what they moms and they pops on
Out go the love when the drugs come
They never got nothing for Christmas, and they ain't Muslim
This is a jewel, a lot of us was them
This is a jewel, a lot of us was them

To my shot down niggas keep your head in the sky
I don't know if it's better to ride, or better to die
And that's why there's red in my eye
Cause people don't know what the ghetto is like
Either you make it out, or the terrible life
I don't want to be a broke bastard
And everybody in the hood got somebody in they fam' with a coke habit
You work for minimum wage
I'ma get in the game, get shot or a bid in the cage
It's a risk I gotta take - and I'ma be the nigga
with the bricks and the stash and the biscuit outta state
And even though I'm blessed with the gift
I gotta move cause the pain and the sickness gotta wait
I go extremely hard - why let up?
And I can breathe long as I keep my head up

Hey yo I come from a place where it's three strikes out
And your life's on the line, so we iced out
Summertime getting money, three dice out
Tanktops, and jean shorts, we Niked out
Headbands, and four wheelers
Jeeps and Coupes and convos, about who know more killers
It's all wrong but it's all right
It's a small world, matter fact it's a small life
We all trip but the way to survive
is hold your head and make sure you fall right
And it's a quite fact, that whatever goes around comes right back
It's just like that
And we tryin to touch major paper
Everybody in the struggle it gets greater later
Never say can't, it's better to try

I felt a strange feeling come over me

You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The moon is new
But love is old

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak

I would be, caught in the undertow

Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.

You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Ann Richards,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

Oh, it's a long long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
And you ain't got time for waiting game

When days dwindle down to a precious few
September November,
And these few golden days I'd share with you
Those golden days I share with you

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2013

And then a kiss, but more than this, I wish you love.
And if you like lemonade to cool you in some lazy glade, 
I wish you health, and more than wealth, I wish you love.
My breaking heart and I agree that you and I could never be,

Most of all, when snowflakes fall, I wish you love.

I'm holding onto time,

I'm holding onto love,

Verse 1:

I'm holding onto time,
and time is holding onto me,
I'm holding onto love,
But our loves not what it used to be,

Pre-Chorus:

We're crying all,
Of the time,
On the shoulders of each other,
Is it Worth it?
And we're lying all
Of the time,
To each other,
And my baby is it worth it?
Is it worth it?

Chorus:

Is it Worth It?
Staying together,
Is it Worth It?
When we don't love each other?
Is it Worth It?
We're just hurting & fighting,
Is it Worth It?
Bringing each other down?
Is it worth It?

Verse 2:

There's nothing left to say,
Except it's time to move on,
I don't want you to turn around,
And see my teardrops fall
To the ground ound ound,

We're crying all of the time,

To the cold flame of the Northern Lights

To see the shy boy inside the man

Did you reach too high and fall?
And there is no rest for the ones God blessed
And He blessed you best of all

Your eyes seem from a different face
They've seen that much that soon
Your cheek's too cold, too pale to shine
Like an old and waning moon

And there is no peace, no true release
No secret place to crawl
And there is no rest for the ones God blessed
And He blessed you best of all

If tears unshed could heal your heart
If words unsaid could sway
Watch you melt into the night

Ann Wilson,"Oh once I had a little dog, his color it was brown
I taught him for to whistle, to sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long, his ears so very wide
Around the world in half a day, upon him I could ride.

Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.

Oh once I had a little frog, he wore a vest of red
He'd lean upon his silver cane, a top hat on his head
He'd speak of far off places, of things to see and do,
Of all the Kings and Queens he'd met while sailing in a shoe.

Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.

Oh once I had a flock of sheep, they grazed upon a feather
I'd keep them in a music box from wind or rainy weather
And every day the sun would shine, they'd fly all through the town
To bring me back some golden rings, candy by the pound.

Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May.

Oh once I had a downey swan, she was so very frail
She sat upon an oyster shell and hatched me out a snail
The snail had changed into a bird, the bird to butterfly
And he who tells a bigger tale would have to tell a lie.

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed""

In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't

Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

We shall surely pass.
When the wind that left us here,
Returns for us at last.
We are but a moment's sunlight,
Fading on the grass.

Love one another right now.

And as funny as it may be

I had two guys every morning
Seeing that I was well fed
And believe you me, one sweetened my tea
While another one buttered my bread

Two guys gave me my money
Two guys made me my clothes
And another sweet thing, bought me a diamond ring
About forty carats I suppose

And all the rest really did their best
Boy, they sure were a lively pack

And all of these angels were mine
But I woke up and ended the dream

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Their old familiar Carols play
And wide and sweet the words repeat
Of peace on earth good will to man

I thought as now this day had come
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rung so long the unbroken song
Of peace on earth good will to man

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong and marks the song
Of peace on earth good will to man

You can sleep in the bed with me, 
At the foot of the bed, with your feet first. 
And, I will twirk you, you the only good smoking, 
Puffing better than purple, girl. 
I hope you fertile, girl.

And you're just in reach,
When you and sleep escape me.

That glowed in the dark.
What made it special
Made it dangerous,
So I bury it
And forget.
But every time it rains,
You're here in my head,
Like the sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen.
And I don't know when,
But just saying it could even make it happen.
On top of the world,

Looking over the edge,
You could see them coming.
You looked too small
In their big, black car,
To be a threat to the men in power.
I hid my yo-yo
In the garden.
I can't hide you
From the government.

I won't forget,

Anna Abreu,"I woke up this morning
To the intro of this song
My iPod on the night stand
Shuffling pop and rock

I had a hit for breakfast
And flipped the TV on
The videos were hideous
But they kick started the day

The day the day the day
I'm ready for the the day the day

Inside my head there's a radio station
I'm overcome with a sense of elation
Inside my head there's a radio station
Salvation on heavy rotation

Pop pop and I don't care
As long as I'm on the air
And music is everywhere

I fired up the engine
Heading for the highway
The stereo was way too loud
But that's what it's all about

I could have taken yoga
But I need more stamina
The beats of the body pump
Make me wanna play

The game the game the game
I'm ready for the the game the game the game

I'm overcome with a sense of elation

As long as I'm on the air
And music is everywhere
Pop pop everywhere

I'm pop and I'm corny I'm on the air
I'm flat and I'm sharp and I'm everywhere
I'm in C I'm in D I'm in every key
I'm singing for you even when you're asleep

Lire, écrire, savoir aimer, écouter, entendre, expliquer, 
connaître l'anglais et même l'espagnol, 
pourquoi pas d'autres langues.

respectueux, sensible, ouvert, juste être un artiste.

plaire, déplaire, 
goûter ou même apprendre l'art du silence 
être et surtout évoluer, travailler mon sens du rythme 
Innover échanger rencontrer,

No friends comin' through I think I lost 'em all
No man to take their place
So I decided to make this call
That I'd rather be drunk and
Drive away from
Here
I don't want to be sober, no not sober
Yea

          (CHORUS)
Broke and alone
No where to go
And lonlieness is killin' me s-s-slow

    (Verse 2)

One stog left to light
I think I'll smoke just a half
By the time I finish this drink
I'll roll the last of the grass
'cause I'd rather feel pumped
Than to drown in my tears
That'll help me peel over, sleep the night sober
Yea
Did I drink too much?
'cause the road's all lop-sided
I only drove a small way
I thought I swore not to take this right
Now my air's bein' pumped
And I'm drenched in my tears
I don't want to peel over, just want to be sober
Yea

     (Repeat chorus)

I wish I could have listened to my consience
And not drunk a drip
I wouldn't be here in so many pieces 
I shouldn't have drank a sip

Anna Francolini,"Once I hated this city
Now it can't get me down
Slushy, humid and gritty
What a pretty town

What thought I could be duller
More depressing, less gay
Now my favorite color
Is gray

A wall of rain as it turns to sleep
The lack of sun on a one-way street
I love the grime all the time
And what more do I need?

My window pane has a lovely view
An inch of sky and a fly or two
Why I can see half a tree
And what more do I need?

The dusk is thick and it's galling
It simply can't be excused
In winter even the falling snow looks
Used

My window pane may not give much light
But I see you, so the view is bright
If I can love you, I'll pay the dirt no heed
With your love what more do I need?

Someone shouting for quiet
Someone starting a brawl
Down the block there's a riot
And I'll buy it all

Listen now, I'm ecstatic
Hold me close and be still
Hear the lovely pneumatic
Drill

A subway train thunders through the Bronx
A taxi horn on the corner honks
But I adore every roar
And what more do I need?

I hear a crane making street repairs
A two ton child running wild upstairs
Steam pipes bang, sirens clang
And what more do I need?

The neighbors yell in the summer
The landlord yells in the fall
So loud I can't hear the plumber
Pound the wall

An aeroplane roars across the bay
But I can hear you as clear as day
You said you loved me
Above the sound and speed

C'est à toi que je le devrais

Je sens des boums et des bangs
Agiter mon cœur blessé
L'amour comme un boomerang
Me revient des jours passés
A pleurer les larmes dingues
D'un corps que je t'avais donné",Boomerang,1967
Anna Karina,"Moi je te dis une chose. Tu perds un seul instant ta lucidité, t'es foutu.
Laisse-moi rire ! Tu bois comme un trou!
Ouais t'es foutu. Tu perds toutes les autres.
C'est la cristallisation comme dit Stendhal.
Vous êtes pas marrants tout les deux, c'est l' même cinéma tout les soirs.

Toi ça va hein! Non mais alors!
Si tu veux qu'on te mette sur un coup tu vas te tenir tranquille.
Si vous croyez que je vous ai attendu
C'est pourquoi je dis que la lucidité est indispensable.
Sinon les filles te possèdent jusqu'à la gauche.
Un seul remède, changer!
Changer pour vous, c'est échanger!
Ouais une belle partie de base-ball, une belle partie de base-ball.
Moi je fais bande à part, ouais je fais bande à part.
Et oui, chacun son jeu mon vieux. Tu as été à Londres ces jours-ci?
Ouais j'ai ramené ça.
Oh oh les gâtés, les gâtés (Lemon tie! Lemon tie!)
Encore une bière
Deux.
Trois.
Quatre, je vais vous les chercher.
Tu la connais?
Pourquoi ça t'intéresse?
Ah! on peut te brancher si tu veux.
343-78-53. Ton boulot ça marche ?
Ben faut que je trouve un nom pour une marque de chewing-gum.

Baby gum, Baby gum, Lolita Lola Gum!

Baby gum ça va pas?
Ah on verra, je trouverai bien. Allez, à demain!
Allez pour le moment faut penser à se marrer hein haaa!",C'Est la Cristallisation Comme Dit Stendhal,1967
Anna Karina,"Ça va pas, ça va pas, restez immobile 
Seule façon ici de se mouvoir 
Ou alors je me casse la gueule et je me tue 
Non mais t'as vu ce que t'as fait de moi 
T'as vu ce qu'il en reste, nothing, lord nothing 
Mais qu'est-ce qu'elle fait bon Dieu, elle est là elle est pas là 
C'est pas possible, pas possible, pas possible, et pourtant 
Il me suffit de fermer les yeux et tu es là 

Ne dis rien, surtout pas, ne dis rien suis-moi 
Ne dis rien, n'ai pas peur, ne crains rien de moi 
Suis moi jusqu'au bout de la nuit 
Jusqu'au bout de ma folie 
Laisse le temps, oublie demain 
Oublie tout ne pense plus à rien 
Ne dis rien, surtout pas, ne dis rien suis-moi 
Ne dis rien, n'ai pas peur, ne crains rien de moi 

Suis-moi jusqu'au bout de la nuit 
Jusqu'au bout de ma folie 
Laisse le temps, oublie demain 
Oublie tout ne pense plus à rien",Ne Dis Rien (Say No More),1989
Anna Karina,"Je suis la fille que l'on colle, sur les Harley Davidson,
Les BMW, les camions 16 tonnes, je suis la roller girl,
Roller girl, roller girl
Je suis la fille des bulles, la lolita des comics,
Une des plus dangereuses des bandes dessin?
Je suis la roller girl, roller girl
Je suis l'amour en trompe l’œil, la décalcomanie girl,
Le danger immédiat et l'amour fiction,
Je suis la roller girl, roller girl, roller girl",Roller Girl,1989

Du Capricorne ou du Cancer

Then I know I don't have to hide from anyone 
And I pray that we'll stay just that way
Till the day comes along when we catch the sun.

[Chorus: x2]
Little girl you're runnin'
Come catch my hand I'm near you
Little girl you're singin'
Come close to me I hear you
You're growin' old, my mother's cold
Now you've learned what it meant to be mature
There's no such place as make believe
But when I look at your face, 
I'm not so sure

You and me is what I see
And that's the way its gonna stay and it will always be
So little man, please understand
In this world with all its land
You're all I see

Anna Keisling,"Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't live for tomorrow,
Tomorrow's much too long
I'll burn my eyes out
Before I get out

I wanted more
Than life could ever grant me
Bored by the chore
Of saving face

Today is the greatest
Day I've ever known
Can't wait for tomorrow
I might not have that long
I'll tear my heart out
Before I get out

Pink ribbon scars
That never forget
I tried so hard
To cleanse these regrets
My angel wings
Were bruised and restrained
My belly stings

Today is
Today is
Today is
The greatest day

I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you on
I want to turn you

Today is the greatest
Today is the greatest day
Today is the greatest day
That I have ever really known",Today,2002
Anna Kendrick,"Seems like everybody's got a price,
I wonder how they sleep at night,
When the sale comes first and the truth comes second, just stop for a minute
And smile,

Everybody look to the left,
Everybody look to the right,
Can you feel that yeah,
We're payin' with love tonight,

It's not about the money, money, money,
We don't need your money, money, money,
We just want to make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag,

It ain't about the (Ugh) cha chang cha chang,
It's not about the (Yeah) ba bling ba bling,
Want to make the world dance,
Forget about the price tag,
(Price tag, forget about the price tag)

Won't you come see about me,
I'll be alone dancin' you know it baby,
Tell me your troubles and doubts,
Givin' me everything inside and out,

Don't you forget about me,
As you walk on by,
Will you call my name,
As you walk on by,
will you call my name,
As you walk on by
Will you call my name

I say la lalalala lalalala lalalala lalalala

Tonight,
I will love love you tonight,
Give me everything tonight,
For all we know we might not get tomorrow,
Let's do it tonight,

Forget what they say,
All my cares they play,
I want you tonight,

Grab somebody sexy, tell them hey,

Give me everything tonight,
Give me everything tonight,

Take advantage of tonight
'Cause tomorrow I'm off to do battle, perform for princess,
But tonight, I can make you my queen, and make love to you endless,
It's insane to wait and they ain't growin' money,
Keep flowin', hustlers move beside us, so I'm tip-toeing to keep blowing,
I got it locked down like Lindsay Lohan,
Put it on my lap, baby,
I make you feel right, baby,
Can't promise tomorrow, but I'll promise tonight,

Excuse me,
But I might drink a little more than I should tonight,
And I may take you home with me if I could tonight, (Don't you)
And baby I will make you feel so good tonight, (Forget about me)
'Cause we might not get tomorrow, tonight.

Hands up,
I put my hand up,

Don't you forget about me,(Party in the U.S.A.)

Anna Kendrick,"Whoaoa yeah
I gotta new life
You would hardly recognize me
I'm so glad
How could a person like me care for you
Why do I bother when you're not the one for me
Is enough, enough

I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
And I am happy now living without you
I've left you all alone
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
(I saw the sign I saw the sign)
I saw the sign
(I saw the sign I saw the sign)
I saw the sign

Close your eyes
Give me your hand darling
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Or is this burning an eternal flame

Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
Then you come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling
Is this burning an eternal flame

Turn it around, turn it around
Turn it turn it
Turn it around, turn it around
Turn it turn it
Turn it around, turn it around
Turn it turn it, turn it around

Turn the beat around (turn the beat around) love to hear percussion (love to hear percussion)
Turn it upside down (turn it upside down) love to hear percussion (love to hear percussion)
Turn the beat around (turn the beat around you gotta turn it around) love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down (turn the beat around you gotta turn it around)love to hear it
