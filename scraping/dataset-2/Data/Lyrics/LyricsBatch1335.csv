Bobby Troup,"Lots of folks back east they say 
Leaving home most every day 
Beating the hot old dusty way 
To the California line 
'Cross the desert sands they roll 
Getting out of that Old Dust Bowl 
Think they're coming to a sugar bowl 
But here's what they find 
Police at the port of entry say 
You're number fourteen thousand for to day 

Hey, if you ain't got the Do Re Mi, boy 
If you ain't got the Do Re Mi 
Well, you better go back to beautiful Texas 
Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee 
California is the garden of Eden 
It's a paradise to live in or see 
But believe it or not 
You won't find it so hot 
If you ain't got the Do Re Mi 

You want to buy a home or a farm 
That can't do nobody harm 
Take your vacation by the mountains or sea 
Don't swap your old cow for a car 
You better stay right where you are 
Better take this little tip from me 
Well, I look through the want ads every day 
The headlines in the papers always say",Do-Re-Mi,1994
Bobby Troup,"My story is much too sad to be told
But practically ev'rything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you

Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrific'ly too
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick ev'ry time I see
You're standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me

I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some gal/guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
But I get a kick out of you",I Get a Kick Out of You,1994
Bobby Troup,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,1994
Bobby Troup,"For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I’ve needed so long
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me and somehow I know I’ll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Who have my dreams come true

For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before

For once I have someone I know won't desert me
I’m not alone anymore

For once I can say 
This is mine you can’t take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me

For once I can say
This is mine you can’t take it

As long as I know I have love we can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me",For Once in My Life,1995
Bobby Troup,"They like to chat about the dresses they will wear tonight
They chew the fat about their tresses and the neighbours' fight
Inconsequential things that men don't really care to know
Become essential things that women find so apropos

But that's a dame
They're all the same
It's just a game
They call it girl talk, girl talk

They all me-ouw about the ups and downs of all their friends
The who, the how, the why, they dish the dirt, it never ends
The weaker sex, the speaker sex, we mortal males behold
But though we joke, we wouldn't trade you for a ton of gold

So baby stay, and gab away
But hear me say
That after girl talk
Talk to me

But that's a dame
They're all the same
It's just a game
They call it girl talk, girl talk

So baby stay, and gab away
But hear me say
That after girl talk
Talk to me",Girl Talk,1995
Bobby Troup,"Here is a word to the wise
The top dietitians in town insist
The best source of vitamin C there can be
Is a lemon twist

Even a skeptic replies
That here's a suggestion you can't resist
A cool drink with ice is improved
With some slices of lemon twist

It isn't merely circumstantial evidence
That the lemon is a highly healthful citrus fruit
The most respected scientists agree with the physiologists
That here's one fact you can't dispute

Why don't you open your eyes
Your psychosomatic ills won't persist
If quick like a rabbit
You latch to the habit of lemon twist

Bobby Troup,"Tangerine, she is all they claim
With her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame
Tangerine, when she dances by
Senoritas stare and caballeros sigh
And I've seen toasts to Tangerine
Raised in every bar across the Argentine
Yes, she has them all on the run
But her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine

Tangerine, she is all they say
With mascara'd eyes, and chapeaux by Dache
Tangerine with her lips of flame
If the color keeps, Louis Philippe's to blame
And I've seen clothes on Tangerine
Where the label says from Macy's Mezzanine 
Yes, she's got the guys in a whirl
But she's only fooling one girl
She's only fooling Tangerine",Tangerine,1995
Bobby Troup,"Thou swell, thou witty, thou sweet, thou grand 
Wouldst kiss me pretty? Wouldst hold my hand? 
Both thine eyes are cute too, what they do to me 
Hear me holler, I choose a sweet loll-appaloosa in thee 

I'd feel so rich in a hut for two 
Two rooms and kitchen I'm sure would do 
Give me just a plot of, not a lot of land 
And thou swell, thou witty, thou grand",Thou Swell,1995
Bobby Troup,"Oh she may be weary
Them young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old miniskirt dress
But when she gets weary
You try a little tenderness

Oh man that
Un hunh

Just anticipating
The thing that you'll never never possess
No no no
But while she there waiting

Try just a little bit of tenderness
That's all you got to do
Now it might be a little bit sentimental no
But she has her greavs and care
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
Yeah yeah yeah
And it makes it easier to bear
Oh she wont regret it

No no
Them young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness

Bobby Troup,"Let someone start believing in you
Let him hold out his hand
Let him touch you and watch what happens

One someone who can look in your eyes
And see into your heart
Let him find you and watch what happens

Cold, no I won't believe your heart is cold
Maybe just afraid to be broken again

Let someone with a deep love to give
Give that deep love to you
And what magic you'll see

Bobby Troup,"Where's that careless chambermaid?
Where'd she put my razor blade?
She mislaid it, I'm afraid,
It's gotta be foun'!
Ask her when she cleaned my room
What she did with my perfume;
I just can't lose it,
I've gotta use it,
'Cause Lulu's back in town.

Gotta get my old tuxedo pressed,
Gotta sew a button on my vest,
'Cause tonight I've gotta look my best,

Gotta get a half a buck somewhere,
Gotta shine my shoes and slick my hair,
Gotta get myself a boutonniere,

All my Harlem coquettes;
Mister Otis regrets
That he won't be aroun'.
You can tell the mailman not to call,
I ain't comin' home until the fall,
And I might not get back home at all,
Lulu's back in town.

You can bet I've got it bad,
Best complaint I've ever had;
We'll be stepping out tonight,
An' struttin', an' how.
We're in for the swellest time,
Finish up without a dime;
Look here, you fellers,
I'll make you jealous,
My Lulu, she's a wow.

And the girl who wore his ring
Through the wintery snow

And the weeks and years took wind

Bobby Tucker,"Good morning heartache, you old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around

That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My lips could move and talk

I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

Bobby Tucker,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",(I Got a Woman Crazy for Me) She's Funny That Way,1994

And we were in a most romantic mood
Our hearts were lost in reverie

Which goes to show that music has charms
The lights were low so we kept on dancing
I felt the glow of you in my arms

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

You know who we are, cause we pimping all over the world,

[Ludacris]
Sing it hoes,
All over the world baby, it's only right that I share my experiences with y'all, 
Cause I've been places where you'll never imagine, but I'ma start at home, 
I walk straight up to them and I'm like (ugh), Hey girl how ya doing, 
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin, 
I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name, 
If you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange, Hey!
See I'm the man of this town, 
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around, 
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinking of me, 
We got people to meet and many places to see, Hey!
I'm really digging ya lips,
But be careful where you walking when you swinging them hips, 
I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causing a crash 
Wit ya traffic jam booty, heads pausing so fast, Hey!
I wouldn't trade you for the world I swear it, 
I like ya hair and every style that ya wear it,
And how the colors coordinate wit ya clothes, 
From your manicured nails to ya pedicured toes

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
You hear the song so dance, 
Don't always think I'm trying to get in your pants,
Cause see me my pimpin's in 3-D, 
I'm taking you places you only see on T.V., 
Trying to show ya that living is trife,
How many guys you know that can bring the travel channel to life, 
One day we on the auto-bind swerving driving, 
Next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands, 
If you with me ain't no time to sleep, 
Especially at wet willies on Miami Beach, 
But I drive you off and pay you no attention 
If I make it to Atlanta's Brina Brothers convention, 
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours,
Making sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard, 
Hawaii to D.C. it's plenty women to see, 
So if yo ass don't show up it's more women for me, Hey!

[Chorus]

[Ludacris]
I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican day parade, 
Than at night I'm in New Orleans drinking hand Grenades, 
Outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest, 
In Mardi Gras all the women trying to show more They chest, 
Hey I'm in Jamaica spending massive bucks, 
While the ladies all begging me to masha tucks, 
I had sad Beginnings when I rap wit no fans, 
Now it's all happy endings in my lap in Japan, Hey
I used to think that it was way too cold 
Til I went to Canada and say some beautiful hoes, 
Now I Hit the Caribbean every year in Toronto, 
Then fly t Illinois to get a taste of Chicago,
Oh Yet and still you wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil, 
Ain't no need of even asking Brah, 
The best women are reside in Africa, and that's real

Ladies and gentlemen as we ride out, 
Could we have all the real pimps,
Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air, 
Now ladies look around wit me, 
Lets see if We can weed some of these niggas out, 
Cause it's no way that all these niggas could be pimpin', no
If you happen to see a nigga wit two sweat patches up under his arms, 
Look like he been swimming In shoulder height water, 
Please tell that nigga, put yo hands down, 
If you smell like you been At work all day and your car, 
Please put your hands down, 
Now look up at the pinky fingers that Are still in the air, 
If you see him ashy around the knuckles, 
Like the nigga wash half of his
Hands and lotion three quarters of his body, 
Please say put yo hands down, 
If yo spinning rims Spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin, 
If you are dancing on the dance floor and you look to Yo left and yo right 
And you do not see a woman in sight, 
Guess what you guessed it you are not
Pimpin, if your Vodka and cranberry is really really dark like blood, 
That's because you didn't Order Vodka buddy, 
That's why it's three dollars a glass, 
Put your hands down, now look down, 
I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time ok, 
You see the nigga with the white socks not pimpin'!

On, your not pimping",Pimpin' All Over the World,2004

I had a lot of loves in my life time
But I keep comin back to you,
Now I know why you been down for me

And you had my back when danger comes around me
You're my world, my center of gravity
And no one knows me like you

To my motherfuckin' man, fifty grand, the alcoholic man
Inject a tall can to his blood stream if he can
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker
Emcee provoker, the chocolate tah smoker (huh?)
I like to mack in Maximas and Acuras
But cheeks, I'm smackin' em' (huh?)
The raw rapper, spot smacker
Wit the lil hooker on my lap-ah, you know your favorite macker
A shy nigga, but I ain't ya fuckin' comforter
And If I ever fall in love, I bet I'd fucked it up
Ask the hooker, If I didn't jug her
She try to front, then I put the Chucky Booker on her
(Why you wanna...play games on me?)
Bitch, you crazy? Commitments, I'm Swayze
No time for the ill shit
Mess with the niggaz on that real blood spill shit
My rappin' tactics, are drastic
Stretchin' motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my Pedigree, you better be
Filled with energy, niggaz never gettin' me

Big cities and bright lights
Short days and long nights
No stress and no strife
I'm high off living the life

It's clear to see that I'm the motherfuckin' man, I done learned from the
Best of em; Took the first slot, niggaz still second guessin' em
Hoes, I'm undressin' em', foes, I'm not stresin' em'
Outlastin' a bunch of 'em , outflowed the rest of em'
Cause everyday, I stay preachin' on the pulpit
So tell them haters they could miss me with that bullshit
But I won't miss, I'm Luda, the heat holder
I'm rich, bitch! I've done more shows than Oprah
And I'm a soldier, ready for whatever
Roll with a bunch of niggaz that don't know no better
King like Coretta, countin' mo' cheddar
Just hired two dykes to be my ho getters
When it comes to these women, dog, ain't no one fuckin' wit me
They runnin' back, you think I had TJ Duckett wit me
That's cause I throw it like Vick, from the yard line
Menage a trois, it's safe to say I'm havin' hard times

[Snoop Dogg]
To my nigga Chopper dot, with the whoopty-whop on the block
Got the heaters cocked, cause I know the suckers on the block
Hennesey and Belve-D, brings a lot of jealousy
Nigga stop snitchin', nephew, why you tellin' me?
They say the game ain't what it use to be no mo'
Used to be a G, but now he just a ho
Runnin' 'round poitin' fingers, tellin' names
You fuckin' up the rules to this dirty game, and it's a diry shame
I ain't flippin' out, that's probably why I'm dippin' out
Ya'll fools trippin' out, that why I'm on a different route
Now, makin' money, havin' clout, what's what it's all about
Twenty seven cars and a tweleve bedroom house
Now they call me Snoopy Trump
I keep my heater close, cause I love to bust
Now hat's a stain on a nigga, I bang on a nigga
Kick rocks and watch how I do my thang, young nigga; I'm livin' the life!

I got places to go, and people to see, and things to do
I can't be tied down with you I'm sorry baby! (sorry baby)

She say that she love me, want me to be her husband
Wanna tie me down, tryna ?? and cuff me
But I can't let her, cause I got a jet to catch
But I told her id be back like ??

Wasn't too convincing, she scared to go with me
Say she be lonesome all alone 'cause she miss me
Cries when I'm leavin', whining and weeping, 
But I gotta go before my flight leaves me (leaves me)

Now I could pass you like Grey Poupon
Or you could wait on me shawty I won't take too long
Give a nigga some space, or baby move on

Cut 'em up like Jason, just face it that boy Luda's a killer
Half man, half gorilla, beating all on my chest
Pleasing all of your flesh, squeezing all on your breast
Giving you reasons to rest, and ain't never say no to papi
Wake 'em up like Folgers cause I fold 'em like origami
Hey mami let's get it popping like Orville Redenbacher

Sweeter than Betty Crocker, and I'm ready to belly flop ya

Gotta get 'em up out of them clothes, if I throw a couple dollars then pose
We could drink a couple bottles and go, and ride off in the Impala on vogues
And Rolls, gold is all on my neck, all on my wrist
So just let go of yo' hoe, don't hog her to death, lend her to Chris
Just for a little while for a little bit
Just wanna see her smile and get the bigger fish
She said that you had a little dick
Now how in the hell can she benefit from something like that?
I be up in that cat, make her put a hump in that back
Black, I swing low and sweet chariot, meet me at the Marriott
Key access, I'll be at the very top
Don't hesitate to stop the elevator either
I'll show you the ups and downs, you'll be my elevator diva

Escada, Dior, Fendi, that Masconi and Juicy

Your Jimmy Choo's are so sexy but Giseppi's is mean

I would never do that to you

And you know I love you
And everything would be cool
And you'll say you love me
And forget all your pain
You know this is true

We gotta come back to ya; it's Bobby V. and Luda
We just wanna soothe ya; Bobby V. and Luda

This town is too small for the both of us
She's cryin', I'm packin' stuff
Peelin' chrome wheelies, burnin' dust
This time I'm really goin'
'Bout to turn this road into the autobahn
'Cause if I slow down, I think I might change my mind
I'll run as fast as I can (as fast as I can)
Foot on the gas, down the highway again
Switchin' lanes, not givin' a damn
So catch up with ya boy if ya can

[Chorus:]
I'm runnin from my past
What's done I can't redo
I'm just lookin' in my rear view (ridin'), lookin' in my rear view (ridin')
Wanna right out all my wrongs
What's done I can't redo 
I'm just lookin' in my rear view (ridin'), lookin' in my rear view (ridin')
My rear view (lookin' at my rear view)
I can see you in my rear view
Lookin' at my rear view

I'm pushin' eighty MPH on pop and no doughs
Caffeine, nicotine, and a change of clothes; clear the road
I see ya face, and I miss ya dear
Images in the mirror closer than they appear
I'll run as fast as I can
Foot on the gas, down the highway again
Switchin' lanes, not givin' a damn
So catch up with ya boy if ya can

[Ludacris]
I can see you in my rear view, baby
Luda, I got my pedal to the metal
And I'm lookin' in my rear view mirror, mirror
Never said goodbye, jumped in my ride, and I shook like Shakira; hear the
Noise that I'm makin' while my trunk is steady shakin'
And my heart skip a beat, and thinkin' about
Sneakin' away with a freak on the weekend
But what in the hell was I thinkin' 'bout?
Now I'm all alone tryin' to right my wrongs
Sittin' on chrome in a Cadillac bone
Tryin' to write this song
Can't believe that I'm leavin' home
But I really wanna hear ya scream and moan
My name's Ludacris, and my team is strong
So, hey, Bobby V. gon' sing this song

Bobby V,"When times were rough
And I wanted to give up, you
You were right there

When I was down and out
And my friends weren't around, you
You never left me

This is my second one
And I needed your help, you
You were right there

It was some cloudy days
But it's okay, you
You never left me

I'ma stay on a bent knee
I love you
You were right there

I stay believing
Always have faith in you
You never left me

Cant believe you chose to start the night this way
We were just about to go out
Then you said wait baby no sit down
Baby girl, I just knew right then
Something was wrong with ya
You said I cant be with ya

And trust me this is such a beautiful one

Don't run away
When love is staring you in your face
When the night's cold
I wanna be the one you hold
I've been searchin'
Believe girl I'm lonely
So tired of yearnin for what I've found in you

[Chorus]
I might not be what you want me to be
But I know one thing
I can fulfill your dreams
Just take my hand you'll find romance
'cause I wanna be your man, I wanna be your man!

[Verse 2]
Tell me baby
I hope you love the way that I
I make you happy
When your sad and want to cry
Nobody's perfect
Everybody has their faults girl
Just give us a chance
And our love can go on and on and on...

I might not be what you want me to be
But I know one thing
I can fulfill your dreams
Just take my hand you'll find romance

Oh right...
Ooo baby I've waited so long (so long)
I got your six, I got your ice
Tell me baby what's wrong? (what's wrong?)
Say you'll love me
Say you need me
For always, and we will be together

But I know one thing

Just take my hand you'll find romance

And only hot girls out there trying to get that old hot boy dick
You heard of me dirty, I be up early with the pigeons,
And your neighbors be up wit me too listening through the kitchen
One of the pioneers, gotta bounce somethin' serious
I'm the shit around here, I been out here
Pull out the purple in the wheels, diamond chains and the grills

That'll provoke those
Cowards who scope those,
I got 'em so dro'
I know they follow me,
God bless them if they bother me
They got a problem with me, obviously
And I can understand it ,
'cause they bitches be on top of me
And I understand them bitches too,

And they understand how a nigga feel about his property,
Make 'em understand the consequences if they lie to me

I see a part of me that lives in you and I glow each time I see your face
Don't know where I'll end but I'll take chance
If I'm guilty of loving I'll take the blame

Bobby Vee,"There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun

But soft and sweet and dreaming

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal that look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon

And watch her as she grows in my garden

Don't ask me if she's found somebody new
'Cause I would try to smile but in a little while
My tears would show and then you'd know it's true
Please don't ask about Barbara
The hurt will bring the teardrops to my eyes
Though I would pretend that now she's just a friend
You'd look at me and see right through the lies
Tears, tears, go away, come again another day
How can I hide this pain I feel inside
When little teardrops give my heart away?
Don't you ever tell Barbara
I'd rather die than let her know I'm cryin'
Let her run around until the day she's found
She needs me back again but this I ask till then

Just what a beautiful tree was he
Oh, how he wished that he were a Christmas tree

One starry night, his branches so bright
Were glistening in the snow
And as he stood so silently,
Wishing he were a Christmas tree
Softly, there came from the forest around him
Magic and jingling bells
Nearer and nearer, they seemed to surround him,
Weaving their magic spells

Oh, how he quivered with fright because
There, right beside him, was Santa Claus
Asking him if he'd be his Christmas tree

Now, in his fancy dress, he's the best
Of all the Christmas trees,
Playing with gifts and bon-bons too,
Gay fairy lights of every hue
He stands and waits for the children to see him
Dressed in his party bells
Oh, what a thrill when they see all the tinsel
Round Mr. Robin's nest

And as he raises his arms so green,
Santa agrees with the Fairy Queen
He is a very beautiful Christmas tree

He got a razor in his shoe

I was outside running barefoot in the rain
She lived in the house next door
Her nose was pressed against the window pane

When I looked at her she smiled 
And showed a place where two teeth used to be
And I heard her ask her mom if she 
Could come outside and play with me

Soon the day's of sand and shovels 
Gave way to the mysteries of life
Then I noticed she was changing and I 
Looked at her through different eyes

We became as one and knew a love
Without beginning or an end
And everyday I lived with her 
Was like a new day dawning once again

And I've loved her since every doll was Shirley Temple
Soda pop was still a nickel
Jam was on her fingertips
Milk was circled on her lips

After many years our live grew 
Silent and at night I heard her cry 
And when she left me in the fall I knew
That it would be our last goodbye

I was man enough to give her 
Everything she needed for a while
And searching for a perfect love 
I found that I could not give her a child

Now she lives a quiet life 
And is the mother of a little girl
Every time I pass her house 
My thoughts go back into another world

Because I see her little girl
Her nose is pressed against the window pane
She thinks I'm a lonely man 
Who wants to come inside out of the rain

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see

And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

A-ploughin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel,
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel.

For he saw the riders comin' hard , and he heard their mournful cry!

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked with sweat,

On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on hear them cry;

As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name,

Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run 
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart 
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart 
Where are the green fields that we used to roam?

Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart,
Without a love of my own

Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

And then, there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper, ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold

Blue moon
Now, I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart,
Without a love of my own

And then, there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper, ""Please adore me""

Without a love of my own

Bobby Warren,"How can I convince you what you see is real
Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Can we last forever, will we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, these questions of the heart
You followed me through changes, and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses, through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,
The search is over
You were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me loves that I have lost

Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally stuck like lightning from the blue
Every highway leading me back to you
Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain the man I really am

I was living for a dream,
Loving for a moment
Taking on the world,
That was just my style
Now I look into your eyes
I can see forever,

You were with me all the while",The Search Is Over,2006

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1997

You walked right into my life and told me love would find a way

Looking in the face of one who loved me,

Hoping, 
And praying, Lord, that she could understand me, 
But I didn't know her name. 
She took my hand in hers and told me I was wrong.

As you keep on growing, keep on growing, keep on growing. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Someday baby, who knows where or when, Lord,

And I drive the main roads
Searchin' in the sun
For another overload

I hear you singin' in the wires
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman

But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south
Will never stand the strain

And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time

Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two

We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me

Here I go again, here I go again, here I go again

There's a conversation over in the corner
Big Ed is all on the lawn

And the FM music is groovin'
Folks getting down, getting down in their stocking feet
Sleepy eyes are peeping
From the window across the street

And it looks like daylight gonna catch me up again
Gonna catch me up again
Most people like getting up when I'm just getting in
Oh, it's the only, only time
It seems to be the only time that I can unwind

Swore to myself
Time and time and time again
That I would give up the night life and start layin' in
But it ain't easy, no no

Sayin' no to my friends
'Cause the real, 'cause the real
Set don't get started
Till everyone else is in

And it looks like daylight gonna catch me up again

Oh oh oh you're so sweet
I know you're so kind
Can't you see my face, girl
Must gon' be running out of time
Jealous love
I got to go away and then find myself
Oh babe, nuh oh ah
Trust me (trust me)
Trust me
Oh, yeah, trust me babe
Oh, yeah
On time

Girl lets go, you'll find yourself
I don't wanna baby
(I heard oh little baby that you'll find yourself)
You better find, find yourself
Look woman, you left too hard
(I heard oh little baby that you'll find yourself) go away, go away, go away
Girl you done blew your cool
You're running out of food
I seen a woman (take a man's life, take a man's life, take a man's life)
Even though I know she had a whole lot of love for him
Everybody said it was jealous love, and they was right
Love and happiness are like twins
When one is absent to the other, it always seems like something or someone is missing
Probably the Bible expressed the importance of devotion most dramatically
When it says that greater love
Has no man than this, to lay down his life for another
You know this kind of love is lacking in the world today

Too many people are willing to stand back and watch someone
To watch someone experience sorrow either because they're afraid or they don't
Wanna be involved or they simply don't give a damn
About another human being's life
My brother said
Love is emblem of eternity
Think your head on that

Run to the rock
Hide your face
Rocks cry out
There's no hiding place
Where are you gonna run?
Where are you gonna run

And have the chances to taste the innocence of youth
The innocence of youth, the innocence of youth
You know what we have to do

Save the children and we might save the world

He has to learn to survive before he learns to crawl
He needs somebody who can give him a daddy hand

They deserve a chance, got to have a chance
Why can't we all understand?

Happiness, happiness, happiness is just an illusion
Somewhere it must end even if we have to start
Stop and start again, we're defendin' a man's sin

Silent night! Holy night!
Brought the world peace tonight,
From the heavens' golden height
Shows the grace of His holy might
Jesus, as man on this earth!

Silent night! holy night!
Where today all the might
Of His fatherly love us graced
And then Jesus, as brother embraced.
All the peoples on earth!

Silent night! Holy night!
Long we hoped that He might,
As our Lord, free us of wrath,
Since times of our fathers He hath
Promised to spare all mankind!

Silent night! Holy night!
Shepherds first see the sight.
Told by angelic Alleluja,
Sounding everywhere, both near and far:
""Christ the Savior is here!""",Silent Night,1999

As you were having dinner with your families last night? 
Well, if you did then you must know that 
This world is now in a whole lot of trouble 

But I don't want you to get discouraged by that, no 
Because I believe that there's a solution to all of this

And no more backward thinking, it's time for thinking, ahead

Wake up all you teachers, you better teach a new way 
Maybe then they'll listen to what you have to say 

Because they are the ones 
Who's coming up and the world is in their hands 
When you teach the children 
You better teach them the very best you can 

The world won't get no better 
If you just let it be, no no 
The world won't get no better 
You gotta change again, you and me 

Wake up all you doctors, make the old people well 
Because they're the ones who suffer a lot and catch all the hell 
They don't hassle very long before their judgment day 
Won't you make them happy before they pass away? 

Wake up all you builders, it's time to build a new land 
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand 
Only thing we have to do is put it in our minds 
And surely things will work out, they do it every time 

The world won't get no better, oh no

Don't you understand, I'm just trying to find some peace of mind

I have to stand in line, baby when I'm in queue
I got to do it all, just the same as you
Got my doubts about it, oh but I try
Oh make it work with tears in my eyes
Because I'm just a man, only trying to do the best I can
Don't you understand, I want some peace of mind

Through the good and the bad times too

To fight for a heart that is true

You must have felt me shiver,
Shaken by a wave of fright,
That you calm with a whisper.
And fear gave way to better things,
Like a warm summer and sweeter dreams.  

Like a warm spring rain, on a roof above;
The way you call my name, when we make love.
While the world outside my window goes insane,
You're here to remind me, a few good things remain. 

When living leaves my pride bruised up,
I'm fragile as a feather.
The storms of life just won't let up,
You're like a change of weather.
When dust settles on my dreams,
You wash them clean.

The way you call my name, when we make love.

Bobby Wood,"Oh  the snowflakes fell in silence 
Over Belleau Wood that night 
For a Christmas truce had been declared 
By both sides of the fight 
As we lay there in our trenches 
The silence broke in two 
By a German soldier singing 
A song that we all knew 
Though I did not know the language 
The song was ""Silent Night"" 
Then I heard my buddy whisper  
""All is calm and all is bright"" 
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me 
'Cause I'd die if I was wrong 
But I stood up on my trench 
And I began to sing along 
Then across the frozen battlefield 
Another's voice joined in 
Until one by one each man became 
A singer of the hymn 
Then I thought that I was dreaming 
For right there in my sight 
Stood the German soldier 
'Neath the falling flakes of white 
And he raised his hand and smiled at me 
As if he seemed to say 
Here's hoping we both live 
To see us find a better way 
Then the devil's clock struck midnight 
And the skies lit up again 
And the battlefield where heaven stood 
Was blown to hell again 
But for just one fleeting moment 
The answer seemed so clear 
Heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's just beyond the fear 
No, heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's for us to find it here",Belleau Wood,1997

His grip on the gospel is his one claim to fame
He hurls fire and brimstone at the cars passin' by
He offers salvation from the savior on high

His bouts with the bottle show up on his cheeks
He looks like a scarecrow, a sight to behold
While he works for the shepherd, bringin' lambs to the fold

He points to the Bible he holds in his hand
Says, I'm proof that the good Lord can save any man

Son, it ain't what you're drivin' or the clothes that you wear

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

One that they could croon

And that is how the blues really began

Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
