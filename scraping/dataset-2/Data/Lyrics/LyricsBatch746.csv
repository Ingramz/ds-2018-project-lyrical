Mongo Santamaría,"You know, when you say your marriage vows, they're supposed to be for real. I mean
if you think back about what you really said, what it's all about, honor, loving and
obeying till death do us part and all. But it shouldn't be that way, it should it
should, it should be lies because it turns out to be lies. If you don't honor what
you said, you lie to God. The words should be changed

Ooo now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again and again and again, and that isn't all
I gave my love to you each time to make amends
Suddenly I start to realize I can't make it
Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health's sake
What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won't say those words again
Instead I'll say I'll try to love and protect you
With all my heart as long as you want me to baby

Ooo if I love again I'm gonna try a new way this time
Memories of the things we did; some we're proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger
Do you remember all of the fights we had?
You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me will all of your heart
You'd never take $1 million to part
I really tried, you know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin' but lies
I really tried, you know how I tried, we really lied, didn't we baby?
And on top of that you have scared the life, my name
But I can't understand, 'cause if you love me
How could you turn me into nothin' least
Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best I could, you were so inviting and your love was like mellow wine
Pains of love, miles of tears, after lasting for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years and break away to the blue-day sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend: I'll never be back again
But we're not really bitter babe
I promise you all the love in the world, good love in the world
But I know you'll never be satisfied just to have me by your side
Memories haunt you all the time, I will never leave, you're mine
God judged me on His side; you've said bad things and you've lied
Still I remember some of the good things baby
Of love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I'd love to get in my life
I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared babe
I'd rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was to love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight
It don't matter baby, take a lesson from them all
I never thought I'd see the day when you'd put me through what you put me 
through
You try your best, you say I gave you no rest

When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me? When did I stop loving you?","When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You",1998

Mongo Santamaría,"I woke up early this mornin'
I was feelin' kind of blue
My landlady said you got a letter here
And I began to sing the blues

It was from my brother
Don't you know the boy's laying down in Vietnam
Lord they say, you don't have no reason to fight baby but
Lord knows you think you're right
(but you got to be wrong, don't you hear me, you got to be wrong, now pick up -)

You wake up early in the mornin' baby
And you don't have nothin' to eat
You can't buy yourself no clothes baby
Lord knows who can you meet

My brother's in Vietnam
People don't you know just why I'm singin' these blues
You might have no respect for your country darlin'
But that's why, that's why I'm singin' these blues
(you better pick up baby and get with it, you hear me? Looka here -)

The mothers, all the wives,
All the fathers, that have sons,
In Vietnam, you hear me?
This is to you
Always

Oh I'm gonna wake up early in the mornin'
People I'm 'bout to go out of my god-darn' mind
Lord I'm gonna wake up early in the mornin'
People I'm 'bout to go out of my god-darn' mind
It's so sad, it's so sad to think about your people
Lord when the other man thinks they're wrong
(you're not right baby. Hear this just before I go -)

Lord I woke up in the mornin' (*)
You're gonna look up, you're gonna look up and find yourself gone
Lord I woke up this mornin'
You're gonna look up and find yourself gone
(how would you feel if it was your brother over there, eh? How would you feel?)
Lord then you're gonna ask the good Lord to forgive you
Please forgive me for my sins.",Vietcong Blues,2001
Mongol,"Quando sei qui con me
Questa stanza non ha più pareti
Ma alberi,
Alberi infiniti
Quando sei qui vicino a me
Questo soffitto viola
No, non esiste più.
Io vedo il cielo sopra noi

Che restiamo qui, abbandonati
Come se non ci fosse più
Niente, più niente al mondo.
Suona un'armonica
Mi sembra un organo
Che vibra per te e per me
Su nell'immensità del cielo.

Monia Liter,"'Twas on the Isle of Capri that I found her,
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree,
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming 'round her,
Where we met on the Isle of Capri.

She was as sweet as the rose of the dawning,
But somehow Fate hadn't meant her for me,
And tho' I sailed with the tide in the morning,
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri.

Summertime was nearly over,
Blue Italian skies above,
I said, ""Lady, I'm a rover,
Can you spare a sweet word of love?""
She whispered softly, "" 'Tis best not to linger,""
Then as I kissed her hand I could see
She wore a plain golden ring on her finger,
'Twas good-bye to the Isle of Capri.",Isle of Capri,2001

With the dawn, I still go on and dream of you

And were there more than twenty four hours a day
They'd be spent in sweet content dreaming away
When skies are grey, when skies are blue
Morning, noon and night time too
All I do the whole day thru, is dream of you
 
All I do is dream of you the whole night thru
With the dawn, I still go on and dream of you

With the mem'ries that can't be erased.
Although we need each other, things have changed.
It's not the same.

Sometimes it makes me wonder.
Where would I be if you hadn't discovered,
Reaching deep inside of me?
I know there was something
That we could compare.

I just wanna go back to being the same.
And I only wanna make things right
Before you walk out of my life.

From a portrait hung on high.
It's filled with so much color
And the laughter we left behind.

I made the choice; I was wrong you were right.

Can not live without you.

I be the M-A-L-I-K
Excuse Miss Thang, my god you look smooth
Put away your loot you all in with me boo

Not to get on your nerves but haven't you served a star or two?
Only the ones with no class, the ones with no shape
Shine on em like a diamond in the rain off the window pane
It spittin' on your kitten, can I slob it too?
Of course I got the sauce to put on the barbecue
Well if tonight is tonight like Betty Wright

So I dropped in on a dance

Just to take a glance
And there this lovely thing was
She was more than enough
I asked her for her hand

Said would you like to dance
So pleased that I had asked
She quickly took my hand
And we danced and fell in love

On a slow jam
Ohh

Play another slow jam
This time make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby and for me
Play another slow jam
This time make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby and for me

Seems what you say is true
I feel the same way too
You see I've waited all night long just to dance with you
And when you touched my hand
I knew you were the man

To turn my world around
And make my dreams come true
The magic in your eyes, made me realize
That everything I feel, has got to be real
And we danced and fell in love
On a slow jam

Play another slow jam
This time make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby and for me
Play another slow jam
This time make it sweet
On a slow jam
For my baby and for me

I'm trying to find someone who
I can give my good lovin' to
Never, ever did I dream I'd find someone, yeah

Now I've been to find someone too
I prayed to heaven, and then I found you
I swear I fell in love the night you danced into my heart

Play another slow jam
This time make it sweet
On a slow jam
Can I get a slow jam
Do you want to slow jam, baby
Play another slow jam
This time make it sweet
Can I get a slow jam
Play another slow jam
Are you gonna slow jam",Slow Jam,1997

I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it

Oooo I don't want to push you away 

'Cause no one makes me feel like you do 

I dream of you all through the night 

Holding you tenderly 

Right here wrapped in my arms so tight 

But when I start to tell you how I feel 

You tell me 'bout someone new who's right for you 

If you only knew my love's for real 

Baby, oooo I keep it to myself 

Baby, oooo fallin' in love with you 

The harder it gets

He said without me he couldn't make it

Monica,"See ya from across the room

It's Friday night and
I'm going to a party 
With my man, to dance
As soon as we get in
He is lost with his friends and 
I'm there, in a trance

I can tell that someone's looking at me
And I didn't come here by myself
But he left me here now someone else wants me
So it must mean he didn't care
I'm goin' on

[Chorus]
See ya from across the room
Like you want to know me
If you want to make a move
Meet me on the dance floor
Though I'm here with someone else
He's not what I'm looking for
Instead I've seen him 'cross the room
Meet me on the dance floor

As the night goes on
Each glance makes me wonder
What is on, your mind
More than a dance as you pull 
Up to me it feels, alright

I can tell that someone's looking at me
And I didn't come here by myself
But he left me here now someone else wants me
So it must mean he didn't care
I'm goin' on

Let me know what you want to do
Can't you tell that I'm missing you
I'm lettin' you know that your right on time
Cause I'm lookin' for someone else tonight

Feeling completely, down to be open
Down to be open
For some satisfaction
Didn't want to say yes, hating your reaction
I knew it was wrong, for feeling this way
Especially the thought of giving in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night I had to decide
I was thinking!
I should make a move but I won't
I know your probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do then it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
I should make a move but I won't
I know your probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do then it won't be right
I want to get down but not the first night
We were chillin' watchin' your t.v.
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And somehow in one night discover I love you
Felt so right but it felt so wrong
And look how we are carrying on
Trying to say things to get me to stay
But my watch tells me its getting to late
I'm thinking!

I should make a move but I won't
I know your probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do then it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night
 
I should make a move but I won't
I know your probably thinking something is wrong
Knowing if I do then it won't be right
I want to get down but not the first night
If you want me
You got to know me
And if you want my love
You gotta wait my love
Baby, that's the way it's got to be
Get to know me so we can do this

Boy, it's been a long time
Since the last time I saw you
Feels like nothin' changed
Since we've been together
I must admit that I go crazy 'bout you

And I can see it in your eyes
That there's somethin' you want to say to me
'Cause usually right now
You'd be holdin' on to me
But instead you're tellin' me

That things have changed, they're not the same
And recently you found someone that you
Decided to dedicate your whole life to
And what we had has got to be through

And baby, what hurts the most is letting go
I just want you to know that I love you so
I know things are different now
You've gone and settled down
And I thought for sure you'd always wait for me

I'll tell you what hurts the most is I should have took the chance
Boy when you came to me and offered me your hand
Silly of me, I thought, I'd always have your heart
I had the chance to have all the love, oh, how I'm missing you now

I hate that there is someone new
Comin' in and takin' my place
Doin' the things that we used to do
And makin' love to you

And oh, what am I supposed to do?
It's killin' me 'cause I want you
And you should have known my love was true
And there's no one else in this world for me but you

Decided to dedicate your whole life to

There's just one thing I need you to do

Don't you love her like you really needed me
Don't you love her like you used to love me

The shoes? Gotta be 20's or better

Monica,"Mmm...been a long time
Yea... Yea... Yea
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Can I talk to you for a minute

Inseparable that's how we were
Through anything you were my world
I gave to you, you shared with me
For the love of you I give anything

I would chill wit you, you and your crew
Never complained 'bout the things you do
But I see it now, how it all went down
I can't take no more don't want you around

Never told me the whole truth
Never wishing that I knew the real you
How could you do this to me?
Never hurt so much, I see

Plans I made for you and me, they can't be
These are the last tears that you see from me

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't gonna cry no more
'Cause I'm sick of you hurting me 
I ain't gonna cry no more
Because you don't deserve me 
I ain't gonna cry no more
Pack your stuff up and leave
I ain't gonna cry no more
'Cause I'm tired of you,me,and she


And now I can't believe all the things you did
All your secret trips just to see your kids
What about the crib that I never been
'Cause that's the one that she lives in

But soon you see cause the man is not
In your love affair will soon be forgot
And you will miss me but I won't miss you
You can pull the key cause now we're through

Never told me the whole truth
Never wishing that I knew the real you
You didn't have to do what you did to me
Now you want her so now I see plans 

We made for you and me they can't be
These are the last tears that you see from me

[Chorus]

Used to think that you and me were in love
For sure but I was wrong cause you led me on
But now I found I'm cool without you around
You gotta bounce, I'm tired 

[Chorus]

I ain't gonna cry no more
'Cause I'm sick of you hurting me 
It's not the fact that it's your baby
I ain't gonna cry no more

But it's the fact that you lied
Because you don't deserve me 
And it hurt me
I ain't gonna cry no more

Pack your stuff up and leave
'Cause you don't mean me no good
I ain't gonna cry no more
'Cause I'm tired of you,me,and she

I'm sick of you
I'm through with you 
I'm done with you
I'm tired of your lies

Monica,"Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Oh, yeah
Oh oh

When I think of what I've done all the pain that I've brought
Baby, you should have walked out on me
And when I've turned away from you whenever there were hard times
How could you still be with me

And if it was no mistake when I hurt you that day
And went out with somebody new
But still you forgave me like it was so easy
I should have been better to you

Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not so easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through

And it's hard to believe after everything
That you're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
Thankful just bein' your girl

Never gave you my heart 'cause I never thought
You deserved any of me
I never told you how I felt when deep inside I knew that
You're really what I need

And I always gave you up whenever I saw
Something better come along
And right when I come back you're waitin' for me
And you welcome me home

Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not so easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through

And it's hard to believe after everything
You're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
Thankful just bein' your girl

And if it takes my whole life I'll make it up to you
'Cause I've been so cruel
And you've given your love to me in spite of everything
I-I don't deserve you

From this day forward I'm truly yours
But it took me a while to see
That we were meant for one another
Thank you for loving me

Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not so easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through

And it's hard to believe after everything
You're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world
Thankful just bein' your girl

Baby, it breaks my heart
To think that lovin' me is not so easy to do
And I don't mean to make it hard
Sorry for all the changes I put you through

And it's hard to believe after everything
You're still here right beside me
Wouldn't trade you for this whole world

Never had a mistress distressed before 
Come on ma, like it ain't that deep 
Like there ain't no love there like I don't hate that I gotta creep

This joint so crazy put the needle back on the record

Now listen, baby I'm a dirt bag

You so damn fine

And you betta not forget it, now don't sweat it
And we can really go at it, if you let it let's protect it

'Cause if the fight don't die before the sun rise
We may wake up on the wrong side

Time is ticking, my eyes are getting heavy
But I know we gotta squash this
Before it was popping, it's time for dropping
Copping attitudes right now

Nothings, nothing 'cause this ain't nothing
Don't you know that I love you?
So start to stopping, think about it
You'll see it's stupid

Argue about things so critical
And you heated over nothing and just hang up the phone
I want, wanna talk in the mood
See we need a resolution like that Aaliyah song

And all that equals up to is a fight

We may wake up on the wrong side

What time is it? I'm not on a mission
To stay up with you all night
It makes me so sick to my stomach
Every time we argue and fight

I mean it girl, my head gets lite, it just ain't right
I'm fed right up, please
It's 2:15 in the morning
There is no need

Argue about things so critical
And you heated over nothing and just hang up the phone
I want, wanna talk in the mood

I'm not trying to be mad at you
Why you make me wanna not fool with you?
Can't you see I'm tired girl?
Besides the fact it's a quarter past two
A girl like me got things to do
So let's see each others point of view

I think your wrong, you think your right
And all that equals up to is a fight

I place no one above you baby

Feels like nothing changed since we been together
I must admit that I feel crazy about you
And I can see it in your eyes 
That there something you want to say to me
Cause usually right now you would be holding onto me
But instead you're telling me that things 
Have changed they're not the same
And recently you found someone that you 
Decided to dedicate your whole life to
And what we had has to be through

And baby what hurts the most is letting go
I just want you to know that I love so
And I know things are different now 
You've gone and settled down
I thought for sure you'd always wait for me 
I tell you what hurts the most
Is that should have took the chance 
Boy when you came to me and offered me your hand
Silly of me I thought I would always have your heart
I had the chance to have all the love Oh how I'm missing you now

I hate that there's someone new coming in and taking my place
Doing the things we used to do and making love to you no
What am I supposed to do it's killing me that I want you'
And you should have known my love was true
And there no one else in this world for me but you

That runs the streets
But he treats me good
And he makes his dough illegally

That's how he's taking care of me
And I respect the fact that
He's chosen that life
But it keeps me up late at night

And I just can't spend my time
Wondering where he's at, is he okay?
I want to be by his side
But I commit a crime

I need to exclaim
I don't want to live that way

[Chorus]
I love my baby so
But he's not here no more
Hard for me to understand
So I wrote him this song
Couldn't look him in his eyes
Knew I couldn't change his mind
So I wrote this melody
And I'm singing sweet goodbye

Though he promised that he would never put me in harm's way
That's something that he can't control
'Cause the game remains the same
Now he says he wants out of here

But he's in too deep
And the only way that he will go is killing him or leaving me
So this is where I'm at and it hurts so bad
That I had to choose if I want to live, or die with you

[Chorus]

I tried to give him hope
And promised him my life
But I don't know what made him want to leave this life
And as he went away

The tears fell from my eyes
And there's no turning back
There's only goodbye

Don't you ever interrupt me when I'm listening to a Monica record

Yeah, straight out the slumming streets of A.T.L

Monica,"I didn't ask to go with you to Mexico
I really didn't need the shopping sprees in L.A. and Melrose
Boy if you didn't know it, well now you know
I didn't need the furs or the jewelry
Because material things they don't mean much to me
And ever since you've been gone
I've been holding us down on my own
You know

I never ever cheated
I never ever lied
So you can stop asking
Asking me why
Why I never left you
And why I've kept it real
And why I'm still with you

You should've known better than to think I would leave
You should've known better than to doubt me
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way I'm gonna be around
You should've known that I would stay by your side
You should've known your girl was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter if you're rich or poor
Out here doing five to ten
You should've known better

What makes you think that I would forget about you
Think about it, who comes to see you
Every Saturday and Monday I was on that receiver
It's me your girl, your life, your world
My family and friends, they just don't understand
They say I should leave you alone
But I say that they should all just leave us alone
Don't you get it?

I never every cheated
I never ever lied
So you can stop asking
Asking me why
Why I never left you
And why I've kept it real
And why I'm still with you

You should've known better than to think I would leave
You should've known better than to doubt me
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way I'm gonna be around
You should've known that I would stay by your side
You should've known your girl was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter if you're rich or poor
Out here doing five to ten
You should've known better

You should've known better than to think I would leave
You should've known better than to doubt me
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way I'm gonna be around
You should've known that I would stay by your side
You should've known your girl was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter if you're rich or poor
Out here doing five to ten
You should've known better",U Should've Known Better,2003
Monica,"If I told you
I'll be the one to make all your dreams true
If I gave you
All the things that make a man feel so good
If I need you
To come here before I give it to you
If I had to
I would change the world and make it feel love for you

[Chorus: x2]
If you do what say do
I promise we can do whateva'
You want to cause I want you
Say love me & I'm down 4 whateva'

Now that it's clear I hope you understand the way I'm feelin'
And now that you're here you can't stop thinking of what I want to hear
Now that it's true I can stop holdin' back and do what I do
And when we're through I lay in your arms and say I love you

I believe we can be
Whateva we want to no matter the dilemma
And I believe that you will see it may take forever
But we finally got together
And I believe it will be all about us cause baby I love you
And then they will see what we mean 
When we say we were together for eternity

[Chorus: x2]

Tell me what happens when you think of me
Do you think of the things I'm feeling
Cause when I see you I start trembling
My knees start shakin' just glad to be with you
Tell me your love will always be with me
Promise me you would never leave
And then take me where I want to be
Cause I need you baby, I'm needing you crazy (oh oh! I!)

Monica,"When I hear the children of today
They're questioning me the way
The way that they should live
I often wonder
Wonder what to do
To help them make it through
In a world that's gone astray

Open my heart to see
That it's up to me
Searchin' for the answers to these problems
I'm always facing things that are tryin' me
Testing all the things that I believe

Sometimes I feel so down
And no one here's around
But you, you never left me lonely
And now I see, what a true friend means
And I trust that you would always be here for me
Lord I give you all

Open my heart to see
That this lies with me
Searchin' for the answers to these problems
I'm always facing things that are tryin' me

Now I'm here before you
So tell me what to do

You're trying all that I need
The things I believe

Monica you ready, oh yeah
Man she look so good
Rolling through the hood
God bless the dead (bless the dead)
Jerry Wonder knock on wood
She was a ghetto queen, yeah
Turned into a fiend, yeah
Night I heard her scream
Similar to a nightmare dream, oh yeah (oh)

She was rock, she was pop
She was hip, she was hot
She was too fly for the block
It was her time, her time
So much dope on the streets
That I'm praying for peace
But the poor gotta eat
Talking bout my time
Everybody say it's my time, oh yeah

Baby girl, the world is yours, just look through
That open door, I'll be there for you
If you ever feeling blue (oh), it's a beautiful world

Baby boy, the world is yours, when you're sad
I'll be your joy, I'm still your friend
And I'm a love you till the end

Said he looks so real
When he was running on the football field
I love the cheerleader scream his name
Even in B-ball he had game
But didn't show up at the class reunion
And when I asked one of my girls what happened
That's when they told me he got life in prison
Caught up in the system
Trying to be a kingpin
The story never ever ends

He was rock, he was pop
He was hip, he was hop
He was too fly for the block
It was his time, it was his time (oh why, oh why, oh why)
So much dope on the streets
And I'm praying for peace
But the poor gotta eat
Talking bout my time, my time

I'll be your joy, I'm still your friend
And I'm a love you till the end (it's a beautiful world)

Baby girl, the world is yours, just look through
That open door, I'll be there for you
If you ever feeling blue (oh), it's a beautiful world

And I don't know much about English class
Math I didn't pass
Biology and chemistry
Was all a dream to me

I patiently wait for the bell
So I can see you after class
But now it's all in my pass

She was rock, she was pop
She was hip, she was hot
She was too fly for the block
It was her time, her time
So much dope on the streets
That I'm praying for peace
But the poor gotta eat
Talking bout my time
Everybody say it's my time, oh yeah

We got plans understand he want some children

You'se a cute picture

He's with me everywhere
And when I'm feelin' down 
He tells me baby stay up
He's always straight up and never will we break up
He'd call to say I love you that's how we'd make up
Trips to Jacob like a snow flaker
Shine so bright he make the dead wake up
Great lover know how to handle flavor
Keep my face sweaty till there's no more make up

It feels so good to be so in love and have someone right by your side

The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you

Every time you walk past, all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind ever time I get next to you

I think I'm falling in love with you
Baby, caught up in something that's moving so fast
Never been with nobody else
You and I tighter than the jeans on my ass
You remind me of this thing something like
R.Kelly singing 'bout a jeep
Boy, you're everything to me
And you're my your my property

Boy, you remind me, remind me of the ice on my ring
Boys, you remind me of this
(These are the makings of you
And it's true, these are the makings of you)

You remind me of the very first time
You remind me of the time we made love
Just like the twenty-fifth day of Christmas
Waiting for Santa Claus to show up
You got a heart of gold, baby; you should know
Baby, you remind me of so much
And, baby, you always stay on my mind
'Cause like my rims, you shine

Boy, you remind me of twenty-sixes on my ride
Completely spinning around, looking like a superstar
Boy, you remind me of how life's supposed to be
This is what you gon' buy me, and you're my property

Looking at you, looking at another, baby
I don't need another brother
Sex time around you
I feel the same my body
There's no pressure, baby
You know I keep it so real that I can't help you got the whip appeal
What's the deal?
Tell me how you feel
Could it be me?

Like the ice on my wrist, it's like kick on my hip
Mac in my lips, armor oil on my whip
Butter on my shrimp
I'm the Gladys, you the Pip
I keep my hair flipped the way you like to see me strip
Keep a money clip, you remind me of a tip
Like a pair of jeans from Ambercrombie when they rip
Like glass of wine, and every time I take a sip it's you

Boy, you remind me, remind me of by Gucci Shoes
Every time you walk past, all the girls be looking at you
You got style just like a Bentley Coupe
And I be losing my mind ever time I get next to you

Singing soul changed my world
Flipped my world upside down
I got lost and I couldn't be found
So much on my shoulders
And so much on my mind
Seems no one can help me
I think I just need some time

Sometimes I wish I could fly away
Looking for a place to getaway
Get away from all the heartache and pain
That life can bring
I really don't wanna sound
Like I can't stand my ground
But everybody need some time
That they can getaway

Sometimes I wish I was invisible
Cause then no one would know where I am
To ask me for anything
'Cause I've given so much of me
When is it time for me to receive
'Cause Monica has her needs
Who's gonna look out for me

Sometimes I wish I could fly away
Looking for a place to getaway

And I'm not made of steel

Not as easy as it seems

So don't call don't page don't follow

It's the 17th, one week before the day you were born
I been makin' big plans just for over a month
Tryin' to make this the best birthday you ever had
Show you that you're my baby

Damn, all this strain got me feelin' somethin's wrong
Pulled up to my gate, they keep sayin', ?He's gone?
Found envelopes in between my door
Biggest day got me panickin', what the hell this letter gonna read?

Hell no, you say you don't want it no more
Hell no, you say you can't give me what I want
Hell no, how you just gonna leave
When I stayed wit you through hard times and you cheated?

Hell no, I hate to say it but I need it
Hell no, God, please talk to me
Hell no, your so called love was so deep when it told you
You should run far and not give a damn about me

How could you leave me when you see me desperately
In need of what we had before? How could you leave home
I cried so many times but never did it cross my mind
To think but let it go, how could you leave home

Didn't even ever see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road before, how could you leave home
How could you leave me, baby? Please my heart is beating
For the beat we had before, how could you leave home

Now I need you, wanna laugh, wanna stand
Wanna get just one more chance just to see you
All my friends, all my kin say, ?Mo, just let that end?
But I breath you

In the driveway, I found pictures on the ground of our first date
I never in a million years thought this would be me
I'm trapped in love with somebody that no longer thinks
I'm somebody special, look at me

Hell no, you say you don't want it no more
Hell no, you say you can't give me what I want
Hell no, how you just gonna leave
When I stayed wit you through hard times and you cheated?

Hell no, I hate to say it but I need it
Hell no, God, please talk to me
Hell no, your so called love was so deep that it told you
You should run far and not give a damn about me

How could you leave me when you see me desperately
In need of what we had before? How could you leave home?
I cried so many times but never did it cross my mind
To think but let it go, how could you leave home?

Didn't even ever see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road before, how could you leave home?
How could you leave me, baby? Please my heart is beating
For the beat we had before, how could you leave home?

Monica and Twista, y'all

I remember when you said I couldn't get none of that
Then I remember when you let me hit it from the back
I remember we was young and sprung
And steady talkin' on the phone and how we both kept runnin' back

To each other, we were always together forever to the end
I don't really know why I froze up
Plannin' for a weddin' but gettin' married, it's scary
Now I got you cryin' 'cause a nigga didn't show up
Can't really tell you why but I'm Twista from the Chi
And I'm dyin' inside 'cause I know I really want you

So for leavin' one day, I will have to give you the answer, girl
But right now, I can't tell you why I left, girl
Sweet personality and good sex, girl
Fear will take a man life, you suppose to be my wife
Goodbye, hope to see you in the next world

You was all up under me, actin' like you was so in love
I was talkin' 'bout you but thug nigga, what you runnin' for?
Cop wit you in the Benz, you the first one seen on the block wit it
Took you to the club, showed you how to 'Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It'

You was bold when you wanna get some of that
When you wanna hit the hole like a running back
Then you left, now you wanna come runnin' back
Hell no, nigga, I don't wanna hear none of that

I know you quick, betta spit that shit to so
All I ever wanna say to you is
How could you leave me when you?
How could you leave me when you?

How could you leave me when you see me desperately
In need of what we had before? How could you leave home?
I cried so many times but never did it cross my mind
To think but let it go, how could you leave home?

Didn't even ever see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road before, how could you leave home?
How could you leave me, baby? Please my heart is beating
For the beat we had before, how could you leave home?

All the women I caught you with
Still I didn't leave but I didn't forget
All those women I caught you with
Maybe I didn't leave but I didn't forget

But I didn't leave but I didn't forget
All those women, women I caught you with
I didn't leave but I didn't forget

Spent too much time wondering how could you
(you do this to us while we we're in love) I guess I was thinking too much

I was thinking that the sex had your love
You never could get enough cause I kept it hot
I listen to you tell me your dreams
And your fears
I wiped your tears
I was there and this is why this is hurting me

Why her? Why her?
Did I get on your nerves?
Did I give you too much that you couldn't handle my love?
Why her? Why her?
Tell me what she was worth it, to make you put her first and deceive me.
You wanna come back but I gotta know (why her?)
I thought she was all that? Then why you at my door?

(but you didn't say nothing) All of alone fakin' it in front of me. Why?

I was thinking that the sex had your love
You never could care enough but you know I cant deny
I listen to you tell me your dreams
And your fears
I wiped your tears
I was there and it hurts me

Why her? Why her?
Did I get on your nerves?
Did I give you too much that you couldn't handle my love?
Why her? Why her?
Tell me what she was worth it, to make you put her first and deceive me.
You wanna come back but I gotta know (why her?)
I thought she was all that? Then why you at my door?
(Now look at you, look at us, what's all this for?
Hope you got the answers to my questions)
Why her?

Now ladies, y'all know I speak from experience right?
I used to look at him and wonder why.
Why her?
Yeah know what I'm saying?
But ladies, I learn not to worry about them living a happily ever after
Because that shit just build on a lie
So it should of fall
That's why I stand tall (baby, baby, baby)
I just looked at him and said this is why you

Why her? Why her?
Did I get on your nerves?
Did I give you too much that you couldn't handle my love?
Why her? Why her?
Tell me what she was worth, to make you put her first and deceive me.

And now where there was black and white I'm becoming iridescent

I got love all over me
Baby, you touch every part of me
I got love all over me
And I don't want to get it off
I'm completely covered up in your love

Before your love, baby, I was blinded
To think we painted--you took it from me
You showered me with a new beginning
Now I'm clean
Took me by surprise when you ran up on me
I came to life, baby, in that moment
You put your hands on my heart, baby
Now it beats

Now I got love all over me
Baby, you touch every part of me

Oh, oh ooh yeah, yeah

From the very second I laid eyes on you
In the mirror in that dressing room
Seeing you with me, I finally knew the picture was complete
I used to have my share of lonely days
Beneath the make up and the darkest shades
But baby since you came I know the meaning of true love again

It's not the bags or the trips or the clothes
It's not the fans or the sold-out shows
It's the way that you see through my soul
I'm so exposed

When I look at myself in the mirror
I don't have to feel ashamed
Now it couldn't be much clearer
I'll never have to search again

When I look at myself in the mirror
I don't even recognize
The girl I'm about to glitter
Cause now I sit by my side
When I look at myself in the mirror

No, nothing's ever gonna be the same
Forget the fortune, you can keep the fame
Baby if I had to choose, you know I'd trade it every time for you
Cause this reflection that I'm staring at
Is so amazing I can't turn my back
And every time I look at you and me together, boy, I know the truth, oh

From this very second I'm just saying that
You special enough for me to want to protect you, against you

I'm sure you did a lot of things
Before I got in the picture
Didn't you wait, don't tell me
I know you kissed a lot of girls
Told a lot of lies
Broke a few heats but listen
I ain't feel none of that last night when you held me
I just wanna believe that you
Met a girl who felt something different 
(different from all the other ones)
I believe that girl met you

Take a hand, take a leap
And do what most won't underštand

I'll be down if you tell me you can't
I'll learn to change my plans

Uh, settle down queen
I've been begging you forever just for now queen
When the time's right
Get your mind right

But for now queen
This is how it'll be
I could fully understand if you gotta leave
When the time's right
Get my mind right
I'ma get these dummy form around me
Got a past I'm ashamed of
Past full of danger
I can give you everything but a last name is sacred
All I ask is a chance that you take
And be safe with yourself and never lack any patience

Look, I lost my father to the bottle
I'd hug him everyday like I might not see him tomorrow
Got enough sorrow for a lifetime
'Cause when he was living I'm thinking how do I get him to listen
When he was seldom in his right mind
My early years I was too young to understand
But I remember the smell of beer and seeing all them empty cans
Waking up, crying in the night, hearing arguments
Hands off my momma, somehow knew he was the cause of it
Got a little older and he got a little worse
Drinking must be his remedy, he got a little cursed
Well, tell me what's the cure for a man who miss his pops

I would've grabbed a hold of your heart, and put your love in a bottle, hey

Wishing every day you were here with me
But now that you're gone, I lost my heart to the bottle, to the bottle

Yeah, I lost my father to the bottle
Functioning alcoholic's what they call it far as I know
Became a teenager and started to understand
But even through drinks he still taught me to be a man
So before the hospital, where the paramedics rushed him
Any and everybody who met him, instantly loved him
Ironic how conjure would have made him even sicker
'Cause who gon' tell him he can't drink none of his son's liquor
And tell me without my father how am I supposed to manage?
He had the biggest heart, but also had that liver damage
Tell me what's the cure for a man who miss his paps
The beat goes on, but the drinking' gotta stop!

If I had have known I wouldn't see you tomorrow
I would've grabbed a hold of your heart, and put your love in a bottle, hey
But now you got me drunk off that pain, gone off that sorrow
Wishing every day you were here with me
But now that you're gone, I lost my heart to the bottle, to the bottle

Not a day goes by that I don't miss you, and don't wish you were here with me
No matter what you did, I forgive you!

I lost my father to the bottle
Tell your parents you love 'em
You might not see 'em tomorrow!
I swallow my pride, try to put my problems aside
But I feel so hollow inside
Gotta keep my eyes on the prize
'Cause I'm steady wishing you were here
To see the goals that I plan to reach
You left the day after I put you in my Grammy speech
It's almost like you waited just to see me win
Well, pops I can't wait until the day we meet!

If I had have known I wouldn't see you tomorrow
I would've grabbed a hold of your heart, and put your love in a bottle, hey
But now you got me drunk off that pain, gone off that sorrow

Build a house for 10 mil on your own land
And showed your best friend how to build her own brand
Have you ever seen a street nigga slow dance
In a white tux with a live band playing
It's like the new Gucci talking to the old Gucci
Gotta have 20 M's to see what I'm saying
Who'd ever think I'd get this far, I was just trappin'
Who ever thought I'd get this rich when I started rapping
This make a street nigga stand up and start clapping
I never thought I'f feel this way but then God happened

We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride
We ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride, we ride, we ride
We ride
We ride
Even when it don't go right, even when the shit goes left
Even when my arms can't fight we ride

Get somebody that gon' ride for you
Even when I lose my breath
Who gon' die for you
Even if I hurt myself
Who gon' cry for you
Even if it means my life, we ride

Monica,"As I met 2 Chainz a few minutes ago
As I gazed into his face, I felt that I was in the presence of royalty
There's a certain power presence that he gives off

I tried to be, everything you want and need

'Cause you got a deep title don't mean that you deep
Substance shallow on shit creek, I heard Cole speak
About the bricks, Kendrick got Compton lit
And I've been lit ever since I sold nicks
Never fabricated about my fabric, the scale, that's my apparatus
I give a fuck about the sorriest rappers
This actually happened, path in the back pathogenic
Moved that blow out like we were afrocentric
I had a front row entry, I had the codeine kidney
I made up the Bentiaga truck, you owe me a Bentley
This the rap Ken Griffey, got at least 10 with me
Got at least 10 on me, I'm anti-phony
My girl anti-bony and she get that money
I bought all this shit, don't go acting anti on me
It's Mr. Epps in the bank, I give a F what you think
I bought a Tesla today, there's nothing left in your tank
I did everything except a fucking song with Jay
But I murdered every song I fucking did with Ye
See my verses are better and my subject is realer
See my mom was an addict and my dad was the dealer
And their son is that nigga, I'm no Black activist
I'm a Black millionaire, give you my Black ass to kiss
We used the tree for a fence, I used to land in the trench
Used to dust myself off, then I eat me some shrimp
Coulda did anything, I coulda been me a pimp
I coulda went to the league, I took it straight to the rim
I took it straight to the block, I got Xans in my sock
I got plans for the pot, I got bands, you do not, huh

Yeah, you a miracle
Right now, if you hear this, you're a miracle, I want you to know that
If you're able to hear this right now, you are a miracle
Straight up, no kapp

I'm more Gucci than Vans, give you a Gucci advance
This the chance of your life, you ain't prepared for your life
See the man without a mic is just a mic gimmick
Anyone, Jordan, Jackson, Tyson, Bivens
Phone number unlisted
Gave her the digits to a number that is long distance
She on the wrong mission and got my palm itching
I had it on me, you can see it in my prom pictures, ugh

I'm telling you, niggas like me fall out the sky
You don't just bump into me
I'm a real blessing, bro, nah, for real, bro

You know the times is rough, you know the times is hard
I never trust my neighbors, so we got burglar bars
You know the times is rough you know the times is hard
I never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars, Lord, yeah, okay
You know the times is rough you know the times is hard
I never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars
You know the times is rough you know the times is hard
I never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars, Lord, Lord

Woke up today, gave thanks
Grateful to see another day, then the storm came
As the night falls, I shed my blood, sweat and tears
Let the rain fall, let it fall, let it fall
One day
Your love will take me right over the stars, Lord knows

That soulful trap music, man
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout Section 8, I'm talkin' 'bout the 'partments
You stay in the middle, someone stay on top of you, someone stay below you

Monica Blaire,"El silencio era perfecto, la complicidad honesta
La risa galopante, y el desborde constante
De dos personas que buscaban el abrigo
El abrazo de una conversación en la cercanía del camino
Nada es tan complejo, solo un amigo
Un amigo que te ayuda a cruzar el rio
Un amigo cercano, y un amigo lejano
Un amigo que se perdió la honestidad del plano
Todos tenemos miedos, quizás seremos viejos
Quizás nos encontremos cuando el viento nos sople por su aliento
Quien sabe, quien tendrá, quizás el sol, o quizás un cambio de realidad
Quien conoce la textura, y su locura
Ese torbellino que nos mueve en su fisura
Nada es tan correcto, pues nada es tan perfecto
Nada es tan constante, y eso es lo mas honesto
Lo mas honesto es que perdimos algo
Algo se nos escapo, se nos fue de las manos
Mientras tanto, quien sabe, tocaras la puerta
Un cafe, te acuerdos de las anécdotas
Cuando soñábamos tanto ser adultos
Escuchábamos música, imaginábamos juntos
Cruzar la y ver otro continente
Que nos paso? estamos tan ausentes! 
Quizás crecimos, quizás no somos los mismos
Quizás el silencio nos sople por su abismo
Quizás cambiamos, y parece que cambiamos
Pero ya sabes, en cualquier momento soñamos

What changed, one and the same
I don't know your name, or who you are
Tell me we changed, differently
Different things, who you are? 
Quizás, quizás, quizás
Where could I be with you? 
Summer time, late in night, chilling, uh
Sounds so, good to me, but now it looks like it will never be

Vivir era sencillo, reirse era típico
Solíamos mirar el mundo con ojos de niños
Todo fluía y todo corría
Entre preguntas que eran parte de un alimento
Que nos nutria y que nos unía
Entre dudas y pocas respuestas
Me pregunto si como yo, sigues buscando esa puerta
Buscando esa cosa invisible 
De composición armónica, de luz tan vital
Donde estarás, que harás quizás
Tu también este segundo te acordaras
Quizás nos veremos en un cambio solar
Quizás estarán las arrugas que nos harán recordar
Incluso perdonar lo que dijimos sin pensar
Quizás entre tantos errores volvamos a soñar
Nada es tan correcto, pues nada es tan perfecto
Ningún árbol crece en su corteza tan recto 
Sabes, felicidad no tiene un solo sentido
Solo tomamos caminos distintos, dividimos
Tantas tangentes y tantas lineas
Tantas espinas hechas solo para una vida

Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Monica Borrfors,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1996

Monica Dominique,"Nu lyser ängarna av sommarns alla blommor
Nu surrar bin, och fåglar sjunger överallt
Nu stryker vinden genom trädens höga kronor
men i min trädgård är det visset, mörkt och kallt
Här är det risigt och förvuxet, fult och snårigt
och lika hopplöst trist och grått som i mitt bröst
Därute doftar det av sommarns alla dofter
Där är det sommar, men härinne är det høst

Jag levde lycklig här med dig och mina katter
ett liv i synd och utan omsorg att bli frälst
Försonad med min karaktär, för jag har aldrig
förmått at säga nej till någonting som helst
Och aldrig nekat mig det ena eller andra
och levat livet, tills jag krossades en dag
Det börja med att du bedrog mig med en anna
en som du sa mar mycket finare än jag

Vårt gräl tog veckor, ropen blandades med gråten
och jag blev grundligt jämförd med din fina vän
tills du bekände att han givit dig på båten
Då blev det dödstyst här i trädgården igen!
Ifrån den stunden var den mannen dubbelt hatad
Han hade lekt med dig, med oss et litet slag
Och jag, jag kände det som även jag var ratad
Jag ville slåss, och gick mot mitt livs nederlag

Jag hade hammaren beredd under kavajen
när han kom ut i sidenscarf och sa: God dag
Kom in och slå dig ner en stund, så får vi prata
Jag bare stammade, nu minns jag inte vad
Och jag blev bjuden på cognac och på cigarrer
och kunde inte få mig till att säga nej
Och när vi skildes var vi bästisar och bundis
och jag tog saker som du glömt med hem till dig

Jag går omkring i mitt Pompeji, bland ruiner
jag trampar runt i resterna utav vårt liv
Men du skall aldrig ge mig pikar om sekiner
och aldrig skall du bli en annans tidsfördriv
Nej, åt det gamla skall vi binda vackra kransar
och ta vårt liv och mina katter som de är
Och trots all kärleks brist och trasighet och fransar
Dig skall jag älska livet ut, dig har jag kär!",Trubbel,2008

But know your breakthrough’s not far away

You are too close to give up now
You have so much to live for
Remember what you prayed for
Hold on, please don’t let go in this season
Know that flowers bloom when rain falls
You just hold on

You ask when will this go away
Know that God can feel your pain
Believe He’ll never fall short of His word
Sometimes we forget that He holds us His hands
But I’m reminding you don’t give up

Your skies may look dim and grey
But know your breakthrough’s not far away

I know you’re praying for a change
To see a sunny day
Nothing good has come your way for so long
You need someone to understand this place your heart is in
You just want to dream again and believe

I’ve been where you are
Almost at the breaking point in my life
I know you say it’s impossible
But you’ve got to hang on cause it’s just about over

All of your dreams
All of your desires are coming to pass
So I’m telling you don’t lose your faith
Hold on to His word don’t give up

Your skies may look dim and grey
But know your breakthrough’s not far away

I know you’re praying for a change
To see a sunny day
Nothing good has come your way for so long

Monica Hatch,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1995

Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you

I'll find other charms

Monica Lander,"Si supieras,
Que aún dentro de mi alma,
Conservo aquel cariño
Que tuve para ti
Quién sabe si supieras
Que nunca te he olvidado,
Volviendo a tu pasado
Te acordarás de mí

Los amigos ya no vienen
Ni siquiera a visitarme,
Nadie quiere consolarme
En mi aflicción
Desde el día que te fuiste
Siento angustias en mi pecho,
Decí, percanta, 
Qué has hecho e mi pobre corazón?

Sin embargo,
Yo siempre te recuerdo
Con el cariño santo
Que tuve para ti
Y estás en todas partes,
Pedazo de mi vida,
Y aquellos ojos que fueron mi alegría
Los busco por todas partes
Y no los puedo hallar

Al cotorro abandonado
Ya ni el sol de la mañana
Asoma por la ventana
Como cuando estabas vos,
Y aquel perrito compañero,
Que por tu ausencia no comía,
Al verme solo el otro día
También me dejó",La Cumparsita,1994
Monica Lander,"Corrientes tres cuatro ocho, segundo piso, ascensor,
No hay porteros ni vecinos, adentro cocktel de amor.

Pisito que puso Maple, piano, estera y velador,
Un telefono que contesta, una fonola que llora,
Viejos tangos de mi flor y un gato de porcelana pa que No maulle el amor.

Y todo a media luz, que es un brujo el amor,
A media luz los besos, a media luz los dos.
Y todo a media luz, crepsculo interior,
Que suave terciopelo la media luz de amor.

Juncal doce venticuatro, telefonea sin temor,
De tarde te con masitas, de noche tango y amor,
Los domingos t danzante, los lunes desolacin.

Coco, alfombras que no hacen ruido y mesa puesta al amor...",A Media Luz,1994
Monica Lander,"Uno busca lleno de esperanzas
el camino que los sueÃ±os
prometieron a sus ansias...
Sabe que la lucha es cruel y es mucha
pero lucha y se desangra
por la fe que lo empecina.

Uno va arrastrÃ¡ndose entre espinas
y en su afÃ¡n por dar su amor...
Sufre y se destroza hasta entender,
que uno se quedo sin corazÃ³n...

Precio de castigo que uno entrega
por un beso que no llega
o un amor que lo engaÃ±o,
vaciÃ³ ya de amar y de llorar
tanta traiciÃ³n...

Si yo tuviera el corazÃ³n,
el mismo que perdÃ­;
si olvidara a la que ayer
lo destrozo,
y pudiera amarte,
me abrazarÃ­a a tu ilusiÃ³n
para llorar tu amor.

Pero Dios te trajo a mi destino
sin pensar que ya es muy tarde
y no sabrÃ© como quererte,
dÃ©jame que llore como aquel
que sufre en vida
la tortura de llorar
su propia muerte.

Buena como eres salvarias
mi esperanza con tu amor...
Uno esta tan solo en su dolor,
uno esta tan ciego en su penar...

Pero un friÃ³ cruel que es peor
que el odio, punto muerto
de las almas, tumba horrenda
de mi amor, maldijo para siempre
y me robo... toda ilusiÃ³n...

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

I wanna go and bounce the moon

Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

wish you were here to warm this night.

seems like a year 
since you've been out of my sight.

But soon I'll kiss you hello
at our front door,
and dear heart I want you to know
I'll leave your arms nevermore.

Monica Mancini,"Love is storm and wind and tide,
all the tears your heart can hold,
But I look back after Loss of love 
and know the days were gold.

I see on fly shattered skies;
not a ray of light to find,
But I look back after Loss of love 
and sunlight blinds my mind.

Songs were sung with words as young as May,
But in the midst of summer, winter came;
A chill blew out the flame,
Now the words of haunted songs 
ring as clear as they did then.

Still I look back after Loss of Love,
and live to love again,
live to love again.

Monica Mancini,"Where has my love gone?
How can I go on?
It seems dear love has gone away.

Where is my spirit?
I'm nowhere near it,
Oh yes, my love has gone astray.

But I'll blame it on the sun,
The sun that didn't shine,
I'll blame it on the wind and the trees.

I'll blame it on the time that never was enough,
I'll blame it on the tide and the sea,
But, my heart blames it on me.

Who poured the love out?
What made this bitter doubt?
Is peace not here for me to see?

Wish I could tell you,
But, words won't come for me to speak.

But I'll blame it on the sun,
That didn't fill the sky,
I'll blame it on the birds and the trees.

I'll blame it on the day that ended once too soon,
I'll blame it on the nights that could not be,
But, my heart blames it on me.

Esta noche de luna en celo 
Con ganas te daría 
Esa cosa que va enredando 
Tu vida con la mía 
Como algo mágico (siempre) 

Tú, 
Amando locamente tú 
Bandera de rebelde juventad 
Quiero ser libre como tú 

Despertar en el alba mojada 
Por el agua de un sueño estremecida 
Oy! Mira cómo tira a ser tan romántica 

Ocultar las ojeras de anoche 
Why en el párpado un brillo de purpurina 
Oy! Mira como tira a ser tan auténtica
En la flor de tus quince años 
Brotó la fantasía 
Why a los veinte mordí su fruta 
Abierta en una orgía 
De amor why vértigo (siempre) 

Tú,

You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy

How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Oh, Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""Let's run and we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away""

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there, all around the square
Sayin', ""Catch me if you can""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, ""stop""

Hey, Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye, sayin', ""don't you cry
I'll be back again someday""

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

He isn't good, he isn't true

Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms

What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

Monica Zetterlund,"Nu lyser ängarna av sommarns alla blommor
Nu surrar bin, och fåglar sjunger överallt
Nu stryker vinden genom trädens höga kronor
men i min trädgård är det visset, mörkt och kallt
Här är det risigt och förvuxet, fult och snårigt
och lika hopplöst trist och grått som i mitt bröst
Därute doftar det av sommarns alla dofter
Där är det sommar, men härinne är det høst

Jag levde lycklig här med dig och mina katter
ett liv i synd och utan omsorg att bli frälst
Försonad med min karaktär, för jag har aldrig
förmått at säga nej till någonting som helst
Och aldrig nekat mig det ena eller andra
och levat livet, tills jag krossades en dag
Det börja med att du bedrog mig med en anna
en som du sa mar mycket finare än jag

Vårt gräl tog veckor, ropen blandades med gråten
och jag blev grundligt jämförd med din fina vän
tills du bekände att han givit dig på båten
Då blev det dödstyst här i trädgården igen!
Ifrån den stunden var den mannen dubbelt hatad
Han hade lekt med dig, med oss et litet slag
Och jag, jag kände det som även jag var ratad
Jag ville slåss, och gick mot mitt livs nederlag

Jag hade hammaren beredd under kavajen
när han kom ut i sidenscarf och sa: God dag
Kom in och slå dig ner en stund, så får vi prata
Jag bare stammade, nu minns jag inte vad
Och jag blev bjuden på cognac och på cigarrer
och kunde inte få mig till att säga nej
Och när vi skildes var vi bästisar och bundis
och jag tog saker som du glömt med hem till dig

Jag går omkring i mitt Pompeji, bland ruiner
jag trampar runt i resterna utav vårt liv
Men du skall aldrig ge mig pikar om sekiner
och aldrig skall du bli en annans tidsfördriv
Nej, åt det gamla skall vi binda vackra kransar
och ta vårt liv och mina katter som de är
Och trots all kärleks brist och trasighet och fransar
Dig skall jag älska livet ut, dig har jag kär!",Trubbel,2008
Monica Zetterlund,"I dim all the lights and I sink in my chair.
The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air.
The walls of my room fade away in the blue,
And I'm deep in a dream of you.

The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend;
You come to my arms, may this bliss never end,
For we love anew just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you.

Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing,
We glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing
That I'm soon revealing my love for you over again.

A little something called ""Doing Our Own Dang""
Breaking the beat others wished they broke
Bass line so dope that you just might choke
Don't bite off something that you can't chew
And don't trail behind when I'm coming through
Fronting the feel that you really can't feel
Cause you're trying to feel what's on my reel to reel

About the group, how to be smooth and play funky

For we are beyond the stereotypes
Coordination crazy, but still it sounds hype
Rocking on and off beat, and I do believe I'm right (You're right)
Am I wrong? (Yeah, son)

I'll try to listen good and give the best advice that I can give
so, what's up with you this time?
Your honey took a dive and now he's playin with your mind?
Oh no, this can not be accepted
The feelings that belong to you must be protected
Hold up, time out, I shout, get it together sister
Tell him to be nice or ditch the mister

It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!

Get back on your feet please
I'm beggin you to check out all your own needs
Don't let nobody see you in a state of grievin, over the brother
there's another possibility
Which is for you to work out where you went wrong
I guarantee to you that it will not take long
For you to make your mind up if the two of you belong
You know where honey's head at, and where he's comin from
Get it out your system, don't be another victim
This took the nerve, oh boy, he really picked em, whaddya know
It's time for you to show you're not sleepin
A progress report on the two of you, you're keepin
Peekin through the peephole, to see if honey's sneakin
You estimated right, that night the other weekend
Collectively the facts should conclude the decision
You caught the brother in a terrible disposition

It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!

That's it, pack it up, be wise my sister
cause the facts keep stackin up, tell him, to kiss the you know what
Make sure the door is shut, behind you
I do believe the brother's out of luck, and stuck
But that's not, your P-are-O-be	-L-E-M
You gotta let him go and let him know this is the end
You've been kissed, dissed, listed as a dumb one
I hope he likes sad songs, he's gonna hum one
He's been a dumb dumb and that's the way it is forever
There comes a time, when you're at the end of your tether
and you know, I think you went FAR beyond that
So it was bound to backtrack
And smack you with an irksome vengeance as it attacks you
Makin sure you get the full entire view
of who's to blame, at the end, of the game
Things will never be the same
And it's a cryin shame

It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!

I scrunched up the letter you wrote me in lunch
In 5th period I pay no notice to your motion
My work is on the table, my pen's in locomotion
Every time I turn around, you're looking at my face

Sitting three seats back, and I'm a walk over to him
And give him the letter I wrote
Because my feelings towards him are brewing, ya know?

I said ""Yo why you trying to ride me?""
Day in and day out I can't seem to get you off my back
What do you think I should do about that?
In fact it's embarrassing, what a bufoon
You even follow me in the ladies bathroom
Give me a break, I can't take it, the stakes are too high
Besides, there goes the other brother
I'm not Keith Sweat, so don't sweat me
The other brother's smooth approach is what gets me
He intruiges the Mon you know
So I suggest the course towards me you blow
You're wasting time pursuing Monie
Cause she's pursuing the lover only

Go for what you know, Mo, yo

Bringing matters to a close and everybody knows
That I'm no longer in the middle
I made my decision, precisely, precision is a must
For me to solve another riddle
Step into a brand new rhythm, ism schisms
Nope, I'm not with 'em, I've given
My undivided attention, you know what I'm saying?
No type of games I'm playing when

Mothers all over the world stop look alert
A lot of things are tryna meddle with your work
From the day you give birth your time becomes a little less
You got a permanent job in which there'll be no rest
You have to keep an eye open 'cause there's far too much to contend with
Hope you got a good partner you can go round the bend with
You have to accept that to a certain extent
Your private life is at a halt yep it's a true commintment
Well the horse is through the gate get ready now 'cause here they come
What you teach your child determines what they will become
How much your child is worth to you to this there is no digit
Brothers like Ed O G said be a father can you dig it?
I write this here song to express my sentimentality
And help to encourage some to wake up to reality
Of why your parents boss you around like indeed they do
I only understand because I'm now a parent too

[Verse 2]
What a world what a world that we live in
People try to steal your babies and drugs is what is given
To a child by a child it's the style ain't it wild
Collectively the facts ain't a lot to make you smile
But s smile does exist among the dirt and the mist
It happens when the angel in your life is kissed
And loved and hugged and cherished and cared for
When the wounds of the world are sore
Hearts are breakin' hearts are breakin' can you see it
Being strong is must and we're too busy tryna be it
Staring out into a scum-filled a world with disgust
Define the line between success and gettin' left back in the dust
Opposition that arises you know we have to get over
And listen to those not only wiser but also older
Turn our children into responsible men and ladies
And to the cops stop beatin' on our babies

Chorus (2x)

I didn't bring a child into this world for politicians
Trippin' on each other starting wars and causing friction
Makin' life a little harder for those strugglin' to cope
Bring a cease towards your fighting instead of the people's hope
It's easy for the powers that be to make decisions
Tell you to get on with get on with who gave you the permission
Sending the youth that we produce to help you score
I don't see any of your kids so fight your own wars
As to discrimination little ones don't know the meaning
Unless we separate they could be on the same team
And it's okay to teach your child all their history
Until it somehow slowly develops to bigotry
Pass up opportunities to segregate the space
Think about the children's future make this world a better place
Before decide to act wild
Remember everybody is somebody else's child

All in due time, well my time is right now

One that will never try to desert of defy me
So who are you to tell me how to run my family
I can plan it by myself, I need nobody planning me
'Cause yeah I might be young, but my stability's correct

So tell me what do the kids learn at school
How to pack a pistol, how to play a class fool
Then they blame the parents when the kid plays hooky
Subject to getting shot is something that I wouldn't want to be
Maybe it is safer to stay within your home
Protecting yourself from getting a bullet within your dome
It's something to think about, the word safe
I often wonder if there exists such a place
Whether on a bus, a train, or plain walkin'
You're subject to the devious ones that might be hawkin'
I'll teach my child to respect every day as a blessing
And follow the path of her future lesson by lesson

So ask me again if I need ghetto assistance
There's food on my table and my baby's not wearing piss pants
I could teach my child more at home that you could ever
Corrupt the youthful mind I produce, that will be never
This one will learn from me, the other babies too
'Cause what you teach is censorship, I want to teach what's true
So bother me not with our by the book method

Wearing holey pants and always reading Marvel comics
Never used deodorant, clothes were always soiled
Instead of body lotion, Rick used the Crisco oil
Never had a hair cut, breath was always stenching
Used to try to catch me sitting on the school bench and
Speaking to me, stinking to me, killing all the flowers
Wish I had a Certs in my pocket, he could devour
Now he's out the projects, no longer a resident
Heard his father died and left him crazy dead presidents
Seen the brother yesterday, pulled up in a Beamer
Looked me up and down and said ""are you still a primadonna?""
I said no, I'll get with you if you want me
You're looking kinda buttermilk biscuit, on the money
No need for him to sweat, 'cause you got my respect
He's living kinda greasy, yep he got himself correct

[Verse 2]
Jimmy was a stick, Toothpick is what they called him
Never combed his hair, which is why his mother balled him
Used to stick up kids going home from other schools
Till somebody beat him down, flipped his butt and changed the rules
He was back around the way being someone else's Joey
Because he was bald they named him Obi Wan Kenobi
He said yo Imo be a rap star one day
They said shut your yellow teeth get me a forty okay
Well slap me upside my head, there go Jimmy
And there go all them brothers sayin' gimme gimme gimme
I see him on the box almost every other day
Ricochet from the down and out, butter up today
He made it to the top, to this there was no misdemeanor
And on Jimmy's side, you know the grass was always greener
So hop, skip and jump for the twinkle, not a deadbeat
Because he knew exactly how to rock the greasy beats

[Verse 3]
Knew a kid cursed with the kiss of being bummy
Never got any play, didn't find it very funny
He looked so scary and his head going bald
Liked to give us all his number, but nobody ever called
His name was Vom Boogie 'cause he's always throwing up
Loved to drink himself sick, never thought he'd ever stop
Used to like to wear socks all the way up to his knees
And he kept tryna talk to my girl Bonita B.
I saw Bonita B. just a few moments ago
Riding round inside a Lexus, acting like she didn't know
Who I was standing there, that's alright 'cause she's a sucker
If he wasn't living greasy she wouldn't be with the brother
Count yourself lucky that you caught when you did
I might still talk to him regardless who he's with
'Cause he looking kinda butter, and I think he could please med
Because he's living way beyond fat, he's living greasy",Greasy,1993
Monie Love,"[Verse 1]
Who ever said that you couldn't succeed
When your heart bleeds you need on your knees and you begging please
And if it ever came your way it be a better day
And if it don't, don't give up hope and continue to pray
I know I've had my fair share of despair honey
I wouldn't give up on the mere thought of mo' money
So this is what I did I forbid
The attitude that'll get ya
suckered out of a picture
I never saw myself as some kinda hero
So listen up because your time could be near yo
Quitters never win winners never quit
If you don't believe in yourself nobody else will do it

[Verse 2]
The very young can be blinded
Thinking what they find is an easy way out
It's road that escapes the clout
Well think again because there's prices on another level
a faster route and now your foot is layin' on the pedal
When did your heart decide that you could just settle for less
Don't you know in your category you were truly blessed
I think you suffered a severe loss of self-esteem
And now it seems your whole life is a movie scene
You're still a rompa you can change if you really want to
Double back recollect when you turned the wrong corner
Don't be content until you meet your demands
You can do it blood you can be a much better man

[Verse 3]
I had some lucky circumstances but I had to work
Amidst the possibility of maybe gettin' jerked
But I'm here ain't I and I'm in the mix too
That demonstrates how much a strong heart and mind can do
So please don't become a victim of pessimism
Keep your goals to yourself nobody messing with 'em
Keep your mind straight from those who want to dictate
The spam of your intelligence they seem to underrate
It's a form of oppression that they demonstrate
And nine times out of ten they're guarded by a false plate
Never give up individual dreams
of your future state and determine your own fate

[Verse 4]
Suckas that speak on a tracky technique
Choose to preach on a sub-level spewing evil of the devil
You gotta check it disconnect it to the minimal 
Speaking tongues under drums like a subliminal
Figure that you gotta kiss before you kick
and every trick will then stick without licks you it's over dick
You didn't touch me then you don' t touch me now
Believing in the power of myself, I know how",I'm a Believer,1993
Monie Love,"[Verse 1]
I'm glad heaven allowed me to be saved
The sidewalk to forever for me has been paved
I live a little passion every day I'm in your presence
And when I'm away I carry with me your very essence
I try to imagine a scenario without you
It doesn't happen 'cause my mind never doubts you
My admiration is in awe of your persona
Your plateau is high, everything else is much lower
How do I explain to you with lack of complication
Speaking to one who fills me up with exhilaration
I mean what I say, you know I really do
I'm just trying to say, in a word of 2
I love you

Chorus:

In a word or 2, I love you
Everything you do

[Verse 2]
Sacrifice is a word that's second nature
You give more than you take, it's hard for somebody to hate ya
Dream a little longer, I can penetrate your visions
Beauty lies within your thoughts to stay is what I'm wishin'
I love the way the world around you quivers but you float
Also how other people get frustrated but you won't
The way you relax while the world is so intense
I'm so much in love with you that sometimes it don't make sense
You please me in every way and I'll never make amendments
You are my teacher, I'll always be in attendance
I'd like to commend you for all the things I see you do
In a world or 2, I'd like to say I love you

Chorus 2:

In a word or 2, I love you
Everything you do
When I'm in your arms
There's no place I'd rather be
Stormy weather come
Oh, you go right through me

[Verse 3]
How can I even begin to thank you enough
The life I'd live if I didn't have you, it would be tough
I shudder to think of how empty my heart would feel
If you should disappear and none of this was ever real
I feel a quiet comfort when I am within your arms
You make all my stormy weather become a gentle calm
I wish to never be separated from such a bliss
The warmth of your touch, the motion of your kiss
I wish to never lose sight of the smile within your face
It's you or nothin', baby, you could never be replaced
So to let you know before I go, before I'm through
In a word or 2, I love you

Chorus 3:

In a word or 2, I love you
Baby, I really do
L-o-v-e you",In a Word or 2,1993
Monie Love,"Gotta let a woman be	 a woman (2x)

[Verse 1]
Don't touch the merchandise you got it honey
You're standing here see me coming you try to puff out your money
And I sure don't give a toss about the car you drive
Whether Benz 500 SL or a banger five
So let me pass without a convo 'cause I'm not into
Your rap is kickin' boomin' a system with no rhytm to it
And I'll be mighty obliged if you just step to the side
And move your sorry frontin' butt before I run right through it
You think I'm fresh, O well best you'll never get to hear
and I got money in a bank account also my dear
So I don't need you hanging round to be my sugar daddy
So you can paddy on that paddy wagon but without me and you can...

Let a woman be	 a woman

[Verse 2]
Coming through coming through make my way my tank is full
Like Sald and Pepa said my cow died I don't need ya bull
So keep your skiving and conniving kindly to yourself
Nobody asked you for a statement stick it on a shelf
'Cause Ima make it to the top to this there is no doubt
By my talent no stoppin' stones that's what it's all about
You can consider what you want 'cause I don't give a bit
A lot of things are blowin' up and you ain't part of shit
Go sing your boo boo song your life's a loser's drama
This chick is truly not with it so save it for your mama
Gettin' paid stayin' paid yep it is my way of life
I'm cuttin' through this funky rhythm as sharp as a knife
Your trashy talk is not romantic so get out my face
The litter of your loins is scattered up and down the place
So you can pucker up and kiss this here funky behind
I got to full cheeks I'll take you 2 at a time

Let a woman be	 a woman

[Verse 3]
Kickin' up a fuss cuss cuss you're full o' puss
We're the underground legionnaires you ain't part of us
All you do is complain all about the women's role
Little do you know it's climbing on the voter's poll
Babblin' babblin' babblin' babblin' but not sayin' nothin'
Bring a cease to all your speech punk and quit the bluffin'
On this groove I'll be as funky as I want to be
So step off you little Chuck D wannabe
You can pop all that junk but keep it out my face
Make a move towards me and you will be erased
Stoppin' to a brother's level no I'm not sucker
'Cause when you lay down with dogs you catch fleas motherfucker",Let a Woman B a Woman,1993
Monie Love,"[Verse 1]
Low and behold there's a story to be told
of a sister who missed a plane
Destiny was rearranged
I never knew that I would be in this position
Makin' money makin' music makin' a complete transition
But hey in here yeasterday, today and tomorrow
forever after that because none of my shit is borrowed
Cleverly constructed my flairs abundant
Developed from hangin' with all the roughnecks back in London
Pogo swiftly gets biznizz done with no parkin'
in a mellow manner cookies on the side sparkin'
Flavour la treacherous few will do you lovely
So don't run around playin' with you like you know money
Blessed when the Lord snipped my microphone cord
And said rock it any way you can you got the whole world in your hand
I made amendments to achieve my inner passion
Makin' performances in musical fashions
Check it out hypocritical subjects playin' like
Primadonna before they knew who I was yet
It's alright 'cause my rhyme will pack a fist full
Personification, smile, metaphor list full
Blissful is the interpretation I deliver
Make you quiver, make you kidneys dance all around your liver
I'm a giver of lyrical sex to your ear drum
Come all ya faithful to the record store and get some
Soul seasones with the future of the funk
It's not hard to find I stand out from the junk
Push a punk to oblivion spin 'em 'til they're dizzy and die
I won't be at that funeral 'cause I'm busy
Don't try to injust me suicidal you must be
If you suddenly develop the urge to cuss me
A lus will be given if correct is how you livin'
And the rhymes you recite are yours, not given

[Verse 2]
Sucka A sucka be	 sucka see or you talking 'G'
Or should I say pea brain no better yet shit-for-brains
You want to save somebody save your bloddy self
It's grievous to see a waste of human tissue go to hell
Appointing yourself to be lord of the premises
When you look like death warmed up and you smell of piss
Hiss hiss hiss there a kiss of death coming
In your direction so you better start running
Doubleups of original creations
Is taking over rapidly false duplication
Artists that are supposed to be self-acclaimed
Tapping into other artists' domain
It's a bore to the brain blahblahblahblahblahblahblah
Shut the hell up I can't understand a word you're sayin'
I buy too and for what the hell I'm payin'
Check yourself before you point the finger and start slayin'
Method bottom pit used by emcee we ain't shit
Is the scraping of the barrel 'cause they're full of it
Yesterday's news tomorrow's forgotten thought
And how in the hell are you gonna pay for the shit you bought
Just like you I'm in it for self
Do whatever it takes whether you or someone else
it is amazing how the human mind works
Find somebody that you feel you can jerk
You should have never let yourself get talked into this one
Fuck around and your ass won't be a missed one
When it comes to the crunch on a lyrical basis
I pass with flying colors you might as well face this
I don't even want to go on with this nonsense
You're just a repetitionist baby no contest
War with me and you'll wish you'd never been born
I'll shut your ass up quick and put a muscle on ya",Mo' Monie,1993
Monie Love,"[Verse 1]
Hello and hallelujah for the Wheel of Fortune
Thank God they got a selection of men they can auction
Be him black be him white
Rude, stink or polite
They got catalogue you know
Honey Dips hold tight
Form a line form a line
Behind me you know what I'm sayin'
I bin waiting since last year child I'm not playin'
Imo find myself somebody if it takes all week
Find me a piece of butt and no longer will I seek

[Verse 2]
First off I got a drug dealer
A heart stealer
Bucks hangin' out his butt
To him it was no big deal
Bought me this bought me that
Tried to spread me forget that
My name was not Country Crock
You big Spock-looking muskrat
Having money don't make you God
Find yourself a hole for you to stick your rod
No no no we can't be lovers
No no no we can't be friends
Only one thing left to do
Have to spin again

[Verse 3]
The second was a bum crumb
Nothing having mug
Personality OK but face looking like a pug
He said ""Come over to my house and watch movies""
I said who me so that you can do me
Not that I would but at least the dealer would have paid
You don't want to spend no money and you want to get laid
Back off!
Here's a dollar and the deal
Treat yourself to White Castle's
For me it's back to the wheel

[Verse 4]
The third was a white collar working in Manhattan
When he walked when he talked
When he ate there was a pattern
He tried to change the way I dressed and I talked
Showing me the difference
In the different types of forks
I said ""hey Mr. Connoiseur, you can stuff it""
You gotta love me for me or love nothin'
Take your forks and shove 'em all
Where the sun don't shine
And I'm back to spin the wheel just one more time

[Verse 5]
The final was a cop from up the block
The type that catches kids
From picking next door neighbor's locks
He liked to keep tabs
Don't you know he was a psycho
He also liked to hit
I said well now it's time that I go
I said don't touch me you might lose your nutz
I'll stick 'em in a pickle jar and wouldn't give a butt
Keep your hands to yourself if you know what I'm sayin'
There's a knife in my bag
Brother man I'm not playin' ya know

[Verse 6]
There you go there you have it
Wheel of fortune didn't work
Instead of meetin' gentlemen I met a bunch of jerks
One wid too much money the other not a cent
One too snobby and the other had no sense
I guess for Monie it's right back to the drawling board
How long will it be before I actually score
I gotta find somebody to unleash all this affection
I know what Imo do
I think I'll try the Love Connection",Wheel of Fortune,1993
Monie Love,"The ladies will kick it  the rhyme that is wicked 
Those that don't know how to be pros get evicted 
A woman can bear you  break you  take you 
Now it's time to rhyme  can you relate to 
A sister dope enough to make you holler and scream 

Ayo  let me take it from here  Queen
Excuse me but I think I'm about do 
To get into precisely what I am about to do 
I'm conversating to the folks that have no whatsoever clue 
So listen very carefully as I break it down for you 
Merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed 
Pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed 
Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes 
Let me state the position: Ladies first, yes? (Yes) 

(Yeah, there's going to be some changes in here) 

Believe me when I say being a woman is great, you see 
I know all the fellas out there will agree with me 
Not for being one but for being with one 
Because when it's time for loving it's the woman that gets some 
Strong, stepping, strutting, moving on 
Rhyming, cutting, and not forgetting 
We are the ones that give birth 
To the new generation of prophets because it's Ladies First 

I break into a lyrical freestyle 
Grab the mic, look into the crowd and see smiles 
Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two 
Sloppy slouching is something I won't do 
Some think that we can't flow (can't flow) 
Stereotypes, they got to go (got to go) 
I'm a mess around and flip the scene into reverse 
(With what?) With a little touch of ""Ladies First"" 

Who said the ladies couldn't make it, you must be blind 
If you don't believe, well here, listen to this rhyme 
Ladies first, there's no time to rehearse 
I'm divine and my mind expands throughout the universe 
A female rapper with the message to send the 
Queen Latifah is a perfect specimen 

My sister, can I get some? 

Sure, Monie Love, grab the mic and get dumb 

Yo, praise me not for simply being what I am 
Born in L-O-N-D-O-N and sound American 
You dig exactly where I'm coming from 
You want righteous rhyming, Imma give you some 
To enable you to aid yourself and get paid 
And the material that has no meaning I wish to slay 
Pay me every bit of your attention 
Like mother, like daughter, I would also like to mention 
I wish for you to bring me to, bring me to the rhythm 
Of which is now systematically given 
Desperately stressing I'm the daughter of a sister 
Who's the mother of a brother who's the brother of another 
Plus one more, all four 
Have a job to do, we doing it 
Respect due, to the mother who's the root of it 
And next up is me, the M-O-N-I-E L-O-V-E 
And I'm first cause I'm a L-A-D-I-E 

Contact and in fact, the style, it gets harder 
Cooling on the scene with my European partner 
Laying down track after track, waiting for the climax 
When I get there, that's when I tax 
The next man, or the next woman 
It doesn't make a difference, keep the competition coming 
And I'll recite the chapter in verse 
The title of this recital is ""Ladies First""",Ladies First,1996

Hello it's the Soul
Troopin' in wit the Jungle patrol
And this one's about the KO's the knockouts out there
Who's holdin' my buddy
Hold up
(Wait a minute)

Now just wait
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle
(The Jungle, the Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers)

De La Soul, from the soul
Black medallions no gold
Hangin' out wit Pos hangin' out wit Mase
Buddy buddy buddy all in my face

For the lap Jimbrowski must wear a cap
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I initiate the buddy with a slap

Now for the next
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best (the best)
The best (ooh wee!)
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch
(Stick em up, stick em up jimmy)
Nets won't be needed unless
(Jenny wanna get right to the flesh)

(Sweet little woman, sweet little woman)

I won't lie, I love b-u-d-d-y (why)
Cause I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny
I seem (very serious) like a Peek Freen
Buddy is the act that occurs on the lip
When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff

Buddy buddy, don't you know you make me go nutty
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy
Not too skinny and not too chubby
Soft like Silly Putty
Miss Crabtree I hope that you're not mad at me
Cause I told you that it was your buddy
That was making me ever so horny
Junglelistically horny

On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the

Q to her tip

On the A side and sometimes the flip
(Gotta gotta flip this record)
Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the Luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)

Behind my bush my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out
(Oh let loose the juice)
My buddy helps me to
(De La my Soul)
Keepin' jimmy in total control
Without Jimmy I'd be on a roll

(La la la l-la la la la, la la la l-la la la la)

Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my buddy I will toast
That we're like Ethel Merts and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mines and I can be your buddy

The best buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' less Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed

Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

And I watched and then I checked my swatch
To see the time
The Soul had formed a buddy line
And that buddy was (mine all mine)

Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul
Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands
(Then Jenny start flockin' it everywhere)
Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware

I keep that Goochie sweaters, hand knit cuz that's that blush shit
I stay in lace because my body got massage taste
Rolex on my cuff flooded with diamonds and stuff
A half a dozen hundred Benz, cool in my driveway
Tried to have it my way the fly way
That's you were baby
I should of kept it real when I was with you
Instead I dissed you 
So now I miss, true

Since you've been gone
Feels good when I 'm with you
I miss you come back home
I need your smile
Ain't seen you in a while

It's been two sleepless nights three lonely days
Since I last saw you
Now things just ain't the same

Hey yo, it's the Chocolate Mac

But you'll be that exception
The one I cared about
Wanna know about your whereabouts
and then I dissed you
so now I miss , true

So sugar come back home
I'm so all alone
I need someone that I can talk to

Feels good when I 'm with you
I miss you come back home
I need your smile

Verse 1: AZ
Yo, blesses to the young ones trapped in the world
Never hate the next man that be tappin your girl
It's just a hype, shoot anythings a man vision thru life
Help me to understand the chosen ones livin thru Christ
Blinded time from so many signs shown from greed
Tryin to calculate all the funds I blown from weed
Started out just a young shorty, wakin the rules
Turnin out to be the wise, educatin the fools
So many lost in these last days, closed curtains
Tryin to change from my past ways, I'm soul searchin
Diggin deep, tryin to feel within, it's real ill
Takin time just to chill with friends we still bill
Always told when I kick it with moms, to stay strong
Watch out for them bitches that's wicked, they play wrong
Keep your game strong, maintain yourself and live
Star bless the kids, soon sometin gotta give

Verse 2: AZ
You got to know when your end is near, I been there
Seen years disappear in thin air, nobody wins here
Swore on the population, we fightin blind
For sure, we need to stop the hatin, enlightin minds
Many die from a tragic death, in cold blood
Behoggin niggas lost or lack respect, show love
Sometime I wonder, was we ever free? High officials
they move so cleverly, don't ever sleep
 
Got my mind on the proverbs, ecclesiastics
These Bible words, so absurb, I read em backwards
They open doors, gave me a cause to stay swift
And reward, it gave me the sword to stay rich
Understandin is the best part, besides that
I fell-a off to a fresh start, no time to sidetrack
So much more still to come, it seems strange
I was much more iller young, but things change
Tryin to grow old, so many sights to see
Told it never fold, just more righteously, you know?
Chorus
Verse 3: AZ
I never knew any Bloods and Crips, but they exist
In New York, it's just thugs and clicks, we offer tips
Makin moves, tryin to stay afloat, it get deep
In these streets, you either stay or walk, or get beat
So strategise like the wise king, respect due
Brothers get high and let they mind scheme, I got Tek cool
In this world where so many stress, understand
ain't nuttin left but the thoughts of death, we're sons of man
So off track it's a shame to see, it's open season
Got police movin dangerously, for no reason
Hopin soon we can all adapt, get wise
It build lies, it was all a trap, in disguise
Assassinated by my own kind, so why ask
Because blacks to have a closed mind, deal with facts
Keep your eyes open, never rock yourself to sleep
Love to the East, let the dead rest in peace

Within their dreams, I walk the shadows
Late at night an empty feeling creeps
Within my soul, I feel so lonely

So I go into the darkness of the night
All alone I walk the streets until I find
Someone who is just like me
Looking for some company

Late at night a restless feeling takes
Control of me and I can't fight it
Late at night I feel the need for someone
Who like me needs understanding

All alone I'll walk each street until I find
Someone who is just like me
Looking for some company, no, yeah, hea

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low

How I'll hate going out in the storm!

Monique Danielle,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

And the promise to be near each time you call,

And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

These hoes love me to death, they mumble under they breath
Lovely duets, boy, I'm (Going down)

When he first came in, it's (Going down)
I know you mad, my career's blowing up
Going up, holding up, and your's is (Going down)
Slowly but surely, so coked to the shorty's
Caught by the boys, the judge says your (Going down)
I had to call up my lawyer, gotta make court
And yawning, it's four in the morning, it's (Going down)
I need be out by the morning
Man the police need me to be out by the morning, or nothings (Going down)

Money's longer than ever, longer Baretta, it's (Going down)
Man we could get it on, it's whatever
The morns the better, I'm shorter, I'm better whenever it's (Going down)
Got a new chick, badder than ever
Ass fatter than ever, got it together and love (Going down)
No bud, no kiss, no hug
No rub, no bath, no tub, just love (Going down)
Yeah, that's my kind of baby
That's my kind of lady it's (Going down)
And the purse, you might find a eighty
Underneath her lip gloss, shorty keeps some lip gloss she's (Going down)
And that's why I love her, that's also why I don't trust her
Think she got her a sucker, nope (Going down)
Got another thing coming, not a baby but a

Ya beautiful child it's (Going down)
Mama look up and smile, you made a beautiful child
Still shooting the pound it's (Going down)
Gotta survive, maneuver through towns
Gotta drive, smooth through the town, or it's (Going down)
Cops on my ass, gotta shoot through the town
Shooting the pound, I ruined it now it's (Going down)
Only question is, will I get caught
Will I get cuffed, will I see court, will people see me (Going down)
No they won't, man I'ma survivor
Plus I gotta lady cop that's a rider, so nothing's (Going down)
You might catch me, crossing the border
Crossing the water, three ladies out and deported it's (Going down)

Lost in the water, caught 'em and scored 'em, now they (Going down)

Monique Séka,"If there was a perfect night
This might be the one
For telling you the way I feel
And just how real we've become
If I'm anxious and a little uptight
It's because I want to ask you this right

(Chorus)
If I never stop loving you
Will you never start wanting me too
Say you won't and that's what I'll do
For forever with a heart so true
If you'll start and end everyday
Always never wanting me to go away
All I'm ever gonna do
Is never stop loving you

Forgive me I'm a little bit nervous
I really rehearsed what to say
It's funny in front of the mirror
My words sounded clearer today
In my heart I've got it straight in my head
I mean everything I think I just said

He used to have money, but he s wasted it all.

His blanket's an old coat he s had since the war
He stands on the corner of Carter and Vine

How I get all the women in the palm of my hand
I told them treat her like a lady; do the best you can do
You gotta treat her like a lady, she'll give in to you
Lord, you can seek, you know what I mean
 
I know you've heard that the woman soon takes advantage of you
Let me tell you my friend there just ain't no substitute, you ought to
Treat her like a lady do the best you can do
You gotta treat her like a lady, she'll give in to you
Lord, you can seek, you know what I mean
 
Oh, you've got to love her, tease her, but most of all you've got to please her
You've got to hold her and want her and make her feel you'll always need her
You know a woman is sentimental and so easy to upset
So make her feel that she's for real and she'll give you happiness
Woh, oh, oh, strange as it seems, you know you can't treat a woman mean
 
So my friend there you have it, the easy simple way
If you fail to do this, don't blame her if she looks my way
'Cause I'm gonna treat her like a lady;  so affectionately
I'm gonna treat her like a lady, she'll give in to me

I've been climbing to the ceiling, I'll fall once more.

Hajimeyou kimi to boku de",Morning-Evening,2008
Monkey Puzzle,"When I had you to myself 
I didn't want you around 
Those pretty faces always made you 
Stand out in a crowd 
But someone picked you from the bunch 
One glance was all it took 
Now it's much too late for me 
To take second look 

Oh baby give me one more chance 
To show you that I love you 
Won't you please send me back in your heart 

Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go 
But now since I see you in his arms 
I want you back 
Yes I do now 
I want you back 
Ooh ooh baby 
Yeah yeah, naw 

Trying to live without your love 
Is one long sleepless night 
Let me show you girl 
That I know wrong from right 

Every street you walk on 
I leave tear stains on the ground 
Following the girl 
I didn't even want around 
Oh baby give me one more chance 
To show you that I love you 
Won't you please send me back in your heart

Abuh buh buh buh 
All I want! 
Abuh buh buh buh 
All I need! 
Abuh buh buh buh",I Want You Back,1995
