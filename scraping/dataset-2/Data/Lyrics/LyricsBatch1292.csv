Young Jeezy,"I would, never violate the codes of the streets
And I would never make a promise, that I know I couldn't keep
And I would, never testify, cop out for a plea
Or surrender information on my boys to the police
And you could, never catch me on the block without a strap
And I would, never pull it out unless I'm bouts to black
And I could, never forget my homies dyin' for they scratch
Forever pourin' out liquor for 'em, God send me back
And I'll, never shed tears, my heart is like a stone now
Never thought I'd live to see 21 look I'm grown now
Never say never they tell me all the time
Cause never means it's forever, but it's never crossed my mine
And I'll, never go broke, I promise I'm a shine
Never come short on my issue, I'm on it every time
And I'll, never be past it, you better gimme me mine
It's my money, and I want it, every motherfuckin' dime
No I, never forgot all my struggles in the past
And I could, never forget how to hustle for my cash
And I will, never forget how I felt when I saw Brad
Take that first breath and from then, I knew I had to mash
And it could, never be said I went out like a hoe
Never been punked, I'll never let it slide, never let it go
Never ever, never ever ever no
Get on my level hoe, or get a shovel hoe
It's never any question for my manhood I get down
I'll never switch, never snitch, never sit down
I'll never hesitate to squeeze a nigga six rounds
I'll never squat to take a piss, who's the bitch now
I never ran, I never will, I ain't never scared
It's in my bloodline, the realest nigga ever bred
And that's some of the realest shit that I done ever said
And I can die but through my lyrics, I ain't never dead
I'll never disrespect my momma, never disrespect her momma neither
I'll never turn my back on Jesus
I'll never get caught off in the system, cause I believe a
Man that follows man, ain't no man, and I'm a leader
Never go turncoat my nigga, I could never trade
I'll never cross my homies out, that I ain't how I'm made
And I never had not one regret, on how I was raised
I'm from the ghetto, where I slung and rapped it every day
Never knew no other way, this ain't gon' never change
Never gon' bite my tongue, FUCK what nigga say
100 with myself I swore to God I'd stay the same
And when I finally got my paper, I was on my game
I'll never talk a nigga down, do yo' thang dawg!
Never hate a dude for tryin, that's insane dawg
Get yo' motherfuckin' money, that's the thang dawg
Too many homies dyin' young, feel my pain y'all",Never,2008

And just your luck the rap game got me hold up

Here we go again just spent a hundred of that brown paper
Bag money all on timbs, and that bad bitch is all on him
'Cause the cars that he drives are all foreign
The game is mine I'm so far in I'm speaking with an accent
Just cartwin, can't even relax in my room,
That brown paper bag money push my mattress through the roof
This for my niggas getting brown paper bag money
This for my strippers getting black plastic bag money
We're talking that bad money, that i.r.s can tax money you dig me

Understand I been in that water like I'm a dolphin
Miami Khaled took me in like a orphan
Why did they start him?
Now they can't park him

To streets my brother
Fefe's my brother
And we stay on point like a fucking box cutter
You heard what I said motherfucker did I studder
With my brown paper bag, here to represent the hustle I'm out

I confuse it, critics be hating
Best album yet but give me the same rating
I'm waiting top of rap Rushmore
Etched in stone runt top puns war
Unsure anythings possible
4mil spent bought out the art possible, I'm Picasso in the Versace suit, don't worry my nigga
Khaled I got you, not just 'cause I want to 'cause I got to, put the squad on your back did the impossible

Another hit, okay
We lookin' fine, takin' off
Saw us on a runway
On any given Sunday
Monday, Tuesday (haha)
They try to confuse me
I never let 'em use me

I was a girl, you was a man
I was too young to understand
I was naive, I just believed
Everything that you told me

Said you were strong, protecting me
Then I found out that you were weak
Keeping me there under your thumb
'Cause you were scared that I'd become much

More than you could handle
Shining like a chandelier
That decorated every room
Inside this private hell we built
And I dealt with it like a kid
I wished I could fly away but instead

I kept my tears inside 'cause I knew if I
Started I'd keep cryin' for the rest of my
Life with you I finally built up the strength
To walk away don't regret it
But I still live with the side effects

Wakin' up scared some nights
Still dreamin' 'bout the violent times
Still a little protective 'bout the people
That I let inside
Still a little defensive
Thinkin' folks be tryin' to run my life
Still a little depressed
Inside I fake a smile and deal with the

Side effects
Side effects
Side effects
Side effects

Vacant inside no one was there
Couldn't be real, had to keep quiet
Once in a while put up a fight
It's just too much night after night

After a while I would just lie
You were dead wrong said you were right
Did what I could just to survive
Couldn't believe this was my life

Flickering like a candle
Doin' my best to handle
Sleepin with the enemy
Aware that he was smothering
Every last part of me
So I broke away and finally
Found the strength to breathe

I kept my tears inside 'cause I knew if I
Started I'd keep cryin' for the rest of my
Life with you I finally built up the strength
To walk away don't regret it
But I still live with the side effects

Wakin' up scared some nights
Still dreamin' 'bout the violent times
Still a little protective 'bout the people

Hey Magnifico or should I say Magnificent?
Ain't nothing worth your happiness
And I ain't caring who you're with
Misery love company so we ain't tryin' to hang with y'all
Hurt you if you let 'em in
Gotta keep your circle small
Keep tryin' to play
I tell him I ain't blowin' tho
Think they want me outta here
I tell 'em I ain't goin' tho
Side effects be drowsiness
Loneliness
How is this?
I think the call it hateration
What can you prescribe for this? 

Forgive but I can't forget it

Doing a hundred on the Interstate 95
My shawty leanin' blasting that Do or Die
Pushin' that motherfuckin' wood cause we certified
Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hoping they never call off
I'm a sniper sitting on the roof already saw y'all
It ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I rather have them dollar bills rain on me

Paint lookin' like a sugar free Redbull
I'm so paid ya know I keep a pocketful
And that's before the taxes
Took my whole gross net and hid it under my mattress
I use to get bored count 20's for practice
Paper therapy we let the money relax us
Gold chains round my neck just like Michael Phelps
I made a killin' in the water killin' with da water
Against all odds and I will not stop
They try and keep me on bottom but I prefer the top
And my project chick I moved her next to Joc
She said the house was too small I moved her next to block
So baby get ya ass up I need an extra block
I told her do the speed limit and no extra stops and that's why

I send some niggas with guns at y'all house
Only to find out you live in a doll house damn!

We bury cowards on the set that they come from

Toilet paper on the side for example homie
I, get, money
I know you niggas ain't heard no shit like this and
While you wishing on that fallin' star I'm in a foreign car
Smoking out with the doors ajar
Suede sun roof hangin' out the big top
We leave the dealership head to the rim shop
You niggas barely dressin' I got thousands piling
That's that salad dressin' I'm on my thousand island
Wildin' stylin' I be I get so much money its my i.d
Don't try me and if I dont do nuthin' I'm a fuckin' ball
And I ain't bout to start runnin' naw nigga naw

[Chorus]

Ain't nothin' to a boss we ballin' when you see us
We hear them haters callin' they too far off to see us
Unless they got they glasses on get your bifocal game
Class is now in session now try to stay focus mane
Your boy ain't good enough style ain't hood enough
Would've could've should've wont do with us true enough
Need a hoe break a hoe never nuthin' new to us
Turnin' hoes to house wives never been cool with us
Soon enough all these dealers are gonna catch up
Till then fuck it I'm winnin' so I'm a stack up
Flows like a river the current is so rapid
Hit with the ratchet thats how shit happens
Next time you're yappin' make sure it be about that big money talk
Let that lil' money walk call me what you want but don't call me for front
Southside I got what you want come holla at me

Hustle from the beginning of January til the end of December
Wasn't smokin purple then it was more like bobby brown
On that hen dog got a nigga drinking straight brown (7/11 nigga you know)

I think we got a problem
Yeah

Big money in this bitch if you didn't knew
Big business minus the business suit
Even I look in the mirror like is it you
And I say I must be the hottest if it isn't you
Stay fresh from my top to my tennis shoes
New coupe, no top, big tennis shoes
Never slipped, not even on the side of a swimming pool
We don't get ridiculed,
We get rid of fools
They said I couldn't play football I was too small
They say I couldn't play basketball I wasn't tall
They say I couldn't play baseball at all
And now everyday of my life I ball!
And they say ya' ain't raining until someone assassinate,
And I feel like M-L-K
Yeah, I have a dream to be your worst nightmare,
And now meet the boss of the cartel 
(Ross!)

I'm a seven-nine Satan, sitting on Lorenz's
And I seem really patient, picture the equation
People taking pictures and they really getting fragrant
Flags down my spaceship, sergeant sniffin' for a fragrance
Yeyo, Yeyo, he wanna sniff the yeyo, flying saucer on the house
In the casa just to lay-low
Make more (money man) that the model for the mob
Need a blow-job my model, get a model for the job
Go hard, no job, hustler, no prob, poster,
Nigga what finger fuck you whole squad.
Forty around extendo, flipping for my kin folk
Luxury tax on them packs if you didn't know
Bought a new crib, niggas feeling like I hid
Three point two but I just did it for the kids
More guns than a pawn shop,
Got my whole arm rocked.
Keep the seven sexty double parked in the wrong spot

Still hustling
Boss!

[Chorus]
Yeah
You gotta pay for this,
I remember when I used to pray for this
This, this is classic,
Some shit you might not see again
And we taxin', you don't want it nigga leave it then,
And we taxin', you don't want it nigga leave it then
And we ain't trying to see the pen,
Like a needle in a hay stack we ain't trying to see the pen
This is a luxury tax

(I don't ask them baby I just tax 'em baby)
(Let's go)

Yeah imagine this,
No imagine that
Gave me my sack like, good luck getting back (Yeah)
I'm like how the fuck I'm gonna get outta there
And if I'm not careful,
Leave 'em the same place they find him there
And I'm a winner if I make it cross the finish line,
Putting food on the table like it's dinner time
And this is what you call stereotyping by far?
Can you tell me me why your dog keep sniffing my car?
Huh? Got the audacity to call me a liar
So what you got in your trunk?
Oh, just a spare tire
You niggas talked blow,
While I sold mine
Like a bad cramp, it's locking up in no time
More time in the kitchen then I spent in the studio,
Gangsters paradise and I ain't talking about Coolio
Can't lie, still addicted to the odor
Got a ice cold Pepsi,
But still thinking Coke-Cola

Ha ha ha

[Chorus]

I'm up early in the morning, and I'm dressed in black
Hold on, every morning I get dressed in black
While your half ass, nigga my pants saggin',
I'm getting money, and my swaggin' and black flaggin'
Million dollar status, fully automatic
Heavy on the henny and even harder on the women
If it wasn't for rappin',
I probably would pimpin' and shit
Pops, my papi, has already hear me
I tried trapping, shit sent me to prison,
Got mad and went to savage so homicide came to visit
I smell gun powder,
So you got one hour to come up with every damn dollar,
Or your dun-dolla
It cost a ball dog,
Especially when the players on your team,
Consider you as the ball hog.
You treat me like Shaq,
And you Kobe but I didn't say you owe me nigga
But act like you know me nigga

Damn right a nigga straight come get some mo from me

If you can't find Chaka then my right hands keep it
Look I am simply on of the best
Can't even lie i can't vouch for the depressed
Just like zip-lock they get killed in the plastic
Best add five grams so you can weigh it in plastic
I am so dirty they wrap me in plastic
When they wrap me in plastic need to put me in traffic
They say that I'm difficult even different
Show me the difference I'll bring you the difference

Nothin' like ya man he ain't grindin' like this
And even if he was, he ain't fuckin with cause 

I came so far from the bottom couldn't even see the top
Just as soon as a fill the trap I'm rippin' up every block
I'ma good god fearin' man with a criminal mind state
Ain't nobody gave a shit and that's why we grind weight
My grandma off in the church while I'm in the refrigerator
In search of the baking soda right next to the mashed potatoes
She prayin' for better days I'm prayin' they take this water
Realest and stun and ship put that day on my mothers daughter

Its Mr. Trap or die yeah yall remember me
First album was a classic them critics weren't feelin' me
Now as far as award shows we all know how that goes
So whats all the doubt about because he ain't sellin' out
Because he ain't givin' up because he don't give a fuck
Because he ain't changin' up I guess he aint lean enough
And just know I'm savin' up let you play with my sanity
Gives a fuck what you think of me unless you feedin' my family
Mother fuck all my enemies one time for my mini me's
Listen to these niggas I bet you hear plenty me
I'm who they pretend to be the one they pretend to do
See me I'm a hustla I do what my hustlaz do

[Chorus]

Might not just be the best just know I plan to be
I refuse to let suckers win but thats just the man in me
Look it could be the G in me these niggas ain't seein' me
Unless they seein' me in traffic and somethin' topic and drastic
I say I grind like there 10 of me swear to god theres just one of me
Look I know I ain't there yet just know that I'm gonna be

Tryna make a plate anybody seen the scale

And they love to see white now how much you tryna pay
Lets go!

Today was a good day hope I have me a great night
I dunno what you fishin' for hope you catch you a great white
Me I see great white heavy as killer whales
I cannot believe this who knew it came in bails
Who knew it came with jail who knew it came with prison
Jus cuz you got an opinion does that make you a politician
Bush robbed all of us would that make him a criminal
& den he cheated in Florida would dat make him a seminal
I say and I quote ""we need a miracle""
And I say a miracle cuz this shit is hysterical
By my nephews and nieces I will email Jesus
Tell him forward to Moses and cc Allah
Mr. soul survivor does that make me a konvict
Be all u can be now don't dat sound like some dumb shit
When you die over crude oil as black as my nigga boo
It's really a desert storm that's word to my nigga clue
Catch me in Las Vegas, a.r. Arizona
Rep for them real niggaz im winnin' in California
Winnin' in Tennessee hands down Atlanta
Landslide Alabama on my way to Savannah

I said I woke up this morning headache this big!
Pay all these damn bills feed all these damn kids
Buy all these school shoes buy all these school clothes
For some strange reason my son addicted to polos
Love me some spinach dip I'm addicted to Houston's
And if the numbers is right I take a trip out to Houston
A earthquake out in China a hurricane in New Orleans
Street dreams tour I showed my ass in New Orleans
Did it for soulja slim brought out b.g.
Its all love bun, I'm forgiving you pimp c
You know how the pimp be
That nigga go'n speak his mind
If he could speak down from heaven
He tell me stay on my grind
Tell him I'm doin' fine Obama for mankind
We ready for damn change so ya'll let the man shine
Stuntin' on Martin Luther feelin just like a king
Guess dis is what he meant when he said dat he had a dream

[Chorus]

Yeah!
History, black history
No president ever did shit for me
Had to hit the streets try to flip some keys
So a nigga wont go broke
Then they put us in jail now a nigga cant go vote
So I spend dough all these hoes is trippin'
She ain't a politician honeys a politician
My president is black Rolls golden charms
Twenty two inch rims like Hulk Hogan's arms
When thousands of people is riled up to see you
That can arouse ya ego you got mouths to feed so
Gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
Cuz at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you can ever be
For whatever fee or publicity never lose your integrity
For years there's been surprise horses in this stable
Just two albums in I'm the realest nigga on this label
Mr black president yeah Obama fa real
They gotta put ya face on the five thousand dollar bill

So good you can smell it through the roof,
If you getting money throw your hood out the roof,
You know it ain't a remix without the band man,
Fliest nigga in the club he got on his man bands
Why he call bag man because he got them bands
Would have called him gram bands if he had them grams in em,
Leave nothing at the crib I got it all on,
And I ain't leave nothing off I got it all on,
So I ain't trying to be rude, niggas ain't shit,
They just trying to be dude, niggas ain't this,
Pull up in something so stupid, like what ya think?
Damn shades so dark I can't even blink,
Left the street with bad habits I can't spill my drink,
Fuck around and have a flashback, I might need a sink,
I get it in I go hard, that's my own broad,
Fuck critics, straight cash that's my gold card,

The way you bouncing on my dick and grindin' slow wit yo ass
Hit the v.i.p. wit me I po' some moe' fo yo ass
Just so I can see you out there bouncing yo ass

In a crowd full of hoes I would notice yo ass

And if you don't know what to do wit you better give it here shawty
Put a bend in her back, I'm throwing the dick she giving it back

I'm so official all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She opened up her mouth and then I blew her brains out

And I don't sit still I keep it moving like a drive-by

I am the show and the after party I'm stacking dough
Ain't gotta sell crack no more still on my grind
Got a lot of kids at home gotta get it on late nights
To the early morn 50 grand in my pocket like Ivan Smith
Give back to the hood like Nino Brown neck kinda freezy boy
Believe it you can playa hate but take it easy
We done got the streets me and jeezy learned from the game
How to stack the breezes got love from the hood
So it's all good er both goin eat me
And jeezy riding down the highway (zoom, zoom)

She roller coaster ride me in the projects
Where ya find I got the whole hood behind
Me my records selling out the stores
Now my money on 4s now you best believe it
They feeling me from Alaska to Tennessee
From the east to the west coast I smoke
What the best smoke we pushing Lambos, Phantoms,
And Bentley coupes now people hollerin' out
The window ay boosie you got the juice now

Brick on top of brick laid my foundation
And I built my house and it was mixtape after mixtapes
And next thang you know I was running the south streets
Introduced me to the trap see that wasn't enough
I wanted the world that was round time my album dropped
And the next thang you know I was running
The world it it what it was was one of the girls
Jeezy wanted one of the girls ima super nigga need a cape
For me real street niggas can relate to me it
Would be a big disappointment
I would hate to be at the wrong place at the wrong time wrong line,
Wrong name, right car but the wrong thang, can't tell me shit
I'ma grown mane 16 years ols wit a old thang didn't eat for days
And months 2 A.K's and a box of blunts if money you want
Then it's money you get hanging wit blow it's money you get ever
Believe that I'd ever believe that I'd ever achieve what I ever achieve

Stop this bitch let me tell the world some
From the bottom to the top shoulda seen that shit me
And my lil' thug gotta it from the mud every thang
I spit I really mean that shit it's crazy
Ain't it hard to explain it I done got famous
All I did was brang it savage life behind the mic now
Everybody hollerin' bout trill entertainment rest in peace
Pimp C I scream that shit every time I do shows you put me on
And I ain't forget so for my nigga
I gotta fuck 2 hoes whateva y'all mean I ain't got cream
You see me in the hood don't thank I can't leave
When I was 19 already and deal y'all other lil' niggas
Y'all jus' selling y'all dreams I ain't through yet
I done done it all got a lot of stuff I been through yet
I fucked up I ain't make it through school
Wanna see if my kids gon' make it
Through that from Miami to L.A. back to Manhattan
Where the big cake from Baton Rouge I done did it gon' ahead admit it
I'ma the shit hey and ion care what a bitch say

It's that Blueprint 3 shit right here
It's that T-M 103 shit right here
You ready? You ready Hov'? Let's go! (Hands up!)

Allow me to re-introduce myself
At the same time re-introduce my wealth
At the same time rejuvenate the game
It's for my ol'dawg niggas that's used to 'caine

Not what B-dawg said, I respect the game
G-D's, vice lords, crips the same
And I know you're 'bout to say this off the chain
Tell 'em fake trappin' ass niggas stay out my lane

See I ain't dead or in jail, I can't complain
And when these fake niggas gone, I shall remain
And if you just tunin' in, let me explain
You know I keep that 47 who ?

These niggas way too far, I played the game
And if you listen hard enough I say some things
And when that sack got low, I shave them things
And put 'em right back together, I made them things

Put your sacks in the air if you represent your click
Money in the air if you ever hear the lick, baby
Put your hands in the air, if you know that you that bitch
Say you looking for the real, hey well this is real as it gets

Hey! Hey! Oh! Oh!
Hey! Hey! Oh! Oh!

Hey! Hey! Oh! Oh!

Where the west coast at, put your W's up
Where my east coast niggas that hustle to live
And all my niggas up north that's doin' it big

Oh yeah I'm rare, I'm aware that I'm rare
I rap and I'm real, I'm one of the few here
These other boys lyin', I wonder if y'all care
Their stories out this world, I wonder if y'all hear

But don't really matter as long as they stay clear
Clear of the real shit we doin' over here
When my nigga get home, I'm gonna send him a Lear
For all the time he been down, get him right up in the air

With a couple of broads get him right up in the air
Mile high club get him right up in there
Send my nigga some gear like he never missed a year
By the time you hear this song, he'll be standing right here

Real nigga shit there!

Put your sacks in the air if you represent your click
Money in the air if you ever hear the lick, baby
Put your hands in the air, if you know that you that bitch
Say you looking for the real, hey well this is real as it gets

Hey! Hey! Oh! Oh!
Hey! Hey! Oh! Oh!
This is real as it gets

Hey! Hey! Oh! Oh!
Hey! Hey! Oh! Oh!

A hundred million to the good and I'm still talkin' yayo
At a snails pace I won this race that y'all trail
Uh, uh, Blueprint's for sale
Followin' my footprints you can't fail

Set sail, I used to duck shots but now I eat quail
I'll probably never see jail
Each tale contains more of the truth
Of the statue allows me to go into detail

Uh, close your eyes you can smell
Hov's the audio equivalent of braille
That's why they feel me in the favelas in Brazil
And water-house 'cause real recognize real

Rah!

You know me, I don't need no introductions
Call me make a lil' somethin' out of nothin'
Anywhere you go, we're the topic of discussion
Damn, that's gotta be disgustin'

Err, shit make me wanna throw up
It's big boy music, it should make me wanna grow up
Flows like selvage, it just make me wanna pour up
And is it just me or this makes you wanna roll up

A big fat one, then unpack one
Then unwrap one, peel back one
They use to call me Jizzle when they step in the middle
And you can tell the color when it's damp in the middle

Whats up!

Put your sacks in the air if you represent your click
Money in the air if you ever hear the lick, baby
Put your hands in the air, if you know that you that bitch
Say you looking for the real, hey well this is real as it gets

24 inches on the old school
Beat up knocking
These hoes keep jocking
And these tags I'ma pop em
I'm a real show shopper
Sold out shows everywhere I go
Just to hear the young boy from the old ways flow
When it comes to the money imam get that doe
Imam get that doe nigga that's for sure
Can't nobody do it quite like this man
They cool but they ain't like this man
Got ice on my neck and my wrist man

These Nigga can't do it like I
Everyday this nigga stay fly
26 inches be on my ride
Hear my dubs be suicide
Still black card spending

When it comes to the hoes you know I'ma get em
At the mall everyday so you know that I'm fitted
Everything that I done hop in undid it
Tell these men first time I drop
6 years later still on top
Making these hits but it ain't goin' stop
I'ma get this money til my casket drop
And yes, yes my nigga I'ma baller
They had to nickname me Mr tear the mall up
Clip the bar
When I hit that mall
Shut the whole mall down
Buying everything I saw
And these lame niggas hating on me cos they hoes all want me
Hey it ain't my fault
You should having it, check homie

(Hey), nigga, don't you hit me 'less you buyin' six or mo'
My twenty-four blades glistenin', and my 808 kickin'

I wear the crown down under, man, somebody better tell 'em
'For I spit a hundred rounds and have everybody bailin'
I got some bitches in a Benz and my partners in the Chevy
And now we ridin' Giovanni's and Asani's on Pirellis
If ya ever think ya tryin' to run up on me, just forget it
The clip in the chopper long as ya leg and leave ya shredded
Pistol way in the truck, and my knife on tuck
Ya think he ain't gettin' stuck, you got life fucked up
A couple stiches in ya hip will have ya night fucked up
Will he live?  Will he die?  Guess he might luck up
Meanwhile, I'm racin' my Ferarri like a light for a buck
Against Lamborghini Gallardo every time I get a car

And still spendin' every dollar they encourage me to save

Young Jeezy,"In the midst of negativity, a positive site can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good, seems to let evil occur
While still possessing our human form,
We live life searching for greatness since the day we was born
And as we bow our heads at night rich wealthy or poor with dislikes
We pray, asking for forgiveness for our sinful ways
With mind, body, spirit and faith
We pray
Amen

Yeah, you like that right? I wrote it myself by the way
Yo Young, Jeezy, Jizzle, Snowman
We gotta give the streets what they want man
Fuck the god damn sheet man
You gotta get it in bruh
Let's get it

You like that don't you?
I wrote it myself by the way
And I don’t mean to be selfish
But I picture myself gettin’ paid
And you might catch pneumonia
'Cause I'm colder than an elf on a sleigh
Uh, me and Pusha back on it
Now everybody help us pray.
Lord forgive my sins and all my friends
Dollars make sense, I’m tryna get paid

Tryna get saved (too late)
Time to get paid
Got a gun and a stocking mask
Niggas thought I was tryna get waves
I’mma let y'all niggas pray for it
My young niggas knocking off a K for it
Sold my soul on the back end
Only fucking way I'ma pay for it
Front that shit you put a flame on
My niggas locked in a cage for
They keep telling me to go hard
Number one spot you was made for
Yeah, I made more
Front of the grill, got a racehorse
California Crayola red
Glow In The Dark like a ‘Ye tour
Fuck niggas steppin’ in my lane for
Not knowing that it’s a land mine
Soon as a nigga feel a cool breeze
Throw the top up like a gang sign
Red or blue, crip or blood
Solitaires, diamond studs
Like chandeliers I’ma flood
Black Jesus piece like it’s dipped in mud
Fashion God’s, notice mine
Roller ball spikes I’m Pokemon
Paris shit, Louboutin
Under bright lights where do you belong?

Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin realer everyday
Niggas killin’ niggas, starving 'cause they can’t find no Yay
See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trapped and some be dying, bow our heads and let us pray
Amen

Amen, how many people do you know hatin’?
On your downfall sitting their waitin’
When you shine, wonder what they gonna say then
Everything I do now stadiums
Tell me what they really gon’ say to him
And I’m headed straight to the ATM
Finna go HAM, nigga finna go in
Nigga you'll get it when pigs fly, when Yeezy fake
Devil’s pie, piece of cake
Kit-Kat I need a break
God’s child, Jesus Christ
Club like a broken neck, I need the ice
I need the lights
In Egypt they fightin’ for freedom
Cop pull you over no reason, beat him

Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin realer everyday
Niggas killin’ niggas, starving 'cause they can’t find no Yay
See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trapped and some be dying, bow our heads and let us pray, amen

I got them units packed in that black van like the A-Team
Even seen 'em come two tone like a Saleen (Saleen)
Saleen, Yeah that’s a Mustang
Break 'em down in the night, that's what I call hustling
They say they want that dumb shit, but this is ignorance
Come to warn the timepiece, yeah now that's ignorance
They like, Young you a fool, yeah I coulda bought some real estate
Instead I bought a half a block, I tried to sew up half the streets
I’m up seventy five on seventy five, when they was going for the twenty five
Guess who’s pickin’ up a trey
Just an ordinary day with extraordinary pay
Extraordinary risk
Can’t even explain, got an extraordinary wrist
I talk it cause I lived it man, this shit ain't really nothin’ to me
Tell ya like Sosa told Tony “don't you fuck with me”

Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin realer everyday
Niggas killin’ niggas, starving 'cause they can’t find no Yay
See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trapped and some be dying, bow our heads and let us pray

Same ol j.young ain't no buster, never said I was a usher,
So how you gone act like I ain't no hustler,
I got bitches all round me young like usher,
Don't leave your bitch around me young might fuck her,
Catch me in the ballout, me and my shooters,
In a white drop top, hooters, broad day big bag, getting money, 5 grand we had...
Rent money, real nigga till I die, get money, 20 in advance big money.

I done done it all lexis, ice strokes, chevys, bitches, promices broken.
You ain't never in your life seen a nigga this focused
And done done it all in a pair of air forces 
And done done it all in a pair of air forces

Clip hold half a hundred, blame it on the K
Still the realest nigga in it, these niggas CB4
This is fuck a nigga records, and I’m the CEO

Nigga selling anything, buffet wild
DB9 stupid grill, yeah that overbite
Need me nine stupid deals, this shit is overpriced
Got it vacuum sealed up, that’s the hide the scent

Got murked out chillin' at a bird house
Shoulda seen the look on that ho face
When we kicked the doors off the hinge
Niggas that don't know walled out to win
Six feet deep when you catch a nigga 'sleep in the streets
Man I bet he won't doze off again
Niggas took a Chevy and blowed off the lid
Show a hundred pounds and balled off the bitch
A couple hundred shots will hold off the picks
'Til my homeboy Will get home off his bid
I'mma still do stickups
Two Mossberg pumps in the pickup
Everybody keep your cool cause if anybody move
The bust shots will tear your whole clique up

Face in his ribcage, ripped off

That's why I gotta say it again, pussy bananas
My little cool ass bitch, she from the West side
She let me hit from the back, say that's her best side
Call it her bed side, I call it her wet side
And every time the bitch cum, she holler, ""West-side!""
One Thursday night, met her at Crucial's
You already knowing the rest, the head was crucial
Do this little thing with her tongue that get me so hype
You should see her lips when I'm done, them shits be so white
Nothing ain't soft in my pants, that barrel so long
Each and every time that she call, that shit be so hard

Told her all pussy's the same, she got a super one
And when I'm on that trick, I'm going superman
And when I'm on that smoke, I'm going super-HAM
Make a quick stop and a run for blunts and po'boys
When you left your strap in the car? The answer's no, boy
In my wife-beater and boxers, left on my damn chain
Before I left, I put her to sleep, don't play no damn games

Yeah, you know our conversation is cool, she intellectual
Got turned out at the school, she bisexual
Show up with my game face on, ready to kill something
Man, that thing get so wet, you think you spilled something
She said she can be anything if we arrange it
She said, boy, you better get back, it's bout to rain here
She said, Young, since this your pussy, let's put your name here
Baby girl, since this your crib, let's hide some 'caine here
Think about the business side of it, we both can gain here
Yeah bitch, I know this your shit, we both can hang here
I told her, listen here, that's my shit so let me hide that

When I'm gone the whole world gonna know my name

Twelve years old, caught up in that street life
I was tryna shine harder than the street lights
Ran the streets tongue-tied, couldn't sleep nights
Cause when you're living wrong, it's hard to sleep right
But it is what it is, gotta eat right
Cop them things they be whiter than your teeth right?
Drank some big things on my grandmama couch
Hit some big things at my grandmama house
'Cause when you play the game every strike counts
And why they call them eight-balls if they don't bounce
Bag full of weight down in the crack yard
But you can't get 'em till ?

Who you be nigga? Neighborhood hero
Dope game, no shame, nigga more pain
See them enough to drive a young nigga insane
From the windows of the trap, see the prison bars
Flashing lights on top, we call them prison cars
For my niggas make a livin' on they mobile phone
Grind hard 'till your earrings cost a mobile home

Get the bricks butt naked, get your struggles on

Road trips ain't shit, you know I go get 'em
Plus my man send his check, you know we gon' split 'em

From that real nigga cloth, that's why you can't tear

Another year in prison, promise this is it for me
Tryna make it through the storm, should be makin' history
No feelin' sorry for me, keep ya pity and ya sympathy
Good or bad, take it like a man, whatever meant for me

Much mota, many different kinds in the bag
I fell hard for the funk, I can't fake the love
I smoke dro, good Reggie, smoke shake to nugs

Got a blunt? Let me split it down the gut

Guess it was love at first sight, eye contact
Remember the night we first met, I caught a contact
Now she's my ride or die, it’s us against the world
You know we both hustlin’ so hustlin’ is our world
Said I must've had too much to drink I’m in my G-Mode
So all the ladies repeat after me cause it’s the G-Code
Promise if I get locked, you’ll come and pay my bond
If you hear some niggas plotting on me, you’ll ring the alarm

Lets tie the knot, lets grab us a pot, lets make a baby
Looking back, I don’t know who threw this bouquet to me
But I walk down this aisle faithfully, cut that cake for me
I, Jay-Z, take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And 'til the task force roll
To hug her every corner 'til I get ash from the cold
Or until I’ve amassed a fortune, too much cash for me to fold
Fold under pressure I would never, ever, ever, ever
Your secrets I treasure, for better or worse
You’ll always be my first love 'til death do us part
Pull a hearse up, my verse up

Niggas do bitches do but them numbers don't lie
And if forever through these words real niggas don't die
Even thing, even birds, a real nigga gon' try
The penitentiary ain't never scared me
Either I'm going or I ain't, that's just how it's gon' be
They want top dollar, and the shit gettin' stepped on
Got a nigga feeling like he being slept on
Sleep is for the weak when the work came cheap
Now the sour was sweet but you can't be weak
They say what don't kill us, makes us stronger
Until they build a better case, so they can lock us up longer

And I don't look at you the same no more nigga
It'll never be the same no more my nigga
I don't wanna play the game no more my nigga
It'll never be the same no more my nigga
And I don't look at you the same no more nigga
It'll never be the same no more my nigga
I don't wanna play the game no more my nigga
It'll never be the same no more my nigga",Never Be the Same,2011

Too much money in the room, guess I hit her in the kitchen then
Get her to myself man, I ain't hit that girl yet

Every time we got pulled over, never ran her mouth
Fuck with real niggas, get money baby, off the chain
Long as baby stay getting money, how can I complain?
Favorite girl, guess she got the skills just to pay the bills
Last nigga she was fuckin' with was worth a couple mil

Get em home and they probably all sheet rock

You living mine and yours thats a double dip
That synthetic ass shit we call it double whip
And nigga nothing beat the cross but the double cross
I ran the streets and rap bitch I'mma double boss
Them niggas cashed out one I sent a double off
They knocked him  off halfway I took a double loss

Let's put these niggas on the stand, now stand up and be a man
Raise your hand and swear you weren't my number one fan
And I'm  still that same nigga, you still that same nigga
But at the same time, I'm  starting to get bad vibes
What I owe you sumthin' nigga, that's what you act like
I ain't like them other niggas boy, you betta act right
The first few years of your deal ride your training wheels
And then you graduate and live how real niggas live
And I ain't dissin', naw, I ain't dissin'
But when you sit back and listen, this what the rap game's is missin'
I'm  used to thug niggas, it's too many young niggas with.
Too much of liquor, too many drugs in em, too many clicks, too much swag nigga,
Too many niggas wearing tight shirts and skinnies, walking round with they ass out
Y'all betta cash out, gon' put your cash up
Because I'm  all in and if I don't win nigga, I'mma mask up

Hardest part of life niggas cant play they role
Everybody wanna ride the train, don't wanna pay the toll
Keep it going young, boy you on a role
Hoe nigga magazine, you the centerfold
You can check the resume, nigga I'm  good as gold
Lawn chair ass niggas all they do is fold
Nigga you talkin' with emotions, you emotional
You might can get a lil' light, feelin promotional
Tell me what cha see when you lookin' in the mirror
Look as this hoe as nigga, I couldn't said it clearer
And you the same nigga that started up this jewelry game
And when you see him  nowadays the nigga jewelry lame
Ain't got it by now, nigga you ain't got it
And why you talkin' like that cause bitch you ain't bout it
And nigga how ya doin' now, worst then before

Want me fall on my face

Told her do me a favor and put your mouth on this faucet
I know just how she like it
She might think I'm a psychic
Even called me a plumber, she like the way that I pipe it

I'm talking so much white, you would think I was racist
See I came from the bottom, I'm talking under the basement
Threw the roof off this bitch like we just had a tornado
Desert Eagles, they twins, I call em Cain and Abel
Hundred K in my pocket, that shit as thick as a Bible
Superstar in my hood, so that would make me an idol
Had a hell of a night, so I'mma say me a prayer
In the lockout I'm balling, so that would make me a player

I'm the life of the party, bring the party some life
You know I'm dead-ass serious. Why? Cause I said it twice
We talking straight suicide, we taking shots to the head
Must be drinking amnesia, cause I forgot what I said
Stacked up so much bread I'mma need me a toaster

Swear to God, couple right by the night stand
Clip my half a hundred, fill a case another hundred grand
And get some rest when your conscious keep waking ya
The evil kicks in and them demons start shaking ya
Every night, I wake up in a cold sweat
Get dressed and hit the club in a cold vest
God damn, girl, you so sexy, cold shit
But why they still riding to your old shit?

Party by the beat, all still riding with ya
Party by the big riders, still siding with ya
Party by the real niggas still hustling to ya
I know you're here in the day, ain't nothing to ya
They say a picture's worth about a thousand words 
Niggas talkin' like they really worth a thousand words 
Come the paramedics ?
Calling the beat, it's really dope fool, yo

It goes one for the money, two for the dough
All you got is three niggas kicking at your door, ha ha
Here come the paramedics, here come the paramedics 
It goes one for the down, two niggas running
Game and the snowman, one hundred miles and gunning
Hey, here come the paramedics, here come the paramedics

See us riding like some mobsters, with the trunk full of choppers
Give a nigga a couple shots, and I ain't talking about vodka
Hanging out the sunroof, Snowman driving
Nigga live through these shots, put his ass on Survivor
Fresh up at the trap, I ain't never been a rat
Get cheese like a mouse, so I'm honest throwing stack
Let you suckers make it rain, I'll make it Katrina
And pile all them hoes in the back of my Beamer

Hit the freeway, bumping ""Ghetto Boys"", with the V twelve steaming
Top down, in the rain, California dreaming
I'd be lying if I said I still flip birds
Well nigga I still flip birds
Word to the doors on this ? I'm sitting on
Ain't a rapper alive me and Jeezy ain't shitting on
Who else you know shit out Benjamins, and piss Patron?
Put Michael Buffer between us, and let's get it on!

Hey, here come the paramedics, here come the paramedics

(Hey Snowman, these niggas hustling backwards
I'ma pull the K out, and turn 'em around)
Look, if I give you half a chicken, can you break that bitch down?
Tell the truth, it's me nigga, ain't nobody else around
Jeezy said it's a recession, so we hustling that Mayweather
My furs the best pound for pound, like Mayweather

Undisputed, I never lost a brick
UPS, FedEx and duct tape to a bitch
Put her ass on that greyhound
Tell that hoe to stay down
Sleep the first 48, and wake up in the A-Town
Give a fuck about a bitch
Die for the paper, hustle relentless
Nigga, I take the sky from a scraper

The Gerber out a baby mouth, the fire out of Satan's house
These rappers turned saints, we pull them fucking gauges out
Black Tim's kicking in the door, at your lady house
He at the strip club, well fuck it, we gon' wait it out
You tipped him off, so now all the K's is out
We locate shot him down from the neighbor's house

And you know what I was thinking
All my thoughts, all my cares
The same love on the balcony
Right there in new york city
I saw a tourist staring back at me
In times square in new york city

She sassy, she classy, hair like she cassie
Say why your voices so raspy
Uh, I hope she nasty
Last night, good kush and sirrock with a super freak
Told him put it on my black card,
Get it super sweet
We can do it right now girl, I don't give a fuck
Right here in the valley, we can do it in the truck
Got her legs on the dashboard, yeah I got a boulder
Don't know if the kush heat with the
Go, but I'll be back though

Had a couple drinks, later air it was perfect
The enjoying the scene, now breathe
We couldn't help it
All things have their purpose
The wind it blew, through my hair love
I stunned by your stare
From the sight of you, standing there love
I could walk, walk on air
Then we made love on balcony
Right there in new york city
I saw a tourist staring back at me
In times square in new york city
And in that moment the city was mine

I told her look, baby talk to me, you know I'ma talk
You know that tic talk... yeah you gonna get the

Yeah you my needle white, swish
Turn it right,

I ain't no funny nigga nah I ain't got jokes
Wake up in the morning tell your girls that you got choked
Bust it wide open, turn it up, blew it back
Turn that presidential suite, swerving deep, like a crack house
We're at the rich and I got her on the balcony
One stop shop ain't nobody coming after me

Then we made love on balcony
Right there in new york city
I saw a tourist staring back at me

Thumbing through a check born on a jet
Talking on the iPhone sipping out tha styrofoam

When I cash that cash money smell like cocaine 
Doing Birdman numbers making flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside the jeweler drop my bail on your ring 
Spent so much in Louis gave me free champagne 
In Bal Harbour shopping and they doing the same thing 
And I keep my cup wit me like a pimp

Fast cash life, happily ever after

RIP to my niggas (Rest in peace)
I pour out a little liquor

Evil thoughts in your mind keep running through
Not quite sure what you wanna do
Like, what is this world coming to?
Life goes on even if you don't want it to (Uh-huh)
It's a sad ride home if the good die young do the bad die old? (Let me know)
I'm just trying to carry my load another good nigga livin' by the bad guy code
Lookin' for the Lord but the devil spoke to you
When you lose a loved one or somebody that's close to you
People turning they back meaning the most to you
Then you find out your man is sending them folks to you
Maybe you shed a tear and you never cry
Always true to your word and you never lie
Got your hand on them birds you would let em fly
Yeah, cause real niggas never die (What?)

Somebody tell me why (why)
Why the good die young (why)
Sometimes it makes me cry (cry)
To know that you're gone 
Hold on to the memories
Not a day goes by I
Hear a voice saying dry those eyes
'Cause real niggas never die (Real niggas never die)
They never die, no
Real niggas never die (Real niggas never die)
They never die
Real niggas never die

I had love for this music but ain't know how to pursue it,
Was frustrated as a teen I needed money for Buicks,
My shirt was stained from the sewage,
Niggas rockin' the newest,
I dealt with it for the moment but couldn't call it the future,
I'm down a block from the shootin',
It started to sound like recruitin',
Seein' niggas I grew up with sleep to funeral music,
And I was only fifteen,
I parted ways with my schoolin',
My first seven grams of work were like my holy communion and now I'm turnt out,
The block hot, niggas burnt out,
With no heart it's cold cash that we search out,
We got rules we hear shots then we 'sperse out,
Retaliation, get back exactly what the turf bout,
And it's a gang of young niggas I was hurt 'bout
On the real I almost shed tears in the church house
Back when I thought real niggas couldn't die
Learnt I was wrong but still couldn't cry

Somebody tell me why (why)
Why the good die young (why)
Sometimes it makes me cry (cry)
To know that you're gone 
Hold on to the memories
Not a day goes by I
Hear a voice saying dry those eyes
'Cause real niggas never die (Real niggas never die)
They never die, no
Real niggas never die (Real niggas never die)
They never die
Real niggas never die

Since everybody real, where the fakers at?
Since everybody trill, where the flakers at?
Trynta break 'em down, where the tables at?
Dufflebag full of cash like, where Vegas at?
Crap tables, life's a gamble, but a nigga won!
Now I'm lookin' round like, what have a nigga done?
My lord my God, I'm used to hustlin' hard
Guess they find it odd how a nigga beat the odds
No Illuminati never been a fan of saints
That's what happens when you room big as central station
Same rubber band my cousin tied her braids with
We ain't cop the same car my auntie played spades with
What you know about five eatin' off a half
That's five mu'fuckas now you do the math
Oxymoron these rap niggas don't lie
This real nigga shit and real niggas don't die

Somebody tell me why (why)
Why the good die young (why)
Sometimes it makes me cry (cry)
To know that you're gone 
Hold on to the memories
Not a day goes by I
Hear a voice saying dry those eyes
'Cause real niggas never die (Real niggas never die)
They never die, no
Real niggas never die (Real niggas never die)
They never die

In the hood that you can visit
Oh boy I got it, no chasers

I took that advice young when I was headed up to college
Momma swimming in that debt
Rather swim with the piranhas or the shark
Ready set go, on your mark to the top
Getting rich ain’t a blessing it’s a choice
Drunk and still drinking out the fucking bottle
I want a hood rat bitch motherfuck a model

Told my olds im hiding you here, so they won’t find you
What you know about a bag that’s heavy as anacondas?

In the same damn place, damn block, with no progress
To be this nigga here, it takes a process
First you got to hit the block like a real nigga
Then you gonna hit the booth and straight kill niggas
I don’t feel niggas but you bet they felt me

I’m bound to fuck, call the federalies come and get me
This shit here ain’t the game, man this shit here’s the game
I’m talking real jail, real prisons and everything
That’s why I put the God honest truth on every bar

That’s the way it’s gonna be
Won’t be happy till I’m in the same place as Max B

Anything you wanna know about them things just ask me
See I might be from the ghetto but I’m gonna be classy
You can hate it if you want but I’m gonna be flashy
See I do it for the time that I was broke and ashy
Bitches say you want them clothes all week ,you nasty
See Pac said it best , real niggas don’t die

I ain’t bathed in a week, I was smellin’ like pickles
Street showin’ no pities, still gettin’ to the business

Had to ball him out of jail, blew the money on the bail
When flat, bounced back from a 30-cent flipper

I don’t even know how many times I’ve been to prison
Shit get gangsta, we call …
Bought two things, had the third one off issue
Two-fifty-two on the scale, that’s a nino
Eighteen sales, five hundred-four grams
Add an extra gram when you weigh it with the …
Real rap talk, keep it real, don’t believe you
When you get out of line, swear to God, I’ma leave you
Dirks cuts the water ‘fore they kick a nigga dope
Try to flush it down the toilet but the dope just flow
Tear gas from the cannon
Everybody scramblin’, but I ain’t the one to panic
Double homicide, broad day, that’s my jacket
Tried to bird feed, cut through on my jacket
And I take change, I’m a serve when they askin’
Come from out of town, I’ma test, none or less

Everythin’ wrong, this can’t be right
Man, it’s so much, this can’t be life (yeah)
Shit get real, me and K. on back
(We gotta do what we gotta do, you feel me)
Never came back in that black on black

I still do it for them niggas with them bricks on bricks
I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
Let me tell you how them real niggas pull a rebound back

See I never came back in that black on black

Served a couple blocks
Hit a couple corners tryna shake a couple cops

Crawling on fours, every time I slide by

Hos on my swag 'cause the diamonds in my mouth
But I move low key, posted in the trap
Raw with the rap, to put my hood on the map

And my partna named Screw, so I let the trunk crack
What they know about that, haters better chill

Grab a couple mill, and I can show you what I'm worth

Trunk just popped, so I'm showing my surround
84's got me tipping, so low to the ground
Still hitting licks, moving off the Greyhound
Watching for the laws, I ain't fucking with the time
Bitch I'm in my prime, ain't no stopping my shine
I advise, that they lead the truth to the throne
If you say I ain't the realest, say bitch you dead wrong

Young Joc,"I got 5000 ones, lookin' for the baddest bitch in the club
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her
I got 5000 ones when I see her pimp, I'm throwin' it up
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her

See me when I walk in, ain't nothin' to it
Brought ten stacks to the back, then threw it
Make it rain, ain't a thang
When it come to money I got it, man

You the next best thang, I'm the hottest, mayne
You talk that shit, I'm 'bout it, mayne
We way over here, up out your range
Don't try to be G, that's not your thang

You try me G, that Glock gon' bang
K I N G, that's not gon' change
I'm rich, bitch, I don't care about no fame
'Cause if all else fails, I got cocaine

Still see me all on TV wit it
Still in da hood what ya need he get it
Dough low 44, see me wit it
If a nigga runnin' up best believe he get it

See us in da club, nigga, we be trippin'
Niggas rap 'bout that shit we livin'
7 or 8 stacks on 2 or 3 bitches
Sucka niggas over there hatin', we chillin'

I ran out of ones, so go back get more
Say shawty, bend it over back, real slow
Jack dat ass up, grab that pole
Show me you 'bout that action, hoe

I got 5000 ones, lookin' for the baddest bitch in the club
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her
I got 5000 ones when I see her pimp, I'm throwin' it up
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her

Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold
Stacks so fat rubber bands can't hold it, no
They can't hold it, no, they can't hold it, no

Eeenie, meenie, miny, moe
I'm lookin' for the direction this money 'bout to go

Blow top dollas
Got this bitch jumpin' off the chain like Rottweilers

See I'm lookin' for the baddest bitch
Splurge for a second when I'm done you can have this bitch

5000, 10,000, 20

Stacked money tall as skyscrapers

I got 5000 ones when I see her pimp, I'm throwin' it up
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her

They call me Young, my money long
I make it rain, now loose your thong
Now loose your bottoms, now loose your tops
You saw what I just spent, I could've bought a watch

I could've bought a car, maybe a couple bricks
I send my hood bitch the fifths on a shoppin' trip
5000 ones, ya you know young wit it
So high up in the air, she need a flight to go get it

Still Mr. Magic City, you know no replacements
This is what I do I got a pole in my basement
If I can make it to Onyx, I bring Onyx to the condo
Call lil' bro bring me 20 grand pronto

I got 5000 ones, lookin' for the baddest bitch in the club

Walk up in the club, neighborhood superstars
Buyin' up the bar, cushin' a cigar
A bitch on each arm, and both them hoes foreign
Menagin' wid'cha boy, try'na drink my unborn
Lickin' on each otha, acrobatics wid they tongue
Shake it like Beyonce, go ring the alarm

Treat her like a rope
And tie her in a knot
Hood nigga shit meet me at the travel-lodge
Bring some redbulls and some Trojan extra large
Work a big chop, she gon lose a lot of carbs
Make that juice box talk, man I make that pussy fart
The girl can't win

And make her back In
I beat it for an hour
Than I rest for 10
And grab another rubber
And do it all again

Fuck with us, ay choppa hit ya
Choppa split ya shit
Uh enough of all that
Try'na make a juice box wet fall back
Now whip it out what do u call that?
She got skin baby girl, haul ass

Young Josh,"Where they at?

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home)
She can be 18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

If you want to go and take a ride with me

Check, check, yo, I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas want to know why: why I fly by
But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, 'wishing you was' niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss
Honies looking all ""they wish"" - come on boo, gimme kiss

If you don't pay you don't smoke

See I puff then pass through the cuts
Got to make the dash
Lit another blunt hurry up fetch had to come and get
Split it's kind of hart to take the losses
Quickly had to brake ya'll now I'm thinking ya'll slice the sweet
And quickly rolled it up got to catch you fold it up
In the green with the heat of my cup
Stupid stuff but all my cudees blaze wit me
And when they blaze young lay get's way dizzy
I'm feeling tipsey so you know I'm feeling perk
Walk through the club seeing sister on with some tight skirts
But what I got on ya a sack black lips and lungs
I got what I got to stack hunds and ones
Now I know why they want to see me up state
Going to prisions for decisions that should don't make
You gone brake 'cause the county you in ain't no joke
You can bounce when you want

Chorus

(Young Lay)
I come from a family of three sprung on the sticky green
I hit the spot and said it don't stop but repeat
Yale gets caught and yale gets off
One of my tapes run around thinking lay soft
They bootsey trick'em fools all I wanted juice 
while homies sell and flaunt keys
And we stay deeper than some vietnamese
When the microphone is on the rhyme hit some rushing up some fine chicks
While cudees yelling rewind this
It's critical homies calling me on a digital phone
To know what's going on am I coming home or what
I was living way plush young lay must
Stacking g'z and come clean on capris candy
I see my family running away from these folks
Down with young lay and qude downless flode
And roll another jay but in the swiss a sweet
In the grass I down with wax with ten sacks and bags

Chorus

(Young Lay)
My indo indo spot it just don't stop everytime I go to wit
Dank we let her hold it in than roll another spliff
Splurred by professional scenes I mean the punk police
Who always want to front on me they coming around when I'm keyed
Thinking that we some hood rats I got some good yat
Base to make your crack blu I rap with interior black
Hear me coming watch me scat who is he where he be
I heard he got a lil scratch but young lay ain't all that
Love to see him fall flat smash and check to the curb
I'm with the clock stack with junkie key can keep the glock on the turn
Dubiees with herb all smashed in the ash tray
Now rollers want to tail gait I put them on lay away
'cause lay through this everyday I try to mash in another way
And now there wondering if this gangster  stay
But like a truff I clock some gluff high up in my playa suit
Fine hoes and daisy dukes gonna jock me 'cause these crazy fools

Welcome to Emerica

(Don't hate me) 'cause I done made this world what it's done to me

[Ja Rule]
Niggaz, if I could pledge my allegiance to the, United Ghettoes
of the Emerica, go on sell ya drugs
Cuttin taxes for strippers and thugs
It's all good, room for mayor in all hood and as well I should
I make it publicly desmist understood
When they caught me gettin high in the back of the ho-tel
Was you freakin them ho's?
Well, I just say I was gettin a lil head but so what
Bill and Hillery stay for them stills
That's a down ass bitch for ya
Wash em with some soap and water
And return them dirty bra's to their rightful owner
Now that's creep shit
One over one, I got this broad on the one-o-one
She's botherin, so don't even come up in here
'cause she's contious, no nonsense
She like to choke on the dick, and the lungs on the constant
Gettin the W1's you church girl
Proda stant, it's aiight ma you rollin wit the Inc.

[Young Life]
Yeah I'm here can you tell?
Mo' niggaz livin, livin in ?? in Emerica

Young Life is a compeditor
And is into real my niggaz headed up hill
I'm lettin you know shit's real
I came into the game copped a deal
Aimin to get this shit still
It ain't been a minute I ain't been high
And I haven't handled my business
How I been fuckin you bitches right
Yeah you witnesses my life
Imperial night, in the ghetto holdin my medal tight
Still, in Emerica
Remilitary is terror nigga holds his medal
Of his never be availible
That easy I'm a editor, restin up with the best of em
Minds of them bitches that stress givin em hard sex
I'm set for life, the lightin ho's that write
And hit the mic, not over night
You get the gift to be the best of something like
(Enough in Emerica) Young Life is comin home
Motherfuckers prepare to die

[Chorus]

[Chink Santana]
Niggaz hit that crack houses hustlers and hoes
No youngins up on the corners nigga smokin them bones
I'm rattin away wit knots comin up, what's no pills?
That's why they'll find your ass slumped in the blacks of ville
But still, I spot that paper Jo, Blowin my weed
And ain't a thing a mother need is gotta be me
But now days these lil youngins rollin on E
And a nigga that supplyin that is who runs the streets
Now look, this ain't no crack day
I gotsa come up on the stash and get back man
'cause I done witness all this shit that they say them ho's do
Fuckin wit X, like finger fuckin that hot glock
While she swallow her tit
But real, there nigga want his dick sucked?
Bitches is why bitches turn that rehold into a intrick (It's pimp shit)
No limp dick, just a gangsta fuck
Why the murder put some major bust biatch

Making money flip, make it flip, make flip, make it flip, make it flip

A nigga hardly right but I did this time
Whipping up the white yeah you know his rhymes
All he talk is dealing, balling shit, and killing
That's what the fuck I'm seeing on my way to a million
Would you rather I be broke, a struggle rapper for your laughter with no hope?
Them niggas lead you to disaster in they quotes
It was depressing every time them niggas spoke
I talk about getting the most out of life my nigga
I can't settle and grin, I'm ain't a Pilgrim, I am built to win
That's why I do well with the blow, I just chill and win
The boy got a glow can't filter him

It's just the way my day go tryna finagle the bagel
Playing with the Legos, I'm talking about the yayo

Making money flip, make it flip, make flip, make it flip, make it flip

These niggas don't wanna see me ball, they rather see me fall
Or laying in the morgue, instead of shopping at the mall
Mad cause I'm like Wall, your boy a young Wizard
When it come to them digits they know I really get it
Got the city on my fitted and the hood on my back
A lot of gold around my neck and on my hip is the strap
They say since I started rappin' I don't know how to act
But I was never into acting, so front and clapped
Man down, all you little niggas better stand down
You can't block these shots, put your hand down
The block I used to walk on getting ran now
You ain't deaf I know you heard I'm the man clown

It's just the way my day go tryna finagle the bagel
Playing with the Legos, I'm talking about the yayo
I be in the mix, in the mix, in the mix, in the mix, in the mix
Making money flip, make it flip, make flip, make it flip, make it flip

It's just the way my day go tryna finagle the bagel

From your eyes
Everything you wanted me to know

That we had when we used to own this town
But you won???t see my cry

To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below

Double cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in the store
Morphine city slippin' dues, down to see that

We don't even care, as restless as we are
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement, lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go, beneath the sound of hope

Hung down with the freaks and the ghouls

Kids are living underground

Rumors get so loud
We want to scream and shout
It's taking over now
You can't control it
You're shaking soaking wet
In the middle of the night again

Will the message
Cause a motion
We won't know till we get there
When the suns down
Lights come up
Friends and enemies come together!

Awful things were said,
You might not be able to take back

And tells him
Get out, get out
Just leave, she pleads
He can't believe what he's done
As he's walking down the street
The night keeps warning him to turn around

underneath the night sky
Take flight
Underneath the night sky
She cries
Underneath the night sky

You know where I'm going
Oh underneath the night sky
Remembering the reasons why
Underneath the night sky
I'll fall for you tonight again

on his way to familiar arms
Someone who will know him
The girl who understands
Stops dead in his tracks to see
It's too much too give up
Not too late for apologies
Turns down the wrong street
Give me all your money
Should know better than to be here alone
Tries to run, doesn't feel like a fight
She could hear the shots ring out from home

underneath the night sky
Take flight
Underneath the night sky
She cries
Underneath the night sky

You know where I'm going
Oh underneath the night sky

It's sure is nice to feel good again
I see a door left open beggars and kings
Come and go, it'll never close

I got my black boots on, gonna show up late
But that's okay because we won't leave till dawn
I've got my black boots on, I want your body shirt off
This river of fun is coming, coming to take us home

Put your hands together for each other
Oh, oh, oh
Hands together for each other
Oh, oh, oh

We start fires to make the cost up
We laughed, we screamed, we hid from the cops
It was Christmas Eve that streets were empty
We ran so hard, it hurt to breathe

Young Love,"Love can you hear me?
I'm calling to you

Beyond the fields of Avalon
I found a new lover
It's her I lay my lips upon
When my emotions uncover

Even when she's far away
Beyond my fences
I know that she will never stray
Beyond my senses

Love can you hear me?
I'm calling to you

When her kisses touch my soul
I feel embraced by the diva
And then my spirit unfolds
And shakes me like Shiva

Beyond the gates of Babylon
I found a new lover
It's her I lay my lips upon
When my emotions uncover

Love can you hear me?
I'm calling to you
My heart is on the line

Been around the world and back again
My kind of freedom was always leaving
And I thought hearts were just for stealing

Then I saw the light in your eyes this morning
And somehow I knew
I was gonna take a chance with you
Try to see this through so I'll be hoping you

Don't let me down
Love, don't let me down

Been on the bad side of a lot of goodbyes
Sometimes it felt like I was out of tears to cry
So for my own sake I put my heart away
Thought I'd try again on some sunny day

Then I saw the light in your eyes this morning
And somehow I knew
I was gonna take a chance with you
Try to see this through so I'll be hoping you

Don't let me down
Love, don't let me down

Let's make a promise we can believe in tonight
Give me your heart and I'll give you mine

Don't let me down

I don't fuck with rats if you take the pack
Better bring that money back
It's a simple fact, that the bill is scrapped
With the milli mac, hit you with a rack
It's a mummy wrap
Haters jumping out got you frozen like a snapshot
Drumroll your whole team the mascot
Pure killa, no filter hoover gang
Real niggas never speak about our murder game

Crippling bullies, black hoodies
Get fully loaded nigga, I smack pussy
Pussy pussy cat, come here pussy cat
Pull that hoodie back
We shooting first ain't no shooting back
I like my bitches from the hood
Head tied with the doobie wrap
She told me bring that big dog
I told her bring that cootie cat

Down that shit I be quick to cop the tooly back

Bedford Stuyvesant the livest one
My barrel is thorough fill a cold burrow
Niggas on me, I'mma RIP 'em
Put him on display let his homies see him
This young boy think the game is soft
Till they get they whole head knocked off
My nigga still shocked from the crack era
20 years later coming home together

This style is that really good shit
This that wish a nigga would shit
2pac and Suge shit
Got a lot of niggas mad because the money's steady coming in
When I pull my phone out them bitches put they number in
Automatic guns you can call my niggas drummer men
And when they go burrrrahh, you see a bunch of running men
If you ain't fucking with M.A aye well fuck 'em then
The mixtape is coming that's a way to bring the summer in

25 years with an L on it
Put a closed eye no scale on it
Fuck paid a quarter hope it come back
If not guns out and we come back
Still from day one all about the money
Paranoid niggas so they move funny
Taught a boy learn from the hand to hand
Death is life, you can die or you stand

I don't give a fuck, not a motherfuck
Not a single solitary fuck
Pussy cream when the pistol buck
Keep a pistol tucked
Come up missing when you mess with us
Fuck the game, bitch I run the team the commissioner
I'mma freak, I'mma vicious one
Got some bitches tougher than you niggas that will hit you up
Tell the coroner, zip you up
Pop a zip, tell a sensai roll a cinci up

Brooklyn, home of the official
Motherfuckers comeing with a shock for your body tissue
Probably miss you if you was somebody important
Irrelevant rappers getting clapped in that black coffin

M.A said get him Buck, I get him with the team nah-mean?
When I'm on the scene nah-mean?
M.A said get him Buck, I get him with the team

Popping bottles, I'm all wet now
Told my city I won't let up, I won't let down (Brooklyn)

I just bagged twenty bitches on the walk out
Honestly, knowing me, I won't hit them up
And if they try to hit me up I ain't picking up

We make money, we don't make threats

Out in Cali, getting cloudy with my hitter Blue
Uh, you aight ma? yeah we good
And if I had to make a wish, I wish you niggas would
Put my Cartiers on for the shade throwers
At first they was fucking with us then they changed on us
And we right back popping and they back again
And these hoes back thotting and they back again
In the Yams with some Jordans, on our scooter bikes
They was claiming that they do it but don't do it right
It's not about what you got, it's 'bout who you are
'Cause we don't need foreign cars to get foreign broads

'Cause we them niggas

If she down then she a rider
She been with you from the bottom, 'cause
Nowadays it's been kind of hard to find 'em 'cause

Good times I had with you
Back in the Sixties when love was free
Never need to worry bout my G.C.E. 

Dying of boredom in your plastic home
Pretty the pictures, work to the bone
Don't be depressed,
You can just pick up the phone

Is a robot when he should
Never tires, ever good
And we're singing

Parallel sympathy with you
Skin to metal overture
Take a walk, he's always near
Like a shadow, never fear
While we're singing

Like a tower in the dark
He can leave you feeling stark
While his fingers fall away
Love is climbing in his heart
So we're singing

Take a towel to his brow
Soothe the features of the proud
Lubricate the inner man
Exercise him when you can
And be singing

You will be dead

At the top of your legs
And you only live when you are in bed
Then you are not in this world

When the baby cries lullaby again
As the light goes out on the final day
For the people who never had a say

There is too much heat
And the living floor
Throws you off your feet
As the final day falls into the night
There is peace outside

Play hard to get females get jealous

A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next days function high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone-cold munchin'
Music comes on people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walking guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove
So come on fatso and just bust a move

You're on a mission and your wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls just ugly faces
From frustration first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself, with a celibate rope
Your movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin' in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says ""Hello,
come sit next to me you fine fellow.""
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next hey bust a move

Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""No way""

Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no women and there you are

And roll to the church in your new tuxedo

-------

Some of the busiest rhymes ever made by man
Are goin' into this mic, written by this hand
Are comin' out of this mouth, made by this tongue
I'll tell you now my name, my name is Young
But so you think that it's your destiny
To get the best of me, but I suggest to be
Quiet, bro', don't even try it from the east and west of me
Takin' it and never breakin' it or even shakin' it
Groovin' it and always movin' it, 'cause I'm not fakin' it
Pullin' out rhymes like books off the shelf
Born in England, raised in Hollis, taught to go for myself
This is stone cold rhymin', no frills, no fluffs
And it's no accident that these rhymes sound tough
I'm goin' off, baby, there's no turnin' back
I'm on your TV, on your album, cassette and 8-track
And when the show is finally finished I'll be takin' my bow
My name is Young, and yo I got know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?

I got know-how
Party people, I got know...how
I kick it just like this...

Verse 2
-------

I got juice like the president, I'm makin' rappers hesitant
Invite me to your house and I'll be chillin' like a resident
Yes, 'cause I'm that type of man
'cause I make myself at home no matter where I am
I got it rollin' like thunder, makin' y'all wonder
Why I'm on top with all the other rappers under
I make no errors, mistakes or blunders
It's like a wedding, let no man put asunder
My name is Young MC, I like to rock mic well
'cause when I get up on the mic I just release my spell
It's no hocus-pocus, I'll just get you into focus
And swarm all over you just like a horde of locusts
Smooth operator, female persuader
Spot a fly girl and in a week I'm gonna date her
I got the kind of style for the here and the now
And I can do it 'cause I got know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?

I got know-how
Party people, I got know...how
Bust it!

Verse 3
-------

MC's I'll ruin, 'cause I know what I'm doin'
I'll treat 'em like doublemint gum and start chewin'
I spit 'em out when the flavour's gone
And I repeat the chewin' practice 'til the break of dawn
'cause I'm tough like a bone, sly like Stallone
Rockin' and clockin' on the microphone
Smooth like a mirror, in hearts I strike terror
Rhymes like runs and hits with no errors
Cold like a blizzard, on the mic I am the wizard
With the funky fresh rhymes comin' out of my gizzard
Never sneezin', never coughin', I rock the mic often
Hard as a rock and no sign I'll soften
Makin' sure I get respect, on my mind rhymes connect
I start to build like a builder from a architect
Movin' all around, above and under the ground
You see my face, and then you hear my sound
Comin' atcha with the mic in hand
I'm gonna take command just the way I planned
'cause I'm a one-man band and you are my fan
Don't you understand? I'm like Superman
Yeah, the Man of Steel, don't you know the deal?
You better be for real, I got sex appeal
This is what I feel, and this here's my vow
And now you know the brother with know-how, you know what I'm sayin'?

I got know-how...and I'm chillin', never illin'
In my mouth I got two fillin's...whatever!
I'm on the mic, cold stone gettin' over
My name is Young MC, known as the fly casanova, kick it...

['Apache' until fade]",Know How,1989
Young MC,"Now this rhyme right here has been dedicated,
To all rap fans that said that they hated,
The other MC's whose rhymes deviated,
'Cause this is real gold, it's not gold plated,
A few years ago these rhymes were created,
I was real proud and very elated,
It took a long time as I claculated,
But now I look back, I'm glad I waited,
At so many times I was so frustrated,
'Cause I couldn't finish up what I initiated,
I got mad and quite agitated,
And I remember rhymes that I had confiscated,
But one day, this girl, she perpetrated,
She was cute and quite educated,
We got married at once, an it was consummated,
But once it hit the books it was ill-fated,
She took me to court, to have it liligated,
A judge and a jury, that's how it operated,
The jury went away, and they deliberated,
Then she took all of my money, had my house renivated,
I felt so poor, and so humilated,
Because of a fight that I instigated,
But I got my money back, and I was jubilated,
'Cause the first court decision was never validated,
For weeks and weeks, I just celebrated,
Because the jury and judge recapitulated,
And all of my funds were never liquadated,
Yes I won, yes I dominated,
I saw another girl and my heart pulsated,
She just looked like that girl, I made it,

It's time for the people to know, so now I tell 'em
What goes in my cerebrum and my cerebellum
The though process that helps me get dressed
Get up and go to school, sit down and take a test
It helps me determine if a girl is fine
And the steps necessary to make her mine
It tells me if something is cold or hot
And I don't mess it up with crack, coke, or pot
It helps my hearing, taste, touch and sight
And smell so that I can tell that everything's alright
It tells me when to get up and when to go to bed
This is some of what goes on inside my head
Inside my head, I wonder what might happen
If the day came and I stopped rappin'
Would I still have friends or be all alone
Do they like me for me or for the microphone
And also, when I go on a date
To a fancy restaurant, a hundred dollars a plate
And people stare, is it because they recognize me
Or are they knee-jerk reacting to what they see
I'm sorry, let me make it somewhat clear
Do they look with joy or do they look with fear
Do they think 'oh wow, Young MC is near'
Or do they think, 'yo, get that nigga out of here'
I don't know, it's an unfortunate case
That I can't read your mind when I see your face
But on the other hand, you can't read mine
So I guess that the status quo's just fine
For instance, say I'm in a tall building
Looking out the window, what if I illed and
Jumped out, would it really matter to some
And if they had my funeral, just who would come
Would they cry for me after I was gone
Well don't worry, that's not how I'm gonna move on
'Cause I want to go to heaven after I am dead
But this is what I goes on inside my head

Chorus 2: (spoken)
The cerebrum is the part of the brain which is responsible for thinking,
reasoning, problem solving, and initiating responses to external stimuli. It
is comprised of four lobes: the frontal, which is concerned with speech and
voluntary muscle activity. The partietal, which is concerned with the
interpretation of sensory stimuli, the temporal, which is concerned with
auditory stimuli or hearing. And the occipital lobe, which is concerned with
the interpretation of visual stimuli. It is the development of the cerebrum
in humans which distinguishes us from other living creatures. Only whales
and dolphins have comparable cerebral development.

Inside my head, pretty women reign supreme
Because they enter my live and dominate my dreams
I see one walking down the avenue freely
And I look her up and down hoping that she don't see me
Then I wonder, what if the girl just stopped
Threw me on the ground and she got on top
And moved and grooved until our bodies were slick
Then I stop and say 'man, that's sick'
But I'm not alone in this train of thought
A lot of people think it, but they don't get caught
They just live their lives and keep it all inside
Another secret that the brain will hide,
Right, I wonder what it's like to live life wild
I wonder which women will have my child
Will I be a good parent, or will I be cold
Then I imagine I'm five years old
I'm running down the street without a care in the world
Puberty's later, so I don't think about girls
Mom and Dad will do whatever I say
They think it's really cute to see their son play
Responsibility is like a four letter word
They say they told me something, I'll say I never heard
Forget growing up, I'll be a kid instead
Because this is what goes on inside my head

Chorus 3: (spoken)
The cerebellum is located below the occtipal lobe and behind the brain stem.
It takes impulses from the rest of the brain and helps translate them into
coordinated muscle movements. Any muscular activity, from brute strength to
a steady hand, requires a high degree of cerebellum input. The brain stem is
located just above the base of the skull, and is the continuous connection
between the brain and the spinal cord. The lowest part of the brain stem or
The medullah oblongata actually becomes the spinal cord at the medullah's
lowest point and is concerned with the waking and sleeping states.

Inside my head, there are so many questions to answer
And self-doubt grows in my mind like cancer
But I make sure that my thoughts are pure
And my self-confidence is like a cancer cure
So someone tell me why I think I'm fat
When none of my friends ever think like that
And could it be I'm not as ugly as I feel
Because a lot of women think I've got sex appeal
And is it true, that I'm just too commercial
Not black enough cause I'm not controversial
Is it true what religious fanatics tell
If I don't go to your church then I'm going to hell
And is it true, that I'm obliged to try
To please everyone with music I supply
And is it true, that it will make me strong
If I sleep with a women cause she likes my song
And is it true that I'm not a real black man
If I fall in love with somebody who needs a tan
And is it true that I have to try to be
Some type of superhero, cause I'm Young MC
And is it true, that I have to watch myself
Because I think about sex more than anyone else
And is it true, that every women is fake
'cause she don't like me for me but for the money I make
And is it true that I must be out of place
Since pop radio likes me, I'm ignoring my race
And is it true what some people will complain
That since I made this song I must be insane
Hell no, these are just negative thoughts
And I just ignore them so I won't get caught
I let my heart lead and my brain be led
Because this is what goes on inside my head

Chorus 4: (spoken)
The limbic system or the visceral brain is located in the area above the
brain stem and below the cerebrum. It is concerned with emotional tone,
habitual tendencies, sexual behavior and desires, and is closely associated
with the cerebrum. This association provides an inhibition for the raw
emotional output of the limbic system. It is the artist's opinion that the
concept of self-control rests upon the cerebrum's ability to regulate the
uninhibited emotional impulses of the limbic system. And for me, the
struggle continues.",Inside My Head,1991
Young MC,"Hey, hey, ya, ya, you got it going on,
aah na-na, na-na

Now I wrote this record for when I perform, 
from the nights inside a university dorm,
I put pen to paper with a paper and pen, 
for the times I'm rockin' the mic in front of women and men, 
I get raw like Eddie, rough like Freddy,
Kreuger with a luger turnin' men into spaghetti,
I'm like Fats Domino, up on Blueberry Hill, 
'cause my rhymes are funky fresh not run of the mill,
And like a king has palaces I give an analyis,
You can't talk because you suffer from paralysis,
of the mouth, of the lip, of the tongue, comin' to you complements of a
brother named Young,
Now you can't talk because I'm leaving you speechless, 
so be quiet and let an educater teach this,
It's due to my producer, so he's in a rage. And Mike you control the vinyl
I'll control the stage 'cause I come of,

Chorus

Four score and seven years ago
there were a whole bunch of rappers who were in the know
Four score and seven years later
I dig a hole in those rappers like the moon with a crater
Because they battle me they're really taking a risk, 
Cause you're an eight track tape and I'm a compact disc,
And like Tyson drops boxers in rapid succession,
I'm droppin' MCs in the rappin' profession
I'm comin' off, just like the clothes on a hooker,
and I can fly like Jimmy Superfly Snooka, 
Like a shuttle goes up into outer space, people's hands go up when I enter
the place, 
I don't mean to brag or boast just to tell ya I'm great, but I can rock the
microphone like Dorothy Hammil can skate, 
Yeah, I can say a funky rhyme like Greg Luganis can dive, Don't have to be
Saturday night for Young MC to get live 'cause I come off,

Chorus

Yo I come off, My name is Young MC and baby I come off
Yo the brother's comin' off, Bust this, Here we go

Now one behold, Young MC struck gold,
form the rhymes that I've been sayin' to the young and the old, 
From the battles I've been havin' with the smart and the dumb, 
From the records I've been makin' with the mic and the drum, 
You know the other rappers want to play a game with me, 
they run and hide when they hear the name of Young MC, 
Like a kid playing tag, that's how it's got to be
so when I start I say Oli Oli Oxenfree, 
Yo, you can never write a rhyme as strong as this one, 
So pay attention 'cause you don't want to miss one, of my healthy rhymes
nobody's are healthier, New York, New Jersy, LA or Philidelphia,
City to city, and town to town, place to place
country to country, cause I get around 
Even if you were in prison you'da heard me play
cause the warden had me rock and I'm on the PA, 
So when you get out come and see my show 
and if you start static back in you go
'Cause comin' off is the title and the theme of the jam, 
and when the rhymes are finally finished people say God damn 
cause I come off

Chorus

I come off. Yo baby, I come off. Here we go...",I Come Off,1992
Young MC,"This here's a tale for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down cause ya over-zealous
Play hard to get females get jealous
Okay smarty go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next days function high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone-cold munchin'
Music comes on people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walking guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove
So come on fatso and just bust a move

Just bust a move

You're on a mission and your wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls just ugly faces
From frustration first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself, with a celibate rope
Your movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin' in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says ""Hello,
come sit next to me you fine fellow.""
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next hey bust a move

You want it, you got it,
You want it, baby you got it (Just bust a move)
You want it, you got it,
You want it, baby you got it

In this city ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""No way""
Girls are fakin' goodness sakin'
They want the man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no women and there you are
Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Lookin' for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on a beach perpetrating a tan
So a brother with the money can be their man
So on the beach you're strollin' real high rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove
So don't just stand there bust a move

If you want it, you got it
You want it, baby you got it (Just bust a move)
You want it, you got it,
You want it, baby you got it (Break it down for me fellas)

Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry
In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can
'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man
You say neat-o, check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
So you start thinkin' then you start blinking
The bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking
She thinks your kinda cute so she winks back
And now your feelin' really firm 'cause the girl is stacked
Reception's jumpin' bass is pumpin'
You look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wants to dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do G bust a move

You want it, baby you got it (Just bust a move)

Young MC,"Back in the day,
Growing up in Hollis Queens New York,
I used to play in the day til the day got dark,
And everyone around me knew everybody else,
No matter what you do, you're never by yourself,
School and homework were necessary evils,
Before you went out and daredeviled like Kenivel
Football and softball and be	-ball we played,
'Cause that's that we went about it back in the day

Now back in the day,
Block party's going on in the summer,
The echo in the street was the beat of the drummer,
Guys and girls dancing, and kids ran around,
When I got a little older, grab the mic and throw down,
I always rocked the party, I never was afraid,
Cause if you made a record you was gonna get paid,
Baby D was in there, and so was Super Rhymes,
And every single DJ had a pair of good times,
Now ? hooked me, and put me in the crew,
But 15 brothers made it something like a zoo,
When I got through, like the other crews around,
With Jam, Pete, Hollis Crew and Solo Sound,
But meanwhile, all the kids were getting into fashion,
Spend a couple dollars, hit the ave with a passion,
Trying to be in with the rest of New Yorkers,
Mock necks, knees, and a pair of British walkers,
The ?? to the turn to the ave for the shopping,
And once you got started, yo, there was no stopping,
And when it got cold there were coats to get inta,
Sheep dogs and goosedowns that keep you warm in the winter,
Collecting dust in my house today is some of the gear that I used to wear
Around the way,
You gotta dress to impress is what I always say,
'Cause that's the way you went about it back in the day

Back in the day I watched wrestling with Superfly Snuka,
A quart of ? and a strawberry bazooka,
5 for a haircut, and they can make it thorough,
And 50 cents can get you anywhere in the borough,
Karate movies came on Saturdays at 3,
The films were kind of cheap but they were dope to me,
Movie scores for 3 bucks, and 5 in the city,
So 20 was plenty, with someone who was pretty,
You had to have heart, though,
And suckers were forbidden,
Yes we were kids then, but no we wasn't kidding,
I often reminisce about the real good times,
Yo, I know it's not Georgia, but it's still on my mind,
Back when we used to have the partys in the park,
And crack wasn't nothing but a broken sidewalk,
You helped a brother out so he could make his way,
'Cause that's how you went about it back in the day,",Back in the Day,1993
Young MC,"Ah-yo, stop what you're doin, kid, here comes the tracks
From the heart to the head to the pen to the wax
And then to the store and the video channel
I'm not the Black Crows but I'm still 'hard to handle'

I don't wear sandals, I'd rather wear kicks
When I chill with the fellas and I watch the Knicks
See, I run things like Judge Wapner in the court
I'm like New York in the winter cause I take no shorts

Or no sports, but I know something too
Gimme the mic and 4 minutes and I show what I can do
Fu Man Chu was a famous oriental
And Katmandu made a funky instrumental

I don't get sentimental, even with a honey dip
My chorus line a rental cause I have a pink slip
And I won't flip as I make my way through this
So check it cause I got a record, yo, and we can do this

(What, what, a say what?)
Yo, we can do this

I make papers like an IBM
Most of my friends clock the ends so I'm down with them
I don't need nobody tryin' to sweat me or tryin' to get me 
Or tryin' to soak me like a Tetley

Tea bag, to slap on a feedbag
Playin' like Olive Oil but lookin' more like the Sea Hag
So don't pay me Tuesday for a hamburger today
Here's the pun and then some, you can be on your way

See, I'm sick of all the beefin' and the riffin'
From the hype and the pipe and the cocaine sniffin'
Walk around the way robotic
Thinkin you can get what you need to get from a narcotic

Girls ain't speakin', no, they're just freakin'
Livin' life fast like the last of the Mohicans
Think they know it all but they don't cause they clueless
So check it cause I got a record, yo, and we can do this

Yo, we can do this

(What, what, a say what?)
Yo, we can do this

Yes, we can do this like Brutus, play it like a flutist
Or jump it like a nudist parachutist
I'm not new to this, but you already knew this
That's too many rhymes at one time, so yo, screw this

I be bonin' like a skeleton, never wear Benetton
If I watch the base then I be watchin' Terry Pendelton
Love to eat Jellitan to keep my body toner
And if [Name] wore some Nikes she would of gone to Barcelona

So pick up the phone and call your friends
This is somethin' that be bumpin' from a Yugo to a Benz
I might make ends but I'm not in it for the money
You're not Lamont Sanford but you're still a 'big dummy'

I hang out with the honeys to pass the time
And I hang out with the homies to bust a rhyme
I draw the line at actin' dumb and actin' foolish
So check it cause I got a record, yo, and we can do this

I had to get your name number information
because certain body parts had inflimation

Now from planet to planet, and from star to star
It doesn't really matter, baby, just who you are
And from Earth to solar system, and to galaxy
It's real hard to get a ticket to hear Young MC
Because I rock like a professional, this ain't no lark
You either hear me at a party, or you see me in the park
I rocked the many places far away from my home
I guess that must be the reason why I'm so well known
I rocked from Iowa to Idaho, Canada to Mexico
I came into the place, you party people, just to let you know
My name is the Young MC, ladies want to come to me
And when they're in my arms, the ladies never ever front on me
Thinkin that you know the deal, boy, why don't you be for real
I love to rock the mic, and sometimes even rock the wheels of steel
Rock the place without a doubt, now I'm gonna turn it out
So listen very close, so I can tell you that it's all about

But I'm not Prince, Lionel Richie, or Patti Labelle
I'm not the Cars, the Pretenders, or the be	-52's

Cause when the music comes in, the beat starts thumpin

I'm the doctor on the mic, and yes, I'm so sure
That all you need is one visit, then you'll be cured

And now you know, just from those 12 lines
That a fella like me never falls behind
Cause I'm the cream of the crop, and the leader of the pack
Once you give me the mic, you know there's no turnin back
Because I got more rhymes then the other guys do
They're just a monkey, I'm the whole damn zoo
I can't use a book, I use a hefty bag
Because they're just a string, I'm the American flag
I got more rhymes than water seen by a sailor
More than husbands of Elizabeth Taylor
More than Babe Ruth has hit home runs

RHYMES - what are these things that I talk about?
Hear them in the walkman everytime you want to walk about
Never lost a battle in which I fought 
And if rhyme was a crime, I'd never get caught
I had to go to college, because I am an intellectual
I only sleep with women, cause I am heterosexual
Rock the microphone anyplace, anytime
That's why I had to write a jam and call it Got More Rhymes
Now as a consequence of this
I'd like to make some sense of this
And tell the party people all the reasons that I sent you this
RHYME that I continue to say
School starts in September, graduation in May
And when I graduate RHYMES'll keep comin
Girls try to flock and jock, but stop bummin
Cause I'm the kinda guy that you never want to toy with
And now you know that I'm talkin about the boy with
RHYMES

just say no, 'cause better save than sorry,
this is for real, this ain't no game or foley,
it's your life, and you've only got one,
so you better do it right or it will soon be done,
you want to be popular, you want to be cool,
you want to be the one that everybody likes at school,
you want be everything just for everyone else,
but you better think of what you want to be for yourself,
every day, people livin' in the same old mess,
hard to be original and not be like the rest,
you gotta go for what you know, you can't afford to guess,
and heaven knows what would happen if you did say yes,
so say no

Chorus:
Just say no,
do you hear me, say no
just say no

Verse 2:
kids O.D. and cause a family grief,
over the marjuiana plant and the coca leaf,
or a bunch of pills,
to try to get their thrills,
over a drug you shoot,
because you think's it cute,
over something you smoke,
man it ain't no joke,
over somethin you drink,
homeboy why don't you think?,
over something you snort like you were playing a sport,
one day you'll go to far and then you'll come up short,
some people out there don't seem to get my point,
telling others crack kills while their smoking a joint,
but the point of this song is to tell you the facts,
some people die from smoking wreffer like they die from crack,
not a drug in particular, but drugs in general,
they're not good for you, like a vitamin or mineral,
they come in liquid, leaves, powder, pills and rocks,
can put you six feet under on your back in a box,
so say no

Chorus",Just Say No,1999
Young MC,"Verse 1:
Now as I get to school I hear the late bell ringing,
runnning through the halls, I hear the glee club singing,
and as I get to the office I can hardly speak,
cause it's the third late pass that I got this week,
so to my first class I run and don't walk,
all I hear is my sneakers and the scratching of chalk,
and as I get to the room I hear the teacher say,
Mr. Young I'm very happy you could join us today,
I try to sit down so I can take some notes,
but I can't read what the kind next to me wrote,
and if that wasn't enough to make my morning complete,
as I try to get up, I find this gum on my seat,
so with the seat stuck to me, I raised my hand,
and said, exscuse me but can I go to the bathroom, maam?
the teacher got upset, and she screamed out no,
it's off the principal's office you go,

Verse 2:
12 o'clock comes with mass hysteria,
everybody rushes down to the cafeteria,
picked up my tray to have Thursday's lunch,
and as I tried the apple sauce, I heard it crunch,
I'm running up the stairs with my front tooth broken,
the nurse just laughed, and said you must be joking,
I looked up at her with a smile on my face,
no joke 'cause my front tooth is out of place,
so I walked to school with ice on my lip,
the nurse's late pass like a gun on my hip,
my books are real heavey, I'm walking, I'm dragging,
ain't no school lunch next week, I'm brown-bagging it,
forget class, I'm a shoot some ball,
with the late pass I got no trouble at all,
but then the nurse walks up and says what do you know,
it's office to the prinicipal's office you go

recess

Verse 3:
passing notes is my favorite pass time,
I can't wait to find a girl to pass mine to,
to express my feelings,
give me a week be	, and the girl' be dealing,
now one young lady was looking at me,
I said hi my name is Marvin, known as Young MC,
but then the ball rang, and the teacher came in,
and that's when the game of passin notes would begin,
I wrote the first note, told her she was fine,
and I hoped that the two of us could spend some time,
she wrote me back and told me you're fine too,
I'd love to go on a date and spend some time with you,
so then I sat there reeling, and looking at the ceiling,
words can't express the way that I was feeling,
then I though to myself, the sure way to get her,
is to write another note, oh yes, a love letter,
when I finished the note, it was ready to pass,
the teacher took it, and read it right in front of the class,
she read it word-by-word and line-by-line,
and everybody who was laughing was a friend of mine,
even then my girl was laughing, and it was too late,
for me to write another note 'cause there would be no date,
the teacher looked at me, and I said I know,
it's off to the principal's office I go,

yo, you think this is bad, wait til I get my report card",Principal's Office,1999
Young MC,"Roll with the punches is what I tell
To people when things don't go to well
When you go for the gold and you come back empty
When the ups are few and the downs are plenty
When you talk with the girl that you always desired
You busted a move but the move backfired 
When life puts you in the little crunches,
Don't give up you gotta roll with the punches

WORK
No matter what occupation,
Anytime is good time for vacation
Everyday's the same you can't believe the manotony,
So when the weekend come's it's like you've had a labotomy
You can't do a thing without the boss start yellin
It wouldn't be bad if his breath wasn't smellin
A good day's work for a good day's pay
But that's before uncle sam takes a portion away
Now a lot of times you feel just like quittin,
But without a job you're home alone sittin'
Checkin the want ads for jobs to fill
Watchin soaps geraldo and oprah and phil
Ny advice is to roll with it honey and soon you'll find that you'll be in the money
Expense accounts and three martini lunches,
And that's whatcha get when ya roll with the punches

You got ta roll with the punches

Roll wit it

Roll it baby

LOTTO
Take your chance for a dollar
If I win then I'll scream and holler
High on the hawn and it's definitely ???? in the lap of luxery 
I picked four numbers they were all okay for the fifth and sixth I used my birthday
But I erased my birthday and said better yet
I'll use the birthday of a girlie that I just met 
I filled out the ticket gave it a kiss for luck,
Handed it to the agent with a brand new buck
I went home and watched t.v. on a Saturday night,
Four numbers came up and they were all alright
Now what happened next really made me drop dead,
It wasn't her birthday it was mine instead
I said next time I'll just play with my hunches,
But what the heck I'll just roll with the punches

Roll wit it

You got ta go with the flow

Roll with the punches y'all

Like this

WOMEN
Let me tell you about 'em
Can't live with em can't live without 'em
The ones you like only seem to hate you,
The ones you hate only seem to date you
Girls will often tell you you come on too strong,
You got to take it slow to make the love last long
But I say the early bird catches the worm,
The late bird gets the girly with a two-dollar perm
Man that put me in a dillemma case-in-point a fly girl named Jemma
I met this lady at a quiet place,
About five years ago we were face to face
I stepped up to her tossed the first line
Like fishin I was wishin that the girl would be mine
I told my best jokes and she started smilin
A voice inside said ""yo dun you're stylin""
But then jemma really started actin silly,
'cause she broke up with her boyfriend billy
She wanted advice and started comin to me
I said you need Dear Abby and I be Young MC
Because I don't mind bein' a shoulder to cry on
But I need one who needs a body to lie on
Nowadays I got girls by the bunches
See I got smart and just roll with the punches

Roll it baby

You got ta go with the flow

Roll it baby

Nowadays I got girls by the bunches I got smart I just roll with the punches",Roll with the Punches,1999

Young Men from Memphis,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1959
Young Merc,"[Caddillac Tah]
Yeah..
Yeah, yeah, yo
I got a knack for pushin crack, and cookin raw coke
Fresh off the boat, no vest but I tote, and wear it like a coat
I'm starin through the scope, with one eye open and one shut
Zero in on the target, spark him and watch his head bust
Ain't shit to discuss, unless it's moneybags
or the SK-8, drop Jag with funny tags
Homey laugh now but die later when the lead dump
And double barrel slugs like Elmer Fudd, I'm handsome

[Black Child]
Some of your favorite rappers is flamin, I'm bangin things at them
They claim they gangster, lettin mens give brains to them
I aim the stainless, let the games begin
Bang bang dangerous, my gun gang famous
My hoes don't speak english, catch 'em at the foreign money exchange
New Armani leather in the Range
When you see my gang, tuck in your chain
We stuck in the game, we fuckin the same, bang!

[Black Child]
It's back to business, stackin riches
If you, act suspicious, it's a Wrap like Reynolds
Black Continental, mac outta the window
Black's out of his mental, I black out with pistols
It ain't confidential, all the shit I been through
Now I'm gettin money and a mill' is essential
Bang bang, nigga, 'til the day we die
A tooth for a tooth and a eye for a eye

[Caddillac Tah]
Nigga you know it's, business befo' pleasure, money over chicks
Dummies in the clip, nickel on my hip patrollin through the strip
Bet a stack, head crack, no rollin to the six
Scoop up my chips, then I split, with my beautiful bitch
Like Jada Pinkett Smith, for that paper I leave stinkin and stiff
Your pinky and wrist, and your necklace
Get removed nigga, my wolves is playin hardball
Leavin him bloody like a Pelican Bay yard brawl

[Chorus]
[Ja Rule]
Who want to know why I got so much beef with so many rappers?
Drama, it's the INC redrum spun backwards
Karma, is a muh'fucker watch your actions
Cause the clip to the max slips in bananas
I catch fire like matches {*whew*} then blow out
And the flyest crews goin the fastest
Pull up to the hottest club in New York, with my hazards on
No tags, I just drove it off the showroom floor
Straight cash, bout my paper, I'm on my gangster
Doin this shit for ten years, niggaz I'm major
Maybach and all that, same behaviour
Money over bitches, bitches over strangers
Guns befo' bangers but bangers do
For niggaz that had enough and ain't got no clue
that they can get slayed, flex and get sprayed
And spin they head like yo' hottest DJ's, motherfuckers!

Sold pieces for my reli, chasing peso

So I hop inside of my Mercedes and let the bass go
On you hating ass niggas
I deserve everything I get, A creating cash getter
I ain't putting the 2 on the 10
I'm making vast figures
You fags bitter, mad
Wanna be faking class with us
How they thinking they gonna come and conquer us?
Little Mini Cooper hating on a monster truck
Ponder such, I'll have you up in yonder, stuck
Not a nare nutta brother stutter that conjure a,
Nothing, nothing, The Ruger's penetration
Inside of ya head is what's sounding like it's bassing
Boom, Bing, Bang
All you haters in the game, Strange lane taking aim
Ain't a damn thing sane, I get it in
Want some drama? Well I can fit it in
We can make it so you're no longer a citizen
Suction from beneath you

All because I'm bringing the bucks in

Lost my homies to this shit, man

They go hard on the hustler
All these pussy niggas lacking
So us real niggaz suffer
Not plentiful for me no more

Pour some whiskey, Party with me

Talk with bananas and talk clips
Ride around and smoke kush with the yurner on me
Drink them champagne bottles with the flower on 'em
All that talking loud will get a nigga a hit
You see them cherry red chucks?
Yeah, I'm with the shit
Anyway I bounce out, man
I hit 'em up and I'll lock up with you

But ain't no love, like a calendar with no February's
I'm a need four secretary, and four bloody Mary's
I'm a go eat me some pussy, and choke up the cherry
I'm gone

Yeah
Fully loaded with it, to the ceiling with it
More money than you ever seen nigga
Aight, Drizzy, Drake

Look
Kill the game no one recovers the murder weapon
Young angel if ya hate me tell me burn in heaven
How'd you sleep on me, the highest earning freshmen
Like ya third infection, I hope ya learned ya lesson
Yeah

I own her heart and her mind, and the shirt she slept in
Bitch I got the answer, and still ain't heard the question
I shut ya club down, please reserve my section
Fuck a confrontation, there ain't no cakin' it
And I'm cakin' bitch, so tell me why I take a break from it
The mother of your child always tell you I'm her favorite
She call me her baby, not the one she was in labor with
She say 'oh you taste good', I say 'oh just savor it'
She know that she love a nigga, I be on that major shit
Cause I get paid to stand, and I get paid to sit
So I don't walk around with money, baby girl I'm made of it",F*** Da Bulls***,2009

Young Money,"Young Money, they go
Sittin' on the toilet, smokin' on some medicated
Countin' loose thousands, I'm living good, they aggravated
Two things on my mind, one is to keep stylin'
And the second is to get more of this shit that I'm counting
Call me J-2-0, I flow like a fountain
And I swear I beat the beat up till that bitch start ouchin'
Keep them bitches' asses bouncin', man we fly like a falcon
Comparing them to us is like a pebble to a mountain
I'm a uptown flamethrower young money fire starter
Had to sign to Wayne, I'm from the same place as ""Tha Carter"" Ha-Harlem
And I ain't like none of these other niggas
I get it, I spend it, your husband on a budget, Mrs.
Young Money cloud gang so above you niggas
Besides these groupies after the shows, who's fuckin' with us?
You might as well have a badge, the way you cuff them bitches
I slut them bitches, then back to the door, like fuck them bitches

Money talks, 
We say hello
And I'm so, I'm so
I'm so Young Moolah baby

OK it's too much paper and not enough hands to count it
Paper coming in money never going outward
Its young money yeah I hear a lot of niggas doubting
This here is God's work, ain't nothing you can do about it
So nigga join the team or you can catch the sideline
And just get out the game or get hit from the blind side
We makin' money while you niggas makin' petty quotes
You can make it rain, we make it flood like the levee broke
It's all about the paper, money control my whereabouts
About a year from now I'm tryin' to break that new McLaren out
Wheels of fortune on the whip, Vanna White in it
Bitch shotgun, probably be your wife in it
Hustle year round nothing come in front of that
Rap real estate and work, I can make a ton with that
Pay me in advance so I'm not coming bitch
Like Pain, Wayne and Mack Maine, I got money bitch

[Chorus]

Yeah, Young Money I'm the boss, you don't wanna come across
Money do somersaults, Bentley on young adults
Stuntin' on them hoes, it ain't me, its the money folk
Still make it rain, get struck by a money bolt
What it is though, I know what it ain't
Y'all go hard, I go to the bank
Check my check stubs, bitch it's Mack Maine
Young money up and runnin', join the campaign

Times ain't the same, shit been goin' bad
Bend a bitch over, pull some money out her ass
I'm tired of the game, 'cause it ain't what it was
The chopper's so close, I can give that bitch a hug
And a gangster need love, so I keep a gangster bitch
I got that dope dick, there ain't a bitch I can't addict
And I'm lookin' at the game, I roll my eyes
I looked at the clock and the hands were tied because

Watch how you run up on these businessmen, they're gang related
I said I like the way she dance, she like the way I made it
Fuck me without paying a rent, imagine if I paid it
I owe you one girl, I owe you one's

""Hoes down and bros up""
It's different when we show up, kicking doors up
I'm a young Stunna, young Wayne, I'm Young Money
I'm growned up like I'm new here but I'm nuclear
That's a bomb threat mothafucker, watch how blow up

I'm good, I'm reminded I'm good
From time to time I'm fine
I be spending time with the Greatest Of All Time all the time
And ever since I'm living life every night like it's '99
I'm way ahead of my time I think I was only 8 at that time
I rep them five letters forever
Will someone just tell the bartender to mix my drink
While I mix my thoughts of business in pleasure, I'm clever
Long money all around me
I just hope I live long enough, long enough to measure
We should take pictures sippin' Cristal in COOGI sweaters
And I'm still getting better nigga, what's better?
They said I never do it now I'm looking around like, nigga what's never?
And now they run from us when they see us, boy that money's pressure
Plots on the wall of every building that I walk into
Phone taps 'cause they curious, careful what you talk into
Living the star life you'll never know you'll run into
Like baby I can change your life
Just leave everything that you been through and rise

Long as my niggas right then we alright
Long as the women right then we alright
Long as the drinks on ice then we alright
Long as these private flights then we alright
Long as we living right then we alright
Long as it's high life then we alright
'Cause I love it more than anything (anything)
Boy it's money over everything, we've been alright

Yea, it's money over everything

Bag full of every president that ever died
Yea, spraying everything that's in the way

A million ones we can throw this shit a million ways
Youngin, if you alright then we alright
Night life GTV popping every night
Fly rich in a different city bright lights
With my niggas, rich gang and living high life
Yea, guns in the basement, millions in the wall, GTV cases

Audemars and cigars and them new toys

Long as my niggas right then we alright
Long as the women right then we alright
Long as the drinks on ice then we alright
Long as these private flights then we alright

Long as it's high life then we alright
'Cause I love it more than anything
Boy it's money over everything, we been alright

Do this shit for riz-zeal
Young Money, Rich Gang, ya heard me, with big ears
You just a crocodile, I drink a full cup of his tears
Can’t recognize you nigga, like Santa cut off his beard
And Tunechi, he gon’ be alright as long as he got his pills
I’m higher than my bitch bill, stop cryin bout' em', bitch chill
And I'm working on that Carter 5, I got this bitch in fifth gear
I can't stand these niggas, I'ma lie down or sit still
Get tied down with that fucking steel, at your eyebrow or your fucking grill
Catch you while you layed up, straight up, bunny ears
I shoot your fucking fade up, badges don't touch me
If that pussy smell like cat fish salmon trout or guppies
I ain't trippin on no ho, treat that ho like a servant
I know that ho better know, how to deep throat like a serpent
But lose lips shink ships, but I just let these hoes Worship
She think I'm a window of opportunity, close curtains, Tunechi

[Chorus]
Boy, look what you done started now
Ain't no stopping this or calming it down
Don't let me catch one of you fools out of pound
Heart is cold, be in war from the motherfucking cradle to the grave
Man, look what you done started now
Ain't no stopping this or calming it down
Don't let me catch one of you fools out of pound
Heart is cold, be in war from the motherfucking cradle to the grave

[Verse 1]
Cowards en traced all this anger and hatred
Gon' make me damage abrasion my attitude is very impatient
Nigga crossed me, first thing I wanna do is erase him
Yea he used to be my dog, but fuck a relation
Once he get money and fame, everybody starts aging
Shit ain't no longer the same, your own niggaz be hatin'
Can't see another brother succeed
So you backstab 'em just to see how long he'll bleed
But I'm a strong man, pops always told me never fear no man
That's why I'm scarred up on both hands
And never love a bitch, hell naw I can't trust a bitch
Fuck 'em and leave 'em, that's the way you thug a bitch
It's how a nigga was raised, with a heart full of rage
And I'm just too stuck in my ways (You hear me?)
Its how a nigga was raised, with a heart full of rage
And I'm just too stuck in my ways (So fuck y'all)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Dog I came here to prove your wackness
Bunch of useless bastards always frontin', moving backwards
This is hardcore, ain't no acoustic classic
Nigga swift for anything reserving using a ratchet
Competition stand 'em in line, cause without permission
I'm handling mine, occupation scramble and grind
Stop your facing, shank you with knives
You're missing a born soldier, operation declined
I'm like a optician, with a vision to shine
A hundred steps ahead of y'all, ain't no getting behind
Say what I choose 'cause I done payed my dues
Came from an error of pain and terror, a lot of rainy weather
I learned to survive through the hatred and lies
That's why from far away, I can spot a snake in disguise
And believe me dog we ain't scared, hope you came prepared

Drain the henny out your stomach and replace it with blood
You wish us to hell 'cause we too real
Selling two mills and still ain't afraid to pull steal
Ready Rock ain't concerned with y'all
I'm too big too strong for y'all
And I came too long for y'all, ya heard Pun
Takes years to earn a pair of Terror Squad balls
Heard you niggaz want it with us, a fatal mistake
Been blazing the game since niggaz fourth-aides
Crack is king, man the city is mine
And I ain't got no problem with bidding with +Shyne+
Here's the real deal homie, stakes is high
Look at the mirror man I bet you hate your life (Mu'fucker)

But I just want to thank you for everything
Without you, id be nothing

Listen mum, I know we had our arguements, but I'm sorry
I'll always be there for you, you don't have to worry
It's hard to say sorry, but I'm feelin like a man
I'm feeling so down, but I'm sure you understand
Without you, I don't think I could even breathe
Believe, I've cried sometimes, its gone so deep
And sometimes I wounder why, I can't even sleep

When everytime I try all I do is mess things up again
And sometimes late at night, I look outside my window and see you praying I wish for you
I think about what I'm going to say
When she finally walks my way
I can't even let her know how I'm feeling
Its driving me crazy
I'm loosing my mind when I see her
Kinda funny all the other girls tryna be her
All the other guys running around tryna see her

I wonder if..
I wonder if you ever felt this way
And I'm wondering if ill find the words to say
Wish I could read your mind
And let you into mine
If only you would try
I could change your life
Just wonder this sometimes
Just wonder this sometimes


I can see behind your smile
Thoughts you cannot hide
And I feel your calls for me
Now I don't even know where to start with you
You got me so confused but I will not loose
I know just what I'm going to say to you when she finally walks my way
I'm going to let her no how I'm feeling
No its amazing
I'm loosing my mind when I see ya
Ain't no other girl gna be ya
Other guys running round tryna please ya
I wonder if..
I wonder if you never felt this way
And I'm wondering if ill find the words to say
Wish I could read your mind
And let you into mine
If only you would try
I could change your life
They say that I'm wrong for you
When I know I'm right
They say that I'm rushing it when I know its time
And I know that you've got space for me in your life am I right

I wish I could hold you",I Wonder,2009

Young Noble,"Suge Shot Me
In today's music news: the ever controversial Tupac Shakur has
Just released another album under the alias Makaveli.
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
Street dates, in fear of a wipe out in retail interchart movement.
Although no one knows the exact 'cause of the new album;
Resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
Have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
Of not only Mr. Shakur, but of Death Row Records as well.
Nas, the alleged ring leader of it, is furious at Tupac
Excuse me Makaveli's verbal assault
On Mobb Sleep, Notorius P.I.G., and several other New York rappers
Jay-Z, from ""Hawaiian Sophie"" fame, Big Little whatever
And several other corny sounding motherfuckers
Are understandably shaken up by this release.
The question everbody wants to know is,
Why'd they get this nigga started?
Tupac, rather Makaveli, was not available for comment
But released this statement:

It's not about East or West
It's about niggas and bitches, power and money,
Riders and punks. Which side are you on?

These niggas is still fuckin' talkin?
You niggas still breathin? fuckin' roaches, aight
Aight, it's the Raid for your cockroaches

(All day, everyday)
It's the raid for you punk motherfuckers
(The pump in yo' ass)
This is it nigga! Killuminati style
(Outlaw lifestyle)
Makaveli the Don, solo shit, bring it!

Allow me to introduce first Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like the holy Qu'Ran
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My forty-five gun's next to me when we ride, for survival
Money makin' plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes 'cause they breath freely, see me ride?
Located world wide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Born on a dope fiend's titty, huh
In every city you'll find me
Look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, knahmean?
I hit the scene niggas duckin from my guillotine stare
I'm right there; my every word, a fuckin' nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs down to die for yours
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in 'em
Cut 'em down.. to Hell is where we send 'em
My whole team, trained to explode ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically, and I'm not gon' cry
Me - a born leader never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them my bitch nigga eaters
And not a whimper 'til I'm gone
Thug Life runnin' through my veins so I'm strong
(Ha ha ha)

Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas but I'm not gon' cry
I'm a Bad Boy killa, Jay-Z die too
Lookin' out for Mobb Deep, nigga when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yeahh-yeayy!
West coast ridah, comin' right behind ya
Should've never fucked wit me
I want money hoes sex and weed
I wont rest till my road dawgs free, bomb first!

We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or yo' life, and I'ma bomb first
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or yo' life, and I'ma bomb first

For so many days and some many ways we've been duckin strays
They delivers, but we still some Bad Boy killers
Got nothin' to lose, I gots no where to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli, be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission
Sent to do, what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause
Yes I'll die for the cause
Ya best believe if I'ma leave this bitch
Yo I'm dyin with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a muh'fuckin' Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made ""Paparazzi""
If you ain't in this rap game, for the motherfuckin' cash mayne

But I'm from Jerz and we don't play that shit
From the Claire down to Newark Bricks, all my niggas flippin chips
Gettin' rich, even though it's hard
Tryin' to creep through these halls and brawls
Without scarred by a revolv'
With no warnin' signs, 'cause yo my man took five
Now I'm the young one with the nine, ready to put in my time

Shoot first, look at they head burst bleedin'

Young Noble,"In today's music news: the ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur
Has just released another album under the alias ""Makaveli""
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist's
Street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail enter chart movement
Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album
Resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
Have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
Of not only Mr. Shakur, but of Death Row Records as well
Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac,
Excuse me, Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep
Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers
Jay-Z, from ""Hawaiian Sophie"" fame, Big Little whatever
And several other corny sounding motherfuckers
Are understandably shaken up by this release
The question everybody wants to know is:
Why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac, rather Makaveli
Was not available for comment, but released this statement:

It's not about East or West
It's about niggas and bitches, power and money
Riders and punks. Which side are you on?

These niggas is still fucking talking?
You niggas still breathing? Fucking roaches, aight
Aight, it's the Raid for you cockroaches

Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like the holy Qur'an
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My .45 is next to me when we ride, for survival
Money-making plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes cause they breath freely, see me ride!
Located worldwide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Colder than a dope fiend's titty
In every city you'll find me
Look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, know what I mean?
I hit the scene, niggas ducking from my guillotine stare
Right there, my every word, a fucking nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs: down to die for y'all
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in them
Cut them down, to hell is where we send them
My whole team: trained to explode, ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry
Me: a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them ""my bitch-nigga eaters""
And not a whimper until I'm gone
Thug Life running through my veins so I'm strong
Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas but I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer, Jay-Z die too
Looking out for Mobb Deep: nigga, when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay
West coast rider, coming right behind you
Should have never fucked with me
I want money, hoes, sex and weed
I won't rest until my road dog is free, bomb first

We bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider before you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first

For so many days, in so many ways, we've been ducking strays
They delivers, but still we some Bad Boy killers
Got nothing to lose, I got nowhere to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission
Sent to do what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause
Yes, I'll die for the cause
You best believe, if I'ma leave this bitch
Yo, I'm dying with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a motherfucking Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made ""Paparazzi""
If you ain't in this rap game for the motherfucking cash, mane
Then what is your motherfucking purpose? None can serve us
E.D.I. Mean born worthless
That's until the day I decided to bomb first, bitch

Your style wack as ever like you was rocking patent leather
Causing massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper, half drug kingpin
You're telling fairy tales, dunn
""King of New York"" like you the motherfucking one?
But I'm from Jers' and we don't play that shit
From the Clare down to North Bricks, all my niggas flipping chips
Getting rich even though it's hard
Trying to creep through these halls and brawls
Without scarred by a revolve
With no warning signs, cause yo, my man took 5
Now I'm the young one with the 9 ready to put in my time

Shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider before you die

And we don't tote six-shooters, we tote Glock nines
And we don't smoke a peace pipe, we smoke fat dimes
It's a place where it's a common site to see the 5-0
Hit the other side of sixteen and get ya mind blown
Fo sho', it's a different vibe from being downtown
Then when ya come into the ghetto and ya can't come back out
I seen the ghetto shut down, seen niggas shot up
Seen niggas get knocked the fuck out and never got up
The neighborhood paralyzed, crack drive-bys
It's evident we hurt, you ignored our cry
On the outside the ghetto just another mind state
And import more minorities to help the crime rate
I ain't looking for a job, fuck working the part-time
When we could come up on some dough, with good combs and slang dimes
I see this all the Goddamn time, it's fucked up and it's the truth
Never mind a shooter on the roof
It's a war going on right here, where we at
I can't complain about what I can't change, so why adapt?
Dropped outta high school in tenth grade so I rapped
But still, can't seem to get this monkey off my back
Fuck it, I pulled a few moves and ride for the streets

We want the fame

One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

Though we exist and breathe some believe currency comes to G's 
Stresses after battle with success comes greed (echo) 
They got me hot When they shot me 
Plotted my revenge 
To increase my ends 
Enemies gettin' dropped 
Win or lose 
Red or blue 
We must all stay true 
Play the game nigga 
Never let the game play you 
And for the fame 
Niggas change fast 
That's a shame 
What's the game 
Lost souls 
Who controls our brain? 
Who can I blame? 
The world seems strange at times 
Somewhat insane 
I'm hoping we can change with time 
I'm living blinded 
Searching for refinement 
Curse, I know death follows me 
But I murder him first 
And worse yet 
With each breathe 
Steps I take 
Breathless 
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish? 
Cigar ashes 
Coaster 
Crystal glasses 
We mash on them jealous bastards 
With a ski mask 
I'm the first one to warn them 
Blast it 
Wrapped in plastic 
Bullshitting got his ass hit (outlaws) 
Ain't nothing left now 
Treated like a stepchild 
Was not for me 
Nothing but busters and bitches (fuck 'em all) 
Be rocking beats 
Fake in fame 

Block run and shoot slugs 
We throw them back like hardballs 
Without the gloves 
No love for these fake desperados 
And thugs I bleed to envy 
Smoke and blow out they blunts 
Sipping Henney 
Drunk nights 
And hot days 
Cocking my heat shooting it sideways 
A wife on the run 
Full of common blunts 
Unconditionally married 
To my gun 
Fulfillin' my destiny 
On knees 
And ones desires 
Be pulling all my cabbage like priors 
Stuck in the trance searching for something higher 
Fortune and fame

Lost in the rain 
A lose of the game 
With life the cost of the game 
We forcing the change 
Mother fuck flossing the chain  
All the blame 
Belongs to the part of the brain (
That we never use nigga 
Plus my heart is in pain 
And if I ever lose homey 
Bet I'm at it again 
Outlaws don't die 
So united we stand 
And if family come before 
All the fortune and fame 
 
As I walk up in the crib 
Laid to rest my head 
Say some rhymes to angels 
Hope they bless my bed 
Hope they bless me the righteous way 
Got a homie locked down 
Outta town 
I sent him a kite today 
Man that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it dog 
Praying for my downfall and I can sense it dog 
I was passed down the street fame 
Like glock clocked and keep aim 
Was raised up with a clock box 
And I ran with the local street gang 
They say the light is faded 
But still shine in the dark 
You can easy been a man 
But you is a boy in your heart 
And that's some game that I got 
From generation of game 
In the road of life dog 
We need to switch up lanes 
Think about it 

One thing we all adore

Nothing but pain

The one thing we all adore

Stuck in this game

I can't complain 
I've seen my fair share of the fame 
It won't change me 
Now I've got this piece of change 
I feel strange I got so used to the hood 
That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good 
I was just a baby still retarded from slavery 
When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me 
Ghetto ain't made me I made myself 
Poverty raised me thinking ain't no help 
I pray for my health my mind and my family too 
State of myself my grind and my family crew 
Where one hand watches the other 
No we ain't blood 
But we still real brothers 
The struggle is real 
Nothing can steal 
What we build 
And that remains the same 
'Till that day we killed 
And that's real 
Life that I was aimed to be 
Love by my family tree 
That's fame to me 
How about it 

One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain

And ugh

I started out dumb sprung off a hood rat
Listening to the radio wishing that I could rap
But nothing changed I was stuck in the game
'Cause everybody in the industry was fucking me man
Listen I've got a scheme break away do my own thing
Drop some conversation sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas they want to see me rise
'97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
And if I catch another case ], lord knows how they hate me
Got a playa in the court room please don't let them frame me
I've been dealt a lot of bad cards living as a thug
Count my blessings don't stress in this land with no love
Maybe if they see me rolling look at all this green I'm holding
I guess that's why the envious get their eye swollen
Hoping the heavenly father love a hustler
Be the hardest nigga on earth to ever bust a nut
My homies tell me have a heart fuck they feelings
I've been trying to make a million since we started
We cold hearted, niggas in masks that'll blast at the task force
Empty out my clip time to mash they asked for it

You can be a ridah and ride, or a coward and hide
Either way you go against me, you still gon' die
I got four macs, a few nines, I'm ready for beef
You wanna talk, it ain't about money, then let it be brief
I need a drop for when it's a hot, a hummer for when it's cold
An ill attorney's in my corner when these fake niggas fold
The shit I kick fuck with niggas mentally, makes them wanna mention me
And see me doing a quarter century in the penitentiary
Nastradamus predicted 50's the future, that's a fact money
I run up on your workers with the mac, like where that pack money
I'm a tell y'all what papi told me
I got what you need, 19,5 a key
I stay catching a stunt, frontin' in somethin' mean
And I'll clap any nigga for the right amount of cream
Run up on them all with the same problem solver
Beat up ass, tape on the handle, trey eight revolver
What!

'Cause then we gonna run up in your spot
Screamin' get the fuck on the floor, give us the ro'

I'm like sugar Shane Mosley, it ain't no beef
You're staring, a ticket holder that sits in row three
Next to Ron Artest and Kobe
Yo I woulda went pro too, then I let them Phillies slow me
I'm like a black man's asthma, seeking a pump
Breathin' deeper when I'm creeping up
Y'all need to fuck with the tightest, I stick niggas
Encephalitis leavin' whole families in silence
My virus is obvious, past on to most rap fiends
Uncured, ain't no vaccine
Last seen at the automatic teller machine, maxing out
Or in the studio booth, blacking out
It's con-ed style, real twisted, I disappear on some Blair Witch shit
Comin' back I'm rich kid
Either or, you can't stop me with my feet in the door
Or walk away from the street or the morgue, play your part, nigga.

Tatted on they arms, pimp your moms, like I'm magic Don Juan
From queens to Hong Kong, weed in the bong
We smoke that, leave our minks on the coat rack
Those that plot on me, nine times outta ten the nine is on me
Feds search the god, but nothin' they find on me
When I rap don't wait to clap applaud sooner
Unless you hate a nigga like George Bush Jr., I bring awkward to you
Porsche maneuvers through the city like new york sewers
Stinkin' up the air, central park, horse manure
Rims is 22 inches, Benz suspensions
22 inch dick when I'm pimpin'

And the Game behind the desert is a nightmare dog

Can't breathe then it's probably the desert, if you a gangsta or not
I give a fuck dog, bullets is hot

And every nigga gonna cry when he hit, the more pain
The more blood drain, he ain't surviving shit
And your niggaz ain't gonna ride for shit, they know
If they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit

Red rag or blue rag, niggaz die for this
The Game the reason all these niggaz on that ""Cali Love"" shit
Compton niggaz get grimy too, pull you out of that 6
Fuck you up like one time will do

And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard
Coming hard, Doogie Howser pulling bullets out your jaw
Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket
You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it

We left a stain on your block, you came with a cop
Pointing fingers at them niggaz, that kept shit hot
Next to 'Pac, I'm the hottest thing out, homey we can bang out
Outlaw air it out, box 'em in, square it out

Learn about your whereabouts and we right there
Me and Game have you left right there

We bubble with ease, and I double my cheese

I got niggaz out in Compton that'll find yo' ass
I got niggaz out in Jersey, that'll hide yo' ass
For a long time if you ever fuckin' with mine
It's a thin line dog between the real and the fraud

All-white bricks
Off-white bricks
Light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for 50 more bricks
Balling like a bitch with all these bricks
Bricks!
36 zips
That's a whole chick
Want a bad bitch? Gotta have bricks
Yeah that makes sense
Yeah, I make hits
But I still take bricks

I'm like a waitress in the trap: I've got something to serve
That's 16 bars, same price for a bird
What you need, a bird? Or a couple pounds?
I'm on Cleveland Ave...you know my side of town
So many bricks I can build my own apartment
You better check when you come in my department
Yes I break em down and I sell em whole
Try me, watch your whole crew fall like some dominoes
I got a trap house and a trap car
100,000 off a cap: that's a trapstar
All this smoke got me feeling real nauseous
Riding with them bricks got me feeling real cautious

Bricks!

Couple choppers just in case they wanna go to war

Young Redd,"Hi, this is the Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous
Today we're interviewing Lil' Flip (what's up man)
So Lil' Flip tell me, how long have you been rapping
(man I've been rapping ever since)...

[Lil' Flip]
1995, I was in junior high
I saw a lot of shit, so I was glad to be alive
A lot of people died, but a lot of people here
And when I turned 15, my vision got clear

It's time to be a man, time to make a plan
It's cool to make a hundred, but it's best to make a grand
My Granny got sick, and then they found cancer
We got to pay the doctors, but God got the answer

The surgery went good, my Granny doing well
My baby on the way so I can't go to jail
And to my niggas on the block, stop selling rocks
'Cause I'm a tell the truth you can't outsmart the cops

You see what I did, I only drop hits
Chopping up game, why'all chopping up bricks
And some niggas snitch, cause they can't take the heat
How we gone go buy a system when the system got his beat

[Young Redd]
Hey, I'm from the home of the Astros, home of the Rockets
Born to rap yo, with a microphone in my pocket
Always thought I was grown, you couldn't tell me nothing
I would talk shit if you tried to tell me something

But I regret that, I had some minor setbacks
Old people thought my future would be jet black
All my years growing up, I thought life was a game
You can't make it real far, thinking life is a game

Yeah we lost a couple of friends, I almost lost my brother
I don't know what would of happened if we lost eachother
Everyday is something new, I just take it in stride
You only got one life, so enjoy the ride

Sometimes I was paid, sometimes I was broke
Me and Gray started hustling but my mama didn't know
But it's cool, cause now I'm into this music
The man gave us a gift and we loving to use it

And if you look real close you'll see
That you can only be you, and I can be me
'Cause can't nobody ever live my life but me
But you will never see what I see like me huh me

[Chorus: x 2]
And you don't know what I've been through
So you shouldn't judge me
And you don't know what I will and I won't do
So you shouldn't judge me

[Lil Ron]
It's getting harder now I just don't understand
Why the people in the world disgrace the black man
All that I could say, is pray and let it be
Little right and try your best not to end up like me

See I was the nigga that slang dope and steal cars
Glad I stopped before it led behind bars
Heart aches and scars, help me feel my way
Understand today I got a decision to make

Now do I want to live right or continue going wrong
I'm never at home this music keep a nigga gone
But this is what gets me, who are you to judge
'Cause I'm young and black, people still hold a grudge

Just a nudge right now'd push me over the end
When I was 14 I lost a very close friend
And ever since then my life ain't been the same
That's the biggest reason why I had to make a change

[Lil' Flip]
Never judge a book by it's cover, a man by his wealth
And if you already on your feet why don't you help somebody else
This what I was taught, so that's what I live by
'Cause you can't take none of this shit with you when you die

So everyday I try, to keep my head high
But these bird ass niggas always jump fly
Should I take em out the game, naw I'ma use my brain
I'm a kill em with kindness, and blow up my name

I came from nothing, and now I got a little change
A nigga happy now but I went through some pain
And everyday it rain, there's gone be some sunshine
I never thought I could put my whole life in one rhyme

[Chorus: x 2",What I Been Through,2002
Young Redd,"[Talking]
For the hoe ass niggas
This for the niggas, hoe ass niggas
Look at the nigga right next to you, look at him
Is he real, is that nigga real, is that girl real
Is that girl real, huh

[Chorus]
He a hoe, he a hoe, he a hoe, he a hoe
If that nigga owe you money, he a hoe
She a hoe, she a hoe, she a hoe, she a hoe
If that hoe won't let you fuck, she a hoe
He a hoe, he a hoe, he a hoe, he a hoe
If he don't want to sell you weed, he a hoe
She a hoe, she a hoe, she a hoe, she a hoe
If she don't want to give you head, she a hoe

[Lil' Flip]
They call me Thunder Cat, cause I got so many hoes
They call me cookie man, cause I sold so many o's
Did a lot of shows, made a lot of cash
Slid out the Benz, jumped in a jag
Jumped out the Jag, then I hopped in a Hummer
Guess what I drop, underground this summer
But get ready, for the shit about to hit the air
And bitch you ain't smoking endo, so I don't care

[Chorus]

[Lil Ron]
Say Flip, look at all these hoes
Some are girls, but its niggas also
I'm tired of getting attention, when walking in places
Niggas is hating, I'm fin to hurt they faces
Change the paces, winning the races
Money I'm making, cookies a nigga baking
Feeling my status, above average
Lil Ron be ready for all that static

[Lil' Flip]
We got automatics, nigga we still thuggin'
Nigga we still hustlin', all the hoes still loving
The way that we flowing, the cars that we driving
The way that we hustle, that's the way we surviving
Going to shows, going to clubs
Riding on Blaze, riding on Dubs
We from the south, we country as hell
why'all smoking that brown weed, we got that funky smell
The dro and the do-do, the blueberry endo
Riding on low-lows (Flip there go the po-pos)

Step out, let me see your license
And your insurance (nah, cause)

You a hoe, you a hoe, you a hoe, you a hoe
If the laws pull you over, he a hoe
She a hoe, she a hoe, she a hoe, she a hoe
If she want child support, she a hoe
He a hoe, he a hoe, he a hoe, he a hoe
If he fucked up your car, he a hoe
She a hoe, she a hoe, she a hoe, she a hoe
If she tear up your Bentley she a hoe

[Redd]
I ain't never been the type, to be in love with a hoe
Instead I'm trying to leave, out the club with a hoe
A basket case, I spit in a bastard's face
Walk in, crash the party, and trash the place
Fuck it I tried to tell em, some niggas wouldn't like it
Too bad, you should of seen it coming like a psychic
Then its, back to the Benz that's sitting on chrome men
Waving at the hoes, yelling aiight then

[Chorus]

[David Banner]
Ki's from over seas, for me that's just some cain
30 g's and robbing lanes, that's just some change
Bows from them hoes, you know, that's just them thangs
Listen to my pimp game, listen to my pimp game
Yeah fuck em, my nuts let em suck em and let em go
Mississippi, p-p-p-pimping, mayne fa sho
Coming down, gripping grain up on the do'
On the flo man you slow, and not knowing that she's a hoe
You give her all your feelings, she giving me all your do'
I'm shopping all day, for Polo and hydro
Weed greed man, her pussy is what you need
I'll fuck her in the puss, she giving you all them seeds

Young Rising Sons,"I feel a lack of gravity, lost the weight of love
Feel my demons pulling me, but I won't give up
Hollow chains cut into me, tangled up on tongues
Ghosts that came to set us free, they lift us up
To kingdom come

We are the stars and the suns
The unforgettable ones say
(Wooooh oooooh)
And when we reign from above
The undefeatable ones say
(Wooooh oooooh)
The undefeatable ones

We are, the undefeatable ones

Here among the fallen leaves, can you feel it in your bones
There's a fire burning bright, that will free your soul
Can you see it in the moonlit sky
We can leave this world behind
We don't need no gravity, no
We don't need no gravity

We are the stars and the suns
The unforgettable ones say
(Wooooh oooooh)
And when we reign from above
The undefeatable ones say
(Wooooh oooooh)
The undefeatable ones

We are, the undefeatable ones

So I stood up straight and took my time catching my breath
I brushed off the dust and then I buried all the stress
I feel like I'm ready, I'm ready to go
I'm ready to make my way home

We are the stars and the suns

Niggas been waiting on trade like whats the hold up
My only mission in life was to blow up they ask what I throw up
You know what I rep and I'm one of the best
Supervillian in the building I'm clearly a threat
Been doing this here for a minute considered a vet
A lot of niggas want me to fail cause they know that I'm next
That's damn near I'm possible this game ain't got rid of me yet
I fell of and I crawled and regaining my steps
This time around I'm ma give all till I'm gaspin' for breath
I stay silent on a lot of shit quiet is kept
But I don't know too many niggas with silent success
So I write it all down to get it off my chest
The weed we break it all down to get off the stress
Niggas hate (fuck em) cause they know that we the best
It ain't my fault I do this shit breakin' a sweat

I'm just laid back chillin' posted
Living like a villain mostly
High off this purple shit
No lie I'm flyin' I'm so roasted
Money bitches
?
Bring them through my ups and downs life is like a roller coaster

The more I smoke the smaller the doobie get
They takin' shots at the jets on some john woo movie shit
All blanks I'm unscaved untouched on my way to the bank wtf
For tryna play spitta you shall forever remain with out a name
Lames know what I claim
Upset they all throw up my set from the sunroof of my car
Seats butter boogets 
Bitches crumbling nuggets I'm feeling lovely and blessed
Tribeca and bubbies I'm enjoying a lemon press not that many made crap
They squeeze these lemons they selves
The hearts of women melt 
When trilla lyrics are felt
Olympic swimming in bitches Micheal slash Leon Phelps
High bread weed money tree slang for dummies
Get it crackin' like lobsters ice vodka in the

Then I say a few poems and buy my moms a new home
Spitta kush king, bong next to my throne
Scribble in my notepad 'bout my city's wrongs
And I try to make it right through these songs
It's niggas tryna make it through the night, let alone make a million
Get it on nigga and show off when you get it

And on the set, shit get live, it's all action
But where I'm from, shit get real, it's no acting
In the 12th grade with 20 grand in my khakis
Life under the scope, them bitches keep looking at me
But picture living where these niggas don't feel a thing
This wicked world got a nigga numb, free from pain
And all that dirt I did, I still remain without a stain
So I twist it, smoke it by myself, clear my brain

Them sober nights drove a nigga damn near insane
I saw it all but never will I tell a thing
Can't think of one thing to lose, and 'bout a million things to gain
So I charge this to the game
But soon as I got my change, they say I changed maine
They told me state my name, I'm Roddy from the planes maine
These unfamiliar faces lookin' at me strange maine
But I'm no lame, these niggas know what I claim
I keep it trill to the jet, I put that shit there on the Jets

Through the lights, cameras, and flashes bong snappin' and action, I'm
Focused on this paper, money transactions is what I'm after playa
Was taught as a youngin' to move smart and get my weight up
Federal reserves papers by the layers, and weed by the acres
Bitches by the dozen, just watch me come up from nothin' hata
Greater things await for those who remain patient
Yeah that's real talk, matter fact a true statement
But still I grind 'cause in the end I want more than Nathan

Smokin' kush, tryna ease them thought with vapors
But my mind stuck on gettin' big faces
Racin' toward the guap, these niggas still chasin'
Runnin' in place, tryna catch up with they replacements
Made it to the majors, live from the basement
Straight to the rooftop with spacious living spaces
With cases of the Clicquot, trees in different flavors
Runnin' the game the OGs gave us",On G's,2011
Young Roddy,"About to land chances on suckers houses
Homey come about it that side shit
You call your girl crib in the bed while she bumping my shit
You mad I'm at the crib cutting open vacuum bags
Pouring some of that potent for the true smoking shit my homey head
Last time I was in Cali told him he had to send me that
Ship it to the city, so I could mess some ? with them mama 
Tell them hit some of this sticky with me

Just being rhymey make her slippery, sexy pajamas when she visit me
Her friends fall through, with louder that, over talking, baller stalking
Search for eye contact so they could double back and ass G
When I have some time free, but honestly
Building this empire taking a lot of me
It will be worth it though, she good right now you found my lighter
And my grinding had to be perfect yo
And it's still, and it's still jets central motherfucker

And I stand here, get up from the feet up
Paper on my mind, my chick scrolling that weed up
Baby smoke it up, I ain't tripping I just read up
She thought real niggers was dead I made her a believer
Now she us, we a different breed
Come planning from a different species, young ? to keep it
My life is like a movie but I'm living out the scenes
I'm pulling x for the Rex I'm all about the cream
By any means a hustling scheme will fulfill my dreams

A better living fatter pockets, prettier women
Super sticky weed I'm puffing late up in the villa
South east suite metro post smoking and chilling
Waiting on my bitch to come through with some more killer
Hit her with the Deals she in love with the villain
But my mind focus on writing raps and chopping spittas
Can I get a witness to this G shit that I'm spitting
Will, it's still, it's still, jet central motherfucking

OK, girl, where shall I begin?
I told her about my lifestyle she said I'm all in
She say most niggers change you ain't nothing like them
So I got her high as hill, I'm talking the butter rim
But I never cared, mama blow it in the wind
Ain't too much changed since back then
But now I got a couple different ways to make my ends
They wouldn't last a minute if they'd live what I live

They couldn't walk a mile in these Jordan's number ten
I got that shit off like think you come again
Such a scary risk but that risk got me rich
So, where my cash for that's worth
That's why I'm buying the bridge at bay when I get it in 
Haters know the set that I rub to the end
It's crazy I keep in my ear, telling me to get paid, my reply bet I will
And it's still, and it's still central motherfucking, yeah",Still,2011

Yellow gold, January cold, my mink
I'm from the the school of old, check out my ring
I won a super bowl of hash, I saw the Mona Lisa blink
Not falling off my ass
Cause I lean like the Tower of Pisa on stained glass
At the church, funeral services for this beat
Niggas tryna steal my style, I can hear 'em in my sleep
Like young thieves outside tryna break in your Z
28 or your Double S, they hit your Trans-Am
For your big nose hood and you know them fools man
And I swear that ain't no good, but I'm not surprised
Cause it's all fair in the game
Of fucking these bitches due to your street fame
This shit's wicked, deserves a documentary
Dead stocks on my feet, I'm walking ancient history
Niggas is beast hype, tryna be like what we write
Ain't nothing but that Jet Life

I'm talking stacks in the walls, floors, ceilings
A house made of money, feel what I'm building
(Cause this rap shit just my hustle baby, we paper chasing)
(Cause this rap shit just my hustle baby, we paper chasing)

I'm talking pounds in the fridge, hundred stack in the armoire
Constant reminders of what the fuck we grind for
(Cause this rap shit just my hustle baby, we paper chasing)

Still at it, Jet Set mathematics
I'm, from the city of choppers clappers and levee crackage
All levels completed, bitch I'm All-Madden
Smoking out the E-Class wagon
It's just that ""to the airport"" action, I am more Mr. 2 Door
Still running triple O game on my new hoes
More than one time was I told that I was too cold
Gucci Mane, tryna be grizzly burr on these hoes
Foundation laid, and from that, a mansion rose
When my driver bring yo bitches home, ask her how that Caddy roll
You can tell that she was with daddy, just smell her clothes
Money and smoke, that's all I know

I'm talking stacks in the walls, floors, ceilings
A house made of money, feel what I'm building

Young Rome,"This is a deep story, a very deep story
The life of Young Rome, picture me
In the hood playin' hidin'-go-get-it
With a slingshot in my back pocket
Just bad as hell, that's me

Those were the best times of my life
(I gotta give it up)
Those were the best times of my life
(To the greatest niggas of my life, Marques Houston)

Those were the best times of my life
(LDB, if I could change anythin')
Those were the best times of my life
(I wouldn't change nothin' at all)

Listen up, I remember growin' up in the streets of menace
Where the boys turned thugs, I was labeled a menace
A little bad nigga, momma use to whip my ass
I'm playin' football on the concreted instead of the grass

I remember meetin' Chris Stokes, Taz kicked me
Out the whole bunch, man the whole hood had jokes
'Til we came out with the Da Munchies
That's right Romeo, Batman and Half Pint

We was the first to pull up black street and Destiny?s Child
Had to replace Half Pint 'cause his parents wasn't down
With lettin' him ride, we fasted adversity early
Then God blessed us with LDB

New LP, tours, freakin' girls at 13
Young, black and missive, just livin' my dreams
Interviews, photo shoots, young teen in zoo suits
Hearin' grown women sayin', ""They so cute""

(Them was the days, man)
Those were the best times of my life
(Yeah, those were)
Those were the best times of my life
(And I still think back on 'em)

Those were the best times of my life
(And it makes me feel so good)
(But here's another chapter of my work)
Those were the best times of my life
(Half Pint need ya'll listen to this real good)

It felt good to see Marques go solo, I stood by his side
His dreams was my dreams, so the love will never die
I remember when we first met B2K
I knew God was with us and gave us brighter days

Seein' them grow, meant more to me then seein' them blow
I miss hearin' Fizz callin' me big bro
My love will never change Druex Pierre
I'm in the poof without you and I wish you was here

It's like the game was designed to kill us
Raz and Boog, I miss you, I hope this music can heal us
I remember us playin' ball and wildin' out
Shinin' together, alternatin' whips, livin' in the same house

Tappin' chicks out on the same couch
Never thought fame and money would take us this route
But the good out weighed the bad, I'm happy
To see you alive and well, I ain't mad but I miss you nigga

Those were the best times of my life
(Yeah, those were)
Those were the best times of my life
(And I always had love for my niggas, no matter what)

Those were the best times of my life
(Let's go)
Those were the best times of my life
(Yo, this is for my niggas on the block, another chapter)

Yo, I am not God, I cannot judge, I refuse to look down
Upon my thugs while they push they product
And bust slugs, I remember seein' chest bang
And dudes, I looked up too on the block slangin'

Tellin' me my thang is makin' the music and anythin' is bad
For you if you abuse it, so we equivalent in the sense
And what I learned from back in the day I hope you youngin's
Follow my footprints, follow my footprints, follow my footprints

Those were the best times of my life
(Yeah, I swear to you they were)
Those were the best times of my life
(I just thank y'all for lettin' me)
Those were the best times of my life
(Read a couple of chapters out the book of my life)
Those were the best times of my
(And they really were)

Those were the best times of my life
(C'mon y'all, just clap with me)
Those were the best times of my life
(Just pray with me)
Those were the best times of my life
(Show love with me)
Those were the best times of my life
(Put your hands with me)

Those were the best times of my life
(Yeah, yeah)
Those were the best times of my life

[Rome Rap 1:]
I'm so hood and I can't change
Rip blocks from Venice
All the way to Fullton to Saint James
LA to BK
Young Rome and I'm serious
Born hustler more clever then my nemesis
Pop bottles like I'm Michael Jordon in the 90?s
Six ring all I do is big things
Fall sickin
My taste
Big ass, small waist
Flawless face
Really don't matter the race
Cause we all black as soon as the lights go out
If the head good I might show out
If its right I'm tight like a feen
When dis pipe blow out
The fifth ward
Let a psycho out
Young Rome like a redneck with his rifle out
what's that glow, mami ice no doubt
Rhinestone never
We have conference calls with Jacob
Been like this ever since I got my cake up
Pick up the dirt off the concrete and shake up
Been caring my timbs since B2K break up
I'm like Patton with no Shaq, Kobe the mailman
One word that don't compete in my brains is failing man
 
[Chorus]
Mami show a little flesh ,let me see you ma
Put a little Cris on tits, rub it in ya ma
Let your boyfriend go he's a chi-chi man
Put a little Cris on tits, rub it in ya ma
 
[Rome Rap 2:]
We bag more then broads
We bag cities
You can have those hood rats with those t-bag tities
Rome gotta like him I'm slappin these dudes silly
Rip the nerve out your body that don't feel me
I rock the party like Bizzy be	 in his prime
I'm cool as an AC I'm not Busta Rhymes
No disrespect but I'm smooth as a Jazz artist
But live as the Roots
Homey I'm beyond the hottest
I'm not a star
I'm the sun
Not number two
I am the 1
I am not a rose
I am the gun
And I spit for the half niggas sleep on cots
Started from nothing 
Dreaming of boats and yachts
Man I use to dream a lot but then I stop sleepin
Got on my grizzle and kept bizzy
Got my mind right, money right
Never tricked
Chicks mad cause I'm tight
Cheap as a birds language
I ain't the one mami
 
[Chorus]
Mami show a little flesh ,let me see you ma
Put a little Cris on tits, rub it in ya ma
Let your boyfriend go he's a chi-chi man
Put a little Cris on tits, rub it in ya ma

Think willy?s a trick?
Have Diddy sippin on Cris on some silly shit
I don't drink from yellow bottles
I like my liquor brown as just jo
Hold a grudge no
I erase enemy?s like Bubba fat
Take stars to ball
Clap like the grammy awards
Down hits, seven up
Spit hit, seven up
Missed seven enough
Shredem up
Setem up, wetem up
Shock won't letem up
Hittem twice more cause he ain't dead enough
Call me iron man
Think I'm sexy now
You should see me in my boxer
You think my flow is obnoxious 
I got old donuts in my refrigerator
Harder then you
You niggas know how we do
What bitch!!!

I'm half amazing my homeys blazin
And dey don't hit the club till they look Asian
See you could blind fold em wit a shoe string

I'm so rookie you'd think I was satins advocate
I'm bad bruh bad as JLo so call me Affleck

Platinum status so I treat hoes like they the media
I keep em off me no replies or comments
And haters can go out the same way that saddam went 
'cause you cannot hide and you cannot run
And most of you niggas will die by the gun
'cause rap is outta control
And everybody frontin' like they heart is as cold as the North Pole

To free your mind from you fakers
Be wrong if I cried 
Talk about muttering locks in every soda crack rock

Get yo mind right nigga

I'm here now, I'm here now
I don't think y'all niggas heard me
I can't be stopped at this point

Young Rome,"[repeat throughout] the Lord is watching over me
Fa real
Yo, I believe errybody was put here on this earth for their own reason
And I believe my reason is here
And I'm ready now
I remember when I was at rock bottom
I thought I couldn't get no lower to the ground
I was like damn if I fall anymore, I don't know where I?ma be
But you never know, you gotta try him
You gotta give your all in no matter what you do
And I promise you I don't been though the worst
I done lost my pops
He left???..he went to jail when I was young
He back now which is a good thing
But I lost my brother
Boy that was a big deal to me
25-life
2003.??matta fact??that's recent
My sister
She doing 5-10 but I love and respect her
She didn't snitch
She kept it real
And she said "" for those that did wrong to her??..wrong come back to why?all
that's Karma for why?all
I remember when Brandy Norwood hit me in my eye
I had an attach regna my lens came out I had to have 3 eye surgeries
And she thought we?ll never be cool again
But I put that on my life
I love her to death
If she hear me talking, I know she can hear the honesty in my voice and my sincerity 
But you gotta get up
I know everybody just talking and talking bout what's going on
They don't have a clue
But to get real with why?all
I love dem niggas B2K
But, if it was meant for us to part
So be it
The moral of the story is
When you see me with IMx
And you see me doing my thing
don't mean I don't know bout these streets
Cause I done been through it all
And it all done been through me
All I know
Is God is looking down on me",Look Down on Me,2004

Young Royals,"I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Young Sicc,"[Young Sicc]
Oh yeah
Back up in the house for that Y2K shot
Young Sicc aka Frank Nitty
With my dog Knightowl
What's up dog
Keeping it real baby
You know what I'm saying
We're gonna show you fools how to represent
Represent that Dago style
Killer Cal style, baby

[Young Sicc]
Well it's that E-double S-E represent to the fullest
The mic is like a nine homeboy, don't make me pull this
Trigger if you figure that you can hang with us
Ese Sicc in the brain, click click, shoot 'em up shoot 'em up, bang bang
Be ready to throw them thangs and drop them bombs on ya
And this is how we do it in that Southern Killafornia
G's carry rags and represent your true colors
And if you ask me it feels good to be that Mexican brother
I handle my own and mind my own
But if you try to step you best believe it's going to be going down dog
Dropping bombs, stomping fools like King Kong
Take my steel-toes off your head and then I'm gone
So just recognize and watch your little step
Or be like American Me and catch that sharp shank to your neck
But I ain't trying to trip, just letting you know where I stand
Coming sick with this shit and representing Mexicans

[Chorus x2: Young Sicc]
Represent like it ain't no thang
Represent staying true to the game
Represent when we're out just hanging, banging, swanging
Represent that neighborhood gang

[Knightowl]
Better believe I represent reality, my street mentality
Will bring the pain, so don't get caught up in the game
The life I lead was not exactly what I chose
Hanging out on corner and drinking brew with winos
Smoking on the lala, the sound of fucking valas
Through the night up in the city where it's wicked, Dago where I kick it
G's all around me, mobbing through the county
Don't ever step and try and cross the line or you will find me
Got my boy Frank Nitty going off on your committee
You want to get brave, we'll give that ass an early grave
Little youngsters throwing up their shit
And ain't knowing I'm a G
I'm part of the reason shit goes down up in the SD
We represent this to the fullest, and I'm quick to pull a jale
Me vale madre, chinga tu madre
The loc'est of them all, I'm guaranteed to make you fall
Victim all up in the ghetto 'cause I wear the fucking metal baby

[Chorus x2]
[Young Sicc]
I represent everywhere I go and where I be at
Creased up Levis, Chuck Taylors and that San Diego hat
That grey pulled over sweater, Mexicans sticking together
Through tough situations, any kind of weather
Rolling in Impalas, Regals and Cadillacs
Homies got that San Diego tatted on their backs
And even on their arms, head and the chest
But this is how we do it on that wicked ass West
G's come out the pen, they're all sleeved up
So approach the wrong G and watch that ass get beat up
I'm only duece-one but got family that taught me well
And they got all kinds of stories to tell, laying low like a shell
Avoid sand getting kicked up in your face
You recognize or get put in your place
I always stay quiet and listen to what my family had to say
And thank 'em that I got to live to see another day

[Chorus x2]

Young Sinatras,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,2008
Young Sinatras,"Please teacher, teach me something,
Nice teacher, teach me something.
I'm as awkward as a camel, that's not the worst,
My two feet haven't met yet,
But I'll be teacher's pet yet,
'Cause I'm gonna learn to dance or burst.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Work like a soul inspired,
Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Will you remember the famous men,
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath,
Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

I'll get some self assurance
If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

Nothing's impossible I have found,
For when my chin is on the ground,
I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,

Young Sly,"Every night - a different town - I sing my song
I play and sing - pack my things and move along

A pretty face, another place I never get to know
A one night stand, another show

My guitar - a railroad car - a bus or plane
Chocolate bar - and there you are - the price of fame

If I could do what I want to, I'd stay and never go
A one night stand is all I know

I wish that I could be two people
Instead of bein' on my own
I wish that I could be two people
And then I'd never be alone

Photographs of where I've been and all I've done
In this whole world - is there a girl - no, not one

Goodbye, hello - I've got to go - I hope you understand
A one night man is all I am
A one night stand, a one night man.

(take money) MOB, Bad Boy killers
(take money) Hahahaha, hey fat boy...
(take money)

Verse One: 2Pac
First off, touch your chick and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player, but I bust your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, brothers touch for life
Plus Puffy trying to see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some mark-ass tricks
We keep on coming while we running for your jewels
Steady gunning, keep on busting at them fools
You know the rules
Little Ceaser, go ask your homie how I'll leave you
Cut your trick ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil Kim, don't play around with real G's
Quick to snatch your ugly hair off the streets
You Little weave! I'll let them suckas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride the night haha
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Mess with me and get your caps peeled
You know ... see ...

Chorus:
Grab ya Glocks, when you see 2Pac
Call the cops, when you see 2Pac, uhh
Who shot me, but ya punks didn't finish
Now ya bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Busta, I hit em' up...

Interlude: 2Pac
Yeah, straight out on the Bad Boy camp
You know how we do it
All my real homeboys in New York keep thuggin'
All the rest of you bustas die slow!

Verse Two: Fatal
Get out the way yo, Hussein Fatal
Biggie Smallz just got dropped
Little Moo, pass the Mac, and let me hit him in his back
Frank White need to get spanked right, for settin traps
Little accident murderer, and I ain't never heard-a ya
Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin ya
Spank ya shank ya whole style when I gank
Guard your rank, cause I'ma slam you ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than a block I run on you
And I'll smoke ya junior mafia in front of you
With the ready power tuckin my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Ya clout, pretty sour I get packages every hour
And hit em up

Chorus
Grab ya Glocks, when you see 2Pac
Call the cops, when you see 2Pac, uhh
Who shot me, but ya punks didn't finish
Now ya bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Busta, we hit em' up...

Verse Three: 2Pac
Peep how we do it, keep it real, it's penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle, all you suckers gettin
Killed with ya mouths open
Tryin to come up offa me, you in the clouds hoping
Smokin dope it's like a sherm high
Brothers think they learned to fly
But they burn little suckers, you deserve to die
Talkin bout you gettin money, but its funny to me
All you suckers living bummy, why you're messin' with me
I'm a self made milionare
Thug Livin out a prison, pistols in the air, hahaha
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on tha couch
And beg the trick to let you sleep in the house, ahh
Now its all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it, and smiled
Now I'm bout to set the record straight, with my AK
I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Little busta, I hit em up

Verse Four: Kadafi
I'm from N-E-W Jerz, where plenty murders occur
No point to comment , we bringin drama to all you herbs
Knuckle check the scenario, Little Cease
I bring you fake G's to your knees
Coppin pleas in de janeiro
Big Momma, is you coked up, or doped up?
Get ya lil Junior whopper clique smoked up, Please tell me
Is you STUPID?!?! I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my clique lootin, shootin and pollutin ya block
With 15 shots cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw mafia clique movin up another notch
And you bast stops squaws get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass east coast props brainstormed and locked

Verse Five: Idi Amin
You is a, b writer, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to ya face you ain't nothin' but a faker
Softer than Alizee with a chaser
Bout to get murdered for the paper
Idi Amin approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Prodigy in a choke hold
Totin smoke, Outlawz we ain't no joke
Thug Life, cowards betta be known, we approachin
In the wide open, guns smokin
No need for hopin its a battle lost, I got em crossed
Soon as the funk is poppin off
HAHA I hit em up

Gucci Mane ain't hot? Youse a God damn liar
Why ask why? Niggaz go Bud Dry
A case of Cristal and a black fo'-five
Hoes in the club like ""Who is that guy?
Drinkin Cristal throwin money in the sky?""
His fit so sharp and his wheels so large
The rims keep spinnin but the car stay parked
Fo' bedroom with the two car garage
Gucci just copped, nigga I ain't got a flaw
Wet paint job and the automatic start
Semi-automatic if you try to play hard
Gucci Mane Montana, from East Atlanta
Bitch the diamonds in my chain same color bananas

Scoop up the lil' homies and hit the motherfuckin' party, bang out
Dig what I'm saying, we gon let them niggaz get, they walk on
We gon' get our ride on and leave with a couple of bitches
And rep this Dub S thang to the fullest West side, like that

When the music is bumpin' and the homies give it somethin'
All the hoes is comin' and you know they all fuckin'
Got the Henny in glass, big puffin' on somethin'
And the niggaz outside and these bitches wanna fight
Then them niggaz pulled up and they deuces all wired
And you know we banged out when the homies come around
One times always turning it up because we bangin' at the party

We come through on that 22 shoe
In that SL500 chappell hill light blue
In cal-aye, we hit the valet
You ain't got it like that, park in the alley, nigga
Get in line while we spit the line for ya
Get inside where we gettin' high
On the dance floor with a big behind
Nigga, don't get mad 'cause your dick ain't mind

So when you see the west side up in V.I.P
Don't bring your ass up there and try to be Ali
I'll beat your ass back down just to be on TV
We know bad publicity'll sell another CD
Fuck with that, fuck with this and I fuck with the crys
Only fuck with the dough, never fuck with you marks
And if you're just getting in, motherfucker you 'tarded
'Cause we bangin' at the party

And you know we banged out when the homies come around
One times always turning it up because we bangin' at the party

Yeah, you know it's a white tee occasion
We in G formation, reppin' a G nation
I pull up three wheels, swangin' a rag fo'
Hop out with the sag low, strapped with the mag fo'
It's cash flow, thick money rolls and thick hoes

We got those and it's a party on the block loc
And it's a party on the block dawg
You know it's packed full of hogs
That's active and hard on hoes
Handcuffin' your broad is a negative
The twenty-third letter, I'm an O G and reppin' this

Believe, Skoop never nervous to crack a hoe
Plus I got them sets on deck, servin' like McEnroe
K Mac fa sho, I'll give you what you askin' fo'
Why treat a bitch like a bitch and let a hoe be a hoe
It's a Dub S see thang, Soprano the name
H double O bang with the connect gang, nigga

Let 'em walk, walk, let 'em walk

If the Devil wasn't alive, Mack would be stressed
Riding around town in a bulletproof vest
Police everywhere amour cars and shh
Worried about being another victim of a hit

But my relationship too strong for real I'm a saint
A child of God and if you hate me then you ain't
Be the only G I know to take it all with no triggers
So I put my faith in Him and never no niggas

As a result of that I'm cool, seem like I'm never nervous
So catch me Sunday mornings in that 8:30 service
Told me ride with me son and I'll never leave you lonely
Yeah, troubles for a reason, 'cause now you got a testimony

Most people get outrageous when they hit they knees
But I'm a thank you for the simple things the grass and the trees
I'm grateful for everything my fame and good wealth
I'm blessed with good money but most of all with good health

God, if they don't think I'm sincere, they don't know me, never knew me
And I tear up every time I think how good You been to me
I should of lost a few times and walked away without any pay
But I got favored with You and You gave it to me anyway

So when you blind in a situation believe, He can show you
And if you ever need a hug then just believe He can hold you
So turn to the Lord for He's the best to consult you

And thank You for letting my momma survive them five shots
It was up close and personal a lot for a kid to see
All the stuff I been through how could I not be a G

I know you got a purpose for me, it ain't no if ands or maybes
God in case I never told You, I want to thank You for my babies
Although I'm a gangster, rapper I'm pretty smart and well rounded
I never sell my soul and I promise to stay grounded

Livin’ life coo, not buried in tears/
No enemies or foes tryna test my triggas/

Throw my hand on the blade for ya
Jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya

But I'm only human
And I bleed when I fall down
I'm only human
And I crash and I break down
Your words in my head, knives in my heart
You fill me up and I fall apart
And I'm only

So wake me up when it's all over

It's Monday morning
I gotta get up and go to school
I wish I could sleep all day but Mom said you know your rules
The weekend's over, seems like school never ends
The only thing that keeps me going, I can go and chill with my friends
So I bust 'em on the basketball team 'cause basketball's my thing
So let me get up and get myself together, be on my way
I get to school and everything's cool I see shorty's
I smile at her, she smile back and it makes my day
So I say

Can I holla, would you mind
If I stand up with two time
You don't have to be alone
I can call you on the phone
Can I holla, what's the deal
Can I holla, I'm for real (I'm for real)
You don't have to be alone
Oh no

Uh Lil Steff
Pop tracks, let's go

Every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday later on I'm at the spot
It's a place where me and my boys go hanging
The girls and the music be hot
It's a place where young people go and there we be having fun
That's when I seen that shawty from school and I said
""Yo, she the one""
It was on and poppin' and there was no stoppin'
The crush that I had on you
And I wondered if you really know

Can I holla, would you mind
If I stand up with two time
You don't have to be alone
I can call you on the phone
Can I holla, what's the deal
Can I holla, I'm for real (I'm for real)
You don't have to be alone
Oh no

Can I holla, would you mind
If I bother you for a minute
Just a minute of your time
Me and you we can kick it
Can I holla (holla holla)

Yo, yo Bow Weezie
Rappers steppin' to me
They want to get some but it's yo boy Lil Weezie
You know the outcome
Another victory, they can't get wit me
So pick a PCD 'cause you're history
And stop trying to be like this rap mine
'Cause as long as I'm around you gon' be behind
I'm like a new bike to a kid
A perm to your wig
There's a lot of copy catin' but I know who ya wit
Can you holla at this big dolla getting sitting pretty hard
Representin' So So
You know the flow, baby, everything gravy
Everything big, ma, everything crazy
That means you ain't got to worry 'bout nothing
That means I'ma keep ya fly and crushing
That means when people see me they see you
And all you got to do is holla

Can I holla would you mind
If I stand up with two time
You don't have to be alone

I feel like an old Seven tray impala/
Wit no doors and no windows/
Wit no oil/no g*d dam**d water/
Been riding around for over 200, 000 miles/
With no tags/no insurance/
On some old bald head a** tires/
My alignment off/timing off/
S**t lookin real bad/
Cuz Im down to my last quarter tank of gas/
Good thing the weathers in fair condition/
Cuz where Im from/
All year long n****s need air condition/
But I aint got none cuz my compressor gone/
And I keep hearing a tick tick tick ticker sound/
I think one of my heads is blown/
They say for 1500 I can get it rebuilt/
But I aint got a dime/
Im going through some hard times/
I aint lyin/
(Chorus)
(Verse 2)
You know s**t get rough/
Every year around the same time/
The longer you wait/the longer its gonna take for you to calm it down/
And its gon take more than a check for X to pimp my ride/
Ima need me a new blockbuster deal/
For a n***a to live/
Its gon take shady 4, 5 maybe 6 mil/
I done did 6 albums n***a/
This s***s real/
And now you trippin/
Cuz my transmission aint slippin/
I aint getting no younger/
Im damn near 50/
Ive been ticketed and towed/
And broke down on the side of the road/
Steering column been broke up/
But never been sold/
So this time Ima need me some insurance/
I need me some medical/and dental/and some gangsta a** instrumentals/
So I can get this s**t all chromed out/
Painted candy apple green/
The wettest s**t a n***a ever seen/
If daddy dollars cant do it/
G*d dam**t it must cant be done/
And I must be a motherf****n pearl shine/
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
Aint nothing like and ol full tank of gas/
Aint nothing like being waxed and washed/
Then being valet parked/
And I got rid of that old bad cough/
Got me a new cam and exhaust/
A n***a pushing 500 horses/
And thats without the spray/
Get out my way/
Get out your car/
This green thing/
Is a motherf****n superstar/
The American Idol of the Chevy game/
Trick Daddy Dollars/
Don Dada/
A f****n donk rider/

Singing ""It's all gonna fall like we're living a lie""

You've been tearing up these walls again
Ain't no place left here for a girl to hide

You know I tell you just like it is
Gonna walk that far in the scars of another guy

And I'm not gonna give up all of this
Ain't no room left here for me to fly

And if our love is a hurricane
Broken phones and broken doors
Baby you know I can stand the rain
Let it lift us off the floor

You use your words just like a criminal
Kinda like a bullet from a gun
(Young Summer)
Well that shadow found me years ago
I've been bought, I've been shot with a lawless love

And if our love is a hurricane
Broken phones and broken doors
Baby you know I can stand the rain
Let it lift us off the floor

Build it up, tear it down
Let it fall right to the ground
All the words that we could bleed
Let it fly just you and me

Wasted pride
It comes in like the rolling tide
We don't have to give up this fight
But it's too late to give up tonight

And if our love is a hurricane

Young Swoop G,"Nine in the mornin' feds at my door (my door) 
Lou Cortez creakin' cross the hardwood floor (right) 
Dippin' through the alley I made my escape 
Didn't even get a chance to grab my Snoop Dogg tape 
Man with no music but happy he's free 
Bailin' fast as I can bail down 19th Street 
I got my sacks in my pocket and at least a grand 
Gold on my knuckle, my pistol's closed in hand 
I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta from the LBC 
Remotely controlled by the bombity 
But just livin' in big city is a serious task 
Didn't know what the feds wanted, didn't have time to ask 

We're comin' with that G shit, that see shit that makin' niggas sick 
How does it feel to see a G from your clique? 
Wake up, jumped out of bed wit my grin on (why?) 
Last night's dice game got my win on 
About a G and a half is what I come with 
But twenty five G's is what I left with 
Teatley was the word I heard 
I went deep in my pockets and threw my stars on the cone 
Gimme the dice so I can break you niggas 
I threw a see (C-I-X) so my point was the biggie 
Seven-four-four-tre back to back 
I sent two fools back to their lizzack 

See now I'm off to the graveyard shift 
And I gots ta pay my dues to make my grip 
But I chill 'cause my ho might call 
Ain't no thang 'cause I sleeps all day and slang when night fall 
And I takes a quick walk up the block 
With my Glock cocked, ready to make a stop where I set up shop 
On 59th and 8th Ave where all the homies be hangin' 
That's where a nigga'll be slangin 
I'm makin' a cool grip of shit, this ain't me 
So I put my chips together and cops a quarter ki 
And now the shops on deck 
And everything that's mines I protect with a Tek, I don't half step 
Now I got ends 
And I'm rollin' a Lexus, fuck a Benz, and so many new friends 
But I could only trust a few 
And unawarely I trusted you 
But if only G 

It's Snoop, homies from the motherfuckin get-go 
Devoted and quotin', back in '84 
I was thirteen, G was a year older 
But I still wadn't afraid to throw him from his shoulders 
Gettin' good on the hood was the anticipation 
And yeah, King Park was the destination 
Every nigga that I knew was at the Park that night 
Even the smokers that be levellin' gettin' sparked tonight 

Back on the streets, straight blue and grey 
'Cause I represent like every day 
Nigga you can't tell me I don't be on the spot 
When I can tell you all the homies that done get shot 
From at least about five years ago 
When I was in junior high goin' to Marshall 
The homey use to come up to the school and rock 
And leave and have the bitches flockin' his jock 
Damn them was the days of the past 
But since the Pizzound formed we been whippin' people's ass 
And everybody a blast 
And if you don't believe me nigga you can axe the homey Daz 
And that's your ass 
Fucked around and let Young Swoop take your cash (ha ha) 
He didn't even run, he walked away (bust) 
'cause I let it sit that day 
I wished I was there I would've clowned 
But that's why we axed your bitch ass from the Pound 
'cause he wouldn't even squad back 
Man we can't fuck with no niggas like that 
He'll get us all cracked 
If the police was behind us, he wouldn't even jump out with the strap 
Now that's what I call a beeyatch! (Beeiyitch!) 
I second the emotion you was dropped the clique (yeah yeah) 

Some of these nigga are bitches too 
And some of these niggas look just like you 
So if you've ever been toetone 
Go out and get your roll on you punk ass nigga, you'll get stole on 

It's 5:30 in the mornin', now I'm yizzawnin 
Now as I perceive to get G to a tee 
And before I bail to school you know I blaze up a sack 
Another day, another dollar for the gangsta mack 
Bitch act like you know, show me some sex and affection 
And let me dial slow, flossin', tossin' a bitch (bitch) 
Yeah Dogg, one more thing I forgot to mention 
Shoot five niggas, shoot ten 
Shoot the piece, slip to your fiends 
Seven, goddamn it, when it deal

Young the Giant,"Titus was born
Under the eye of a storm
Rainwater carried his bed
Around the world and back again
Oh, all the things he had seen
Life is a dream
Drifting at sea
It's so hard to believe

And so, Titus would grow
Taller and strong as an oak
Rainwater stuck in his head
It filled him with words left unsaid
Of all the things he might be
Drifting at sea
At night he would dream

Of all stumps at bay
To wash the pain away
Rain's falling
Falling on you

And the stone he was driving
Washing away
All the trees on the island
Rainwater, rainwater
In the eye there was a silence
But he washed it away
Crashing rocks by the sirens
It's falling on you

Rainwater, rainwater
It's falling on you

And the stone he was driving
Washing away

Going at me, got me hot, but hold up, how is they involved?
And you can't say that I ain't changed

And when we get it right, God bless that day
