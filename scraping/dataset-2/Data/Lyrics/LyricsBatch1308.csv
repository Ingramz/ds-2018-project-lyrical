7th Ambassador,"And that's my word... that's my word 

[Chorus]
If you're blind to the wicked ways 
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind (check it out) 
If you're blind of the wicked ways (yeah check it out) 
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind (yo) 

The President just ordered the Navy to hit the borders of Haiti 
Slaughter babies from the waters of Euphrates 
Maybe they sent germ that's polluted our sperm 
And made us live uncircumcised in the serpent eyes 

And told us certain lies, and each day a servant dies 
But in the halls of Pharaoh the walls are narrow 
And religion is like a prison for the seekers of wisdom 
This be the dance of the graveyard 

So do the spank with the dead zombie 
Here comes the tanks of a Red Army 
The real Jew is you, Jeremiah fourteen and two 
Enforced by the Hebrew 

Ya hovered by the eagle, America is evil 
Let no man deceive you, beat you, or mistreat you 
The tribe of Edem, stole your freedom 
And Edem means redneck 

I'm throwin bullets in my Tec 
Nah, I'm goin out like Joshua 
With a pen, an army, and an apocalypse 

[Chorus]

I remember 
The six doctors, that wanted to take my brain into a laboratory 
Destroy me, since birth 
My baby talk was psychic thoughts 

Flashbacks, all the past blacks trapped in the present 
Killin for dead presidents, where every ghetto residence 
is evidence, and the future, there will never be none 
If we don't be-come, unity 

Or get them devil made guns, and leave them demons bleedings 
Give em BACK with tons of speeding bullets 
Fuck your tech-nology, it's trick-knowledgy 
Tellin lies to my vision, I was given, enough time 
To master, the criminology 
And Mr. Pastor, teachin demonology 
Words of dope knowledge, I demolish 
Evil men, with an easy win 
When my thoughts are spaced out, come down to EARTH 
The devil crawls, 'cause he's only, jealous 
And a victim of the unholy ghost 

Chorus: 
If you're blind to the wicked ways 
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind (mind) 
If you're blind to the wicked ways 
The devil plays mad tricks on your mind 

Verse Three: 7th Ambassador 
He listens to the cries in the distance 
of the next victim, wishin, that he had some assistance 
And right before his eyes it appeared 
Beware when the shadow caster, demon master's in the near 
He blocked the true light from your sight 
And transformed your brightest days, into your darkest nights 
I had your blind man praisin the grave 
Cause he feel the cross, that lays in the dirt 
And think he's in the church, not even aware 
That death is near, and he's one step from his grave 
A naive mental slave if he had, his third eye sparked 
He mighta been scopin 
Them demons that be lurkin in the dark 
Always keep your glowin eye open 
By knowin who your enemies be 
I can see you but you can't see me 
Escape from your chains like, Great Houdini 
And disappear, like a majestic genie, in midair 
Vanish, that's my advantage 
And then I transform to a hurricane storm 
And rain holy water, for seven days 
And seven nights, the chosen ones spark the light 
Of the Sun, that's killin off villains by the ton 
Sealin all the doors to the Hells, correct spells 
That were cast on my peeps that were weak 
Made to keep, my peeps in a deep sleep 

Verse Four: 60 Sec. Assassin 
Behold! The angels out the heaven 
Who professes a whole new rap, session reposessin the gossip 
back so black, better hand over your act, or trapped, to 
Seven fifty three, who have received the law 
By the dispositions of angels, and have not, kept it 
Transgressed it, better burn your testaments 
Ain't nothing changed niggaz is gettin arrested 
Beat down like wrestling 
On the count, of false impression, indiscretion 
Advise em all with the glimpse, of a third eye 
The silent sleep, and wicked 
I work you niggaz out like physics, I blast out from the heart 
of Brooklyn, like an arrow, just stick to my point 
It's narrow, I shoot niggaz back, into the time 
like Pharaoh, I smoke up on your brain, leave it 
burnt as Sahara, that leaves desert, with a rock storm 
Leavin niggaz buried and puttin them at Lou's lawn 
Headquarters, of the Zoo, what part, wasn't reviewed 
Or didn't you understand 
I'm drillin niggaz back under the surface of the land 

Outro: Killah Priest 
Show the righteous man, stand in great lonliness 
Before the face, of such that have afflicted him 
And may no account of his labels 
For they see it, they shall be troubled with terrible fear 
And shall, be amazed at the strangeness of his salvation 
So far beyond all they were lookin for",Wicked Ways,1998

A pasado el tiempo why an cambiado muchas cosas
An surgido nuevos cantantes why nuevas modas
Pero el mundo sigue teniendo la misma escena
Alegrias pero tambien tristezas
Amor pero tambien odio why este que te habla ha caminado por sombras
De valle de muerte conociendo las dos caras de la vida
why recopelando episodios por episodio para traernos este dia
why sembrarlos en tu consiencia
A pasado el tiempo why an cambiado muchas cosas
An surgido nuevos cantantes why nuevas modas
Ayer estuve muerto why hoy vivo

[Chorus 2x]
Miden mi lenguayo aquel que habia muerto  de la tumba salio
why ahora contra ataca con lo que aprendio
La voz de la experiencia con potencia regreso (LISTEN)

Dia a dia canto mi presar why represento
Dia a dia tengo a todo el mundo mas adentro
Dia a dia tratan de quedarse con mi asiento
Pero dia a dia se que sigo siendo el mas violento
Porque los violentos somos los que arrebatamos
El reino de los cielos donde nunca nos tiramos
Los que creamos musica madura why expresamos
No es necesario pare que aprendamos why asi que estamos(LISTEN UP KID!)
Sabes que le que traigo en accion mirando bien atento cual es tu reaccion,COMO SUENA!
No es solo por la satisfaccion si no por la batalla contra la distraccion
Ra -pap-pap-pa, quita quita la risita -sita que segun la mensaje que te ajita-jita

Raperito que ya acabas de nacer AH!
Que es lo que pasa que no te puedo entender AH!
Que por el lado a quien queres aconsejar AH!
why por el lado me queres asesinar
Niño funny canta solamente por la fama why por el money
Aprendete mi lirica mas tirable como el Broni
Alimenticio como el cereal del tigre Tony
why agradable como el honey
Abre los ojos why averigua por ti mismo que al que daran por muerto ha subido del avismo
Todo sucede siempre aunque muchos no quieran
Regreso como el zorro cuando menos se lo esperan, OK!!

[Chorus 2x]

Yo lyrical traqui trac, no traten de engañar al mundo
why diciendo mil palabras por segundo
Porque no tiene sentido porque su contenido no es veral tratan de hacer
Algo especial pero terminan igual
Repeticiones muchos dan consejos pero no dan soluciones
Se obuscan de la fama para obtener posiciones
Buscando reacciones personatico pero con ese estilo
El fracaso esta automatico, maniatico rebelde why mas clemente de inocentes
Si quieres ser diferente no te quites mas lo delincuente
Porque ya es hora de que busques otra tactica
Pues tienes el talento pero te falta mucha practica
Ay va el regreso con el verdadero flow pues aquel que habbia muerto
Pues regresa con el muy largo YO!

why poniendo en su lugar la que no carece

Frittirta el rapero llego el trero te di un HIP-HOP PAPA EL ESH SHU PAPA

Lo, it's all so true,
They told me, ""Don't go walkin' slow
'Cause Devil's on the loose.""

Better run through the jungle,
Better run through the jungle,
Better run through the jungle,
Woa, Don't look back.

Callin' to my name,
Two hundred million guns are loaded
Satan's gone insane

8 Off Aguilar,"[Chorus]
Somebody told me that this rap shit was fun 
You get to smoke weed and hold big guns 
Stand on stage rockin' your Timbs wit your sons 
That's bullshit  yo I'm out to get these funds 

Yo, yo somebody told me that threw a hotter joint dies 
Could he see it? EPMD Aguilar recognize 
Niggas was stuck on Diggy before Biggie and Nas 
Test guy reported in The Source, even thought about ""Best Buys"" 
My twelve-bar Count Dracula wit lyrics spectacular 
Sippin' out of Coke and he's drinkin' terror daiquiris and chrome 
backwards 
Challenge any woman, balls nothing, rock the hardest 
Racoons rap with your soloists if artist 
Puttin' it down on the day nine thousand, that's a cell with stories to tell 
Off those cells we're livin' well 
In the nine-eight-off, country club plink off 
While you're way off, check all systems, it's time we take off 

[Chorus: x2]

Guns with banana clips, two Rolexes to master whips 
A point four-five under my armpit 
Another one in the glove compartment 
Money startin' shit, brand new shoes on spank shit 
Tek nines, after parties with mad dimes 
Bitches twist the vine, I'm high and the moon's mine 
We're out to get mines, on a regular 
On the south, probably took the dreaded predator's pirate treasure 
In the crib I bought the leather, plus a movie screen 
So my team can play Sega plus the gods in Vegas 
An ounce of weed in every type of flavor 
Bank accounts wit fat paper, a major player 'cause

[Chorus] 

Higgity-hardcore, sewer rats keep it raw 
Beach houses and more, puffin weed on Seymour 
Pliggity-plush carpets cover floors, on bus tours 
Chrome point forty-fours, diggity-diamonds on paws 
All my slick cats above the laws, higgity-hide records in stores 
Hit squad, second world tour 
Kiggity-cameras compass on doors, signin' autographs 
After, where? In corridors 
Figgity-fuck walls, I'm buildin', splittin' Dutches spillin'
Chillin' until these pilgrims start ice grillin' 
Figgity-frontin' hard like a villain, Das EFX'll make a killin' 
And grab the cheese up like Sicilians cos

[Chorus: x2]

Got the funds 
This rap shit was fun, kid 
We hold big guns, diamond gyms and Timbs and all that",Somebody Told Me,1998

[Parrish Smith]
On my knees at the mercy of god
Straight up back up I keeps it hard
You like to watch but can't touch this nigga
Or catch a charge
Papichulo, with karate chops, just like judo
Fucking coolo make you quit rap and go sing with menudo
Underground's where we live and that's where we'll be when you leave
Overachieve, I'd rather be rocking apollo creed
Time to speak up, fagot niggas dropping these weak cuts
We're the b-boys, hows about some hardcore in the speakers
For the mic dons,
Pmd shining with my stripes on
In the saddle, fuck around, get your shit rattled
No paddles up shit's creek when time to battle
Same place, same bat time, so fuck a bat channel
This nigga, object of game, get your pockets bigger
Biggie, pac, and eaze, one love, them still my fucking niggas

[215]
We don't need no gat, just cock me fucking back
And watch me spitfire my ? volerical? fact
It's a sign of a miracle that, my iron spitting
Ain't peeling your cap, me and the devil had a spiritual chat
Cause I'm eviler with lyrical rap
Than a black cat, on a black night, and I'm black
In the moonshining, I'm sipping starsky and hutch
While my rims blinding, while p rolling the dutch
Cause I'm too much for ma's and grandpa's to solve
Roll the windows to your cars, when out at large
Who the fuck's in charge? Charles Laston sauls
I got his mom sucking my balls like a fresh pack of halls
Right hand to Allah, I'm the roughest of the raw
Nobody's ever seen what they seen and never saw
When I jump in my car, they go ooh and ahh
EPMD, 215, and 8-off agallah

[8-off]
Yo 215, who the fuck was them cats up in the car?
One of them got a gat, the other one wanna spar
Jumping out the car, pop a trunk, swinging crowbars
Stick up my seeds in my fiends for the G's
People low self-esteem rocking the gleam, hotter than steam
When I blow off the top I got this cream like bill rothstein
And when I rob unique excitement is, why you scream
So put your hands together, get your mans together
Here's the plan together here's the gun together let's run together
Soldier mind crime nigga, bitch-down live nigga
8-off's gonna hit em like, five niggas, surprise niggas

[Erick Sermon]
Hey yo you hit em like that
I bust em from the back, to the extreme
Hit em up, make em scream like a bitch
And switch up, for the mix up, and dig a ditch up
And bounce, then for luck, I throw a six up
And hook off like prince naseem a head
Duck yo' head, or go inside instead
Step to me bourgeois? fancy as dandy?
You get killed, like you was jon-benet ramsey
And some of y'all just plain civilians
Talking shit, and never even seen a million
Acting like y'all Sicilians, when y'all niggas
With small figures, and chasing gold diggers
(motherfuckers) don't even come up to me yapping
Or you'll die hard with Bruce and Sam Jackson
Right now, you wanna duel, you fool
I'm a dog 4 life like my nigga ja rule
Who wanna flex, with the influential
With mad credentials on instrumentals we're too essential
The mic and the beat, now shit's complete
For me to kick your ass, for talkin trash, punk

Let freedom ring
Forget a bow ring
It's a black thing

Holding me locked up
With brothers be getting oxed up
Taking life for granted
Most of us abandon

How I know you not a cruel
Beef in the home
Africans
With jet black Americans

Dominicans war with the Puerto Ricans
Deep in the street
Thugs carrying heat
The rest of the projects surrounded with gates

Middle class families are moving upstate
While the younger generation selling cake
Trying to imitate mixtapes
It's all final

Big locks on the Verrazano
Get fined BB conduct
On some King Tut
Poverty struck

I seen the right to enter Uhaah took
My cup runneth over
Stressed out whenever I'm sober
This cold world got my girl scan

Fight on the sand
I'm allergic to ham
Weak minds all aboard
I see devils in the eyes of camcord'

And my reward is to let y'all know
I'm going out like PLO
Whenever I go uhh

THE GRITS!
THE GRITS!

I start the slaughtering
Make all eyes start watering
I know an 800 number you can get your coffin
Start ordering

The metamorphosis of my skill is sure to bring overcome any king
Faking ain't counterfeit
Money in the bing
I do a sting with two 9's under my sling

Anybody you bring
Still won't do a god damn thing
You nothing but a...
Onion in the rain

I floss rhymes
I loss rhymes
I got it like that
Y'all bitch niggas I toss times

I got rhymes that will still rock you
 
Cats that will spot you
Told you I chill
Lay off a shit
I still shot you

The only thing I'm unable to do
Is do what I got to
Look in hospital
Brooklyn apostle

Lyrical gospel
Still fortunate to scorch your shit
Paying for the cost of it
Your whole style remains wack
I know It's awful kid

THE GRITS!
THE GRITS!
THE GRITS!
THE GRITS!

I play the back like back in the days
Give thanks and praise
Watch the frisk raise
Reunite

Take birth trees to upright
I forget a fake MC's
My songs the Bible
Survival in the man

The lost lands
No radio play
The Pillage is banned
Like a foreigner don't understand

Y'all some flan cats eat pig
Reneg real shit from digs
Hit you off with the packages
And facts on tracks

Y'all talk but that's put that back
We dealing in the orphanage
Way surpass your image
I'm a chemist

A dual dentist
Treat my heritage like friendship
I be exit
I rock a gold necklace

And restless
It's always hectic
Staten Island shit
Bad habit shit

Made me twist it
One twenty district shit
Pillage be the senate
Throw darts like Masons

Garment Renaissance
Patriots
Hold the blood like tampons
Baby conduct

Put your fist up
No more struggles
100 dollars for the hen' dog
200 for the bubbles

[Parrish Smith]
On my knees at the mercy of god
Straight up back up I keeps it hard
You like to watch but can't touch this nigga
Or catch a charge
Papichulo, with karate chops, just like judo
Fucking coolo make you quit rap and go sing with menudo
Underground's where we live and that's where we'll be when you leave
Overachieve, I'd rather be rocking apollo creed
Time to speak up, fagot niggas dropping these weak cuts
We're the b-boys, hows about some hardcore in the speakers
For the mic dons,
Pmd shining with my stripes on
In the saddle, fuck around, get your shit rattled
No paddles up shit's creek when time to battle
Same place, same bat time, so fuck a bat channel
This nigga, object of game, get your pockets bigger
Biggie, pac, and eaze, one love, them still my fucking niggas

[215]
We don't need no gat, just cock me fucking back
And watch me spitfire my ? volerical? fact
It's a sign of a miracle that, my iron spitting
Ain't peeling your cap, me and the devil had a spiritual chat
Cause I'm eviler with lyrical rap
Than a black cat, on a black night, and I'm black
In the moonshining, I'm sipping starsky and hutch
While my rims blinding, while p rolling the dutch
Cause I'm too much for ma's and grandpa's to solve
Roll the windows to your cars, when out at large
Who the fuck's in charge? Charles Laston sauls
I got his mom sucking my balls like a fresh pack of halls
Right hand to Allah, I'm the roughest of the raw
Nobody's ever seen what they seen and never saw
When I jump in my car, they go ooh and ahh
EPMD, 215, and 8-off agallah

[8-off]
Yo 215, who the fuck was them cats up in the car?
One of them got a gat, the other one wanna spar
Jumping out the car, pop a trunk, swinging crowbars
Stick up my seeds in my fiends for the G's
People low self-esteem rocking the gleam, hotter than steam
When I blow off the top I got this cream like bill rothstein
And when I rob unique excitement is, why you scream
So put your hands together, get your mans together
Here's the plan together here's the gun together let's run together
Soldier mind crime nigga, bitch-down live nigga
8-off's gonna hit em like, five niggas, surprise niggas

[Erick Sermon]
Hey yo you hit em like that
I bust em from the back, to the extreme
Hit em up, make em scream like a bitch
And switch up, for the mix up, and dig a ditch up
And bounce, then for luck, I throw a six up
And hook off like prince naseem a head
Duck yo' head, or go inside instead
Step to me bourgeois? fancy as dandy?
You get killed, like you was jon-benet ramsey
And some of y'all just plain civilians
Talking shit, and never even seen a million
Acting like y'all Sicilians, when y'all niggas
With small figures, and chasing gold diggers
(motherfuckers) don't even come up to me yapping
Or you'll die hard with Bruce and Sam Jackson
Right now, you wanna duel, you fool
I'm a dog 4 life like my nigga ja rule
Who wanna flex, with the influential
With mad credentials on instrumentals we're too essential
The mic and the beat, now shit's complete
For me to kick your ass, for talkin trash, punk

Across the sand so I may keep

801,"All the peasants in the squares
At their tables and their chairs
Set to salvage certain numbers
From the wonder of the Tundra
And the muses in the gloom
Counting needles in their rooms
On the carpet in the corner
In a kind of secret slumber
While the in formation rain
Slashed the dirty windowpane to the square

Smoky broads and smoky windows in the square
Come come charmer come on over for the day
Disappearing cocoa forests flash and die
Fortunes crumble all demolished in the bay

Over forty pointed people
In the perfect pointed steeple
Looked to see the lucky number
Yes the wonder of the Tundra
Had come up to fame and fortune
Singing his tune, my tune, your tune
Wooing daughters of the gifted
On the carpets of the courtrooms
While the tickets were expensive
The show was quite relentless in the square

Shot at random random fire
Two particles fused and coupled
Once united multiply
The waves run underground
Electric power copper wire

Some tiny evil bursts the surface
Lays quiet like insecticide
Slanted, the eyes 
And this bonds mind to mind
The risk is mine
And this bonds mind to mind
She says a word across the ocean

I hear the spit I hear the sigh
The wavelength undivided
To drain the fruit 
And leave the rind the shot runs
Through her wiring through her curve
Through her spine to feel an impulse
Rising rising a mess 
Of reason and kissing eyes",Bond,1996

Love's all we have to give
Seems like the more I struggle on this earth
The more completely I'm in
In a world where mediocrity rules
Bodies collide without a moment of emotion
Scant parts running high behind closed minds
And we all lose our way
Let me be, let me be the moon and stars for you
Let me be your sky of blue
Let me be, let me be the sun and moon for you
Let me be your sky of blue
The winter clouds are stalking up on me
Packing the sun away
Darkness is creeping up on all our dreams
To wipe them clean away
Building boxes around our lives
Compartments for each and every feeling
Freedom lost with our innocence
Forgotten long ago.
Let me be, let me be the moon and stars for you
Let me be your sky of blue
Let me be, let me be the sun and moon for you
Let me be your sky of blue
Your sky of blue.
That's all I really know of this life
Here's what I want to be
Seems like the more I wander on this earth
The more I'm after me

One part's necessary in open minds
And we won't lose our way",Azura,1996

What she got is so Niagara
Make a young nigga straight need Viagra
Make a old nigga give keys to Jaguar
Just to keep from all the tease and laughter
Her telling her homegirls that he couldn't stay up
In the restaurant with her voice way up
Please keep it discreet
Keep the business out of the street
She said ""I would if he'll handle biz up in the sheets!""
Pop off like a thang thang
He keep keep
And every time that she bang bang
He skeet skeet
And he so bullheaded tried to three peat
Try imagining something passionate
Between you Cassie and Kim Kardashian
Maybe that'll work when you get to hit that ass again
Or you can grab a Red Bull and sip that twice
Now y'all can have sexy time, is nice!

Man this is classic
Call her National Geographic
Her ass is African, but her eyes so Asian
Plus the waist and, time's a-wastin'
This some good pussy, dog please don't waste it
You said ""Fuck that, man I'm gon' tape it!""
And came before you barely even got the tape in
She had the maid outfit, it's all on her apron
I know a friend who got drunk and claim a fat bitch raped him

I heard that bitch hate men and she covers up her crotch
But she love to show her girls like Sanaa Lathan
And she throwing passes like Troy Aikman
And she really into twisting facts like false statements
He's into twisting backs by throwing his weight in
But she ain't waiting for him to rise to the occasion

So you can save your pep talk, give me that oral support""

ci hanno fatto allontanare
e il motivo sembra strano
non lo saprei neanche dire
solo ti vedevo qualche volta
in giro con quegli altri
tu che mi dicevi
qualche sera passer a trovarti

Io che avevo i fatti miei
ti ricordi quella con quegli occhi grandi
che anche tu
mi dicevi troppo bella

forse stato il tempo
forse quella solitudine
che ci portiamo dentro
per credimi

magari poi
noi riconquisteremo tutto
come tanti anni fa
quando per noi
forse la vita era pi facile

troppo grande per noi

sul giornale la tua foto
steso su quella panchina
non sembravi neanche tu
forse te la sei cercata
forse non sei stato forte

se eri pronto per la morte

Che giro in macchina a vuoto
Vedo coppie abbracciarsi e stringersi

Lontana lontano lontanissimo
Ricorderò maledirò
Il giorno che ho detto no

see how I bait a man, seen as a nigga speak
that deep voice just make a bitch knees weak
I'm in my cadallic, chillin like a fatmack
smoking on a fat sac, drinkin' on a pint of yac
I pick up my car phone, call the freak beat
It's my nigga baby mama, but sometimes I creap
that's just the way it is, niggas have to take a chance
when you ain't around, anybody could be in dat ass
But I just a young nigga, trying to make a dolla
and they way I live, to some it's hard to swalla
see livin' down south ain't what you think it be
nine times out of ten niggas like me
pimps

Ya that's right
we trying to teach all these lames, you know
how to do this shit
cause it's really a hard job
but them lame niggas
they make me get so high

(Chorus)

I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground
I get so high
and I just can't seem to get my feet on the ground

(MJG)

Now let me explain a pimp
a nigga about the m-o-n-e-why
see a hoe, break a hoe
and try to influence the bitch, to a trick the nigga who
persuaded her to sell ass like hoes suppose too
now how in the fuck do you think a pimp is slippin
surrounded by all these hoes
that's going and givin me money
it's funny how a hoe can make you think she wit ya
when all the time
she's just another niggas gold digger
MJG got a bitch for a rich trick
take care of your business
bring me the money, ya this shit is thick
hoe don't violate, bitch I know I taught you better
take all of cash, grab on his ass
write dat trick a love letter
train your woman to break a man
man meeting another nigga
just some shit in the game, same-o-same
to make you pimpin thicker
slicker the pimpin gets, freaker gets the bitch
MJG is rich, I'm coe-coe for this tricks
I pimp

Ya that's right baby 
I pimp
so uh, what you need to do is sat dat ass there
and uh, right about now, I bout to fire up one of these spliffs
and get so high

(Chorus) 2x

(Eightball)

Part 2
It's all the same G
trying to school fools, on this P-I-M-P
lession one
first you should pull a bitch, fuck her good
next time tell her no, the next time take her dough
oh, you better watch your back to man
cause there's a lot of bitchs in the world wit much game
lession two
watch dat hoe, don't trust her wit none of yo dough
never let a bitch know, how you much yo cash flow
lession three
if you don't tell dat hoe who is boss
bitchs like to run shit 
but end up getting smacked in the mouth
see a real nigga believe in beatin them hoes down
push they head into the wall until you hear dat crackin sound
drown in the tub, rub-a-dub-dub
some niggas get pussy whipped and fall into them love bugs
buying hoes this, buying hoes that
then bragging to your friends
how you fucked her from back
never how you took they cash, never how you beat they ass
never how you pull hoes, fuck them, then dropping fast
I don't understand your plan at all man
but you should be around niggas like me 
pimps

Ya man
this niggas is a trip, you know what I'm sayin
but niggas like me, I have to smoke them spliffs
to get my mind off dat shit, and when I smoke um'
I get so high

(Chorus) 2x

Wherever there's a hoe
there's bound to be a pimp
the pimp supplys his bitchs wit some tricks 
dat they can tempt
a sucker will spend his money, till he ain't got nothin left
instead of blamming the bitch, he needs to blame it on himself
it wouldn't be hoe, if it wasn't for the tricks
but I suggest we keep em', so a pimp can keep his bitch
It needs to be understand, there wouldn't be one without the other
so why the fuck these folks keep trying to sweat a muthafucka
jealous suckers just mad!!!
they can't hang with the pimp thang, looking to sprinkle some salt 
in a pimps game
how in the fuck do you figure pimpin is dead when nigga you know it's alive
pimpin is misunderstood by those who can't, that's why they said it died
others tried pimpin, but were only makin chump change
one track minded niggas never run a Amtrain
rearrange shit dat they done seen in a movie script
dam ain't dat a bitch, niggas like me
pimp

MJ fuckin G, P-I-M-P
staying down on this pimpin bout' these hoes
but some niggas fuck shit up for real niggas
and dat shit just makes me get so high

(Chorus) 5x",Pimps,1993
8Ball,"[MJG]
1 to the muthafuckin 2 to the muthafuckin 3
The sound of the boom is sweatin ya hard like a mystery
Could It be
The pimps could rule the nation in '93'
And MJG is gonna start a new race
Replace the weak tapes we got in the first place
And chase that live on cops quick, out the hood
And beat that ass like a cop would real good
And keep that bud goin on like the Flinstones
And shake them bones when you feel the ? comin on
See up in the ground, down a hit and lean back
Look at ya self and see what I'm sayin is real fat
Society lives off what the media tells us
And niggaz be joinin up wit the shit that they mail us
See pimpin ain't dead yet, see pimpin can pay the rent
And pimpin is demonstrated by those in the government
The money they send you ain't shit but nickels and dimes
And you been stuck in the ghetto since 1979
But it's time to switch it up, unhook it and fix it up
Change it and rearrange it, complete and pick it
It's a book with hard covers that's packed with ideas
We rule the future years
Erase the black fears
And change the system, step up and dismiss them
Tricks from the White House
Move in and they move out
Now I'm runnin thangs, my workers walk wit a limp
My whole staff is bitches and all the judges is pimps
If ya weak in the game, thangs are bound to show
'cause a pimp got a stroke, and a wimp can't flow
And I ain't no muthafuckin fall guy, but Imma try hard
To let you know this pimpin ain't gone never die
M.J.G pimp tight
Young black nigga, no wife
No children, just hoes
Supplying the muthafuckin nation wit a dose
Of what, has been injected and now it's on
The muthafuckin pimp is in the house

Here comes the one they call the P.I. -- M.P.
Straight out the cut no one can see I -- bust these
Way out of touch with all them bustas in my rear view
but see they game, so lame, I can hear through
I Hens doggin at the bar, actin real nice (real nice)
Six pack of Hen, straight up, with no ice -- tap me twice
Did you really want my full attention?
Sometimes my mind (intertwine) with the tenth dimension
I see you inchin to my ride, tired, rest them legs
Soon as you open up your mouth (uhh) there's the head
Now who I be, MJG, certified, mic controller
(Uncle Sam, I want you!) Trick bend over
I'm a petrified rapper talkin, and you ain't nuttin
but an electrified shyster walkin, I'm tired of savin
people from takin these dead end trips, I'ma just go
and bust this champagne upside your ship, alright you hip?
You in a hurry? You can't relate?
Don't ever say that I ain't try to set it to you straight
I'm out the gate before you hate but I'll be back again
You saw me faintly through the crowd but now I'm in the wind
Once again

[Chorus: Eightball and MJG]
In the wind, it's a bird, it's a plane
Now it be them hustlers with that skin tight game
In your mix, scopin you, scopin me
Eightball and MJG to the end, bustas we in the wind

[Verse Two: Eightball]
I sold my soul to this hustle, homeboy scratch what you heard
T front me a keyboard, I flipped it like a bird, word
on them streets be them Suave House beats
In the Benz blowin Sweets got your gal between my sheets
Speak -- I ain't have to say one little thang
The fame of my name blew the ghetto freak brain
Lookin for a meal ticket, she let me stick it
Wicked when she lick it, tryin to make me trick it
Girl, when I was broke it seemed all about the luxury
Now I got cheese, I got a pay a girl to love with me
But I'm a jelly worker, like Smuckers
Workin against them suckers, big facin just to love a
broad that done been around the world in a day
Bear lovin whoever got cheddar to pay
Ball like no trick ass, them shakers if I tip
I be drunk, in the club, smokin sticky cat nip
Slip, as if a banana peel was dropped in my path
into a body bodyworkin not discussin no math
Playa haters all around me as I stumble and grin
Snatch my vest, twist somethin, hit the rumble and then...

[Chorus 2X]
[Verse Three: MJG, Eightball]
I flip scripts on young dips who think they hip
Smoke up your whole zip, sess hydro or crip
Time and time again, stories have been told
About the super hustler dyin tryin to get the gold
Concrete jungle full of, carnivorous firearm
Hunger for flesh, and pray on who ain't strong
Heavy weighters, with plenty hoes that buy em alligators
In the wind, breakin all big ?

Pick artificial tricks stolen money makers
Money trees come in please, help a player shake a
million down to the ground, feel them hits fall
Ride with me I'll run your game into a brick wall, trick why'all
is what this false literary do, then reality come
(and snatch the natural dust out you) who speaks the truth?
Whose your leeches? Whose your friends?
I plan to bring the realness back again, but until then
I'm in the wind

It was some what early, I was on my way
To get me some hay from my nigga in the Tray
And a four of that drank to go with my dank
It makes me lean all day
About three, I'm full of them trees
A dog want to hunt for a pack of fleas
Can I get me a freezy please
These H-Town freaks be a hundred degrees
It felt like a dream, sittin' on the lot at Dairy Queen
Very clean, in my dirty three pullin' machine
Jeans with tightly packed booty caught my eyes
My mind started to wonder about the prize between her thighs
She caught me lookin' grinnin'
Sharing my thoughts of late night sinnin'
Hey baby can I speak to you (Naw, naw you probably got plenty women)
Damn, how you gonna shoot a playa down
Before the conversation gets started baby
Ain't you done seen me and MJG on BET with J-O-E
Anyway, I wonder if we could set this thing off properly
Jet to one of my properties and blow a bag of that broccoli
Possibly, we could be, more than friends if you let it be
Imagine it, you and me, in the middle of the night

[Hook]
In the middle of the night, you can do it so right
You could feel real good, lay your head back
Inside my ride, put your hand on the wood, good
And tell me lil' something that I really want to hear, baby have no fear
I'll be oblige to the side of the mack of the year so bring it over here

I was chillin' at the bar, girl gave me the eye
So I had to start a conversation took by vision of my bone
Made me feel this chick was on
She said (I'm bored I ain't did nothin but lay round the house all week)
And so I said in my mind
That's a line of a flat down straight up ho down freak
Then I pulled her to the side and I asked her what's up
She said (What's on ya mind)
I said well if ya thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
We straight ya ain't gonna waste my time
Then I shuffled to the bar
Done missed the stuff that was goin' at the affair
Then as I came to the corner of the wall
I noticed that the girl was just standin' there
And then she gave me a look
Not an ordinary look but a look that made me thank
Did she want to romance, did she want to hit and run
Man, she out to try to count my bank
Now I was sippin' on the Hen and she approached me again
Choosin' on the playa with a grin, telling her friend
(Girl, I'ma be a lil' late gettin' in)
Now I was feelin' kind of hot in the spot
Gotta figure out a way to get my temperature down
Hit the town, ran a red to the hip without a flip
Without all these windows is around
Let's me and you do what we gotta do to get through
The rest of this episode, hold on tight
Let's re-write in the middle of the night

That's the way I gotta flip when I be
Feelin' 'ike I want to take a dip in the wind
Night-life livin' all the way to the end
It's just something bout the moon and the stars
And the dark blue sky that turns me on
I be chillin' in the day by the time somthing down
Gotta get better believe I'm gone
Now you can call me the vampire type
Batman livin' in a cave no lights
Seem too bright MJ outta sight
Never gotta fuss plus I never gotta fight
I might make another round through the Mound
Gotta get a sack of hay to make my trip complete
Look at all the women still hangin' in the streets
Temptation is an animal hard for me to beat
But as I creep through the midnight
Checkin' out the few tail I'd like to get right quick
Got my hand on my tone if a crook try to get me
Then a crook gonna wind up sick
I need to find a way to spend my time
Situation dirty, gotta erase my mind
Hangin' out to dry like clothes on a line
Everything fine, just like wine
Ain't nothin' shakin' but the leaves in the trees
Young women knees in a fresh set of keys
Now I'm fixin' to break em' to the birds and the bees
MJ put the P in tha ABC
In the morning I'ma stay up in the bed
Reaching for the cup filled up with ice
Blend it in with that H2O coolin' me off from my flight

Strip you on down like a shake-a-booty hoe (uh huh)
Put you in the street, make me mo' money mo'

Now see, just the other night, I met me a ol' jazzy hoe
Straight boozyabitch, ol' sassy hoe
Who think she fly to death, so I ain't gon' hold my breath
To let you skeezers know, just let you ask yo'self
For as I cut one but two down the line
But could it be yo' hoe that I'm cuttin' everytime?
And I come to find she servin' every nigga in yo' clique
To get in where she fit in, now she known to be a trick

Quote for quote, who tote like this
Hit the Club Jig, on some Wes Snipe shit
Snatchin' all the hoes in your harem, indeed
I mock turtlenecks while I'm bees and tweed
Til I proceed, damn right, the spot's tight
Nothing but dimes in sight, so just might
Bag these bitches like groceries
Player to player, you can't get close to me
Now who you 'posed to be?
Pullin' toast on the  S-O double N-Y, girlfriend lookin' fly
And I can tell she schemin' (why's that?)
Cause she like the ice is gleamin' (okay)
But that's cool though, cause I know how to stain golds
I pimp tight without the kangol, niggas know
I slang flow, east to west
Available at anytime to put the pussy to the test

All I like is them jazzy hoes, the type that make a nigga spend all his dough
Sho nuff a sight, anything ya like
You know the ones you wanna make your wife, ya heard me?

Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
When the real motherfuckin' player come around
Shy, not I, some times I choose not to speak
Surrounded by my real niggas drinkin' Hennessee
Or Remy or Red Passion with champagne
Chiefin' up some hay, gettin' at them hoes, man
Trick, not I, trick be you, can you dig that?
I got star hoes pickin' me up in Tahoes
Fuck them at-the-bar hoes, tryin'-to-score hoes
Mickey dropin' hoes, quick to drop they clothes
I give those only funky weave wearin' bitches
All made up, gettin' at a  niggas riches
I like women with they head on straight
Pull your own weight and you can fuck wit' Eight
Nigga think he a player with them old Girbauds
Gettin' pimped by them space age jazzy hoes

A man would die a thousand times
Before he reach one with soul
The one he beathes will be his last breath
Or does any one ever known
He died with his riches in the streets
Because game, is all that he knows
Sacrifice his life for the paper
And that's just how the story goes
You do it all for nothin'

6:30 in the mornin' my mama wakin' me up
Tellin' me to get ready for school, or she gon' kick my butt
Iron my jeans till they creased, put on nikes and a fleece
She thinks I'm goin' to school, but I'm headed for them streets
Before 12 am, I done did more shit than a marine
Fall up in the school house, high off them greens
Hoes bobbin', who that young nigga with the Figero
They call him big Ball, but his real name is Primrol
4th period, american history ain't too interestin'
My beeper blowin' up, my homies havin' a smoke session
30 minutes later, I'm stadnin' on the avenue
Duck pulled up in the cut, thang
Askin' me what I want to do
Jumped in the ride, fuck this shit, I ain't hesistatin'
Trees, and chedddar cheese, keepin' me from graduatin'
Hoes and clothes,
Big bones, and vogues
Young nigga puttin' in work,
Superstar of the ghetto

Chorus

Summertime, every weekend the club packed
After 10, if I don't hit ya back, that's where I'm at
Me and my folks get mad love from the freaky hoes
Sleaky hoes, right up under they nigga nose
I'm at the bar gettin' lifted scopin' out the crew
Niggaz chillin' after a hard week of payin' dues
North Memphis niggaz
Dick from Hollywood to Douglas
On the dance floor, provin' that they hood the roughest
South side, and cast day and niggaz will rob you quick
Reposess what you possess like it was they shit
But I was a player, to all the players in other hoods
From dicks and hoes
From Fraiser back to Westwood
Now I'm 19, my job is to supply the fiends
Cook the rock, morphine, or a bag of green
Posted at my mom's house when in the came the door
Black suits and search warrants and I'm the nigga they lookin' for

Everybody wants to live the life
The good life that was seen
Nobody wants to pay the price
But we want to live a life that's free
Why would they make such a thin line
Even below we're livin' it
For the life, I would do anything
Then do it all, then do it all
All for nothin'

All for nothin' 
All for nothin'
Sometimes, we do it all for nothin'
All for nothin' 
All for nothin'
Sometimes, we do it all for nothin'
All for nothin'

Sometimes, we do it all for nothin'
All for nothin'

Sometimes, we do it all for nothin'

I'm 25 now, been gone away for 5 strong
And so much shit has changed around my mama's home
My P-O, said a nigga can't achieve pay no more
The justice system tryin' to play me with revolvin' door
Violate parole and I'll be facin' time again
In the penn, tell me how a nigga supposed to win?
I hit my niggaz up who turned me on back in the game
Finally came across some hedges and a quarter thing
So much has changed, these young niggaz be snortin' cocaine
Shootin' up heroin, and shootin' niggaz for ghetto fame
I gotta lace my boots and wade through the muddy waters
Prey on flesh, so I can feed my sons and daughters
Ain't no love, niggaz hate to see another bubble
At the club sittin' on chrome
Brother playin' trouble
Cheefin' hay, before I knew it steel was in my face
I went for mine now I'm restin' in a better place

Tell them hoes how we beat that pussy inside out
I love it when you give me head in the benz
Up and down swallow, we gettin to win

Give me the money and the hoes and the good weed
And the mic so I can practise killing MCs
Dark dreams still come back in full colour

Hard pounded, the whizzle of the wind soundin
Like a woman screamin in a poo drownin

Weak motherfuckers loosin and twist the game
See some bullshit and blow out their own brain

[Chorus]
The artist pays the price so you won't have to pay
(Around the world in a day)
If only we would listen to what they have to say
We all go through changes to get to where we're going
We have to learn a life of sacrifice (yeah, yeah, yeah) To keep on growin'

Yeah,
Life is for learnin
Remember this
And learn from life
Think about the players in the past who died in sacrifice
Some died in wars for a country that oppressed them
Some died preachin' prayin' for God to bless them
I am one of the blessed, born to bring the world poetry
Hip-hop, musically' expressing what's inside of me
Some find me entertaining. Some find me marketable.
A potential Black millionaire so that makes me target-able.
Low-life's and fork-tongued devils get easy access.
Flashin' me faces, making empty promises.
Soggy niggas sign contracts and make deals,
Rappin' bout who they killed,
Talking bout they keeping it real.
Hardcore homicidal, kingpins of the century
Need to quit rappin' and leave this shit to the real M-C's.
But ain't no chance
Opposing forces got the upper hand.
Do as they command to keep them from suffering.

See, I don't know everything
But my opinion I will voice
As long as I can choose
I'll choose the right or the wrong choice.
Addicted to Hip-hop beats
And hoes that can't stay out the streets.
Tryin' to make a dollar 
Without a nigga havin' to rob and cheat.
Got me hustling
twenty-four-seven,
Three-sixty-five
Coast to coast
Mic-checkin'
Keeping the party alive
Engrave my name in the minds of those
Who bob to this
Slang and rob to this
Jack and rob to this
Herbs and meditation made a pill when I put it down
But individual perception will change each phrase around
Different towns
Ain't none of this shit like Orange Mound
Players unified, digging on my mellow sound
Exec's
Get big ole fat checks
For makin' deals
While soldiers like me in the fields
Down there getting killed
When this is all over
If I could do it again, I do it twice
Before and after me, the artist will always pay the price

[Chorus]

The industry
Full of broke niggas tryin' to make a comeback
Rappin' bout that bullshit
Over them weak-ass tracks
Judging me
When around the globe, ain't nothing the same
Think how the world would be if none of this hit had ever changed
Ain't like it used to be when hip-hop belonged to you and me
Shit got sugar coated' modified for tv
Niggas like me, don't give a fuck about commercial air time
Forced underground, ain't nothing commercial bout my rhymes
Rather be broke or slinging dope than hold my tongue back
Niggas who put on acts get they ass beat up and jacked
I'm not a killer' just a poet tryin to survive, nigga
Given the choice to ride or die, I chose to ride, nigga
I'm paying the price for all the real M-C's after me
Be a artist, not a slave for the industry
I'm paying the price for all the real M-C's after me
Be a artist, not a slave for the industry

Ain't nuthin' you broke ass niggaz do that can fade us
I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'
I drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes
and meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapes

I had to sacrifice, get things right
In this rap life, I paid my dues
Learn how to crawl, before I walk
Then I learned how to tie my shoes
Tryin' crime, but it just didn't work for me
Matter of fact it did it worse for me
Gettin' eyes scarred, bein' weak one time ya hard
It can only do hurt to me
So I sucked up my peer pressure, and my pride
And realized that this rap shit was gon' help me to survive
Stay alive, go with the flow but don't be no muhfuckin' fool
Hell this music thing is all I got, I ain't makin' straight A's in school
And ain't wind up to be dumber nigga, only to be different
So all the shit that you think we are, the shit that we isn't
When you raised up, where I come from, make it out is a blessing
Cause half the cats, where I come from, don't ever learn they lessons
My first love, even before I had a daughter, or a lady
was rappin', sweet lyrics, I love you, my baby
MJG, what you see, on TV, is fame
But the rapper I let loose almost anything, I love this game

I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I make too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'
I live the fast life of a MC
and I sell a lot of records makin' pimp beats
I could do a show tonight and make ten G's
Fuck til the mornin', sleep late and smoke weed
Three cars in my garage, truck in the driveway
I always, get my dick sucked on the highway

My way (pimp til I die) fuck a hoe
Unless that hoe is breakin' me off some dough, to hit the studio
Blowin, niggaz ain't knowin', how far this shit is goin'
I wrote all my shit, but niggaz always talkin' bout what I owe them
But I'm gon' show them, real niggaz stand on they own ten toes
So I'ma make all the money, and try my best to fuck all these hoes
Friend or foe, a bitch or hoe, rich or po'
Eightball got flow, MJG 

Here comes the one they call the P-I, M-P, never will retire
The tree-high, green leaf, helps me to get higher
Eightball and MJG, Too $hort, we all must be
the pimps of the industry, shit people pretend to be
Fuck so why should we, settle down
Leave the kitchen put the kettles down
Stop from fillin' all you hoes
Give up the life of trues and vogues
Hell no, it ain't gon' happen, this shit too deep
So I hooked up with my comrades so we can all get rich, nigga


Yea yea, one time, for your motherfuckin' mind
Pimp shit bitch
Eightball and MJG, now what you weigh me
$hort Dawg in the house, slammin' Cadillac do's, pimpin' hoes

Smile at you; see the name on my grill.
Cut the track up; let me show you the deal.

We get it all; cookin' dope, makin' bread, man.
I got the eagle full of hollow tipped lead, man.
Hear what I said, man?
Can all that weak noise.
I write; busta, go and get your little weak boys.

Blue collar MC's suffer the heat
Until I reach the isosceles heat.
Right angle better; double your sleeve.
I'm just a black, nation wide, singer.
Cops lookin' for Red, but can't arraign us.
You need more than lion trainers to tame us.
Famous for cuffin' mics with five fingers.
That's why I walk so distorted;

Word so superb it'll turn to herb if you snort it.
Fifty sack and a nick can vouch for it.

8Ball,"Life a funny thing, we all want to shine like diamond rings
Live like kings, and achieve childhood dreams
Lord be my witness when I say we all need you
Cause where I'm livin' ain't nothing but hustlin' gon' feed you
Many say the negativity shouldn't be glorified
Eyes wide when they realize a nigga live and die
The shit I speak, but don't nobody give a damn
Nigga hung up, on what I got and who I am
Save me, from this evilness that made me
Ain't nothin' shakin' if you ain't talkin' 'bout payin' me
The route to all evil don't seem bad
When dreams of havin' it is all I ever had

Nobody wants you when your down and out
Can't find, no one

He blessed me, oh yeah, you could say that
A Southern cat, puttin' Tennesee on the map
With rap, hip-hop until they pop me and my heart stop
Thinkin' 'bout the things I did to get me where I got
Are where I came from, ain't nothing easy about it
I got 'bout it, and got the fuck up out it
Crab ass niggaz want to see me broke
Because I'm flippin' like a kingpin sellin' legal dope
Quote what I wrote, gettin' smoked with your guys
Hopin' I demise, I can see it in your eyes
The same nigga tryin' to smoke a sack with me
Be the same bitch talkin' 'bout jackin' me
That's when Ricardo called the killers and they always ready
Nightmares for your fam 'bout them bullets in your belly
Image is everything, and skill is twice that
And don't nobody want you when your ass is broke flat

Nobody wants you when your down and out
Can't find, no one
No one to turn to when your luck is up (where you gonna turn to?)
Can't find, no one (there's no one to turn to)

These streets, can be so mean to men
Crack and guns take dreams from men
In the blink of an eye, go from dusted to the rich
And watch how many people start ridin' your dick
Oh, you the man when your flippin' through the town on chrome
But who gon' really be your nigga when that bullshits gone?
Uh
You think it's funny, but ain't nobody laughin' but you
When I done seen what a broke ass nigga will do
Jack, sell crack to get they life on track
Some say I glorify, but all I do is tell the facts
I done seen garbage sacks full of hundred stacks
Rich cats lose it all fuckin' with P packs
People say make the money change things around you
And not you, but that's some hard shit to do
Remember this when your hustlin' and have doubts
Nobody want you, when a nigga ass out, uh

Nobody wants you when your down and out
Can't find, no one
No one to turn to when your luck is up (where you gonna turn to?)
Can't find, no one (there's no one to turn to)

And they babies in the corner cryin'
Young niggaz bang, and they ain't afriad of dyin'

Enjoy it while you got it, cause you can't take it with your ass
Where I'm from, any day can be your last

Why do white folks, think all we know is sellin' dope?

you know when you lose somebody 
somebody that's close to you
somebody that's probably not even that close to you
you might have just knew him
it's hard to put it into words you know
it's hard to say what you feel
it's hard to say what you feel....
I guess all wounds heal over time
you know...but uh
all i can do now is reminisce

(Verse One)
Look at my homeboy lying there dead in the street
His eyes wide open and it's fucking with me
I can't believe this shit it really seems unreal
My streetwise ass dog ended up getting killed
We used to laugh but now this shit ain't funny at all
Thinking about when my dog first started to ball
Telling me I was blessed use my gift
But it was hard to stay away from that gangsta shit (so hard)
Young eyes attract glitter like glue
Running with a crew doing everything they do
Smoked out drinking mad dog and thunderbird
My momma screaming but I swear I never heard a word
My homeboy's momma cool but she smoke crack
Now getting high is how she bring her son back
Imagine that so many kids are living this
One day my son will lose someone and reminisce
I hope it's me when I'm a hundred and three
Your homeboy getting killed that's some bad shit to see
I hope you agree and make it better for the young ones
Cause these momma's can't take no more dead sons

The world wouldn't spin without gangsta shit

But baby somebody told me
(Only the strong will survive)
If I die press play to bring me back to life
(Only the strong will survive)
Hey yo if I die press play to bring me back to life

(Verse Two)
Riding around in a hoop smoked out behind tent
Serving all day hitting corners getting bent
Time went by quick when we was kicking it
I wish that there was a way I could have predicted this
Somehow thought the shit but I can't blame myself
I just wish that death would have took somebody else
That niggas' shorty looks just like he did
So in a sense I guess my homeboy will live again
In the eyes of his seed forever dad
No one to call on when momma is doing bad
Mad at the world for the pain he feels
I pray to god that his momma shows him what's real

Chorus

(Verse Three)
Every day I thank god for watching over me
If I didn't have rapping I don't know where I would be
Trying to move a key strong armed robbery
My destiny could have been an early death of me
Just to be alive pushing twenty-five
I lived to talk about the shit many didn't survive
All I ask is that we think about the lives passed away
Never to see another sunny day
>From rocks in the hand to keys in the van
No more being broke waiting on the postman
Cost more than the time that you put into it
Now you got the cheese why the fuck you still do it
Greed a need to speed away your precious time
Playa use your mind find yourself another grind
If not for yourself... for the kids sake 
Cause they'll all be where were all at today

Man oh man
It's wild what these streets are doing to us 
You know what I'm saying?
I was thinking I was telling my homie
If I were to name all the people that I knew
That was not here with us no more
It would take a whole album 
You know what I'm saying?

Tie you in the sack proceed to pack you off too young 
Yea you brought some pain I brought the rain and I stun to feel 
I wonder will these fake ass bitches become real 
Hell naw don't forget bout the spliff and I tell ya'll 
Should I spell ya'll fake ass bustas before I see ya 
And I can tell by the scent in the air I don't want to meet ya 
And I don't care if its the motherfuckin' holidays 
I ain't gone preach just pose and look up at me like 
A big 'ol pimp ass I'll beat 'cha 
Nigga I smash down to take care of killers who spit trash 
Small pounds no limit soldiers we kick cash 
At the drop of ball D-I-M-E P-I-M-P 
Tight pass nigga for real trick don't tell me

Man if I had a buck for everytime I've fucked up 
I would be the big willy nigga with my feet up

Preacher man could you pray for me 'cause I'm about to sin 
My homicidal poetry killin' again and again 
T-Mix gave me the gun when he sat and made the track

Of sticky green love controllin' what I'm speakin' 
Sprayin' niggas leavin' niggas layin' up leakin' 
For weeks and weepin' from my grim reapin' realiwin'

Its that pimp shit that hardcore shit that shit you run from 
See I ain't got time for this superstlye shit I know where I come from

Tell you tricks how I feel

See, when I didn't have shit, on the street
Tryin' to hit a lick
Didn't nobody try to give me shit
I worked for it and got jerked for it
Got hurt for it
Still in the mix, these tricks never knew I could last long

8Ball,"My nigga, see, he from Texas, I'm from Tennesee
We do our thang, with them thangs, makin' currency
He got the hook up with Columbians and Mexicans
He wraps 'em up and ships 'em out, and I supply the ends
Excellent profit got us livin' elegant
Laundrymat style washes away the evidence
Get on the plane every weekend and visit
I would visit his town, and he would visit Memphis
Takin' the nigga clubbin', Embassy suites, and freaks
Up all night, sippin' Tussin, smokin' Sweets
One weekend, I'm in his town, his crib
You really must trust a nigga to show him where you live
Fly scenery, space aged things, and big screen
In the den, shootin' pool puffin' on some good green
In walked the woman that was see's fiancee
He said daddy loved her, and would marry her one day
Her name was Angela, damn she was fine
I admit I had evil thoughts rush in my mind
Moscino fittin' tight, she was dressed to kill
She winked but I didn't think the hoe was for real

Chorus
What am I, supposed to do?
When I'm takin' a chance, fuckin' with you
My homeboy's girlfriend
Now if someone, found out about us
Then someone's, gonna get fucked up
My homeboy's grilfriend

The smell of breakfast, woke me up from my dreams
Bacon sizzlin', searchin' for the kitchen like a fiend
What I, seen, straight took me by surprise
Angela half naked not tryin' to hide
She saw me lookin', but kept cookin'
What's up with that?
Invitin' me to sit down, and said she'd be right back
I poured a glass of O.J. and pulled up a seat
Angela came right back, and sat next to me
Kissed me on my cheek and said
(Oh you cute, I don't know what it is, but it's just something about you)
With her hand on my leg, she kissed me on my neck
I said baby chill, this is too much disrespect
If see walked in, he be a mad mothafucker
And ain't no pussy gon' come between brothers
Lovers, we can't be, cause that's bad business
(Ball, you could have all of this, and there won't be no witnesses)
All in my lap, on my early mornin' hard dick
Grindin' on it, pullin' it, before I knew it, suckin' it
Ended up fuckin' it
I guess I'm a weak man
It's hard to understand my homeboy's girlfriend

Chorus

Me and see jumped in the Benz and hit the town for a while
I can't believe what just happned, man this shit too wild
If see finds out, he might trip and try to kill me
And I ain't the type of nigga that's gonna feel guilty
Later on, we was at the pad, kickin' back
see had to make a run, to go and serve a pack
Before he made it out the driveway good
Angela was all on me, tryin' to suck on my wood
On the pool table, on the floor, man what a whore
I was lookin' out for see, she was beggin' me for more
An hour later, see walked through the door
Unaware, that I was just in his ladies underwear
I flew home the next day still reminiscing
Not believin' I just dicked on my homies Mrs.
This is a fuckin' trip man
I will never understand, my homeboy's girlfriend

I remember (I remember)
Right before I used to go to sleep (right before I used to go to sleep)
Me and my mom (me and my mom)
My mom used to tell me to say (my mom used to tell me to say)
Now I lay me down to sleep (now I lay me down to sleep)
I pray to the lord my soul to keep (I pray to the lord my soul to keep)
If I shall die (if I shall die)
Before I wake (before I wake)
I pray to the lord (I pray to the lord)
My soul to take (my soul to take)

So much drama in a nigga life
I have to take the scenic route home, and check the closets at night
Not afraid of the dark, just what the dark hides
Killas with they facemask, tryin' to get my safe cash
If I catch 'em should I blast, nigga?
Hell yeah
Cause if they catch me up in they shit, I'ma dead man
My eye for your eye, that's what the pages read
By any means necessary, that's what Malcolm said
So I'ma a roll like a 20 inch mo-mo
Fuck a lot of hoes, make dough, and kick the bo-bo
It's hard but fair
MJG told your bitch ass
Quick fast, I make my shit last, and put you in the past
Don't ask cat, go get a mask and a gat
Snatch a nigga wife, and make her tell ya where them bitches at
Mafia style, break the code and I'ma break your back
Straight up dogg, I put the house on that

Chorus:
What you want to do?
Go to war man?
Well, talk is cheap, and the game done changed
Fights, only midnight gun blaze
So I say
Watch your back and don't come around my way

What must be
What shall be
That which is necesity to him that struggles
Is little more than choice to him that is willing

One of them fake niggaz, I'm hot like TNT
Blow up, and have you standin' in a puddle of pee-pee
See me, you couldn't do if you sight was 20-20
My lyrics so fat they made me go and call Jenny
Used to be poor like penny, not Anferne, but Janet
Until I unleashed my poetry upon the planet
Harder than granite
Player haters can't stand it
White folks would ban it, cause they children demand it
Tryin' to live a life, I've been fightin' to escape
Earnin' my respect, and never takin' breaks
Breakin' cakes
Everyday I'm on a paper chase
Shake and bake
Just so I could double up my ri-up
We buck, but don't nobody want to find that out
Murder niggaz lyrically instead of pullin' my gat out
Now I'm on some hard core, makin' me a mill shit
Nothin' but the real shit
Soldier in the field shit
Feel this,
Nigga life will never slow it down
You need to do like New Edition baby, cool it now
One of us gon' chill, it's gon' be me or you cat
Fuck what you heard, I put the house on that
Bitch

You know (you know)
I want you to remember (I want you to remember)
Heaven is above all {heaven is above all)
And death is the judge that no king can corrupt (and death is the judge that
no king can corrupt)
And hell (and hell)
Hell is only the truth (hell is only the truth)
Seen too late (seen too late)
Can you dig that? (can you dig that?)

Lord forgive me for the anger that I feel today
Give me the strength to be a man, and turn my cheek the other way
The devil in the form of my enemy has tested me
Now I must retaliate before they get they best of me
No name callin', hoe, I wouldn't give you the pleasure
So you can run and tell niggaz that I'm the one jealous
Oh yeah
I'm supposed to fall for that punk shit
All you did was sign a contract, to get your ass kicked
Blasted
Found in a ditch with your wig split
Thinkin' that we niggaz on some rappin' kiddie kid shit
Dig this
Is my success a threat to you?
Nigga why you hate me, cause I do the shit I do?
Be true, nigga spit it or forget it
If I'm the one wrong, I'll be the first to admit it
And then we can get down, any way you want it

8Ball,"3 kids started off being friends to the end
Growing up in a time that turned boys to men
Carlo was the slick one, the little girls liked him
And all the little niggaz in the hood, wanted to fight him
But Carlo, main nigga James wasn't having that
James had boxing game and left niggaz laying flat
All of us 12 or 13 at the time
Drinking cheap wine, and smokin' brown bag dimes
I was into writing rhyme in class at school
Waitin' for the bell to ring so we can go and shoot pool
One day, some up the block niggaz came talking shit
Bragin' on they clique, and how many crews they click with
Tryin' to start some extra clip shit, them niggaz so for real
James so cool to get with fucked his whole grill
Carlo, that slick nigga pulled a 22
They got some heat too, what the fuck we gonna do?
Bust and hit the backdoor, now we in the alleyway
Running, heart pumpin' fast tryin' to see another day
Blessed to escape the mayhem
Time and time again, we escaped the mayhem

[Talking]
Yo, what's been goin' on dogg?
Man, that shit goin' down dogg
what's goin' down with you?
I done heard you got rich huh?
You don't fuck around with us in the hood no more huh?

You know it's funny how shit changes, right?
How life can loosen up a friendship that's so tight
Years after all the horseplay and misdemeanor crimes
Us being homeboys, didn't seem so fine
Years of just fuckin' around, rappin' in the neighborhood
Found me with a gold album, tryin' to live my life good
Carlo got popped with 8 keys in a minivan
Somewhere in Tex, Arcan, doin' about a hundred man
That nigga James, straight cutthroat on them snouts
Robbin' dope boys, gettin' what the fuck he want
The game changed, now you gotta play with death
Now I have to ask myself

Chorus:
Do you remember your childhood, back when
You didn't have to have loot, to have friends
Now it's all about your benjamins, your cash flow
And if a nigga fuck with that, he better know
Time changed everything, between us
And if I see you in the streets, I gotta bust
You used to be a friend to me, one I could trust
Now if you see me in the streets, you better bust

One day, I'm on my way to the studio, ya dig?
Pick up a zip of hay, after I drop off my kids
Flippin' through the hood, seen James with his little crew
Blue rags up, in a drop top Malibu
Bloodshot eyes, I could smell the dip burnin'
Bumpin' DJ Squeeky, flashin' what the earnin'
He asked about Carlo, well what can I say?
I write him when I get a chance, but I pray for him everyday
Lookin' at my ride, tellin' me nigga you comin' up
Fuckin' with that rappin' stuff, I guess you just forgot about us
Nah cat, it ain't like that
I gotta eat, that's when James clicked and pulled out his fuckin' heat
I hit the gas, he kept bustin' till the clip was empty
17 shots, and didn't nothin hot nip me
Quickly, grabbed my shit and opened it up wide
The nigga on the passenger side instantly died
James bailed, I gave chase, fuck the consequence
If I let him live, he'll start another incident
12 years ago, I never thought I'd see the day
Shit would ever be this way

TSRight right right right
8BOne time
TSBeyotch
8BYeah, you know how they like it baby, nigga you can't retire

From nineteen-eighty, through eighty-eight
I Don't Stop Rappin like my first tapes
When I was broke, I used to sell em instantly (instantly)
One look, you could tell it was the pimp in me (pimp in me)
In eighty-nine, I went on tour with Eazy-E (Eazy-E)
A bunch of fine bitches tryin to sleep with me
Every night, sold out, turnin young hoes
Tell her baby, no doubt, stick this dick in yo' mouth
I smoked a lot of weed, I said a lot of rhymes
Always fucked up in niggaz bitches all the time
Now I'm ridin on twenties wearin nice clothes
But ain't nuttin like pimpin hoes, and ridin Vogues
I live a good life, in my pursuit of happiness
I'm so glad, to get to the point of havin this
Opportunity, for you and me to pass it on
Two years ago, I thought it'd be my last song

Me, Squeaky, Flex and J, on Saratoga Street
Smokin white boys, bumpin dopefiend beats
Eighty-eight, my pockets wasn't straight, but I was makin it
Niggaz like Lil' Tim was out there ballin sellin cakes n shit
I was right there, on the Mob Circle, writin raps
All about my snaps, tryin to put Ball and G on the map
Nowadays I own my shit and bone bad bitches
Kickin it with rich niggaz in rollers, and candy sixes
Deliverin hot shit like Pizza Hut for them hardcore thugs
Niggaz who pimp bitches and hit the highway with them drugs
Feel my flow, mix it in witcha chronic main
$Hort Dawg, I don't know why you tryin to leave this game
State to state, plenty hoes and plenty money to make
Writing raps, makin more than them niggaz movin weight
The game been good to me, and I know that muhfucka bless you
Thanks for passin game, now let's get out here and make this loot

TSI won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
TSI got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
8BWe some presidential players, with money by the layers
8BAin't nuthin you broke ass niggaz do that can fade us
TSI won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
TSI got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
MJI drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes
MJand meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapes

I had to sacrifice, get things right
In this rap life, I paid my dues
Learn how to crawl, before I walk
Then I learned how to tie my shoes
Tryin crime, but it just didn't work for me
Matter of fact it did it worse for me
Gettin eyes scarred, bein weak one time ya hard
It can only do hurt to me
So I sucked up my peer pressure, and my pride
And realized that this rap shit was gon help me to survive
Stay alive, go with the flow but don't be no muhfuckin fool
Hell this music thing is all I got, I ain't makin straight A's in school
And ain't wind up to be dumber nigga, only to be different
So all the shit that you think we are, the shit that we isn't
When you raised up, where I come from, make it out is a blessing
Cause half the cats, where I come from, don't ever learn they lessons
My first love, even before I had a daughter, or a lady
Was rappin, sweet lyrics, I love you, my baby
MJG, what you see, on TV, is fame
But the rapper I let loose almost anything, I love this game

I won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
I make too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
I live the fast life of a MC
And I sell a lot of records makin pimp beats
I could do a show tonight and make ten G's
Fuck til the mornin, sleep late and smoke weed
Three cars in my garage, truck in the driveway
I always, get my dick sucked on the highway

My way (pimp til I dieee) fuck a hoe
Unless that hoe is breakin me off some dough, to hit the studio
Blowin, niggaz ain't knowin, how far this shit is goin
I wrote all my shit, but niggaz always talkin bout what I owe them
But I'm gon' show them, real niggaz stand on they own ten toes
So I'ma make all the money, and try my best to fuck all these hoes
Friend or foe, a bitch or hoe, rich or po'
Eightball got flow, MJG

Here comes the one they call the P-I, M-P, never will retire
The tree-high, green leaf, helps me to get higher
Eightball and MJG, Too $hort, we all must be
The pimps of the industry, shit people pretend to be
Fuck so why should we, settle down
Leave the kitchen put the kettles down
Stop from fillin all you hoes
Give up the life of trues and vogues
Hell no, it ain't gon' happen, this shit too deep

So tight fold crease right on the president's nose

Touch toed, hoes take a centerfold pose
Break a treat, make 'em pay to enter those 
Pros, slam those

Game tied tight like bows, we never close
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four
Hand chose bithces a la mode, gettin' sold
Plus a load of killer, as Chronic gettin' blowed

Keep it froze, tucked up in a Tupperware bowl
Stick of gold, somethin' from the school of the old
Forever flows, I take it down as deep as it can go
Burn rolls, braids tight, blazed afros 

We're pushin' hoes
Dicks get erect like poles, pay the toll

Peep dis', you and them boys need to slow down
Up in the morning in the court, it's 'bout to go down
There's no remorse now, better expose rounds
Them jackets be on the lose until the dope is found

Willin' to bust a n**** a** if he had to
If you feel the same my n*****, you's a hot boy
Blocka, blocka, blocka

Better get up off the block, boy

Pass 'em through the clique until everybody burn 'em out

Holding knives to you neck

Every time I insist
They submit
Bitch don't be lying on my prick
I'm too quick for your lies and deception
Hold your eyes in my direction
If you strive for perfection
Just watch the pro
But its like a chore
You gotta cap and go

Charged with a ten body for a nigga get shot
For a weak ass bitch, fuck that little whore

It's one planet and I'm the fattest motherfucker in the universe 
You worse than a motherfuckin' snake in the grass 
Fake for the cash, wait til you pass ? shake and you crash 
You pay for yo' acts, and all the mistakes you made in yo' past 
Hope you get raped in yo' ass while you, takin' a bath 
Up north - you wouldn't last a day and a half 
I'll bet my weight and my stack, a razor will slash, yo' face and yo' ass 
Before you can say, ""take me at last, I'm ready for death"" 
Now you just heavenly strapped 
A cherry with lips, a fairy or bitch, you barely exist
You motherfuckers ready for this? 
Grab your crucifix, tell God I'm coming for your juicy lips 
You'se a bitch, don't let me run up in yo crib with the ruthlessness 
Bruising shit enough to hurt and pain I'll bring 
Think y'all pray for pun, nigga say my name 
I don't play those games, you picked the wrong nigga to fuck with 
Punk bitch, that's why yo' mother suck dick!

Please Believe it!

[Jazze Pha]
Niggas must be blind
Or that hoe must got yo' mind
You niggas must be blind
Or that hoe must got yo' mind, your mind

[E-40]
She was looking kinda classy in the back of the club
Baby kept eyein' me, loving the stud
Teasing and trying me while I'm sitting there stuff
Quiet like jockin' me, all on my nuts
Til my focus got sloppy, spilling this cup
Went way up out of his mind and started touching her butt
That's premature macking nigga you're fucking off my action
Nigga you Captain Save-a-Hoe (bitch) action packed nigga

[Jazze Pha]
You was young and foolish (young and foolish)
Didn't know what you was doing (what you was doing)
Didn't really know she was a hoe, oh no (a hoe!)
She had a pretty face (pretty face)
Drove you wild (drove you wild)
I bet you want that hoe to have your child (yo' child)

[Eightball]
Yeah, uh-huh
I don't respect no dick-sucking freak in the pack
Most niggas claim pimping but that shit be a act
I ain't got nothing for you hoe
You ain't got to spend the night, you can get your shit and go
I'm not no sugar daddy hoe one-stop
Top notch hoes even got to have they own knot
I seen niggas get caught up, right quick
I seen hoes capitalize, and hit licks
I wonder what the fuck be wrong with these tricks
So me and 40 singing this song for these tricks
You know them niggas who call them hoes all day
At the hoe job all in the hoe face
As soon as the hoe tip off and get tipsy
She got dick on her lips, up in the Embassy
And be home before four, snuggled up with you 
Wake up and pretend to make love with you

[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Niggas must be blind, you niggas must be blind
Or that hoe must got yo' mind, you can't see what I can see
You niggas must be blind, niggas must be blind
Or that hoe must got yo' mind, your mind, your mind

[E-40]
Oh! I told you she was skinless (skinless)
I didn't know you was a rest-having pimping
I thought you was a polygamist (polygamist)
A polygamist, yeah man, ?
A polygamist means having, forty-one broads
I'ma tell you what's real pimping, I'ma tell you straight up true
I'ma keep it real with you pumping, I promise you I got you
She was off in the vocal booth, talking about I'll do you wrong
Some of that genocide and juice, then the thing about the thong
Fantasizin about sex in groups, nothing small
She like niggas that like to shop at the, big and tall

[Jazze Pha]
You was young and foolish (young and foolish)
Didn't know what you was doing (what you was doing)

Ay dawg, check this out (uh)
Peep this..
I met this lil' chick the other day (yea)
Talkin 'bout some super stout
Super stout, she put it on ya boy
Yea I promise ya, she put it on ya boy

[Eightball]
It all started in the mall
She said ""Hey, ain't you Eightball?""
I said ""I'll be whoever you want me to be""
She was fine like a supermodel, Naomi
Out to the truck me and this ho bounced
Thirty minutes later we was on my couch
Remy, X.O. and green sticky weed
She hit it like a pro, didn't choke, didn't heave
We talked for a minute, you know how shit go
Two people get close and they jump off bro
I kissed her on the back of the neck, she got wild
Beggin me to hit it doggie style
Long story short, shorty got that fire
If I tricked off, I'd trick it on her
She said she got a man, but he ain't shit
He give her everythang but love and good dick
Time went on, we kept in contact right
But never really hooked up, and never got tight
I wish I coulda got with her one more time
Then maybe, I woulda never wrote this rhyme

[Hook - Eightball] 2x
She's always on my mind - I want to be with her
She's always on my mind - But I can't be with her
She's always on my mind - I want to be with her
She's always on my mind - But I can't be with her

[MJG]
She was 5'6, redbone and lye chick
Ain't no way she could disguise it
When her eyes hit, my eyes, it was a trance in it
Only thang that I was thinkin was in her pants
She was holdin my wood with a tight fist
I whispered, into her ear ""I know you like this""
She said ""I'm ridin wit'chu"" Damn right bitch!
I'm a pimp and I ain't got all night shit
I got a reserve ticket for a ho want to kick it
Get down lick it, 'cause I'm feelin you down wit it
She was certified, equipped with pussy grip
I ain't buyin a bitch a room, I'll fuck her off in my whip
Feel my rib-tipped, that triple bit Trojan
Fo' den hunnie, it's up in ho land
Up to the windowsill, knockin it off
Then I stuck it in your grill, I'll beat it up
Seein as how you, treated me - Knowin that I was pimpin
Before I understood what it meant, I broke women
MJG, breakin 'em in - mentally and physically
Mind, body, and money - shimmy shimmy

[Chorus] 2x

[MJG]
She was always right there, on the tip of my mind
Makin me look at other women blind
Every motherfuckin time I find myself lookin for a phone number
I'm gone, I'm alone, I want that women
When I see her, I'ma let her know how I feel about her
Be a pimp tight, real nigga with skills outta town
Lookin for the one that got me hypnotized
Hips and thighs, glimpsin eyes, trippin now
Go'on the same, ready to knock it off friend
When she admit it's time, I'm lock it in
Head straight to the hood, and snatch a six-pack
Tell the folks that I'm with, that I'ma get back
I think her name was uhh.. shit I can't remember
But I know she was a cute, lil', stout tender
Ready to put it down, whether rain or shine
She always, always, always..

[Chorus] 4x

[MJG whispering] 4x
She's always on my mind.. always on my mind
She's always on my mind.. always on my mind

Never been a hater even at my lowest level
Some niggaz get some change and sell they soul to the Devil
I'm drinkin' Dom, man I'm chiefin' on some green sticky

But afford it, then motherfuckers sheist for it

Saw some shit fall and seen a lot of shit grow

I get my grind on daily 'cause I wanna see
Me and my niggaz gettin' paid 'til we elderly
And it ain't hard if we all put that work in
Keep it twerkin 'til they close the fuckin' curtains
We all dream and we all have fantasies
Every nigga wanna buy that house for mama G
But life is like a roll of the dice, right
Sometimes you win and sometimes you just might
Lose it all, fucked up sick and don't know what to do
That's when you find out who really down to bust for you
I rock and roll from my heart and let my soul glow
And don't worry about what a nigga think he know, ya know?

Nothin' but 24/7 - 365
Eleven to eleven I be off in the fire
Of this revolution, the solution is what I'm spittin'
Fat stacks of green backs is what I'm gettin'
Jaw bones and microphones, that's what I'm hittin'
I'm hangin' on the edge of the cliff with no mittens
Thick flickin', chrome smokin', preferred potion
Man will never touch my flow, deep as the ocean
When you go down too far and you - can't seem to light
Best to look out for that pressure baby, it bust pipes
I got too much fight - in my heart, body, my insight
Is magnifyed a thousand times, more than the average guys
My status lies right before you with no disguise
The black mack is here to step up and so I rise
My shit has gone way past cold, it's freeze dry
One brain can't do what I do, you need five

How come its been trouble in the places you stayed lately

When she promised you that she was givin' you the whole stack
Can't be no lover slash pimp nigga, or a player slash good boy
You either be real or Mr. Goodjoy
Cause ain't no such thing as love at first sight
But it's a such thing that you was on them drugs the first night
It's mandatory for me to appeal to the women
Keep it real with the women, but let them tricks deal with the women
And when you in the field with them women
Watch 'em, they start talkin' love shit stop 'em

Make a nigga spend a grip and think of plenty lies
Lookin' deep in your eyes and don't mean none of it

you can still hug dad tight

When I get home from off the road
you take this load off me
sweetheart tell ya momma to make me some coffee
Daddy's princess

Daddy's little gyrl
learning things daily in yo own little world.
I'm goin continue doing what I doing
to provide for ya

close ya eye's now, daddy's gotta surprise for ya
I'll ride for ya till I'm old grey and tired for ya
so when I'm gone, you'll understand I tried for ya.
It's important for a gyrl to know her father

so I can be the man you run to, when times get harder
I'm coming home
'cause home is where the heart is
I'm worn out but still, I'll be there regardless.

[Chorus]
Daddy, why you gone so long?
Daddy, when will you come back home?
Daddy, don't get your ??? alone
Daddy, when will you come back home?

[Eightball]
This is for the
cats who hustle all day and night
in the streets doing what's wrong or what's right
you see ya babies when you can
don't ya know ya lil babies need to see you man
if you don't teach them
then they gonna learn the wrong way
so sit down and listen what they got to say.
And you boys in the club every weekend
straight ballin' but you can't take care of ya kids.
When they grow it's to late to try to make it up
you never know when god plan on taking us.
So much evil in the world and it's all new
to a child who ain't been through what you been through
a kid can't play in the streets without dodging bullets
and nine times outta ten
a kid probably pulled it
cause they momma
and daddy weren't there for ?em
so it's important that we let ?em know we care for ?em, yeah.

(Chorus:)
Daddy, why you gone so long?
Daddy, when will you come back home?
Daddy, don't get yo ??? alone
Daddy, when will you come back home?

(Bridge:)
Daddy, Daddy
I really miss my daddy
Daddy, Daddy
I really miss my daddy
Daddy, Daddy

Whoa! Do you really wanna get crunk?
Hey! All my hustlers, all my grinders

Roll through, one deep, heat in the waistband
Jealous-ass niggas might try and touch a made man
Crazy rap fans, followin' my rap van
Wanna get a hug, wanna shake a playa hand
Smoke somethin', I'm a fiend for the sticky green
My whole team keep it clean like a pinky ring
Hardcore like a scene in Cabrini Green
Plenty green get a young nigga anything
Excursion, Escalade with the big rims
Denim suits, soulja rag with my gold Timbs
Poppin' pills like a nigga eatin' M&M's
Shoppin' deals at the table wit the best of them
Leave the rest of them, way in the back
Weak-ass rappers get smoked like a sack
Fat Boy did that, didn't nobody help me
MJ to the G

Do you really wanna get buck?
Then tell the truth, I don't give a fuck
Each day is a blessin', I'm a live it up
Put ya best South fit in the cleaner

I never seen a, party crunker than the one I'm in
Bitch pullin' contest we done won again
We hit the scene all the women start swarmin' in
I feel like I died, went to heaven and born again
Pimp tight, MJ fuckin' G
Death wish meant for anybody touchin' me
I'm a hit the dance floor with a attitude
Who's the killer now? Tell me who's the badder dude?
Who's the one who ain't afraid to let the bullets fly?
If you know you ain't gon' use it, why you pull it why?
Do you really wanna kill me and do time?
And leave ya kids and ya girlfriend left behind?

[Chorus]

Do you really wanna hit the sauna, with some bitches and marijuana?
Sailboats offa the beaches of California
Getcha game tighter as a fist and the ice that's on it
Y'all ain't crunker than us, ghetto performers
Street roamers, still keepin the heat on us
Corner on a nice day, nigga just thought I'd warn ya
Eightball and MJG, we the buckest
Dope shit nigga, roll us up in the Duchess

One of the hardest niggas that you will ever meet
Two of the hardest niggas to bust over beats
It's all real, never fantasy or incomplete
Incomplete emcees just can't compete
Hear defeat, I'm elite when I grab a sheet
Grab a pen and compose what my life hold
Fuck what a nigga stole I'ma still roll
Fifty deep, fifty feet from you weak hoes

I come from hard times hopin? I'm never goin? back
Never thought that all of this would come from writing

Big money, big grills, big cars
Women used to trip, now they want to know who we are
I stayed the same ­ while everything around me changed
My old ponta?s locked up ­ fuckin? wit them thangs
It?s not a game, really it?s a damn shame
?Cause if I wasn't here I?d probably be wit them mane
Thank the Lord I'm not, knock on wood baby

And I'm stuck in the middle stayin? true to myself

Uhh..
I never played the games, fucked hoes and tricks
Niggaz think with they dick and get hit for licks
We mob for life, straight scarred for life
""Space Age 4 Eva"" nigga fuck the hype
Hard rounds I bust, crush punks to dust
Weak studio gangsta, you can't fuck with us
We live the streets, give streets the piece
Defeat weak emcees and bust heat to eat
My love for change, got me stuck in the game
Got me goin insane, who the fuck can I blame?
No you but me, not him but I
Is the one to blame for anything I try
Love life and give, but a trick ain't me
Give bitches the dick and give niggaz the heat
Bust flows that kill, homocide for real
Gold grill and trills, you weak niggaz no the deal

[Hook]
y'all niggaz can't fuck wit... the shit I spit
y'all niggaz can't fuck wit... what I fuck wit
y'all niggaz can't fuck wit... the shit I kick
y'all niggaz can't fuck wit... what I fuck wit

[Verse 2]
I got a mind for murder, leave niggaz with stitches
Bloody kick in the crown for thinkin this is fictitious
I'ma live for this and I'ma die for this
Eye for eye for this, flip a pie for this
This shit is love and hate, niggaz love to hate it
A piece of paper and a ink pen made me straight
God knows I try, every breath I take
Every song I make, is from the heart to the tape
I break and crack flows, build and stack flows
Attack the track flows, back to back flows
You know, I do whatever to get the cash flow
Bust and mash fo' eights in the slab ho
Southern distributer, narcotic deliverer
This shit I be throwin up, combustin and blowin up
I told you niggaz this, see now you done got me pissed

Yeah..
I never fuck with fakes, these niggaz is snakes
Smile in my face schemin tryna see what they can take
Emcee for life, AK-47 flows
Like Al Capone nigga, I'm showin my golds
Black skin and rocks, hittin bitches that bop
Blowin weed on the parkin lot, fuck the cops
We crash the scene, fulla tuss' and lean
With my saggin jeans, tryna bag a queen
Fuck niggaz with blunts, tryna get in my mix
Brown weed fulla seeds, I don't smoke that shit
I'm a green fanatic, I should be in a clinic
Talkin to a psychiatrist 'cause I know I be trippin
Long nights, fist fights, smoke till we cain't
Life of a hustler, go hard in the paint

Thug livin', nigga, ain't nobody promised tomorrow
Ain't no second chance to live, it ain't no time to borrow
Money in these streets, trouble in these streets
I'm tryin to school these niggas deep within these beats
Life is for learnin, learn and live, nigga
What the world hold for me and all my real niggas?
The studio is where we meet up like a holy church
Worshippin the spirits of them niggas who done been here first
And give it all to them young niggas who come after us
And don't give nothin to them boys that's out here fakin tough
Project livin ain't no fly shit, I don't want to go back
And I pray for all my niggas who can't do better than that

I live it how it come to me, good or bad
I got to deal with it, this ain't no movie, see
When the gunshot spray ain't no tellin if a stray
Gonna put one of my little bitty sons in his grave
My nigga in the hood used to kick shit and do his thang
Now that nigga in a wheelchair, damn, ain't that fucked up, mane?
Maye it was somethin comin back from somethin that he did
Maybe that was God's way of tellin him he need to quit
I don't know, I know he think about that shit everyday though
What he did to make his life go the way that it go
Every nigga can't be blingin, Navigatin' on doubs
How many niggas really got a lot of stacks put up?
How many niggas got five cars and no house?
Hustlin' like a slave tryin to shut your baby mama mouth
Long as you hustle ain't nothin impossible, my nigga

Temptation talking to me
I try my best not to listen
The world fuckin wit me
Tryin to stop my ambition
And niggas talkin bout me
I know they hopin and wishing
That ima give it up or quit
But I say fuck all these bitches
Niggas talk to much
Lemme tell you this
If you ain't seen where I been you can't tell me shit
Spirits walking with me
I close my eyes and follow
I live for today
I might not see tomorrow
I heard it all before
All the lies and excuses don't want to see now more
Stupid shit I throw deuces
Dog I'm out the door
This so simple and plain
I keep it hardcore
You gon remember my name, the call me fatboy
I'm such a pro at this thang
The whole key
Work hard get your doe at this thang
But people look at me
Judge, before they see the man
Cash stones I'm losin for they deal my hand
Could you roll one up
Toe beneath me
The devil got a player down on his knees
I don't know why niggas think they want to be like me
You gotta see what I see  before you be like me
What you live for the truth but give nothing but pain
To anything evil for you soften your game
Words give life to the things that we think about
Life is hell
We go to heaven when we make it out
Yea, I'm like a thorn on a rosebush
Hard and prickely and discarded usually
Unseen, the world shittin on my hopes and dreams
Hope and dream that I can open up my throat and sing
Bring poetry and fly when I spread my wings
And let the world see the beauty in these ugly things
Scarred, like a scab, brittle and hard
Being green, and lame greens little reward
Slipping is a mistake and most they pay for it
Gruesomly hideouse, so you really can't ignore it
Yo, you see them pretty motherfuckas on the tv screen
Live and die for that fake shit on mtv
Turn the cameras off and watch our heroes transform
Runnin away from what real life did for em
Under the glitter and the bling of them expensive things
that's where you find that truth and dogg that'll set you free
The real shit is the shit that I would want for me
Not them fools tryin to copy everything they see
This I will never be
From me you'll never see
Before I do it i'll say fuck this whole industry

Could ya roll one up
Smoke with me please
The devil got a player down on his knees
I don't know why niggas think they want to be like me
You gotta see what I see before you be like me
Would you live for the truth but give nothing but pain
To anything evil puttin soft in your game
Words give life to the things that we think about
Life is hell we go to heaven when we make it out

You play thug in the streets I'm wavin at your chest (nigga)
You heard about me boy, you don't want no drama
I make it hard for you to breathe in the streets
While finessin your baby momma-get your mind right shawty
While you poppin that X, I'ma pop yo chest
And leave you dead in the party like soakin wet

Uh, uh - yo when I'm loadin the clips, niggaz I hate, face be on 'em
That's why I stopped coppin' the guns with safeties on 'em
When I touch down, call me up, I'm on the porch
With the mac, servin niggaz ""Eightballs"" and up
You want to know why niggaz is broke, because they hate money
The rims that I'm sittin on is in they late twenties
Bitches want to see me holla at 'em, throw a dollar at 'em and
If they hustle throw some hard or some powder at 'em
This is for my South niggaz
Gold and platinum ice in they mouth niggaz
Let's ride out niggaz
Everybody gon' follow the bitches
Until they realize, bullets gon' follow the stitches
On the other hand, shit is real low, it's a fact that
Nine out of ten niggaz mouths get 'em killed though
What you ride for? What you die for?
'Cause I got some niggaz and some bitches that's my word that I kill for

What can I say about these streets that I be walkin'?
Not too much 'cause where I from niggas ain't motherfuckin' talkin'
We'd rather listen and watch
Tryin' to flex and guard their clothes and Baume and Mercier watches
Tryin' to get my gloss on
I paid the 'cause' to be the boss on these corners where ballin' niggas floss on
Haters get tossed on, 5-0 get ? and out of towners get robbed

Obviously you don't know me It's time that you learned

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Bitches hatin' 'cause I'm always doing big boy stuff
Would will ill be grippin' in my big boy truck
Back then at the club gettin' this big boy sucked
Eightball, Mjg you know we can't be touched
If its 'bout Hennessy and weed you can link it to us
If I feel you disrespectin' Ima cock it and bust
And MJG gon be right with me if that eight ain't enough

If Eight ain't enough 
Don't worry I got eight in the clip
Eight for them hard looks
And eight for that lip
It was unnecessary
That sort of punishment was less than very ugly
Which was fucked up 
You wanted this you lucked up then
Oh well  some more shit I'm stuck up in 
Hey lets squash it  
Go sweep the dust up then 
Drink a shot 
I got a bitch you could drive a truck up in 
MJG pimp tight! And I got em

I fuck with them niggaz who run the hood
From the south to the east coast to the west
I be puffin on that shit that gon be burnin' in yo chest
See them hoes want a nigga who got bread
These niggaz want a bitch you got that fire head
And all I want is weed and money
And mo' money
The streets don't respect a nigga with no money

Ya poor dummy  
You should be spendin' ya ho money
When she offered you some 
You probably tell her ""no honey""
You to slow sonny
What I'm spittin' gon make you know somethin'
So the next time instead of just talking 
You could show something
And most hoes is like casinos 
Pistol blow somethin'
So anytime a bitch approach me 
I see some dope coming
My main focus is tricks who be out ho huntin'
But they don't get that pussy for free
I make em owe somethin'

Hugs and kisses disrespecting bitches 'cause of me
Always want to sex with me no matter where we be
All her friends do my friends and they do it for free
Okay we smoke with them hoes and get em something to eat
But any real nigga will just to drill baby
Pimp hard or pimp harder for the millennium
That paper out here for ya Ima get me some

Hit a liquid some
Tell my bitch to quick get the gun
We got some shit to run so shut up and cut off the grits they done
I want you up on your feet until they blitz the song
Bitch you understand what I'm sayin'
I'm the official one

Until it ain't no hojack left to spring the season on

I know I've done some wrong, but I can't get right
'Cause life is like a big fight
I'm stickin'-and-movin', tryin' to get my shit right
My family's been houndin' me, friends they done turned against me
Kinda like they hearts was on a full tank, but now they empty
And they say I've changed, but like twins I'm just the same
It's because of my job, mo' money mo' prob in this dirty game
This industry fucked up
That's right I said it, and it's fake as ever
Keep real niggaz around me, stay ""Spaced Age for Eva""
Po-ppa never went and jumped the broom, never got that one degree
But if you looked down from heaven, you'd still be proud of me

This whole world around me, diseased, and crumblin'
Babies doin' dope cause daddy did it right in front of them
Everybody want to blame music for they bad kids
Sittin' up in the court talkin' 'bout Eminem made me do what I did
My own hard times rolled in like the fog
Try to think of others, but I can't get past my own thoughts
My momma, in 1967, pickin' cotton
While other blacks was gettin' liberated, boycottin'
My old man was a player, ain't no hidin' that
He started tootin' then he graduated to smokin' crack
I never saw him, never needed to see that muh'fucker
He left me and my mother stuck down here in this fuckin' gutter

We made beats, and hung with old heads, and stayed out late at night
Do talent shows, fo'-way split the dough, that was our way of life
My momma stayed, home full time so she could raise me
Knowin' without a, household father, things could get crazy
Sometimes I listened, sometimes I thought I knew it all
But nevertheless, momma was with me through it all
I graduated out of nothin', not out of school, it was like
Tweleve, thirteen, fourteen years I'm thinkin' cool
I might as well, be focusin' on me tryin' to get paid
Usin' these rhymes I've been writin' since in the seventh grade
Our team played, and had physical sex with minimum wage

Playa getcha pimpi'n on
Gotta getcha game together man, all your women gone
To start all over, ain't nothin' to a mack
Just put 'em to work, and watch yo' money stack
That's fo'sho' doe, everyday a G a mo'
Asked your little sister, ""Girl, why you wanna be a hoe?""
She got turned out, like Red Riding Hood
Goin' to Grandma's house, now she lookin' real good
While the Big Bad Wolf tryna eat her out
Pay up, the cash is what we be about
Squares, we don't care if you don't understand
Players break out the game power, you don't wanna go there
Say it in your prayers you wanna be like me
You down on your knees but it's not likely
To ever happen, so I just keep rappin'
This real mackin', this ain't actin'

Yeah, Bishop Don Magic Juan
Ain't no shame, in my game

One room one night for every day spent
Knocking a dent in the sheet-rock she's hot
Got them legs fanned open like a peacock
I saw her dancing in the club with her new outfit
Her hair and her nails did show me love
Ya man say he got good green show me some bud
Give me the real hook up price like I'm ya 'cause
Baby see I'm above the bullshit and the playing
Them hoes you listening to don't know what they saying
They relaying that he say she say language
If that's the way we trying to swing it won't swing it
M-J fucking G I ain't really new to this shit
Just want to add something new to the list

What it do baby girl
Get on the dance floor
Will you put your drink down
Come and dance with me

Money make the world go round that's what they say
Conversation rules the nation in every way
My mind thinking shit and I say it before I know
I'm at the condo busting condoms on the floor
We keep the crunk hyper than any who use a mic
We do the kinda music the pretty women gone like
A sweet smell you know with perfect nails and toes
A round cinnabun head under them clothes
I know you want to go and smoke out
Stay up all night and go eat at the Waffle House
You and me bring your friend that make three
I bet I can make you feel so sexy
Let the drank flow and burn the best dro
Put ya drank down and go hit the dance floor
Make a nigga want to get with you and spend dough
Love what you do to me mami I want to know

What it do baby girl
Get on the dance floor
Will you put your drink down
Come and dance with me

My yak spilling full of that hay I'm feeling right
Spend the night with me let's wake up and take a flight

She'll suck a nigga dick for the flight but don't bite
We gone keep it on the low no gossip and no hype

My rubber on tight on the jet on the runway
Leave Monday don't come home to Sunday

We dip Tuesday be back in town by Wednesday
Break a girl off that chain like Cunta Kintae

So will you dip with me baby girl
On a trip around the world while I play with your curls

Play with your titty nipples will that make your toes curl
You a bad motherfucker baby its your world

Whatever you want I can do it correctly

8Ball,"And it's hard
Hard

Yea yea sittin' looking out my window the streets I see ain't pretty
Sometimes I wonder if I was born rich with plenty
Money, and everyday was sunny didn't no rain fall
Life was beautiful like the colors of a rainbow
Would I be the same prim row all my niggas know
If I didn't have to learn to beat them streets and get that dough
What if I never witnessed killings with my own two eyes
Bussin' leave they own folks layin' in the street to die
Life without respective if every second I was shakin'
Cause I injected dope in my veins
Divide and strain could I describe pain could I
Describe livin' life without desire mayne
Could I survive if I couldn't rap or entertain alive
And free you can't beat it
Who can you blame my world is like a picture and the frame
The picture might change but the frame stays the same

Hustling waiting on tomorrow
Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

What if you was on the other end of the bullet
When a killer wanna pull it would it seem like
The light flash in front of your face
Or would you run real slow like I ran in my dream like
Just the other day I tried to be a hero but it wasn't the side of me
Or maybe it just wasn't the time to be but if the shoe had to fit then I would be
Ahead of the game playin' the part I bring it all into the light from out of the dark
I hit the bat into the ball and out of the park
And live with the question alone that's meddlin' hard
What if you had to live under the bridge and do anything just to feed your kids
Think about that and the deed you did the first thing that impress me kid
Oh yes you did and I ain't even tryna choke your chain or pull your leg
And I ain't even tryna fuck with your head and I ain't even tryna sweat this shit
Just spit these messages cause I'm blessed with it
What if you had the chance to be able to switch hands with me or anyone you see
And if you really wanna take it deep this shit not quanum to me
For one and each and each and all for the sci-fi mat more religious superstitious
Politicious and all the listeners with us this shit be cold as Christmas
So put your head to the sky say a prayer for the sick and the old the young and the weak
For the bombs and the single moms with six kids askin' for something to eat

Hustling waiting on tomorrow
Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

And when you get up they seem to hold you down
Down to the ground gotta stay focused with your eyes opened wide
See the sun rise I keep my hands on the steering wheel when I'm creepin' up 75
(woo woo woo) changing lanes on the regular talkin' on my cellular fast
Watching cause they wanna take me away
I'm just trying to feed my babies face
But I'm just hustling I'm waiting on tomorrow

Living life in the fast lane
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows
Sitting here waiting on tomorrow
Putting paper away
Cause no one ever knows
No one ever knows

And the only way is to keep your head on right

Let it rip, don't slip, I'm workin' with fly clips

Look, niggaz gottta brake your face like Roy Jones
Crush your bones when its on, we ain't never scared
Them Memphis boys, we so serious when its bout that bread
Kidnap family members, them niggaz don't leave no witness
They all love a gangsta, that shit be so addictive
When we pull up, they know who we are by the car
We blowin' big, and you know Diddy he gonna buy the bar

Take your vest off, I'm blowin' your neck off and eyes out
High speed chase, I'll follow you to your hideout
Shoot your fuckin' tires out, don't try to ride now
What happened to the bass in your voice, you just cryin' now
Thought you was a man, you starting to look fine now
The grim reaper been lookin' for ya, and boy its time now
And blow the roll, shit out the right side of your head man
ain't no way for retaliation when yous'a dead man

Not a scared man, we keep it, out the frame
We stayin' away from lames, and run the whole game

I keep a big old nigga beater heater
It's in the trunk of my four-door and my two seater
I'm make them say skeeter skeeter
Keep up and grab the ball back just like I'm Derek Jeter
I know you want to fuck my hoe but you too scared to meet her
See you ain't got enough bread to even start to treat her
The way a pimp did, and in the bed I'm even sweeter
I hustle, I got more Franklins in me than Aretha
If I had Oprah Winfrey I would marry her and keep her
I spit as much knowledge as preachers and teachers
Just as long as the message reach us we all fill up the bleachers
I'm the MJG, I get in yo' shit
I ain't trying to run yo' clique, that be your friend so quick

Smoking up, drinking up, kicking dust, and fucking up
Everybody want a piece and we ain't got enough for us
Yeah, I touched a brick or two, pounds I done smoked a few
Got my bread and didn't do what the fuck I was supposed to do
Money blinds players, turns them into evil spirits
Niggaz die trying to live out these old rap lyrics
I try to give it to them just how it come to me
Real and unedited, not like it be on T.V
Be myself and don't be what those haters want me to be
Take the good the bad hit my knees set me free
Make the bad good, put that on my leather and wood

What kind of nigga always run his mouth like a hoe
Like his jaw got a battery, this nigga always know
Who got robbed, got shot, who got put on lock
Nobody invited you and still you got up in the spot
Me, I'm not a witness, keep my distance, mind my business
You, somebody talk, you in they mouth like a dentist
We keep it gangsta, mommas love it cause they know it's real
Like UGK, ""we keeps it real"" mobbin' through the field
Big Ball, Fatboy, unload heat when my brain spill
You for it, images without no coke connect pills
We keep it crunk and poppin' real niggaz know the deal
We Bad Boys, anywhere we at we smoke and kill
You try to stop it, get yo' shit broke up in twenty pieces
We roll deep in brand new vehicles wit secret features
Game preachers move yo' pimpin' for you mamasitas
We players on the field, why'all niggas in them bleachers

You talkin' down behind my back (uh) you done shot off nigga
Fifty, four or twenty sack, you done shot off nigga
If you fly and got a gun (uh) when the drama come, you run 
You know what you just done, you done shot off nigga

[Verse 2: MJG]
Man, come on now, you done shot off just like Mike Davis lost a knockoff
Or his tight-ass shirt when the button pop off
You standin' it's snowin' you got yo' shoes and socks on
Who holds the key? No fucking bout it, I broke the lock off
I grew the top off, took the comma, period, dot off
And ran on wit it and broke you a whole lot off
I'm gettin' hot and startin' to boil, don't turn the pot off
You just affected wit it, pimpin' yo, get yo' rocks off
Release some pressure, stop all that cryin' and wipe ya snot off
Excuses you be usin' for losin' it's cheap as hot sauce
Earn yo' position, stop hatin' because you not boss
M-J-G, pimp tight, I'm movin' yo' spot off
And I don't reach, stoppin' yo' plans, fucking yo' plot off
I go hard and I don't sheave and I'm not off
And livin' on the edge rebellin' I'm never dropped off

Now you can either check yo' ego at the do' (door) or let the drama unfold

I'm only rappin' cause I want to, I got enough plaques
Needless to say, my favorite rappers told me to get on this track
And so I DID it, quickly wrote my sixteen down and SPIT it
By the end of the verse you'll say, ""once again, Ludacris shit it""
Then I'll wipe this wit yo' face and put yo' pride in the trash
My whole career is like my video, I'm showin' my ass
I keeps it, ""gangsta, gangsta!"" shooters and shanksters
Until you shot off motherfuckers, I'm a ""thank ya, thank ya!""
Runnin' yo' mouth behind my back until you run out of time
But at least yo' talkin' let's me know some millions stay on yo' mind

Baby, come on you know I wrote compositions
That make niggaz wish they never spoke while they were spittin
I'm so ready I'm bout to blow from the tension
Like surprise you don't even know what you gettin
I'm becomin quick at gettin slow ???
can't throw my position, I flow with persition
Is a must a keep it on the low in addition
To all my weapons and no ammunition

Jump up like a old fat lady at church
Jump back like a uncut thang at work

Fire the green up and let me shoot the shit witcha
Talk slick till I make a chick get the picture

And gun in the bushes, and money in my sock
Shit, I had hoes way before I was nationally famous
I was in the hood strapped up good
Watchin' my anus

I'm a target splitter
The world strongest man hardest hitter

You need to pump yo' brakes
Keep a heater nigga need for them restless snakes
Right in my face caught a case tryin' to defend my space

Dodging snitches police niggaz jumping state to state
What kind of nigga run his mouth and snitch out everybody?
The kind of nigga that's gone end up being a dead body
Yo' wife and children gone be searching for their dear ol' daddy

They found his headless body tied up in a dark alley
It's cold like ice and snow on a nigga soul
For bricks or snow, niggaz will fuck you like a dirty hoe
Kick yo' door and put and your babies on the floor

See you in public fuck who with you let the thang go
A nigga tell you don't let business turn personal
Fuck what they say cause for gram a nigga hurtin' you

I was torn this bitch came from the streets I was born
Pussy like a little kitty back yellow as corn
I don't go around poppin' shit wit' niggaz who talkin'
Them niggaz ain't talkin' no more

Not often do you see a nigga loyal as I
Like that boy from Best Eye nigga ready to die
For my bread and them niggaz that considered me family
Hold it down mayne I got you til we up there wit' granny

What'chu talkin' 'bout, what'chu think you doin'?
Why you walkin' out, where you think you goin'?
You actin like you didn't, you knew what I was doin'
3 o'clock in the mornin', you knew where I was goin'
Straight to my spot, a loft in the city
Stopped and picked up somethin pretty on the freeway suckin' titties
You in the bed sleepin'', I said that I was workin'
You smile when you see me but inside you was hurtin'
The cars and the clothes, whatever that you asked me
I was takin' care of you, I thought that you was happy
Out of town, fuckin' 'round, all-star, Superbowl
A-T-L, Magic City, tippin' big dick hoes
Panties on the back seat, I don't know whose shit that is
Condoms and phone numbers, I don't know whose shit that is
F'real, you know when I realized that I was wrong
When I wrote the words to this song

[Chorus]
Just tell me why baby, did I ever did I ever did I ever let you go baby
Cause I love you cause I love you cause I really love you so baby
Baby, woo, it's the very last time that I'll let you down
I won't make the same mistakes again

Yeah, since way back I was a mag-a-net for pretty women
And brought up in the city where they exercise their pimpin'
I fight temptation daily, I could be in Paris chillin'
With somethin' young, eager talent, they ready and willin'
I get a lot of phone numbers but don't really call 'em
Unless I hit 'em just to let 'em know I'm out here ballin'
I know you picture me, laid up with these other women
Most of the time I'm not, occasionally I get 'em
Who was that woman lookin' at me up in Wal Mart
Lock in the sexual fantasy, her drawers hot
But back to the subject, the chemistry I really loved it
Mental, emotional, couldn't put nothin' above it
But every unturned stone you had to touch it
Rolled 'em over, look what you found, now you disgusted
But before I leave, look me in my eye
Don't cry, never lie

[Chorus]

You and me, full of that, sticky weed and cog-nac
You like how I lick it then, put the dick up in your back
There you go, talkin' 'bout, what you know, who done said
That they saw me trickin' some-where with one of yo' friends
Did you see me do it no, do you know that shit fo' sho'
Who you gon' believe me, or them ol' meddlin' hoes
Damn, I think of all the shit I put you through
This a lonely game and, sometimes I be missin' you

I got a tank of gas to burn up, turn up the radio
Baby hit your girls, go tell 'em c'mon get ready to go
We headed fo', somewhere, tucked in and very low key
No interruptions, no cell phones, no tee-vee
Just you and me, sippin' up on some Hennessy
Makin' sure that we finish the whole, cup to the end it be
Meant to be chemistry between us and even though
You saw the bitches in my Beamer

Close the window when I roll the indo
Know they mad 'cause I roll the Benzo

Super incredible, leave a nigga runnin' back
Where the nigga really good sticky number at

But maybe somebody can give me what I need when I want no less than the best of the trees

I'm sick and tired of these same ol' broke bitches

Get some money, ho; why you wanna watch mine?
Ain't no tellin' what I'm gon' be drivin' next time
Seven-figga, nigga; we don't buy the bar no mo'

Walk like a pimp, bitch

I got New York niggas candy paintin' up they rovers
It say two hundred, but it go a little over
Not the Corvette, the Ferrari Testarossa
We can bet on any point on the dice
Pick 'em up, shake 'em twice, get 'em, girl
Look, I'm nice; I'm so clean with my G-Unit kicks on
I might be goin' in when pimp C get home

Just because I caught a case don't mean you can't be erased

It must be the ice or the money that I make
They talk behind my back, but they won't say it to my face
Ho, say it to my face (yeah), say it to my face (yeah)
They talk behind my back, but they won't say it to my face
It gotta be the cars or the trips that I take
That make 'em wanna hate; won't you say it in my face, bitch?
Ho, say it to my face (yeah), say it to my face (yeah)
They talk behind my back, but they won't say it to my face

Bet they tell ya Bun B is straight mothafuckin' G
A gangsta from his toes to the top of his fitted
Trillest nigga in the flesh; you can't fuck wit' it
Got the German hand guns - they shoot two, two, three
Bust through ya condo and rip open ya knees (rip open ya knees)
My nigga, please, you don't want it; save your breath
By myself I'm a ride till no enemy is left
When the middle finger niggas hit your block like insurgents
There's no deterrence from us cleanin' your clock like detergents
Buck, they don't think I am nigga, please
Why, this pimp - I bet they die before they reach their first
Mothafuckin' sale

Premro, Fat Boy, Eightball whatever y'all niggas wanna call me
Call me for a hot sixteen I'ma shine in the booth like a brand new bling

No fitted man just a head band, Polo shirt and some Birdmans
Still thugged out and it ain't no secret
I got my paper out the drug zones
I got my paper out the gutter man
Sellin' bud man with my brother man
If you a North Memphis raised during my D Boy days
You'd see why Gotti still love the game

Corny n****z pull up in cargo vans
Palms sweaty, icky's out with they masks all mad
I gave 'em the order and that's all bad
Born into flossin' flashin' got his mark-a**, smashed

The Iceman is in the buildin' chillin', big game huntin'
And this lame's, stuntin', got an addiction
That's deeper than a prescription, he's sleepin'
I'm on a mission to beat him in my position, it's f***ed

They know me 'round here, they call me Iceman
I ain't your friend boy, I'll f*** your wife man
Look at my left, now look at my right hand
Every time I move it looks like a strike of lightning

My name is Banks, but you can call me Igloo
There's white rocks on my neck and my wrist's blue
So don't trip 'cause you know I got my pistol
You'll be surprised of the doors that it gets through

They know me 'round here, they call me Iceman
Watch out
They know me 'round here, they call me Iceman
Watch out, I'll f*** yo' wife man

They know me 'round here, they call me Iceman

We high

Good evening ladies and gentleman
This is you're captain speakin' to ya
I'd like to welcome all of you aboard my flight
A flight that's promised to take you high
Way high up in the sky
So get out'cha blunts
Ya Dutchmasters and ya Backwoods
And I'll turn ya seatbelt signs off

I only smoke the best bud
Jamaica and Bahamas got the best herb, yes sir
I could smoke, toke after toke
Won't give a triple choke
And it won't hurt my throat, nope!
Chinky eyed, just ridin' n vibin'
On that real fire
Be high for two-three hours
And I'm cool wit' A-I, but hey
I ain't too much into Phillie's
But split a Dutch and I'll re-fill it
And I ain't friendly, so nope, ya can't hit it
I smoke good trees
Yo collard-greens full of reefer seeds
You use too many chemicals
Too much added stuff, fool, it ain't real kush!
One joint of that G-14
Will have you higher than your highest dreams, just floa-ting
Not knowin' if you're comin' or goin'
But when it's partly-cloudy, be prepared for the storm
And get high

Roll up and feel the vibe
Lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside
Exhale, we so high
Roll up and feel the vibe
Lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside
Exhale, we so high (High)

Love your stewardess coming through
With snacks and drinks
Everybody got cotton-mouth, or the munchies
So y'all keep smokin' that good-good
Help ya fly along, high
High in the sky

Roll a Cigarillo, fire it up n' hit it
Feels so good man, it's hard for me to quit it
M-I-A, land of the palm trees
T double D came through with the bomb trees
And when a nigga inhale this
I had to put my shades on, get behind tint
In the clouds, lookin' down on the ground
Eightball, big black playa from the mound
Remember when, I used to have them dime-sacks
Lil ma circle by my house wit' the weed trap
Now my Zip-Lock's be full of bubble-kush
Spark it like a broads bush when she's on douche
Fruit cocktail, you could tell, by the smell
Burn one, let the whole club know I'm here (Hey!)
Let's fly tonight
Come ride wit'cha boy and get high tonight

(Feel the vibe)
Ain't nothin' like bein' able to smoke-smoke good-good
(Enjoy the ride)
(Deep inside)
And be way up here in the air
(We so high)
Away from all the troubles
(Feel the vibe)
And problems that's goin' on down there in the real world
(Enjoy the ride)
Oh, it feel good, don't it?

Roll up and feel the vibe
Lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside
Exhale, we so high
Inhale, deep inside
Exhale, we so high (Up in the Himalayas)
Roll up and feel the vibe (Gettin' money, we out)
Lay back, enjoy the ride (Smoke on, smoke on)

The only people I know, who don't smoke
Is Jesus, see-O, and my last P-O
Yo, but I ain't on papers no mo'
Ain't gotta creep and sneak
At least not to blow (Not to blow)
I spent my first two years gettin' high
By smokin' dollar joints rolled outta 1.5's
That was 'round '84, '85
Smoke all week for the dimes
Now nigga that's live (Nigga that's live)
Visine to help clear my eyes (My eyes)
Sprayed cologne on, when it was time for me to go home
I been doin' this for twenty years (Twenty years)
Ain't never seen or heard of one man that weed done killed
So just chill (Just chill, take puff here, puff there)
Take a puff here, there
To bring ya down a lil' off ya pills
After that, go and eat'cha a meal
But'chu gon' have to bathe ya ass to get the smell out'cha hair, yeah

Roll up and feel the vibe
Lay back, enjoy the ride
Inhale, deep inside (Inside)
Exhale, we so high (We so high)
Roll up and feel the vibe (Feel the vibe)
Lay back, enjoy the ride (Enjoy the ride)
Inhale, deep inside

The booger-man himself

Take ya everywhere wit' the electric chair
Goin' let'cha see anything wit' the wind
But then again
You'll never get high like this again
Come again my friends!

Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

Woman hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

When I die, fuck it I wanna go to (hell)
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion

Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

I swear to God I just want to (slit) my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm (dead), a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't,
I can't believe (suicide's) on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies

Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died

I reach my peak, I can't speak,
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggaz lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'

Swell in my pocket
Like I'm carryin' a loaf of bread
Been around the world

Got the shit to make 'em jump
It's hyper like a pimp rally
Give 'em just a piece it make 'em
Mime me like a skip daddy

I don't think they fuckin with me whether I'm locked dead or in jail
I'm from Clayon County, Riverdale so I'm supposed to give 'em hell
I'm aware the grass got snakes, I'm aware they gon' hate
You too late, I'll be damned you take this dinner off our plate
Dirty Birds, Dirty Birds, twenty-one gun salute and got killed
It's Bankhead Brick Squad out in U.K., these niggaz ain't fuckin with me

Throwaways I let that triple up like ? triple beam we crackin

Gucci Mane, Waka Flocka and ya boy big Ball
Hard from the start; I ain't never been no fuckin lame
Here I go with Waka Flocka, here I go with Gucci Mane
One of a kind - that Memphis 10 runnin through my bloodstream
Ghetto superstar - man them hood bitches love me
Cup full of that ol' purple drank, pullin on some of that stanky dank
Pocket full of Benny Frank and bitch, what the fuck you thank?
45 hollowheads in my stout, yellow purt ?
I hope one of these ol' bitch bitch-ass niggaz don't cross that line and get hurt
Money what we came to get, money what we represent
You ain't talkin 'bout shit if you ain't talkin 'bout gettin it
Hard hustle never fold, forever I will be cold
Forever I will be big Ball, mouth full of gold

My feet hurt cuz a nigga pullin' double shifts
Rice and peas, that's some brown stool chicken cookin'
Eat a plate, smoke a blunt and fuck a little pussy
Fell asleep on the floor in my girl's arms
In my dreams dogs barkin' at the house alarm
Get louder, hold up this shit for real
I wake up lookin' for my pistol then I see my girl
Not here as I run into the livin' room
But I was too late, she was on her knees on the floor
Banger to her head, them niggas told me not to move
I'm still neck in with no weapon, what was I to do?
One nigga grabbed my girl and took her to the bedroom
The other nigga told me y'all gon be dead soon
If you don't tell me where the cash and the work at
I told him in the garage, in that ole white ‘Vette
Here I am, lying naked by the front door
Hands and feet ducktaped cuz I was moving slow
Helpless, wasn't nothing I could do

And I could hear my girl screamin' from the bedroom
I could hear my girl screamin' from the bedroom
I could hear my girl screamin' from the bedroom
I hear my girl screamin' from the bedroom

I told myself I wasn't gonna die tonight
Even though that's what the shit was looking like
This nigga that I'm doin' business with
He got a short pack and now he think I'm with the shit
That's why these niggas runnin' through my crib
I guess I'm witnessin' you really get it how you live
Now they lookin' for my car keys
Now I'm feelin' like I can't breathe
They put the loot inside my girl car
That's when the bullshit got started
Man, this fuckin' shit we live ain't got no rules

I could hear my girl screamin' from the bedroom

I heard the garage door as it came down
My girl, she quiet now, not makin' a sound
I'm tryin' to listen and make sure that them niggas gone
I can't believe this shit happened right off in my home
My girl appeared in the hallway still shakin'
Stumbled over to me on the floor still naked
Cut the tape off, I ran and put some shorts on
Looked in the garage, both of our cars gone
Fuck, 911 ain't the number to call
I know who done it I don't gotta involve the laws
That's what happens when you play with other niggas bread
Thank God cuz we both could've been dead
After that I never touched another brick at work
Took it as a sign cuz it could've been worse
Heart still beat fast when I think about it
My girl still wake up having bad dreams about it
Still here to talk about it, that's the main thing

Couple mixed drinks, now she feelin' like a star

Order more drinks, her girlfriends drinkin' with ‘er

He took a chance and he asked him for a quarter kil

Somebody had to help you out before you get it right
His uncle said okay boy, I'mma help you out
You ever get pinched nigga, never run yo mouth
Little dude got his nerve up and hit the block
Street's hot, all he had to do is pick a spot
Not knowin' that's another nigga's territory

This is my life
All my pills, all pimps and all my real bitches in the vicinity

Just a coming through your speakers
I'm big, but I still squeeze in a two seat
With the roof off but, but I rather ride big
You with the seat back like I'm chilling at the crib
Front row, in love with making money I'm so gone! 
I'm so wrong cause I hustle hard and never go home
I'm in tune, I got soul, so I vibe with the room
With the brokest mother fuckers and the riches tycoons
Where the Hennessy? I need to pour myself a double shot
And I smoke and hid the cigarette already in the box
Make movies when I ride it, to see it when I say it
At the club I almost and my DJ afraid to play it
I'm so dope, I've been told, I'm so cold when I float
I got gold on my teeth, six on the top row
I've been called many things, from a legend to a king
But I'm just another with a dollar and a drink!

All my fucked up ways, might have got them from my dad
I ain't sure all I know, I'mma keep it ten toes
In the dirt, when it hurt, when it don't make it work
Competition I ain't see it, cause to me it don't exist
Man, I was getting money back when niggas pop
West Coast on the summer with my bitch
Top back in the sun, on the pill
My advice is just don't be worry about them suckers
My heart won't let me quit, I guess I got that from my momma!

Smoking on some Afghan, getting my Cadillac and Benz
Like I owe them, even though I just grew up
I don't know a lot of people stuff and all I wish is the best for 'em
Hold me down, it's your boy, one and only Real McCoy
Really was on my way out, start to give you a little more!

Somebody told me that this rap shit was fun 
You get to smoke weed and hold big guns 
Stand on stage rockin' your Timbs wit your sons 
That's bullshit  yo I'm out to get these funds 

Yo, yo somebody told me that threw a hotter joint dies 
Could he see it? EPMD Aguilar recognize 
Niggas was stuck on Diggy before Biggie and Nas 
Test guy reported in The Source, even thought about ""Best Buys"" 
My twelve-bar Count Dracula wit lyrics spectacular 
Sippin' out of Coke and he's drinkin' terror daiquiris and chrome

Challenge any woman, balls nothing, rock the hardest 
Racoons rap with your soloists if artist

All my slick cats above the laws, higgity-hide records in stores 
Hit squad, second world tour

After, where? In corridors 
Figgity-fuck walls, I'm buildin', splittin' Dutches spillin'

See cause a big girl loves to play it with a player player (Heeey)

But say (Hey) delicious you look sweet like candy
I gotta ride shotgun with a bad bitch in the back
No matter what you see or baby what you saw
If you stand tall we gonna ball through it all
And if the police come, Don't let me take a fall
Please stuff this work in the garage of withdrawal (Which one of u like me)
She was a major hoe, its all unforgettable, last time I see her though I'ma let her know
We been drinking having fun, me and you one on one, doing things holding hands,
Making someone tell me same, we been drinking having fun, me and you one on

Intro/Chorus: 911 
The girl was lookin good 
Like a lady should 
I remember where I saw her 
I saw her in the magazine 
Her body's tight, her fingers right 
Reminds me of a girl from around the way 
Ooooh oooh, I saw her in a magazine 
Verse 1: Queen Pen, 911 
Uhh, I heard you been lookin for me 
Diggin me down, giving me nothin but peach 
Ha please, you know where to find me when you need me 
Queen P, got you charmed out like them trees 
or Lexus, heck a car load full of G's 
Impress thee, wit the realism technique 
Automatically, pulled you right into my lead 
Feel me, as you indulge in your magazine 
I couldn't believe my eyes 
When I opened up that magazine 
It was the finest girl I ever seen 
I think I knew her face 
I saw her hangin out around the way 
Watchin all the players play, whoaaa 
Her smile sets off this glow 
and when she walks, it's such a sexy flow 
I think I want to let her know, that 
(She's a bad mamma jamma) Owowohhh 
Just as fly as she can be, ohohowoh 
Chorus 
Verse 2: 911 
I, often dream of us 
and I can't believe it feels so real 
It gives me such a freaky thrill 
I like to hold her hand 
and tell all the fellas I'm her man 
But my dream came to an end 
Now that she's on my mind 
I just want to make her mine 
We'll be together til the end of time, ooooohhhhhh 
(Yes I can make my dreams come true) 
Then everything would be so cool 
and I would never spend one night without you 
Chorus 
Bridge: 911 
I can't explain, what she's done to me 
So fine that it's a crime 
Ooooh, I want her in my life 
She's one of a kind 
That girl, she blows my mind 
Verse 3: Queen Pen 
uhh, ain't no need for awakening, 'cause you're not dreaming 
I mean your optics be as clear like semen 
It's me, squeaky clean, mentally and physically 
I be's the one to weigh you down like a triple beam 
Whore on the low low, never showin off like dem other hoes 
I let my appearance show and prove 
That's my motto, boo, styles of all types 
So peel the lights and Pen, keeps it tight

911,"Time waits for no one, sure as the tide pulls the ocean 
Sure as the path that's been chosen cannot be changed 
In my life's destination, I searched for the explanation 
For some kind of reason for my sorrow and pain 
But in my isolation, I learned to listen 
To be thankful for the love that I'd been given 

This is my journey, journey through life 
With every twist and turn, I've laughed and cried as the road unwinds 
This is my journey, and I've learned to fight 
To make me strong enough, to lift me up, to bring my dreams alive 
In my desperation, I swore never again 
Would I hear all the laughter of my friends and my family 
A million tears that I'd cry then began to dry 
Silence of the night time 
I have come to realize a sweet inspiration filled my horizon 
Gave me the heart to go on and never would give in 

I'm going to love each moment of every day and every night 
I'll look back to the past with the sweetest smile 
For now, I realize I've been given the key to life 
I've been kissed by the angel by my side

We let this love just fade and die

All the diamonds and the pearls

And then we turn around and put something in yo 
It's tightwork when you holla out we ready 
Laid back smoked out off in the Chevy

When she drop dat big booty on down to the flo' 
It's tightwork when you got a pair of gators on 
Step off in the club and you got dem broad's head gone

Then bust off in da club with a gangsta limp 
If you a pimp and you got yo pockets swoll up

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us

The best things in life were absolutely free
But no one appreciated a sky that was always blue
And no one congratulated, moon that was always new

So it was planned that they would vanish now and then
And you must pay before you get them back again
That's what storms were made for
But you shouldn't be afraid for

It rains pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud
Contains pennies from heaven

You'll find your fortune's falling all over town
Make sure that your umbrella is upside down
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
Cause if you want the things you love, you must have showers

So if you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

Don't call Pharocon to squash it

And the coroner's office
Tell 'em there's a dead body
In the corner of Lawson
And Alston, I would proceed with caution
These motherfucka's really think the 'Te done lost it
He sold a couple records now they think he flossin'
But I ain't stopped battling, I just stopped rattling
Off rhymes for free 'cuz y'all were making me nauseous
Understand fucka I'm gon win regardless
I still got the hunger pains from my apartment
When me and 9th were both splittin' cans of StarKist
Arguing about who LP was the hardest
And a hand full of CD's ready to burn
Some real hip hop for your listening nerves
A year later hooked up with a nigga named Murs
Now everybody play our records for they women and churn
Jay-Lee got the Eastcoast getting the loot
Living Legends on the Westcoast, ready to shoot
Get ourselves while they call up the troops

Skip the sidekick, I'm a nextel nigga
If I hit ya on the chirp, with a verse you better roger that
Picture word-perfect from the land where the Dodgers at
Trying to get some money with some pussy on the side of that
Never have to ask where my killas or my riders at
But when fake gangstas try to find where them dollars at
Go to any city where there's pretty ma's to holla at
The illest in your state, one on the tour-date
And more-great, than your grandfather's father
'Te I know it gotta hurt a man they stand by the slaughter
Oughta be locked away when I rock this way
Get rocked on the airwaves but not for play

'cause I ain't fucking around
I'm gone

Listen up, bro
I'ma let yo know
Fuck it, hit when I spit, I throw body blows
Why? Every line is powerful enough
And now that you stuck
Next time you know, acknowledge the Buck

We ain't going no-where
We iller now, fuck a rap line or a verse
We're contemplating on letting this nine off first
But 'ma just chill and just work

I heard you making a song, but got no deal
Oh yeah, the record that you making so the cops don't squeal
You amazing like blocking O'Neal - Not for real
You amazing everytme you think you shopping a deal
With ya - mixtape of the year

I am a vet
I am a threat
I am the reason that you sweat at night
Watch your neck
Disrespect ain't a part of my vocab
Ya know that
Step to me, get caught like a slow cab
No jab, just hooks and bars
Hooked the underground first right after I hooked them stars
Got niggaz in their cars bobbing their heads
Talking about - Buck ain't shit
You heard what he said, off with his mouth
I coulda told you, when you like act like a bird

Caught a glimpse in the mirror, can't keep me on point

Finally made it to Midtown, walked in the Legend's Isle
Got one waitin', so I gotta go second
Checkin' it with Quan, cran and Goose
C-2 got his son in the shop runnin' loose
to set the slang straight, ya girl is ya cape

Thinkin' that the grass is greener on the other side I panicked
Settlin' down so young, wasn't how I planned it
Man it seemed like yesterday, we was all about each other
Never in a million years would I need another lover

But sayin' something new while we make love would it kill ya?

I put on the weight
You put on the brakes

Momma's so proud of what her boy from the hood done
Got off the meat and I got my mind right, I
Got out these streets I got my grind like I
Got on these beats I gotta come tight it's
Gotta be me, it's gotta be 9th
Your boy dropped some stuff and it was probably nice
But they need a little help, and a lot of advice
Quit while you're ahead, you ain't seein' no bread and
Don't sleep on us, you can sleep when you're dead
And grateful, you didn't live life hateful
Change for the better like the weather in April
Food for the soul, go ahead and grab a plateful
A heart full of hate, is a waste and disgraceful
Uh, don't ingest, turn your stomach
When a brother only wanna see another brother plummet
Come with cha best and you can lose like the rest
Straight shots when I shoot how we do on the West
Yeah!

You know who we might be, man myth or M-C
But Murs sums it up best now, wouldn't you agree?
I, stuck to the plate like it's And1 and straight
Sew the mic around your neck and then bounce it off your face
With grace, the ace in the hole, replacin the old
Cause the new generation got a taste for some soul
Hold on to opinions 'til I tell you to have one
That mic wasn't hot until the spot 'til I grabbed one
Off the stand now it's off the hook
And when the beat is this nuts, then I'm off the books
Meaning, off the head, freestylin' makin' bread
And I shoulda been in a movie but I made my own instead
Still pioneering with this independent hustle
And your mic cord is much too short for you to tussle
For the man that pro like 40-Water, poured in remembrance
Of every hood soldier that died in ghetto tenements
Innocent 'til proven guilty
Should I die don't look for the dude that killed me
Look for a brighter tomorrow, and in spite of the sorrow
Live every moment to the fullest so your life isn't hollow
And you can holla out my name from the top of the game
And since you passed homey I promise I'll do the same
For if a soul is avenged through the deeds of a friend
Then success has always been the best form of revenge
THE END",Murray's Revenge,2006
9th Wonder,"What up though?
Murs, 9th Wonder
Murray's Revenge!
Y'all know what time it is
Shut your fat.. nah
Watch your mouth and lower your tone and keep your hand on that cell phone
We back

Now my day in the sun has come, the one chosen
To break up the ice that got the rap world frozen
Speak that slang that'll heat up the game
Now, roll down your window turn the beat up, it bang
Feelin' the breeze
Let the world know they still makin' real MC's
So please, make a call, tell your friend, tell the hood
That we back and revenge never sounded so good
Questionin' 9th about choppin' vocal samples
I chop you in your throat 'til you choke on the answer
Nice with this mic since I was broke and handsome
'Til I get my respect I'm holdin' dope for ransom
From the West coast, everything I flow's an anthem
A&R's who slept are now throwin' a tantrum
Hand 'em over boys, your jewels and your girls
Bow down to the sound cause ""Murs Rules the World""
I'm better than your favorite rapper
But it don't take much these days for you to master the mic
Most of these rappers trapped in the hype
They makin whole albums, only half of it's tight
So they never really have an impact on your life
That's why ""3:16"" was genius
We all connected through this ""Minstrel Show"" man, I mean it
Until my days end I'm gettin' paid my friend
Without pimpin' my soul, the gangster limpin' was old
So I ""Walk Like a Man"" and, talk to my fans
Clocked a few grand but you gotta understand
I got a little money and I, coulda bought a chain
But my momma woulda killed me, simple and plain
Exchange foreign currency, for legal tender
Now I'm back to end the era of the great pretender
So pull your pants up and, turn that noise down
It's Murs and 9th Wonder on the second go 'round",Murs Day,2006

That lil' stuff between your legs ain't gon' keep me
And neither is you callin' me every five minutes
Like you need to know what I be doin'
I'm at where I'm at, and I'mma be where I'mma be
And that's about all you need to know
And you need to use your inside voice when you talk to me
'Cause all that raisin' your voice to me in front of your friends
In the car on your cell phone,
It's not hot, it's not cute, and it ain't gettin' you nowhere
And it's about to get you fired
So, calm it down

Now, fellas we all know that's the oldest trick in the book
What you do, you wait around, wait until she break down
One day at the crib, she gonna let you break ground
Soon found out she was so real with it
One year, no love man who would deal with it
Me? I fell for it, romancin', financin'
A couple years back I would've told you there was no chance in hell
But oh well, here I was
That's how it be when you're falling in,
Uhm, I wouldn't say that
Well, maybe it was
Them trips to the Gentleman's Club...oh well
They made me feel like I was givin' but I was gettin' back

And there's not a single thing that you can do, do
You're playin' on my phone, and you won't leave me alone
I think it's finally time for you to get a clue, clue
You told all your friends about the time we used to spend
And I'm 'bout to run it all throughout your crew, crew

Ooh, I called Pam
You know the one who always liked me
You tried to tell her that I had a drip just to spite me
But she didn't buy, guess what?
We're down to tryin'
And we did a lot more than kiss, I can't deny it
I took her to the Hyatt, tied her to the terry
Took Tasha to the Hyatt, oh yeah I went there again
And starin' in my windows, it's just not hot
Always knew you were a freak, never knew you liked to watch
And I'mma call the cops next time you come to my job
And my new girlfriend, she from the hood, she kind of suave
When she take out them earrings, crunch time--punch time
Believe me, I know, let me tell you 'bout this one time
I came home late, didn't call, wait that's not the point
She gets in another fight, she goin' back to the joint
So, don't waste your time, we both know you can't fight
Now, quit hidin' in the bushes and go home, goodnight

Yo, I knew this silly chick was diggin' me
I told her I had a girl, but if you keep it on the low, you can get with me
See I done switched the game up
Now she ask when I'mma leave her
Leave her? You know the answer last time that came up

Why you keep stressin'? Just keep undressin'
This a headache, man I swear I never learn my lesson
Told myself about these undercover villains
All these silly chicks end up always catchin' feelin's
And what am I 'sposed to do when a late night freak in the jeep
End up gettin' a little too close to you
Close to who? Close to me?
Nah, my little thing on the side, this ain't how it's 'sposed to be
Supposed to hit it (hit it), quit it (quit it), and hit it again
Chill for a while then flip it again
But she started acting crazy I split to the ends
She told her girl how I get down, now I'm hittin' her friend

Alright, alright I ain't getting out of bed today
9 to 5 to survive, there's gotta be a better way
Waking up early to punch in the clock

But my kids need socks and shoes,
I'm walking through the office (boss yelling)
Who you talking to don't you know on the streets I would've
Never mind, the past is the past I gotta leave it behind
But man back on the block I was a bonafide hustler
Spot popping off until the police rushed us
Handcuffed us I though I was gone
Could've cried thinking now I'd miss my son being born
But I was blessed, beat the case now I'm trying to reform
But this white folks make it so hard to move on
You gotta jump through hoops, anger management groups
But the fact I'm still standin' here today is proof that

When I first met my little baby girl annette
She was standing at the bus stop, sucking on a lollipop
Eyes collard green lean thicker than a pork chop
(stop) cause I don't eat swine
But this girl was so divine, that I had to make her mine
Called upon her a few times, she thought I was funny
Fell for it like a dummy, it was all for the money
(j-eah) growing up in the hood,
You would think I'd understand, but I never understood
Why she rarely came around when my dough wasn't good

Now you can call it puppy love, cause I got dogged out
Now in all my notebooks, I got her name crossed out
But she lost out, I just lost profit
When she left me in the cold, heart broke like my pockets and

You know the days when you just got the blues
All stressed and depressed from just watching the news
No matter what good you do, it seems you always get screwed
Got you caught up in your feelings, now you off in a mood
Shake that attitude and do what you can
Set a couple goals, follow through with your plans
Time wait for no man, and tomorrows not promised
So if she's still alive shoot a call to your momma

Nobodies perfect ain't none of us worthless
We all got a place and we all got a purpose

The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we
The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly (Mocky Remix),2008

And to the beat Com sense'll be the sure shot
Come on

I met this girl, when I was ten years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school, when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic checking her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas, had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out and listen to her
Sitting on a bone, wishing that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
Cause we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh yo, when she was underground
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister
Boy I tell ya, I miss her

Now periodically I would see
Old girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body but she started getting thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about stopping the violence
About my people she was teaching me
By not preaching to me, but speaking to me in a method that was leisurely
So easily I approach
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West coast, and that was cool
Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm a man of expanding, so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in L.A
And she did stud, she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the pro-black, was going out of style
She said, Afrocentricity, was of the past
So she got into R&B hip-house bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and it's all good
I wasn't salty, she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becoming well rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just having fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung

I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once the man got to her, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, looking rock and dressing hippie
And on some dumb shit, when she comes to the city
Talking about popping Glocks serving rocks and hitting switches
Now she's a gangsta rolling with gangsta bitches
Always smoking blunts and getting drunk
Telling me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressing how hardcore and ""real"" she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed, but so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same letting all these groupies do her
I see niggas slamming her, and taking her to the sewer
But I'mma take her back hoping that the shit stop

Wanna know what the problem is
Can you tell me what the problem is?

The problem is we all out for self
In a world that's consumed by greed and wealth
It's a dog-eat-dog and we cannibals for capital
The will to survive in an animal is natural
But the desire to rule
In the pursuit of pure power is the path of the fool
We chase crown till we laying face down

Beyond all the bullshit and the stereotypes

Never worry about the past, it ain't worth your time

Education at an all-time low, still catch an all-time high
Off the kush Dr. Greenthumb grow
I ain't preaching, I'm just giving you a real twenty-four
It's a cold world these streets don't feel anymore
There's no way you tell it 
The people's government, the big time villains
Rob us blind, steal it, just the way it is
Take you for a gang of loot, twenty dollars got you, I ain't?
Now tell me why's that, they blame the lies in rap
But what about the medium bullshit? They disguising that
How we got access to ammo and any size of gat
But we can't get a decent school for us to knowledge at
It's called the block madness
They know they turn us into crime addicts
On the block chasing superficial status
Now do the mathematics, how many of us die in war
On the street or for all who sleep and score
The same cops you pay to protect and serve us
And the country turns it's back even though you fought for it in service

You never know about it till you",The Problem Is...,2010

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""

My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me
Inn her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""

You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Did this shit in the past
But I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?)

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
