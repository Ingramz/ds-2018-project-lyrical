You print on me
I'm on my way for real
No matter
you make me guilty 
My only word is 
""Free""!

Everybody
Can disagree 
So what???
You'll be the muse 
For me...

Just free!!!",Carpe Diem,2009
Quentin Mosimann,"Gainsbourg Zéro-Dix
S'rait-il Mayfair où Saint-Sulpice ?
Videur, danseur, voyeur, artiste ? 
Hardeur ? Petit... petit pianiste ?

Dis-moi, Gainsbourg Zéro-Dix
Mon coeur dresserait-il la liste
De nos erreurs pointillistes
Chauffeur, chauffeur, place Vendôme... vite

Gainsbourg Zéro Dix
Plutôt Lee Cooper ou Levis ?
Blazer ? T-shirt Dorothée Bis ? 
Ou pull-over sur du Van Cleef ?

Gainbourg Zéro Dix 
En poinçonneur planqué en Suisse ?
En twister-twister bout de piste ?
Ambassadeur, sad et sadique ?

Gainsbourg Zéro-Dix
Et quelle liqueur dans quels calices ?
Rhum-planteur ? Un doigt de pastis ?
Long islander ou cannabis ?

Moi rêveur et pensif
Monaco Heuer, cinq moins dix ?
Chambre junior en haut du Ritz
Les connaisseurs l'appellent la suite : ""Gainsbourg Toujours""


	Je vois le Pont-Neuf qui s'illumine au loin
	""Gainsbourg Toujours""
	Elles... soixante-neuf moins mes cinquante et un
	Ça fera toujours
	Toujours mon amour
	Dix-huit au moins... 


Gainsbourg Zéro-Dix
En myspacer ou chez Philips ?
Petit branleur Repetto bis ?
Neuvième mineure à la Franz Liszt ?

Gainsbourg Zéro-Dix
Plutôt chanteur, plutôt Matisse ?
Gitane filter sur les quais tristes
Marchand d'couleurs ? Vendeur de kiff ?

Gainsbourg Zéro-Dix
J'm'en fous d'Ge-Ser, je sers la vis
A mes douleurs un lien se tisse
De cette blondeur à cette métisse

Moi rêveur et tardif
Quand sonne l'heure du room-service
Dans la noirceur du jour qui glisse
Les connaisseurs connaissent la suite : ""Gainsbourg Toujours""

	Je vois le Pont-Neuf qui s'illumine au loin
	""Gainsbourg Toujours""
	Elles... soixante-neuf moins mes cinquante et un
	Ça fera toujours
	Toujours mon amour
	Dix-huit au moins...

Quentin Mosimann,"Si je dois finir ma vie – avec les anges,
Ce n’est pas leur compagnie – qui me dérange,
Mais je crains qu’ils me fassent mourir d’ennui.

Quand je s’rai devant St Pierre – qu’on me condamne
A la descente aux enfers – tout feu tout flamme,
Aux mains de Lucifer et de ses femmes

Quitte à trop m’y plaire et perdre mon âme.

S’il ya un paradis
J’irai à l’opposé,
Oser les interdits,
Oser tout essayer,

S’il ya un paradis
Il n’est pas fait pour moi,
Je suis trop bien ici
Pour m’enterrer là-bas

Dans les salons V.I.P – de la luxure
Je relèv’rai le défi – aux âmes impures
D’avoir eu raison de me faire venir,

Des sept péchés capitaux – je f’rai le tour
Sans répit et sans repos – la nuit, le jour
Même l’éternité sera trop courte,

Quitte à rendre mon ticket de retour,

S’il ya un paradis
J’irai à l’opposé,
Oser les interdits,
Oser tout essayer,

S’il ya un paradis
Il n’est pas fait pour moi,
Je suis trop bien ici
Pour m’enterrer là-bas

Une vie

Querencia,"Siempre seras la niña que me llena el alma
Como un mar inquieto, como un mar en calma
Siempre tan lejana como el horizonte
Gritando en el silensio tu nombre en mis labios
Solo queda el eco de mi desengaños
Sigo aquí en mi sueño de seguirte amando

Sera, sera como tu quieras pero así sera
Si aun tengo que esperarte siete vidas mas
Me quedare colgado de este sentimiento

Por amarte así
Es esa mi fortuna, es ese mi castigo
Sera que tanto amor acaso esta prohibido
Y sigo aquí muriendo por estar contigo

Por amarte así
Aun paso de tu boca y sin poder besarla
Tan cerca de tu piel y sin poder tocarla
Ardiendo de deseos con cada mirada
Por amarte así
Por amarte así
Por amarte

(Y siempre seras la niña que me llena el alma
Y no se aguiten mis Alacranes musical)

Así voy caminando en esta cuerda floja
Por ir tras de tus huellas convertida en sombra
Preso del amor que me negaste un día
Contando los segundos que faltan por verte
Haciéndote culpable de mi propia suerte
Soñando hasta despierto por hacerte mía

Sera, sera como tu quieras pero así sera
Si aun tengo que esperarte siete vidas mas
Me quedare colgado de este sentimiento

Por amarte así
Es esa mi fortuna, es ese mi castigo
Sera que tanto amor acaso esta prohibido
Y sigo aquí muriendo por estar contigo

But it don't work, it just gets louder
In the city, in the city

The big apple took a bite out of me
Look what I turned out to be
I wonder if my mama really means it when she says that she's proud of me
Or is she tripping, is she lying
Is she on to all my lies? Mean that shit ain't rocket science
I've been coming home at four, and my eyes been red as sirens
I miss slurring all my words when she asked me how my night went
I swear it's them white boys, it's them white boys
Everything they do is so much doper than my life been
I don't got that type of money, I don't got that finance
She's like, why you so lazy trying to get by
Back before I smoked, I wasn't even tryna get high
Cigarette breaks at lunch time
Bong rips to my face, I passed out at Dave's place
In the morning tryna get right

These girls are kinda bougie, mom calls 'em fast
Some say you pretentious but I call it class
Prep school boys with their collars popped
Coming through the spot, always see you with your sleeves rolled up
Even with a uniform
I could never do the norm
How could I forget? I be on some shit
Now I rock sweats and I still get it
New kids never fit in, I wasn't any different
Had to get my mind right, wasn't ready for those bright lights

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Hold on girl, now don't be blue,
dry those tears for me and you,
Can't you see our love is true, when you remember,
To do just what you say you'll do, can't you see I live for you?
And I need you to trust me too, open your eyes.
So the sun can shine lights in you, will light on your windows,
And change all your baby blues to golden sparks that light your eyes,
When you finally realize that your fears were all just lies,
So open those eyes and let the sun shine lights in you,
Light on your windows and take all your baby blues

Back the way you came
Can't you see that flash of fire
10 times brighter than the day
And behold a mighty city
Broken in the dust again

Oh God, pride of man
Broken in the dust again

Turn around go back down
Back the way you came
Babylon is laid to waste
Egypt's buried in her shame
Their mighty men are all beaten down
Their kings are all fallin' in the ways

Oh God, pride of man
Broken in the dust again

Turn around go back down
Back the way you came
Terror is on ever sign
Though our leaders are dismayed
All those who place their faith in fire
In fire their fate shall be repayed

Oh God, pride of man
Broken in the dust again

Turn around go back down
Back the way you came
And shout a warning to the nation
That the sword of God is raised
Yes, Babylon backed by it's city
Rich in treasure wide in fame

Oh God, pride of man
Broken in the dust again

And it shall cause your tower to fall
Make of you a pyre of flame
Oh, you who dwell on many waters
Rich in treasure wide in fame
You bow unto your, your god of gold
Your pride of might shall be a shame
For only God can lead his people

Have mercy on the people

I heard you singing
What were you singing when the people got right?
Were you singing Stand and Deliver?
Or was it Down by the River?
Were you singing a fine old tune like Gone to Glory?
Laying it down with grace and power
Long about the midnight hour

I heard the people all singing
Like they'd never sung before
All over the country
Who could help but stand beside you?

Hello, hello - is there anybody here?
My knuckles are sore from rapping all day
I said: Give me one more chance
I'd do it for you if I had your way
If I had your way

What do I know? What do I see?
Don't know nothing but the name of the game
It's high-card draw with everything wild
You bet your life like anyone's child
What else would you want to do?

I heard the people all singing
Like they never sung before
Singing in key and strumming
Everything they heard from you
Hello, hello, hello, hello ... goodbye

Looking back across the years
Other matters disappear
In the murmur I can hear
Familiar voices loud and clear
Hello, hello, hello, hello ... goodbye

I heard you singing
Like one last song in the middle of the night
Were you singing in tongues of fire
Or was it knots of anger?

Were you singing a fine old tune like
Love Me, Love Me, Love Me Only?
Were you caught btween the curtains
Thinking this was too uncertain?

Remember ... the people were singing
Like they never sung before
All over the country
Did you love the way they loved you?

Ain't no knocker on the last big door
Just push on the panel and walk on in
Hello, hello, is there anybody here
But a two-bit high and a busted mirror?
Hello, hello - is anybody here?
My tongue is so sore from rapping all day

Sunshine in the dead on night
I know that can't be right
Could it be? I don't know
But it never done that thing before
So close to my own back door
It got me wondering what to do
And the only thing was to come and tell you
Because - I heard you singing - I heard you

And I'd bow out...

It played on the lake like a mandolin
Now it's washing her away again

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go

The boat's steaming in
I watch the side wheel spin and I
Think about her when I hear that whistle blow
I can't change my mind
I knew all the time that she'd go
But that's a choice I made long ago

Los hambrientos piden pan 
Plomo les da la milicia, si

De esta manera pomposa 
Quieren conservar su asiento 
Los de abanicos y de frac 
Sin tener merecimiento 
Van y vienen de la iglesia 
Y olvidan los mandamientos, si

Habrase visto insolencia 
Barbárie y alevosía 
De presentar el trabuco 
Y matar a sangre fría 
A quien defensa no tiene 
Con las dos manos vacía, si 

La carta que he recibido 
Me pide contestación 
Yo pido que se propague 
Por toda la población 
Que el león es un sanguinario 
En toda generación, si

Por suerte tengo guitarra 
Para llorar mi dolor 
También tengo nueve hermanos 
Fuera del que se engrilló 
Los nueve son comunistas 
Con el favor de mi dios, si",La Carta,1995

Separada do marido está morando sozinha
Além dela ser bonita é um poço de bondade
Vendo meu carro na chuva ofereceu sua garagem

Ela disse, ninguém usa desde que ele me deixou
Dentro da minha garagem teias de aranha juntou
Põe teu carro aqui dentro, se não vai enferrujar
A garagem é usada mas teu carro vai gostar

Ponho o carro, tiro o carro, à hora que eu quiser

Tiro cedo e ponho à noite, e às vezes à tardinha
Estava até mudando o óleo na garagem da vizinha

Ponho o carro, tiro o carro, à hora que eu quiser

Tiro cedo e ponho à noite, e às vezes à tardinha
Estava até mudando o óleo na garagem da vizinha

Só que o meu possante carro, tem um bonito atrelado
Que eu uso pra vender cocos e ganhar mais um trocado
A garagem é pequena, o que é que eu faço agora?
O meu carro fica dentro, os cocos ficam de fora
A minha vizinha é boa, da garagem vou cuidar
Na porta mato cresceu, dei um jeito de cortar
A bondade da vizinha, é coisa de outro mundo
Quando não uso a da frente, uso a garagem do fundo

Quincy Jones,"I have often walked
Down the street before,
But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before.
All at once am i
Several stories high,
Knowing I?m on the street where you live.

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.

For a feeling that's so new, so inviting, so exciting.

Who've never felt the joy we've felt.

Whispering how much you care,
A thousand violins fill the air now.

Keep standing close to me,

Quincy Jones,"Everything must change
Nothing stays the same
Everyone must change
No one stays the same

The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
Cause that's the way of time
Nothing and no one goes unchanged

There are not many things in life
You can be sure of
Except rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

Winter turns to spring
A wounded heart will heal
But never much too soon
Yes everything must change

The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
Cause that's the way of time
Nothing and no one goes unchanged

There are not many things in life
You can be sure of
Except rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
And butterflies do fly

Rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
And music
And music
Makes me cry",Everything Must Change,1974
Quincy Jones,"Hey, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Well, the first time I saw you
Was the first time I lost you
And the first time I kissed you
Was the first time I missed you

There were times when we tried to
Get by with some love too
But the things that we went through
Were so cold, don't let me remind you

It takes one to be alone
And it takes two to carry on
Tell me what you want to say
When you'll take my love
And just walk away

Is it love that we're missing
Peace of mind we're not getting
Are the games that we're playing
Simply our way of entertaining

Since the start you don't seem to
Realize what I've been through
Since the start I have tried to
Make you see that I need you

It takes one to be alone
And it takes two to carry on
Tell me what you want to say
When you'll take my love
And just walk away

And at times when we drift to
Our knees but forgot to
Leave behind all the past fun
Sometimes I find it hard to comfort
Wonder why we're not one

Is it love that we're missing
Peace of mind we're not getting
Is it love that we're missing

Is it love that we're missing
Peace of mind we're not getting
Tell me is it love that we're missing

I tried so hard to make it work
But it seems to me, only got hurt

Is it love that we're missing
Peace of mind we're not getting
Is it love that we're missing

Leave behind all the past fun

Is it love that we're missing

They bury us in soot
Pretending it's a chore
To ship us off to war

You can no longer hide

If I could bring you back, back to where this love once lived?

What would I do for one more precious moment with you?
What would it take to make your heart hear the truth?
To ease our pain I caused, make up for the time I lost with you?
What would I do?
Anything

Are you doing all right?
Have you found a life apart from me?
As it [unverified] you happiness
I don't want to know about it

'Cause night after night, I try to fight the emptiness
In this quiet room
Life goes on without you

Where would I go if only you would ask me to?
No road is too long if it would lead me back to you?
Somehow I found a way, if you called to say that you need me there?
Where would I go?
Anywhere

Are you doing all right?
Have you found a life apart from me?
For now I must confess
That I don't want to talk about it

'Cause night after night I try to fight the emptiness
In this silent room
There's no peace without you

How do you make it last?
How do you keep the song from fading
Too fast?

How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way?
How do you not run out of new things
To say?

And since you know we're always changing
How can it be the same?

And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart won't fall apart
Each time you hear his name?

I know the way I feel for you is now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever, forever

If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better as it grows
With any luck than I suppose
The music never ends

The way I feel for you is now or never (how do you make it last)

Why don't you say
Maybe she has it in her mind
That she's just wasting her time
Ask her to stay

You'll just blow your chance
Take the time to open up your heart

Buy her some moonlight to wear

The sweetest of debts if she wants to pay

You wanna die, wear the wrong color rag
I used to walk in stores and yell: ""Lay down!""
You flinch an inch - AK spray down
But I was lucky cause I never caught the hard time
I was blessed with the skill to bust a dope rhyme
All my homies died or caught the penzo
Lost their diamonds, cops towed their Benzos
Livin that life that we thought was it
Fast lanin, but the car flipped
I'm not gonna lie to ya, cause I don't lie
I just kick thick game, some people say: why?
Cause I'm back on the block, I got my life back
So I school the fools about the fast track
I get static from the style of my technique
Profanity, the blatant way in which I speak
But the Dude knows the streets ain't no kiddie game

He told me: ""Ice, keep doin what you're doin, man
Don't give a damn if the squares don't understand
You let em tell you what to say and what to write
Your whole career'll be over by tomorrow night

What another man saw in a race of people
To see him give his life for the price of equal
The highest wisdoms, the richest kingdoms
The Song of Songs we heard David sing them

He showed me makin love, even showed me strung out

Put through slavery and killed for bravery

Lies perpetrated as truth, and it left us

The clock is always running and
No one ever seems to have enough

And when you least expect it
You come upon the places you find love-love-love
Remember in a flash the feeling can hit you
After all the times that it missed you

Reaching deep inside to find your secret heart, yeah, yeah
Look around you notice you're flying
And for once you're not even trying
City lights below you like a million tiny stars, oh yeah

It's a river never stopping
Winding in and out
But you should never doubt
It will lead you

To the ocean someday
There's no way to fight it
Let it carry you away
Everybody's dreaming waiting for the feeling

That moment when they finally rise above
But it's always in the giving
That gets you to the places you find love-love
Remember in the poorest part of town

Where the sun never reaches the ground
And seeing's not believing
The feeling stays alive-yeah, yeah
Little children laughing and playing

'Cause they haven't learned to start hating
Never giving up-no
'Cause they still believe in love, sweet love
Love, love, love, love, love

Remember in a flash the feeling can hit you
After all the times that it missed you
Reaching deep inside to find your secret heart-yeah, yeah
Look around you notice you're flying

For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,1996
Quincy Jones,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1996
Quincy Jones,"I want to know, baby

				",If I Ever Lose This Heaven,1997
Quincy Jones,"It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Dear one, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Sweet child, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

We seemed to float right through the air
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere

And now when there's moonglow, way up in the blue
I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you",Moonglow,1997
Quincy Jones,"The best of everything, that's (that is) what I wish you all
The best of everything, a Rembrandt (hanging) on your (the) wall
A yacht that wins you cups, skateboards with style and speed
Show dogs or loving pups, the pride of the pound or the pedigreed
I hope you win that prize, pass that blue ribbon test
I hope your good keeps getting better, til your better's best
With every wine you taste, with every song you sing
By now you may have guest, I hope you get the best of everything",The Best of Everything,1997
Quincy Jones,"Baby I just want you to understand
Just exactly how you make me feel
Ooo, oo yeah
I want to feel you next to me, oooo

Time after time, when I'm feelin' low
Something inside of me, lets me know
It's alright, love's on my side
When the world, seems a lonely place
I've got a dream that won't leave a trace, of the blues
I just think of you, baby I know

[Chorus]
I've got a real thing, here by my side
Someone who needs me, holding me tight
And these special feelings, won't ever fade
Cause I knew, I knew from the start
You put a move on my heart

Baby our love's, like a melody
Playing for us in the sweetest key
You could find, the music of life
And when we touch
There's the warmest glow
Heat in the passion that heaven knows, is a dream
Just for you, you and me
And baby I know

[Chorus]

I've got a real love, yes I do
And you're someone baby, you're someone baby
You're someone that needs a true love
And these, these special feelings, time can't erase

Hold me, love me

Quincy Jones,"He stays out every night
And leaves me all alone
He never tells me where he goes
I'm not the only lonely one
Just ask a woman who knows
We used to share our troubles
And our good times too
But now I'm left with all the woes
I'm not the only sorry one
Lord, just ask a woman who knows
The days are long
The nights are longer
I've got the lonesomest blues
You know my only consolation
Is I ain't got nothing more to lose
So there you've got the story 
Of a love gone wrong
That used to blossom like a rose
I'm not the only broken heart
Mmm, ask a woman who knows
Well my only consolation
Is I got nothing more to lose
So there you have the story
Of a love gone wrong
That used to blossom like a rose
But I'm not the only broken heart
Just ask a woman
And I'm a woman
Just ask a woman who knows",Ask a Woman Who Knows,1998
Quincy Jones,"Blue gardenia 
Now I'm alone with you 
And I am oh, so blue 
He has tossed us aside 
And, like you, gardenia 
Once I was near her heart 
After the teardrops start 
Where are teardrops to hide?

I lived for an hour 
What more can I tell 
Love bloomed like a flower 
Then the petals fell 
Blue gardenia 
Thrown to a passing breeze 
But pressed, yes they're pressed in my book
Of memories 

I lived for an hour 
What more can I tell?
Love bloomed like a flower

But pressed in my book

Of memories",Blue Gardenia,1998
Quincy Jones,"Our little dream castle with every dream gone,
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,
The end of the story is told on the door.
A cottage for sale.",A Cottage for Sale,1998
Quincy Jones,"Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There is nothing in life but you

I never regret the years that I'm giving
They're easy to give when you're in love
I'm happy to do whatever I do for you

For you maybe I'm a fool
But it's fun
People say you rule me with one wave of your hand
Darling, it's grand
They just don't understand

Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love
There's nothing in life but you",Easy Living,1998
Quincy Jones,"A-B-C-D-E-F-G
I never learned to spell
At least, not well

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
I never learned to count
A great amount

But my busy mind is burning to use what learning I've got
I won't waste any time
I'll strike while the iron is hot

If they asked me, I could write a book
About the way you walk, and whisper, and look
I could write a preface
On how we met
So the world would never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot
And the world discovers
As my book ends
How to make two lovers
Of friends

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot
And the world discovers
As my book ends
How to make two lovers
Of friends",I Could Write a Book,1998
Quincy Jones,"My story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see your fabulous face

[Chorus]
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?
Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see you obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
But I get a kick out of you

[Chorus]

I get a kick out of you",I Get a Kick Out of You,1998
Quincy Jones,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do 
If I had you
 
I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while

I can't even think of his name
But it's funny now and then
How my thoughts go flashing back again
To my old flame

My new lovers all seem so tame
For I haven't met a gent
So magnificent or elegant
As my old flame

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes
Some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love
Were only imitations of
My old flame
I can't even think of his name
But I'll never be the same
Until I discover what became
Of my old flame

When love was only in the mind
I realize
Ain't no second chance

Baby, come to me
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm oh-so glad I found you
Need you everyday
Got to have your love around me
Baby, always stay
'Cause I can't go back to living without you

Spendin' every dime
To keep you talkin' on the line
That's how it was

And all those walks together
Out in any kind of weather
Just because

There's a brand new way of looking at your life
When you know that love is standing by your side

Baby, come to me
Let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be
And I'm oh-so glad I found you
Need you everyday
Got to have your love around me
Baby, always stay

There's a chill to every evening when you're all alone
Don't talk anymore
'Cause you know that I'll be here to keep you warm

And I'm oh-so glad I found you

Finds us caught in life's most sensible trance

And old dreams find young wings

Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

Written by, and from the archives of Tupac Shakur
Dedicated to the memory of Vincent Van Gogh

A creative heart obsessed with satisfying
This dorment and uncaring society
You have given them the stars at night
And you have given them bountiful bouquets of sunflowers
But for you there's only contempt
Though you pour yourself into that frame and present it so proudly
This world could not accept your masterpieces, from the heart
So on that starry night, you gave to us and you took away from us
The one thing we never acknowledged, your life

Yeah, game laid down by Q, why'knawmsayin?

You gave to us, and took away from us
Starry night, your life
You gave to us, and took away from us

Uh, uh, watch me live my art; writing words from my soul in blood
I speak the truth on every thang I love
I'll probably sacrifice my life, to send my message through mics
It's like a war drum calling soldiers at night
It's bigger than music I spit it straight from the heart
So it's cold n dark and deep like a universe, but nah don't start
It's for ya entertainment but it's my life why all
And I can't rewind, fast forward, or press pause
But when you give your all, it's like the fans demand more
And after the tour I sit alone like before
When ya name is hot it's all love, the world is yours
But when you fall off, you get ignored

You on the cover of da magazine, flossing on the TV screen
Toastin' wit yo' champagne, playin' life like a game
Loaded in the limousine, love to hear the fans scream
Swimmin' wit the sharks now, ain't no love money king
People got they hands out but ain't nobody lendin' hands
Can you really blame dem for tryin' to get what they can?
Late night, bright lights, lust n lies
And anythang goes under the Hollywood sign
Well you might lose ya soul and who knows what you find
But go ahead main we all want to shine
But go ahead main we all want to shine

There you have it
Why'know, when I was younger I prayed, to get in this game
Why'know to hold dis microphone in my hand
I asked the man upstairs, to let me rock a crowd one day
Why'know let people out there feel the way I feel through my music
Like my homeboy Tupac did fo' sho'
And he gave that to me
But he didn't he didn't he didn't let me know
About all the shady shit that's in, in between
You and yo' dream, why'know?
See it's more than the music, I spit it from the heart

Always pulled me from my seat

She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

Years go by I'm lookin' through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel on the pages in-between

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye

I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
Too see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

My memory has just been sold

It's okay I understand
This ain't no never-never land
I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on

Take you car, Yes we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

The pages from my mind are stripped

Oh yea, I guess I gotta buy it!

Hey there
You with the stars in your eyes
Love's never made a fool of you
You used to be too wise. 

Hey there
You on that high-flying cloud 
Though she won't throw a crumb to you
You think someday she'll come to you. 

Better forget her
Her with her nose in the air
She's got you dancing on a string
Break it and she won't care 

Won't you take this advice
I hand you like a brother
Or are you not seeing things too clear?
Are you too much in love to hear?
Is it all going in one ear
And out the other?

A young player, bred in South Central
L.A., home of the bodybag
You wanna die, wear the wrong color rag
I used to walk in stores and yell: ""Lay down!""
You flinch an inch - AK spray down
But I was lucky cause I never caught the hard time
I was blessed with the skill to bust a dope rhyme
All my homies died or caught the penzo
Lost their diamonds, cops towed their Benzos
Livin that life that we thought was it
Fast lanin, but the car flipped
I'm not gonna lie to ya, cause I don't lie
I just kick thick game, some people say: why?
Cause I'm back on the block, I got my life back
So I school the fools about the fast track
I get static from the style of my technique
Profanity, the blatant way in which I speak
But the Dude knows the streets ain't no kiddie game
You don't know the Dude? Quincy's his first name
He told me: ""Ice, keep doin what you're doin, man
Don't give a damn if the squares don't understand
You let em tell you what to say and what to write
Your whole career'll be over by tomorrow night
Rap from your heart, and your heart's with the street

To dance in France, alone in Rome
On the farmlands of Nebraska, the cold of Alaska
The heat of the motherland
To be with my brotherman
On top of a snowcapped mountain I'm scoutin
What another man saw in a race of people
To see him give his life for the price of equal
The highest wisdoms, the richest kingdoms
The Song of Songs we heard David sing them
He showed me me when I was young and hung out
He showed me makin love, even showed me strung out
He showed me poppin nines, standin on a rock
But tears came to my eyes when he showed me my block

Cause I remember of my people bleedin
Put through slavery and killed for bravery
We shoulda got our freedom much sooner
You never seen a blackman on _The Honeymooners_
But now somehow we've learned to earn, to grow, to show
The elevation of a people built is so

An everlasting omnipresence is my present
State of being, seeing the unpleasant
Sight of righteous souls live like peasants
The mind stunts growth in adolescence
My insight enables me to enlight
The weakest of minds, and I put em in flight
As I transcend, a-scend or de-scend
Re-create, re-incarnate and re-send
The powerful spirits of our ancestors
For those that don't know how God blessed us
Because man messed up, the media dressed up
Lies perpetrated as truth, and it left us
Confused, but I've seen it all before

But none so beautiful
Not one so beautiful

None can take the place of my love

When I laid my eyes on that
Near to me boy with that far away look
And right from the start I saw a new horizon
And a road to take me where I wanted to be took
Needed to be took

Quincy Jones,"Every time we say goodbye, I die a little,
Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know.
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.
When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to minor,
Every time we say goodbye.

Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason

That he's so willin' to make whoopee

Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring

He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious he even sews
But don't forget, folks
That's what you get, folks, for makin' whoopee

Of makin' whoopee

She sits alone 'most every night

He says he's busy, but she says, ""Is he?""
He's makin' whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Only five thousand per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You'll pay six to her""

He says, ""Now, Judge, suppose I fail?""
The judge says, ""Budge right into jail""

Quincy Jones,"Perdido, I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
While chancing a dance fiesta
Bolero, he glanced as I danced the Bolero
He said taking off his sombrero: 'Let's meet for a sweet fietsa'
High was the sun when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Perdido, since then has my heart been perdido
I know I must go to Torido, that yearning to lose perdido
I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido
He glanced as I danced the Bolero
He smiled as he tipped his sombrero
High was the moon when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Since then has my heart been perdido
I must go to Torido, that yearning telude

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Holiday tables under the trees
April in Paris, this is a feeling
That no one can ever reprise

Till April in Paris
Whom can I run to?
What have you done to my heart?

And I melt with desire
Just a touch of your hands
And I burst into fire

And my whole world fills with music
When I'm lost in your embrace

And I'm not misled

That you see turns your head

And it scares me that tomorrow
Someone else may take my place

One that they could croon

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail

The midnight sun was shining too
No more is night a wild delight
With all the world on fire
And yet I can't escape
The lips I still desire
I see two silent silhouettes
Against a flaming sky and sea
And then I know, though I'm a fool to care
Again, somewhere
The midnight sun will shine for me",The Midnight Sun Will Never Set,2012

Make my dream a reality 
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie
 
Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality 
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie

There was a terrible flood that year
People lost everything they had

Their crops, their live stock
That means their horses, their mules, cows
Goats and everything they had on their farm

And they would start cryin' and singin' this song

They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
Lord, they tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
They tell me, Joe turner been here and gone

Then they would go out hunting rabbits, 'coons and 'possoms
Anything they could catch
Sometimes they would catch something, then again they didn't

And when they would come home, they would find
Flour meat and molasses
In their homes and they would know that
Joe Turner had been there and left food for them

And they would start cryin' and singin' this song

They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone
Lord, they tell me, that Joe turner been here and gone
They tell me, Joe Turner been here and gone

Then they would start out lookin' for wood
And stuff to make a fire
And they would look in their yards, and they would find axes, wood
That Joe Turner had brought there for them

Then they would get happy
And start singin' and cryin' this song
They would get happy and do a little boogie-woogie too",Joe Turner's Blues,2013

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

When you taught me how to say

To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

You gotta pry it from my cold dead hand 
Want me to give up my weapon?

Wear sunscreen

If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it
A long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists
Whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable
Than my own meandering experience, I will dispense this advice now

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth, oh, never mind
You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth
Until they've faded, but trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back
At photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now
How much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked
You are not as fat as you imagine

Don't worry about the future
Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing Bubble gum
The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind
The kind that blindsides you at 4 p.m. On some idle Tuesday
Do one thing every day that scares you

Saying, don't be reckless with other people's hearts
Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours

Floss

Don't waste your time on jealousy
Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind
The race is long and in the end, it's only with yourself
Remember compliments you receive, forget the insults, if you succeed in doing this, tell me how
Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements

Stretch

Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life.
The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives
Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't

Be kind to your knees

Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't
Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the 'Funky Chicken'
On your 75th wedding anniversary
Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much
Or berate yourself either
Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's

Enjoy your body, use it every way you can
Don't be afraid of it or what other people think of it
It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own
Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your own living room
Read the directions even if you don't follow them
Do not read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly

Brother and sister together we'll make it through
Some day a spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting but I've been waiting to be there for you
And I'll be there just helping you out whenever I can

Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good
Be nice to your siblings, they're your best link to your past
And the people most likely to stick with you in the future

Understand that friends come and go
But a precious few, who should hold on

Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle
For as the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young
Live in New York City once but leave before it makes you hard
Live in northern California once but leave before it makes you soft

Travel

Accept certain inalienable truths
Prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too, will get old
And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young
Prices were reasonable, politicians were noble
And children respected their elders

Respect your elders

Don't expect anyone else to support you
Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse
But you never know when either one might run out

Never mess too much with your hair
Or by the time you're 40 it will look 85

Be careful whose advice you buy but be patient with those who supply it
Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past

You got to make her feel it everyday, boy
She's got to know that she's not walking on shaky ground
Think it over

Don't take for granted the smile upon her face
Check a little bit closer, you might find a tear trace
Maybe the little girl never said a mumbling word
But she's got to know that her voice is heard
Oh, I had a love, it was a true love and I lost it
Now I'm suffering all this pain that the true love cost me

Quinn Lemley,"Just heard of the Shorty George
Got word of the Shorty George
Seems that it's a kind of jig  
Named for someone about so big

He rambles around the town
Preambles around the town
Then stops on a crowded street 
'n beats his feet till his feet is beat

Watch him go! - and he can - 
Like a real- nach'-l man
High Stepper is Shorty George
Black pepper is Shorty George

He dances to pay the rent
And to see that you're solid sent
Mister can you spare a penny?
Lady can you spare a dime? 

He makes, I don't know how many
'Cause he's dancin' all the time. 
Popa's dressed up mighty sporty
Momma's snooz-in' in the shade

But while mommas's catchin' ""forty""
Shorty sees the rent is paid
Get hip to the Shorty George
Hop, skip to the ""Shorty George""

Directions are short and sweet
Beat your feet till your feet is beat

And latch onto ""Shorty George""

I told you I'd be down forever
Loving you is danger, but it don't feel wrong
It's old news, I should look for better
Falling back to strangers, leave me hanging on
You leave me hanging on

Flare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late
Still I dial those numbers every time
Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?
Slowly wishing you were never mine

Why am I still holding on? I'm still holding on

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Clouds are feathers from a lady's fan

Long ago when love began
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly 
A love that could never be mine

Did you find it easy to forget?
I keep on dreaming while the years go drifting by
Calling you my ""Sweet Regret""
