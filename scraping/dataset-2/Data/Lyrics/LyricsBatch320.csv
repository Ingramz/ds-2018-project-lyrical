GoldLink,"I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving, moving-oving
Every now and then

Lil' shorty, shorty, he from the hood right
All he wanna do is get some respect from the homies that came before him
Or either go bust his MAC-11 or try to be Kyrie Irving
It's either die working
Little nappy fade with the braids and the socks tucked
Nike boots in the summer, that boy is real tough
He said to me, ""Link, I like your style, I'll answer ya""
Feel the pain and I'm ready sing

I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving, moving-oving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
Every now and then

Look at Link, the hood fable
The streets crazy, baby, crazy
Now we turned up
How we went from backpages to back stages
And black nominees, and hood DVD's, and world domination
This shit like the Matrix
This shit feel like the end of a saga
This man Linky have problems
This man Linky be poppin'
This man Linky can rock a couple hundred
Turn it to a couple million people now they're crying out

I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, mo-moving, moving-oving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
Every now and then

I can feel Him
Moving, moving, moving
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, moving
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, moving, moving
Every now and then

I can feel Him
Moving, moving, moving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, moving
I can feel it in my bones
I can feel it all in my heart, in my soul
I can feel Him
Moving, moving, moving, moving, moving

Goldman,"Dis-moi pourquoi tu es mon seul problème
Dis-moi pourquoi tu es mon seul souci
On récolte la vie que l'on sème
Mais quand vient l'amour on est un peu surpris

Oh, à cause de toi, je ne suis plus le même
Oh, par ta faute, j'ai changé aussi
Je ne sais pas où ça nous entraîne 
C'est la chance ou bien c'est de la folie

Si tu n'es pas vraiment l'amour tu lui ressembles 
Quand je m'éloigne toi tu te rapproches un peu 
Si ça n'est pas vraiment l'amour de vivre ensemble 
Ça lui ressemble tant que c'est peut-être mieux

J'ai un problème, je sens bien que je t'aime 
Oh, j'ai un problème c'est que je t'aime aussi 
Ces mots restent toujours les mêmes 
C'est nous qui changeons le jour où on les dit

Oh, j'ai un problème, j'ai bien peur que je t'aime 
J'ai un problème, j'en ai bien peur aussi 
En perdant on y gagne quand même 
Et puis après tout, on a pas choisi

Si ce n'es pas vraiment l'amour tu lui ressembles 
Quand je m'éloigne toi tu te rapproches un peu 
Si ça n'est pas vraiment l'amour de vivre ensemble 
Ça lui ressemble tant que c'est peut-être mieux

Oh, si tu n'es pas vraiment l'amour tu lui ressembles 
Quand je m'éloigne toi tu te rapproches un peu (rapproches un peu)
Si ça n'est pas vraiment l'amour de vivre ensemble 
Ça lui ressemble tant que c'est peut-être mieux

Oh, si tu n'es pas vraiment l'amour tu lui ressembles

(me can't believe the girl have me under so much raps)
Heartbreak suzie don't you waste my time

Wasn't it you who left me alone
Wasn't it you who called me on the phone
Wasn't it you who wrecked my home
Wasn't it you who wanted life alone
You must be crazy (you must him mottle)
To still want to be my lady
You must be crazy (mm)
To still want to be my lady, hey

I know now fi tell her say, ha

You said you wanted a break up
Your love was a fake
There was a mistake made
You said you wanted a break up
Your love was a fake
There was a mistake made

I reminisce about the time we had just me and you
And how much days and nights we spent upon that lonely cruise
You were the only one for me I bet I could not lose
And out of many beautiful women you are the one I choose
To love and honor and protect and even say ""I do""
But then you wanted us to part and that's when I refused
But still you left anyway and suddenly I had the blues
Now here's a the pass and no one else could ever fill your shoes

You sending me up bringing me down got my head just spinning around
Come on in get on out baby why you wanna go that route

Say you must be crazy (hey girl you must have giddy)
To still want to be my lady, yeeeah (mr lover, come back to me, ha)

Nothing in this world could extinguish my flames
You are the only one I wanted to bare my name
All of a sudden I notice you playing mind games
Giving me migraine so much emotional pain
You were the one and no one else could make that claim
It's a shame to see the relationship down the drain
Now you want us back together and it won't be the same
What your aim is it to cause me more pain

Heartbreak suzie playing with my mind (mm) (mmm)
Heartbreak suzie don't you waste my time (you're wasting my time)
Heartbreak suzie playing with my mind yey(step a fall and beat)
Heartbreak suzie don't you waste my time

You must be crazy (got me turn on the side ya say quieter)
To still want to be my lady
You must be crazy (she's a naughty)
To still want to be my lady

Huh
Ring a ring a Rosie gal a so you boise
Sweeter than that nobody can understand
Now you could have broken my heart inna so much section
Mash me up until me nearly turn in a mad man
Walk and kick stone and turn over rubbish pan
Now you want me back I know I'll be a senseless man
Naw go end up inna the same situation
Go try to find another goon fi turn in a cartoon
So what

You said you wanted a break up (heartbreak Suzie)

Goldroom,"Did you have to leave so soon?
Didn't wanna make you run around
'Cause it seems I've tripped up once again
I'm lying down again
Staring up in to a cloud of questions, why
Blurry visions of tired eyes
Got a lot of things that I need to say
Got a lot of things that I need to
Find a way to rest my head
Just try to clean my eyes
Why'd I let you walk away
Why'd I let you walk away
'Cause I'm thinking it’s you

I’ve been thinking 'bout you everyday
I see you walking round my way
So easy to get to your embrace
It’s like you never went away
Glow, like you can't escape the rays
You're brave enough to save the day
Love hoping we can make it fade
Come on through to your embrace

Didn't wanna make you run around

Goldrush,"When we met we still had innocence
And we did things 'cause they made sense
Without trying hard I made it final
And we conceived our children on backseat vinyl
Though we didn't have a lot
(But) one was quickly bought
Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
You weren't satisfied I was only superhuman
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help...
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
Well I could only stand sitting here so long
You don't need my help
You'll have to learn to help yourself

Can't trust your bitch, can't trust your partner
And you sho' nuff can't trust the white man

You trust yourself

[ VERSE 1 ]
I'm strugglin and strivin, hustlin and divin, and duckin from the five-o's
And from them marks right down the way we call our rivals
Young soldiers ten deep on the grind spot
We got the trumps and dimes hot and here's where the line stops
And I can't keep my nine in the bushes, Spice
Cause them jealous niggas and them dopefiends and the fuckin vice
Want a nigga to close shop because I'm tearin a grip
I got they spot shook down, let's empty the round, down the clip
They try to ride, must thought we leave, nigga, but never that
They send some dopefiends over to kill us, nigga, but never that
Straight punks call the task
They can't work the helicopters, k9's and gats on that ass
Niggas hit the fences droppin all they twamps, intentions fail
Tryin to make it to my hooptie, but my homie scooped me
Hittin fences, one of my boys got snagged
We tried to get him loose, but the k9's came and chewed his ass
My other boy's on the roof jumpin house to house, he lost a step
And fell to the ground and broke his fuckin neck
They're killin my crew off, they're killin my crew off
We gotta split up or these k9's and helicopers gonna get us
So I bail, never look back, I think I lost him 
Killed his k9 dog, I cut him up and then I tossed him
My other boys said fuck it, they stopped and had a showdown
Before they got took the task counted four down
My other bro was hurt, he hit his knees and threw his hands up
They put two zips of coke in his pockets, then they put him in handcuffs
I was almost through the share and breathin heavy
If I made it when I got behind the wheels I knew they couldn't fade it
I done told you bout them do's and can't's and that shift kick
I hit them corners and five-o got ditched quick
Them niggas ratted us out, the five-o banged coke and gatted us out
Now I'ma show you fools what bein mad is about

The five-o, hoes and niggas know
I can't give them my trust
Cause if I turn my back on them
They just might start to bust

[ VERSE 2 ]
I started with ten niggas, I'm down to the dome
I got no block to call my spot, I got no hood to call my home
I must stay strong and maintain D.T.A.
My real homies are gone, so now that gotta be the way
I started in the streets like a hobo, now I'm mobile
I organize my business, but I still duck the robo
I make mo' money, breakin ounces down sellin sacks, fuck them savages
Kickin my dough down, lookin for packages
I had to down my Chavelle and come anew
Cause I was hot from the block when I used to run the crew
In Oakland on the East Side you know how we ride
We like to swing and slide, whip them old schools and make them inches tight
So I flip the 50 with deposit tractions
Sitton on chrome, Toni supercharge ?Braxton?
You hear me then you wonder where I am
The Flowmaster dude's barkin hard with the hitters and them camps
First 50 in the Town with the racing stripes
Smokin it up like them dopefiends basin pipes
Niggas know I got the sack
They got a drop but I don't, but they know the trigger got my back
I see they mouths droolin, niggas gettin shifty-eyed
They want to jack me cause they know that my 50 ride
One fool tried to jack me on the late tip
Aimed for this chest but I caught him in the hip
Keep one in the chamber with the meter on my dick
Since the safety's on the trigger you'se one dead nigga

I can't give them my trust
Cause if I sleep, they'll creep on me
And then I will be fucked

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now I got them zippers and them quarters and them eights
My stack is gettin fat, so I'm lockin it up in safes
I got the combination tatooed on my brain
Hear all them busters sayin, ""That dude's rollin caine""
Whenever the niggas are rollin the dank and the stank I'm makin the bank
I set up a shop on the block cause drivin and servin the fools I can't
I told you in the first verse my first shop got shut down
100 grand strong from the dank, I gives a fuck now
A daily operation, more than 40 grand a week
And if they raise the profit, the Goldy man'll speak
The rollers give a fuck about the niggas grindin dime sacks
They always slap em up and scare em just to find where I'm at
Shit, there was a time when I was a soldier on the block myself
Now I'm stressin and I'm knowin now that I got my wealth
Now I'm the man with the team that's worked with under me
But I don't trust none of them fools as far as I can see
I know I should cut em loose
Cause if they get caught and have to do 5 they turn me in and settle for 2
Plus they're bringin me five g's a day
I can't let em go, I'm stuck, so I gota hit my knees and pray
Cause I'ma go out like I came in, a soldier
And if I get corner shopped, you all be sayin I told ya
And what I made is mine
Fuck you hoes tryin to find where my safe is at
You all get your face a smack
I don't trust anybody
I be one locked up or dead nigga with a hidden safe full of money

[ CHORUS 1 & 2 ]
The five-o, hoes and niggas know
I can't give them my trust
Cause if I turn my back on them
They just might start to bust
The five-o, hoes and niggas know
I can't give them my trust
Cause if I sleep, they'll creep on me
And then I will be fucked

Yeah, muthafucka
Watch your backsides and your frontsides
Don't trust any muthafuckin body
You can't trust the white man
You can't trust that janky bitch you're with
You sho' nuff can't trust the next nigga

	Really though

The game is sold, not told, stop holdin your hand out and wantin a freebee
I'm from Oakland, you can never be me, so stop ridin my dick and makin it greasy
Easy to take what's Oakland's, you klepto, you stepped though
When we asked your ass who started that 'bitch' word sayin from the get-go
(Biaatch) In 1982 I heard it from Too $hort
Moms and pops said, ""Turn it off"", but you stuck and said, ""Fuck rap from New York""
Cause your dick got hard, but you ain't seen a pussy or been in one
Listen to $hort, be ready to mack some bitches when it's done
It's some of that mackish Oakland street shit, 'bitch' wasn't no secret
But it got famous when we said it when that beat hit
When $hort dropped, niggas rappin now was infants
We taught you the pimp-player-mack game cause you didn't know the difference
You took the game and twist it, bent it out of shape
Payin a bitch, givin her free dick, savin, just without a cape
Mark, afraid they call your woman a bitch and put that bitch in her place
Keepin her payin you cash and put your dick in her face
Brims, perms, Caddy's with the 5th wheel
We told you some of the game you ran, wouldn't, couldn't sit still
So now it's time to take back what you stole, and make you fold

So let the game out-slick and hit a high note
And then scream out 'bitch!' and let em all know you love Too $hort, biatch
Now everybody want to pimp, mack hats on a simp, niggas frontin on a pimp
I'm from Oakland, California where _The Mack_ was made
Grab a pen, start pimpin, like that, you're paid
But your game is shallow, not pimpin, you a car thief
Worse than a fake gangster rap to a hard beat
I tell it like it is, not sittin at the house thinkin music biz
I got love for the pimp game, niggas stop dissin
Daddy's in the house, and when you hear, pops listen
Next time you start mackin in a studio session
I got to charge his punk ass for lessons
Cause he want to be $hort Dog so damn bad, why'all
Bitin on my dick tryin to show that ass off
Workin that image just like me
But the game is sold, it don't come for free
And I won't say ""please"" when I collect my fees
Bow down, little nigga, drop to your knees
And recognize the original pimps on the mic

All about that real Oakland mack shit, busters, not no phoney
Dressin up like the old days, the player's ball ain't Halloween
We give one in Oakland every year, stay home and keep your collar clean
Cause you're not like a player, more like a shade-tree, better yet a rest haven
Tuck your dick in your ass and watch your chest cave in
Where I'm from niggas be mackin hoes for bread and water
Mackin they wife, cause stackin is life and times is gettin harder
All of a sudden you don't know
That $hort said never love a bitch or a hoe?
Mark, so recognize that you learned it from the legendary Too $hort
You stole that image and stole that game, we claim that shit that you wrote
The slow beat, fat bass, and funky bassline
With a name like Mike Dog get bit from $hort Dog, I know it taste fine
Like givin a fool a ounce of coke, keepin his ass from goin broke
When he get rich don't give you shit, you saw him, but he never spoke
What? What part of the game is that?
We gave you the sack and gave you the game to run it
Without this Oakland game you wouldn'ta done it
You midget rat bastard, you should be blasted for the dicks you rode
To get the game, cause it's sold, not told

Wear that hat like me, nigga, act like me
But I bet that muthafucka won't get fat like me
Cause it's more than a pimpin-ass image and a style
I been doin this for years, gettin bitches all the while
A real player gotta know how to lay his shit
Fake players get a bitch and don't be sayin shit
You a player? You get teased sometimes
I'm a pimpin-ass nigga makin g's for lines
Some call it gangster rap, even though it ain't
Won't nobody get shot while I spit this game
So call the pimp police, and just hold it
I put the game to the beat, and niggas stole it
Now some want to-be from Oakland pimp
Knocked two bitches, ain't broke em in
You ask me, that shit is foul
You want some money? Can't get it now
You gotta change your style, you can't pimp no more
My old tapes still sit in the record store
Sellin more than yo new shit do
You said you had bitches, nigga, who pimped who?
Cause you're workin in a warehouse now
Bout to blow your brains out tryin to wear my style out
You shoulda picked some other songs to rap
Cause Oakland, California is the home of _The Mack_

And if my game is right, man, then I can knock her boots
Because to me a girlfriend is of past tense

I was a lemon treatin' tramps like women
Never understood the reason why I couldn't go in em
Now a hoe will think twice before she choose on me

Thinkin' that you're pimpin', and

Know all the Lincolns and the Grants and the Jacksons
Bitches at your door, a rich dude givin' you action

So you kick em down one, two, three, four hundred
And when I saw you with the broad, boy, you sho' fronted
Loud talker like a father figure
But any punk can play her father if his pocket's bigger
And you hoes get treated like a child again
You don't work or go to school 
And get beat when you act a fool
Go home to da 255 pounds for you gladly 

You know you hate the sight of him
Damn, but you'se a tramp and if it pays you good, you might love him
Don't you have any self-respect?
Is the dollar that mighty that you trade him sex?
Now tell me, what does that price include?
Will you suck me and fuck me and dance in the nude?

Well, now you got me trippin', baby
I could buy your freak, toss her up, and call her my lady?
Well, that sounds pretty damn reasonable
I'll just pay her, if that's all that's pleasin' the hoe
What does that sound like to you?
Well, for the right price, player, you got yourself a prostitute

I once had a bitch named Anne-Marie
Fucked her sister and her mother down her family tree
She was just another prospect, a player had to test her
Flashed my money, played dumb like Uncle Fester
Make her think that I'm her sugar daddy
She can lick me, cause I'm full of candy
Man, I got her bitin', she thinks she found herself a sucker

But I'm a pricier, let's see how much it is to fuck her
And if she got a cheap price ring
Cool, then I won't buy her nice things
You see, her values are low, her self-respect is minimal
30 dollars is a steal, makes me feel like a criminal
10 for the movies, 20 for an entree 
Take her to the house and tossed her up the sautee
Dip her, then I flip her on her tummy first
Yeah, you know I gotta get my money's worth
You see, the rule of the game is, you pay to play

See, I call her up, and it's cool for me any day
All there is is an initiation fee
Fronted one time, now it's always free
But a sucker-punk mark keeps payin' the freak
Got sprung on the pussy cause his game was weak
You better hope you can afford the hoe
Cause if you miss a month the rate, she'll be out the do'
Lookin' for the highest bidder that wants to get with her

Punks lease her with an option to buy, but I rent her
30 dollars and I made you sin?
It was cool for a night, now I'ma trade you in
And let me tell you bout the trade-in policy
You trade a freak in and get a woman with quality
One with values and high standards
Not a freak with no fuckin' manners
I need more than a piece of meat
Most freaks can only fuck bare gettin' sleep
What does that sound like to you?
Well, for the right price, player, you got yourself a prostitute

There's a fine line between a girlfriend and a prostitute
But you'se a trick, you thought she loves you, but it's not the truth
It's always odd when you're fuckin' your lady
That you always seem to fuck her on payday
So when you're 200 short, you never trip
A good fuck and 'I love you' is some bullshit
It's a routine, not a new thing, every paycheck
She was bitchin' last night, now she's alright
You never tripped on her attitude adjustment
On payday she be callin' you her husband

I got a plead with my homies
Because when I was broke a lotta bitches didn't know me
Shit like this occurs cause of punks like you
Give em money, pay they rent, buy they clothes and buy they food
The hoes get spoiled and sprung on the treatment
If you step to her broke, then you're turned down frequent
Yeah, you got your high-siders in the drop coupes
Let her ride front seat, then you knock boots
Girls try to play real sweet and innocent

But what they really want is salary and benefits
Damn, I ain't sayin' I'm a stingy miser
But if you play me like a punk, you'll be layin' in kaiser
Usin' sex as a bargainin' tool
So you can get my credit cards and charge em up, fool
Hoes posin' as girlfriends tryin' to get over on me
Playin' themselves just like a tramp, I do em like ???
Now I got another victim, so let me get a quick one
My pants on one leg when I pound and never kiss em
Shit, you want to act like a hoe? Then be a real one
I'ma treat you like you ought, make you feel dumb
When I'm fuckin' I'ma yank it out 
Shove you in your ass, make you fall on your face so you think about
How cheap and sleazy and trampy and stragglin' you really are

For some money or to ride in someone's silly car
Don't you feel like a jackass?
Man, on your hands and knees that fast
A little dinner and a movie is a joke
Cause when it's over, you're still goin' home broke
Now to all the homeboys, let me ask you somethin'
How many of y'all know you got a real woman?
Try to analyze and think practical
Cause if she's sellin' you her sex, then you smack the hoe
And stop callin' her your girlfriend
And treat her like she wants you to

Whipped cream, nuts and cherries

It started at the ice cream parlor, 8 o'clock, she said call her
So that I can come and get her 'fore she's picked up by her father
So I smashed up in the Malibu
How would you feel watchin a fine thick hoe just smile at you?
Dick was rock hard from the start, I couldn't tame him
I didn't want her to see it, so I tried real hard to aim him
I tried to put it to the left, then put it to the right, between my thighs
But I was embarrassed cause I was wearin sweat pants showin my dick rise
Man, I knew she saw it, cause it stood up like a totem pole
Butterflies in my stomach as my scrotums roll
Then she glanced out my window movin her hand up my lap
She was goin for the dick, I knew the cap
Then she moved her hands up by my nutsack
As her other fingers pressed by my buttcrack
Then she grabbed it, squeezed it, jacked it
Got me out my drawers in the car, damn, she macked it
The she put her succulent lips
Right up on the helmet of my gold-ass dick
All you heard was slurpin and sirpin
As she was workin with my hand on her head jerkin, whole car swervin
Immaculate head, man, you can't beat this
Swallowed my dick with lips and tongue and done it all teethless
She went inside the work bag and then brought out the whipped cream
I went to the house and parked it and said 'let me serve this dickfiend'
Laid me on my back, put the whipped cream on my dick
She sprayed it in my ass and licked the split
Oh

Whipped cream, nuts and cherries
Whipped cream, nuts and cherries
Whipped cream, nuts and cherries
Whipped cream, nuts and cherries
I got my whipped, now I want my nuts and cherries
Whipped cream, nuts and cherries

Do you want this dick, tell me that you want this dick (I want it)
Put your legs on my back, clamp tight, let me run it
I was pullin, long-dickin, hittin the walls
I felt the pussy juice just drenched my balls
Pussy hole tight, wet and succulent
Soundin like some firecrackers pop when I was fuckin it
Talkin dirty to me, sayin, ""Fuck me harder, baby""
I start dig in that pussy poundin, had her wild and actin crazy
Rolled her ass over with one motion, never came out
Long-dickin it from the back, she screamed and called my name out
(Oh Goldy!) Big smooth round ass on my stomach
So I start to slap it, ""Do you want it?"" (Yes, I want it)
So I laid back with my dick still inside it
With her back to me, up and down, baby, ride it
Nothin but a long stiff dick in her cock
Deep, had her yellin, ""Ooh yeah, that's the spot""
So I start to pump it hard on my back drilling it
She was about to nut and I was too cause I was feeling it
Then she start nuttin, but I didn't want to, I said, ""Hold up""
Start her around facin me, then pulled her down and slowed up
Suckin on her earlobes, I'm fuckin romantically
My nut went away within, I was back to fuckin frantically
She was nuttin, she was tired, she was weak, she was whinin
Said she couldn't take no more and said she's 'bout to start cryin
By now I could feel my nut oozin up my shaft
Muscles gettin sore in my thighs and my calf
Started poundin the pussy faster, faster, ooh, I'm bout to nut
Come on, baby, oh - fuck...

Whipped cream, nuts and cherries
Whipped cream, nuts and cherries
I got my whipped cream and nuts, now I want my cherries
Whipped cream, nuts and cherries

I got a cravin, honey been savin, givin me the appetite
Watchin her grow and preppin her mind, she's ready to give me the cat tonight
I wrapped her up, packaged her, she's ready for delivery
After tonight I popped that cherry and she'll always remember me
The first man that told her and showed her how to fuck
The first man to lick her and show her how to suck
Now let me take my time and say that she is 17
Fine and thick, never been licked a dick, the girl is heaven-clean
Start suckin on her titties, slid my finger in her pussy
Her hair was trimmed neat, I sho' hate when they bushy
She was squirmin and breathin hard, my finger had her stuck
I wonder how she'll feel when I really start to fuck
Young bitch don't know what she wants till I teach her
I could lick her pussy, but my dick's the main feature
Took my time putting it in, but you know that I was urgin
To fel the warm pussy of this tight young virgin
I made her look at my dick, play with my dick and squeeze my balls
Until there were no problems at all
I want this dick to be her best friend, soon she'll learn to love it
And takin it upon herself to start to suck it and rub it
I put the dick in her mouth, but she bit it
Told her to use her lip jaws and tongue and she did it
Now I broke the ice and the fear is now over
Laid her on her back and put her legs up on my shoulder
Gently inserted the mushroom head of my dick
She took it for a second, then she pushed me out quick
The tight snappy cock had my dick long and so hard
It took many tries till I really got to go far
When I got inside, I didn't start pumpin
Cause everytime I pulled my dick out she was jumpin
So I fucked her slow, then I start to pick the pace up
She's screamin, squished her face up as we tore the fuckin place up
Her pussy was so tight, on my dick when I was through
I pulled it inside out and tore the skin, need some tissue
Wiped the blood offa me, offa her and off the bed
Pussy throbbin, irritated, can't close her legs
Popped her cherry, now it doesn't matter who is after me
Cause the pussy's always mine, end of verse three
Got that cherry

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Send out the monkeys, they come out of the bushes
To piss in the punch and then smash up the decks
It's your party, we're all obliged

But now you must realize
All the world would like to play with you
You hide inside yourself the whole day through

Tell me, tell me how would you feel?

I don't have to speak, she defends me

She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show

He told me he belonged to me but from me he would hide.
And that I would not hear his voice until I learned to sing.
Now every time I sing I know that I belong.
Belong to him.
Singing O why... Singing O why...

He told me he would teach me everything I tried to know.
He made me see that you and me are dreamers in a show.
And when the days were darkest then he lit them with his moons.
And then we crossed the rainbow bridge but we came back...
Came back too soon...
Singing O why... Singing O why...

He showed me where he was Atman that man I could not see.
He pointed to the sky until a ladder I could see.
I climbed for many lives to find the secret golden flower.
And then I woke and found I'd slept for less than half...
Than half an hour.
Singing O why... Singing O why...

He brought us back together then when I was all alone.
He made me see I was not just of earth and skin and bone.
O it makes you feel so beautiful you can tell your Self apart.
Everytime you listen to the wise man in your heart.

Precisam de um remanso
Precisam de um sono

Com a barra de seu tempo
Por sobre seus ombros

Eu vejo que ele berra
Eu vejo que ele sangra
A dor que tem no peito
Pois ama e ama

Se castram seu sonho
Seu sonho é sua vida
E vida é trabalho

E sem a sua honra
Se morre, se marta

Engasgo, engulo, reflito e estendo a mão
E assim nova vida é um rio secando

As pedras cortando e eu vou perguntando
""Até quando?""
Sì o tantas coisinhas miúdas
Roendo, comendo, arrasando
Aos poucos com o nosso ideal
Sì o frases perdidas num mundo
De gritos e gestos

Num jogo de culpa que faz tanto mal
Não quero a razão pois eu sei o quanto estou errado
E o quanto já fiz destruir
Só sinto no are o momento em que o copo está cheio
E que já não dá mais pra engolir
Veja bem,

Nosso caso é uma porta entreaberta
E eu busquei a palavra mais certa
Vê se entende o meu grito de alerta

Veja bem,
É o amor agitando o meu coração
Há um lado carente dizendo que sim
E essa vida da gente gritando que não",Grito de Alerta,2002
Gonzaguinha,"Chega de tentar
Dissimular
E disfarçar
E esconder

O que não dá mais pra ocultar
E eu não quero mais calar
Já que o brilho desse olhar

Foi traidor e entregou
O que você tentou conter
O que você não quis desabafar
Chega de temor

Chorar
Sofrer
Sorrir
Se dar

E se perder
E se achar
E tudo aquilo que é viver
Eu quero é mais me abrir
E que está vida entre

Assim como se fosse o sol
Desvirginando a madrugada
Quero sentir a dor
Dessa manhã

Nascendo
Rompendo
Tomando
Rasgando meu corpo
E então eu

Chorando
Sofrendo
Sorrindo
Adorando

Gritando feito louca alucinada
E criança
Eu quero meu amo

Se derramando
Não dá mais pra segurar
Explode coração

",Não Dá Mais Pra Segurar (Explode Coração),2002
Gonzaguinha,"Por acaso algum dia você se importou
Em saber se ela tinha vontade ou não
E se tinha e transou,você tem a certeza
de que foi uma coisa maior para dois
Você leu em seu rosto o gosto,o fogo,o gozo da
festa
E deixou que ela visse em você
Toda a dor do infinito pra zer
E se ela deseja e você não deseja
Você nega,alega cansaço ou vira de lado 
Ou se deixa levar na rotina
tal qual um menino tão só no antigo banheiro
folheando as revistas,comendo a s figuras
as cores das fotos te dando a completa emoção
são pe rguntas tão tolas de uma pessoa
Não ligue,não ouça são pontos de interrogação
E depois desses anos no escuro do quarto
quem te diz que não é só o vicio da obrigação
pois com a outra você faz de tudo
lembrando daquela tão santa
que é dona do teu coração 
Eu preciso é ter consciência
do que eu represento nesse exato momento
no exato instante na cama,na lama,na grama",Ponto de Interrogação,2002

Que o vento da madrugada já me leva pra você
E antes de acontecer, o sol a barra vir quebrar
Estarei nos teus braços para nunca mais voar

E nas noites de frio serei o teu cobertor
´Quentarei o teu corpo com meu calor
Ah, minha santa, te juro, por Deus Nosso Senhor
Nunca mais minha morena vou fugir do teu amor

Se preciso fosse, meu amor
A chama em meu peito

Me machucando o coração
Na sêde de sentir
Seu corpo inteiro
Coladinho ao meu

E que esta mulher é uma menina
Que colheu seu fruto, flor do seu caminho

Eu apenas queria dizer
A todo mundo que me gosta
Que, hoje, eu me gosto muito mais
Porque me entendo muito mais também

E que a atitude de recomeçar

Tudo que você ouvir, esteja certa que estarei vivendo

E se eu chorar e o sol molhar o meu sorriso

I'm socialist lingerie

I'm gay pastry and racist cappuccino

My position is missionary, I finish on top
And while you're relaxin', I take action
Guinness world record, I beat it, Michael Jackson

Never stop, I workaholic
Like spit sweat splatter Jackson Pollock
But I'm not an artist, I just work the hardest
I beat it to a pulp, just ask Jarvis

Studio to studio, I drink juice,
Produce tons of new shit, like a booty hole
Show to show, full throttle, backstage,
No models, no bathroom, I piss in a bottle

And after the show a lot of autographs,
Man, music is a joke I try not to laugh
I just try to enjoy the grind
My position is doggy, I come from behind

Underground, underdog, underrated
Under stress, under pressure, under-appreciated
Man, this is war
Where careers get killed and that's not a metaphor, like

My mindset is military, like
My attitude is Hitchcock, very scary
Persistence, instincts,
Go the distance, prove my existence

That's why I never stop
'cause it's not Chilly, it's Lily, who makes really clever pop
I just do it in a different way
I'm kind of sort of indirect ricochet,

Chilly like Pinochet, I don't make hits, I take risks
And make flops like floppy disks
I still stay professional and not sloppy
I try to be original, not a photocopy

My position? Don't fuck with me - celibate
Groupie go home, you can find another guy
Man, music is a joke, I try not to cry

Sounds crazy, but the underground's lazy
Maybe just a bunch of big babies
And they're crying 'til they're on the guestlist,
Then they puke at 6 am - English breakfast

See I always hatch a new scheme
No room for the club or a pub in my routine
I don't judge you if you're part of a true scene
But me? I could be anywhere - blue screen

At the Grammys getting nominated
Or trying to be a piano playing Larry David
Flirting with rap, workin' for Birkin
Behind your favorite singer I just might be lurkin'

And I'm certain when they close the curtains
My life will be a B-movie shot by Tim Burton
And if I lack authenticity
Remember authenticity is often shitty

So please, no pity,
You can never melt this ice-cold heart between my two titties
'cause what's life but a board game?
And if you play the game then you're never bored with more of the same

Gonzalez,"Yo adivino el parpadeo
de las luces que a lo lejos
van marcando mi retorno.

Son las mismas que alumbraron
con sus palidos reflejos
hondas horas de dolor.

Y aunque no quise el regreso
siempre se vuelve
al primer amor.

La vieja calle
donde me cobijo
tuya es su vida
tuyo es su querer.

Bajo el burlon
mirar de las estrellas
que con indiferencia
hoy me ven volver.

Volver
con la frente marchita
las nieves del tiempo
platearon mi sien.

Sentir
que es un soplo la vida
que veinte anos no es nada
que febril la mirada
errante en las sombras
te busca y te nombra.

Vivir
con el alma aferrada
a un dulce recuerdo
que lloro otra vez.

Tengo miedo del encuentro
con el pasado que vuelve
a enfrentarse con mi vida.

Tengo miedo de las noches
que pobladas de recuerdos
encadenen mi sonar.

Pero el viajero que huye
tarde o temprano
detiene su andar.

Y aunque el olvido
que todo destruye
haya matado mi vieja ilusion,

guardo escondida
una esperanza humilde
que es toda la fortuna
de mi corazon.

Volver
con la frente marchita
las nieves del tiempo
platearon mi sien.

Gonzalez,"How could I ever stop?
My position is missionary, I finish on top
And while you're relaxin', I take action
Guinness world record, I beat it, Michael Jackson

Never stop, I workaholic
Like spit sweat splatter Jackson Pollock
But I'm not an artist, I just work the hardest
I beat it to a pulp, just ask Jarvis

Studio to studio, I drink juice,
Produce tons of new shit, like a booty hole
Show to show, full throttle, backstage,
No models, no bathroom, I piss in a bottle

And after the show a lot of autographs,
Man, music is a joke I try not to laugh
I just try to enjoy the grind
My position is doggy, I come from behind

Underground, underdog, underrated
Under stress, under pressure, under-appreciated
Man, this is war
Where careers get killed and that's not a metaphor, like

My mindset is military, like
My attitude is Hitchcock, very scary
Persistence, instincts,
Go the distance, prove my existence

That's why I never stop
'cause it's not Chilly, it's Lily, who makes really clever pop
I just do it in a different way
I'm kind of sort of indirect ricochet,

Chilly like Pinochet, I don't make hits, I take risks
And make flops like floppy disks
I still stay professional and not sloppy
I try to be original, not a photocopy

Can't stop, won't stop
Harder, faster better stronger, I listen to the robots
I'm still doing things, so don't cue the strings,
It ain't over 'til Beth Ditto sings

So how could I ever quit
My position? Don't fuck with me - celibate
Groupie go home, you can find another guy
Man, music is a joke, I try not to cry

Sounds crazy, but the underground's lazy
Maybe just a bunch of big babies
And they're crying 'til they're on the guestlist,
Then they puke at 6 am - English breakfast

See I always hatch a new scheme
No room for the club or a pub in my routine
I don't judge you if you're part of a true scene
But me? I could be anywhere - blue screen

At the Grammys getting nominated
Or trying to be a piano playing Larry David
Flirting with rap, workin' for Birkin
Behind your favorite singer I just might be lurkin'

And I'm certain when they close the curtains
My life will be a B-movie shot by Tim Burton
And if I lack authenticity
Remember authenticity is often shitty

So please, no pity,
You can never melt this ice-cold heart between my two titties
'cause what's life but a board game?
And if you play the game then you're never bored with more of the same

What's life but a competition
You know my name, I am bitten
I never stop

"Gonzálo ""El Cocha"" Molina","Ese muchacho que yo quiero tanto 
Ese que yo regaño a cada rato 
Me hizo acordar ayer 
Que así era yo también cuando muchacho 
Que sólo me aquietaban dos pengazos 
Del viejo Rafael 

Y se parece tanto a papá 
Hombre del alma buena 
Y se parece tanto a papá 
Hombre del alma buena 

Se ponía triste al verme llorar 
Y me daba un pedazo de panela 
Y entraba en discusión con mi vieja 
Por que la pobre le reclamaba 
Que porque diablos me maltrataba 
Que dejara al muchacho tranquilo 

Y hoy veo en Rafael Santos mi hijo 
Todavía las costumbres aquellas 
Y hoy veo en Rafael Santos mi hijo 
Todavía las costumbres aquellas 

Recuerdo la cartilla abecedario 
El primer día que al pueblo me mandaron 
Porque era día de fiesta 
Recuerdo que iba tan entusiasmado 
Por que desde que me habían bautizado 
No llegaba a la iglesia 

El 16 de julio es la fiesta 
De la virgen del carmen 
El 16 de julio es la fiesta 
De la virgen del carmen 

Ese fue el día que le escuche al padre 
Que dios a todos nos tiene en cuenta 
Y con deseos también de quedarme 
Pa' allá en la nocha de la caseta 
Y me tocó quedarme en la puerta 
No tenia plata para pagarles 
Por eso es que la vida es un baile 
Que con el tiempo damos la vuelta 
Pero el tiempo acaba la fiesta 
Y me voy solito pa'l valle 

Yo aprendí a trabajar desde pela'o 
Por eso es que yo estoy acostumbrado 
Siempre a vivir con plata 
Y con toda la plata que he ganado 
Cuántos problemas no he solucionado 
Pero nunca me alcanza 

Pa' pagarle a mi viejo la crianza 
Que me dio con esmero 
Pa' pagarle a mi viejo la crianza 
Que me dio con esmero 

Porque en la vida hay cosas del alma 
Que valen mucho más que el dinero
Porque en la vida hay cosas del alma 
Que valen mucho más que el dinero 

Por eso Rafael Santos yo quiero 
Dejarte dicho en esta canción 
Que si te inspira ser zapatero 
Sólo quiero que seas el mejor 
Por que de nada sirve el doctor 
Si es el ejemplo malo del pueblo 

Y el ejemplo mío es mi viejo 
Y el ejemplo tuyo, yo soy
Y el ejemplo mío es mi viejo 
Y el ejemplo tuyo, yo soy
Y el ejemplo mío es mi viejo 
Y el ejemplo tuyo, yo soy
Y el ejemplo mío es mi viejo 
Y el ejemplo tuyo, yo soy
Y el ejemplo tuyo, yo soy",Mi Muchacho,2007
Gonzalo Aloras,"Hoy me dejaste, no puedo ni hablar
Hoy decidí que debía aceptarlo
Hoy vi tus ojos en la oscuridad
Hoy fui tu adiós en la cama
Ya no hay mas que hablar

Mientras cae el sol
Mientras pienso en vos

Hoy me tomé algunos tragos y pensé
Cómo sería mi vida, que insensatez
Hoy me enamoro de tu libertad
Y ya no te tengo, que estúpido, y más allá

Siempre sale el sol
Siempre pienso en vos

Y si alrededor, te abraza el amor

Y hoy aquí espero a que te dejes llevar

Gonzalo Rubalcaba,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day

Gonzalo Rubalcaba,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble

Gonzalo Rubalcaba,"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine,1992
Gonzalo Rubalcaba,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

Funny, but here's that rainy day

Triste estoy y me doy cuenta
Que sin ti, no hay ilusión, ni amor

Veo el mar de inmensas olas
Veo un sinfín, lleno de estrellas
Que sin ti, pierden su intensidad

Falta tú, a cada instante
En la luz, del sol brillante
Yo sin ti, no volveré a sonreír

Or run away from me

Now there only pictures in my head
That's why my green is feeling grey
Sometimes even frogs have rainy days

Remember when the stage caved in
While you were rocking out
Who'd of thought your smorkus board
Would be hard to live without

If we could do it all again
Just another chance to entertain
Would anybody watch or even care
Or did something break we cant repair

Your canon ball tragetory
It always gave me hope
They may have been unbearable but
I still loved your jokes

And my dick get bigger and bigger...

Watch y'all eat clits
Relax roll the rest of my sacks
Ease rooms, get back in the mix

 Here how it goes
 You and me
 Up and down but maybe this time
 Well get it right
 Worth the fight
 'Cause love is something you can't shake
 When it breaks
 All it takes is some trying
 
 [Chorus:]
 If you feel like leaving
 I'm not gonna beg you to stay
 Soon you'll be finding
 You can run you can hide but you can escape my love.
 So if you go
 You should know
 It hard to just forget the past
 So fast
 It was good
 It was bad but it was real and that
 All you have
 In the end our love mattered

 If you feel like leaving

Ice up
Smash out
Hitting no fear
On the same spot I cracked up
My first 5 dollars
Same steez-aline, now wit out the popping collars
Everything bubbled out
Dash board, pull it out
Girls in the backseat running they mouth
Switch up, shut up
Kiss my boo before she nut up
Spitting it all juss trying to get some cut up
Floating
Somebody rolling a blunt
Somebody choking
Somebody pass the blunt
Constantly smoking
The life, of a young tycoon
Roll up green
Pop X and lace 'em
An this life I lead I ain't set
If I ain't got a whip wit a grip or the woman I slip.
Come on.

(Come on, come on)

Uh.

Afros, corn rows
Mouth full of golds
Young hustla hopping outta Range Rove's
Fully equipped wit TV's and videos
Playing Jet Motto
Sip X-O
A ghetto superstara
Living life like there's no tomorrow
Hit the spot in Godfather convertible ?
Smoking gonja
From January 1st to Kwanza
Up in the Bahammas
Racing jet skis screaming ""Cowabunga!""
Top of the world
Yup me and my partners
Smoke-A-Lot, Regime
20 a casa
Skidding through the islands
Be the first to bust
Grab on my nuts
Scream in cuts
Then I smoke the famous weed wit Dutch
Wit no crutch
My Lex got stick shift wit no clutch
Push a button on the back of the steering wheel and skee-skirt like Starsky 
And Hutch
Young Ritzy and Yuk
Quickly bust they enemies
Get cheese like Vito Genevies
Nigga please
The new era Regime
Make 'em bow down kiss they ring
Do they thing
From here to Beijing
Stop hating
The shot calla
That pop collars
Before I get yo ass wit the Rotwilers.

Who searching for a stiff who want to follow
And I voulen-teer
Wrap yo lips around my stuff like a bottle
Here
I shake it, and take it
And take it
You suckers can't make it
Cover it wit hatred
Capitol punishment
Make you taste it
Break down the mind of a Manson
Cause they basic, no care
To my right hand
Swear to bear arms
Bust for my loved ones
An trust none
Got money an funds
I call upon an worship
More evil than good, I fully work it
Shots in ?
The world go perfect wit dollar bills
My wounds can't heal fool
My world too real for dollar bills.

Here, we go

It's a new day
But it all feels old
It's a good life
That's what I'm told
But every day, it all just feels the same

And my high school
It felt more to me
Like a jail cell
A penitentiary
My time spent there it only made me see

That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna hear the words you say

And I don't ever wanna
I don't ever wanna be
You, don't wanna be just like you
What I'm sayin' is, this is the anthem
Throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

Go to college
A university
Get a real job
That's what they said to me
But I could never, live the way they want

I'm gonna get by
And just do my time
Out of step while
They all get in line
I'm just a minor threat so pay no mind

Do you really wanna to be like them?
Do you really wanna be another trend?
Do you wanna be part of that crowd?

'Cause I don't ever wanna
I don't ever wanna be, you
Don't wanna be just like you
What I'm saying is, this is the anthem
Throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

Shake it once that's fine
Shake it twice that's okay
Shake it three times
Your playin' with your self again

(You, don't wanna be just like you)
What I'm saying is, this is the anthem
Throw all your hands up
Now you can feel me
Sing if you're with me
You, don't wanna be just like you
(Just like you)

This is the anthem
Throw all your hands up
Now you can feel me
Sing if you're with me

Another loser anthem

Another loser anthem

Good Charlotte,"Hard days made me, hard nights shaped me
I don't know they somehow saved me
And I know I'm making something out of this life they called nothing
I take what I want
Take what I need
You say it's wrong but it's right for me
I won't look down
Won't say I'm sorry
I know that only God can judge me

And if I make it through today will tomorrow be the same
Am I just running in place?
If I stubble and I fall
Should I get up and carry on or will it all just be the same

'Cause, I'm young and hopeless
I'm lost and I know this
I'm going nowhere fast that's what they say
I'm troublesome, I've fallen
I'm angry at my father
It's me against this world and I don't care, I don't care

No one in this industry understands the life I lead
When I sing about my past it's not a gimmick not an act
These critics and these trust fund kids
Try to tell me what punk is but when I see them on the streets
they got nothing to say

And if I make it through today will tomorrow be the same
Am I just running in place?
If I stubble and I fall
Should I get up and carry on or will it all just be the same

'Cause, I'm young and hopeless
I'm lost and I know this
I'm going nowhere fast that's what they say

Let me go
All hopeless fantasies are making fools of me
Let me go
I walk alone and yet I never say goodbye
Let me go
A change of heart a change of mind and heaven fell that night
Let me go 

I tried but could not bring
The best of everything
Too breathless then to wonder
I died a thousand times
Found guilty of no crime
Now everything is thunder

Nighttime I don't need the

Nighttime I don't need the

The hope of it survives
The facts of life unspoken
The only game in town

They were the best years of our lives
I'll turn the last card down",Let Me Go,2000

To every kid who never had a date to no school dance (2000 eternal)
This is for you
To everyone who's ever been called a freak (come with meeeee)
Here we, here we go
What? (y'all know what I'm talking about, y'all know what I'm saying)

Like the time in school when we got free lunch and the cool kids beat us up (reduced lunch!)
And the rich kids had convertibles and we had to ride the bus (fifty-five)
Like the time we made the baseball team, but they still laughed at us (we still suck)
Like the time that girl broke up with me cause I wasn't cool enough
Trick!

Things...
The little things they always hang around
The little things they try to break me down
The little things they just won't go away
The little things made me who I am today
You want to hate me know
But I won't stop know, cause I can't stop now

What? Come on. Ungh.
Here we go

Like the time mom went to that institute cause she was breaking down (I just can't take it!)
Like the car we had that wouldn't start, we had to walk to get around (Can I get a ride?)
And that same year on Christmas Eve, Dad went to the store (uh, I'll see you guys later)
We checked his room, his things were gone
We didn't see him no more
Dick!

Staring at the sea, things become so small,

And I remember when you said ""everything's gonna be alright""

You made me feel right at home,
You told me I was not alone and you knew just how I feel,

I woke up knowing
Today is the day I will die
Cash Dogg was barking
Went to the park
And enjoyed it one last time
I called my mother
Told her I loved her
And I begged her not to cry
I wrote a letter
I said I'd miss her
And I signed that good bye

You know the happiest day of my life
I swear the happiest day of my life
Is the day that I die

Can you feel the cold tonight? (the day that I died)
It sets in, but it's alright (the day that I died)
Darkness falls, I'm letting go (the day that I died)
All alone, but I feel fine (the day that I died)

We drove through DC
To see the places we lived
Long conversations
We talked of old friends
And all the things that we did
Summer nights
Drunken fights
Mistakes we made
Did we live it right?

You know the happiest day of my life
I swear the happiest day of my life
Is the day that I died

Can you feel the cold tonight? (the day that I died)
It sets in, but it's alright (the day that I died)
Darkness falls, I'm letting go (the day that I died)
All alone but I feel just fine

Do you miss your little girl?
When you lay your head down
How do you sleep at night?
Do you even wonder if we're all right?

Why weren't you there all the nights that we cried
You broke my mother's heart
You broke your children for life

But we're alright

But those were just a long lost memory of mine
I spent so many years learning how to survive
Now, I'm writing just to let you know that I'm still alive

Were full of hate
I was so angry

There's things I'll take, to my grave

Did I meet you in the crowd at one of our shows?
Did I see you in the faces that all come and go?
Did I ever take the time to just say thanks?

Was I too caught up in my life to ask you your name?
The truth about this life is that we're all in it together
That's what you said to me in all your pictures and your letters
Somehow I believe that you have made me better
In my heart I know you're gonna live forever

Life was simple,
Roger was working round the clock to make a living,
No computers, none of that, he used his two hands,
Ignored the cold
Wore, his word to keep him warm,

On the weekends,
He'd load the car up with the kids and they'd go fishing,
No need to work an extra job, there's no recession,
Damn right he smiled a lot
They lay awake at night
So in love

It was a good good year
The kids were alright,
""Highway to Hell"" beat up ""Stayin' Alive"",
The Clash was on the radio
And mum and dad were still in love,
In 1979
It was a good, good year.

In the morning,
Robin always woke up early in the kitchen,
She'd make the coffee, pack his lunch and then she'd kiss him
And he would hold her tight
When they were newlyweds

He'd say maybe
And she would laugh, they knew they'd have another baby
She'd slave away all day until dinner was ready,
And they would dance so slow to ""Just the Way You Are"".

It was a good, good year
The kids were all right,
""Highway to Hell"" beat up ""Stayin' Alive"",
The Clash was on the radio
And mum and dad were still in love,
In 1979
It was a good, good year.

All the decades and the years have passed,
Not every family is built to last,
No time can take away these memories
Remember when you said to me
That we'd be all right.

""Highway to Hell"" beat up ""Stayin' Alive"",

And mum and dad were still in love,

I've got to admit, this feeling's legit
I don't wanna stop and she don't want me to quit
But she gets a little nervous for what we do,
Scare what they would say,
What they would talk about if they knew

Heard her sing a song and I knew that she would write about it
Saw her in a magazine, I knew that she could keep it quite
Keep it in the sheets, the radio the beats
Between you and me, we'll throw away the key

She's sounds to me
She's sounds like sex on the radio
I love to hear her scream
And when I push play she's screaming in stereo

You're gonna grow up fast underneath these lights
Down in Hollywood on the boulevard

Out on the streets a hot summer's day,
The kids getting hungry as they frolic and play,
Then comes the ringing sound it signals the plan,
They quickly surrounded the evil white van,
Eleven years old, but they didn't flinch,
Their watergun barrels did not move an inch,
The driver was guilty, but he had no clue,
Raised in a system he'd never thought through,
And the kids - TOGETHER,
They fought as one and they beat the man,
And the kids - TOGETHER,
They sowed us all how to make a stand,
From that day on, the dairy was gone,
He tried to fix what he had done wrong,
""GOOD BYE GOOD HUMOR, cruelty's not nice"",
He said as he sold treats made from soy beans and rice,
'cause it's never too late to see the light,
To change your ways and do what is right,
The war wasn't over but the battle was won,
And now the neighborhood could have GOOD CLEAN FUN,

And now you know it's true,
If little kids can change the world,
Just think what we could do.

One more buck and the law comes out and they all want to know about why I’m rich
I’m not rich I’m just on the way back to the land where they need this grip
You give yours to a charity fund, I give mine to a cuz that’s sick
You see your name and it fourth on the list, scared I’m involved in the causing of pain
Lost somebody you loved in the towers and looking at me like I boarded the plane
I’m just an artist you’re not a target no use in arguing we all look the same
With that knowledge I stay calm when they search for bombs all they find is green
All in the name - I got a name that’ll scare all the brave in the land of the free
All in the name of protecting a country that’s shooting its citizens dead in the streets
I used to live in Northeast D.C. not too far from Capitol Hill
White House here, trap house there, they were so near you could go by feet
Never mind that cause that’s not news - let’s stay glued to the war on peace
Who gets blamed? Whoever can sway that election towards what the order seeks
We just want to keep oil cheap, we just want to keep motors full
What that mean? Distractions came, I think my TV’s clothed in wool

Man I swear they have my phoned tapped
Man I swear they watching all my moves
Since 9/11 it ain’t too clear just who the target is

I met a boy who arrived in the rain, he lost his folks when they torched his home
That made me want to bring my fam before they see that side of a drone

I got a cuz that’ll drive your taxi, I got a cuz that’ll make your food
I got a cuz that’ll watch your kids and pick them up when they’re done with school
I got a cuz that’ll pump your gas, I got a cuz that’s good with tools
I got a cuz that’ll be your doctor after a test that I hope he’ll pass
Isn’t that what you fear most? But fear don’t trump your needs
Our pros do trump our cons though. And cons don’t trump your greed
And monsters’ what you make of us and we make you succeed
And that’s what makes this country great, it’s built by those who bleed
It’s built by those who came on boats, it’s built by those who flee
And you forgot your family tree and we’re just all your leaves
So if you just try to chop us down you only hurt your knees

Until your vote is counted know I got you until I'm outy
It's all about the effort and I'm effortlessly fresher
If I'm preaching to choir know they're bound to get the lecture
It went from folks around me, pushing envelopes and boundaries
So you won't only hear me where you found me
I'm somewhere asking questions like ""Can I be afforded the most?""
You better answer me with more than a no
Tryin' tell ya

Ooh, never not getting enough
From this life that I'm leading and all I believe in y'all know, I ain't leaving I'm posted, like

DC, Maryland and Virginia know I'm with you

Now whatchu willing to let die first
Your pride or your freedom
The story of my life's inner conflict
It's like I follow my dreams
But how am I supposed to slide in the DM
On this mic, is what I'm trying accomplish
I used to do it for the fist bumps and applauses
But caring about respect started making me nauseous
You walk into a room, and bammas speak to you cautious
Like employees trying to figure out who the boss is
So now I just kick it for, the most divine
Working overtime
Sitting with an open bottle, looking for an open mind
Trying not to be aggressively jaded
Because I find myself just getting faded
And I know that ain’t quite me
I step up for whatever it might be
And RSVP when inspiration invite me
Because who else gonna look out for those who look like me 
Another disenfranchised boy in a white tee

All I know is love
I give it how I get it, I can never get enough
Sympathy to enemies 'cause hate ain't in blood
And if you can relate you've given up
I'm trying to make the most of it though
Getting close is a no
Want nothing less than yes 'cause it's suppose to be so
The cost of nothing too low
My expectation too high
I'd rather die
Than be complacent with the way that it goes
Apathy is a disease and we're just steady sharing needles
Unaffected people carry evil
Ease is what we know
We've got to raise the bar though
The sorrows of today will give away to a tomorrow
So what's a week of paid leave
And empty promises of hiring
Just to fire me before retirement
I'm trying to make more in one day than 401K
So give me what you promised to pay
Because it's never enough

Where we'd fought every endeavor we could fight

And every god fearing son was a patriot
And victory remained elusive

Oh yeah one bomb away

and they say that customs will reconcile people
To any atrocity - (George Bernard Shaw)
From dachau to belfast to baghdad
From sea to shining sea

and they say that when fascism crosses our borders
It'll be wrapped up in a shroud
Glowing red, white, and blue
And our rectors they say will explain it away
As the ravings of a passionate few

well I happened to visit a slaughterhouse
Where cessation's redolence rose to the sky
And propitious creatures await a most virulent fate
Which their pacific demeanor belies
It was a place I don't care to return to
Whose chambers compassion would not recognize
Where slaughter is sanctification
And humanity covers it's eyes

covers it's eyes

Sweet land of liberty
Of thee I sing of thee I sing

All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek.

It always ended up in a big row
When my sister used to get home late.

Out of my window I can see them in the moonlight,
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate.

The day they knocked down the palais
My sister stood and cried.
The day they knocked down the palais
Part of my childhood died, just died.

Now I'm grown up and playing in a band,
And there's a car park where the palais used to stand.
My sister's married and she lives on an estate.
Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait.
She knows they get away with things she never could,
But if I asked her I wonder if she would,

Come dancing,
Come on sister, have yourself a ball.
Don't be afraid to come dancing,
It's only natural.

Come dancing,
Just like the palais on a Saturday.
And all her friends will come dancing
Where the big bands used to play.",Come Dancing,1996
Good Riddance,"I never knew how good I had it
I had to treat you like a habit
It became what I'd guess you call a slight obsession
Now I've had some time to work it out
Way too much time to be without
The one I've wanted
You're my right direction

When you're back there
Do you think of me
When you're alone
Before you sleep
You are the one
I'm waiting for
This time's not like before
I'm going to carry you away

Thinking good things now
I know we'll work it out somehow
I try to keep my chin up but it's so hard to let you go
It never hurt before to be alone
Now your voice is salvation on the phone
I only wish you weren't so far away",Think of Me,1996
Good Riddance,"And what about the times you did your best
To assuage my troubled soul
What happened to me
What happened to you
What was it that you said would see us through
I want to know how to feel something real
And I will try no more to run
All this pressure getting closer
And it seems like I've been here before

Time on my hands
Weight of the world
Laid bare my soul
As I lose control

Run away
You can retrace those steps and find your way once more
I'll wait

Take my hand
I'll be a friend for you this weight you bare alone
One day
The light I know will illuminate your heart",Weight of the World,1996

To die for an ideal

Between a lie and what is real

And I'm never going back
No, no, no
I'm never going back

Who's that shining forth-right man
About to die behind me
He's waiting for the portress to send me head over heels
Who's that black-heart four-star General walking up the hill
To ask the liberals nicely
To help finance his private war

And if I didn't trust that man
When he puts the rifle in your hand
Sings you songs of pageantry and grace
And how much you want to bet on the other side
There's a man with twice your pride
And they put you feet first in an unmarked grave

There was a time in our history
When we justified by saying
Our destinies manifest
Now imperialism is the mantra of the west

See that trigger happy
College boys, love a chance
To try out their new toys
Then they wash the city streets
Clean, with the blood of infidels

And if I didn't trust that man
When he puts the rifle in your hand
Sings you songs of pageantry and grace
And how much you want to bet on the other side
There's a man with twice your pride
And they put you feet first in an unmarked grave

As the fabric of democracy
Left tattered in the dust
We could put another greedy man into the 
Dictatorial 
Puppet-show, now tell me 
Who do you trust
Who do you trust

And an abominable hemisphere
Would perpetuate a heart-whole atmosphere
Call it a threat
To national security
Call it just a poor-sick face
One more place to export cheap labor

Hail the oligarchy
A potential for anarchy
And we pat ourselves firmly on the back",Mother Superior,1996

Alone by the side of the road

And the darkness drifts away
I'm at peace, if only once in a while

You don't understand
There's nothing to say
When everything seems lost
You can bet we'll somehow find a way

Well, I'm feeling hurt
And I fought back some tears of my own
But there's something to be said for the ones
Who face the darkness alone
You're too cool to care
Too self-righteous to see and believe
It's a bond we'll never break
A chance for one more change of heart

You don't understand
There's nothing to say
When everything seems lost
You can bet we'll somehow find a way

Did your ever think about the ones on top

We all bring to bear
Your strength works miracles
And touches those who try to care

I believe in you
And I hope you see it through
Your resolve is inspiration in my life
It takes a lot now

So few who feel the same
When it means enough
Not to give it away now
Finding it hard

Not to think in terms of yesterday
Finding it strange
That somebody else could feel that way

With him Saturday night and she just can't wait

I woudn't wish him on anyone
I said to her when you're with him better watch your step
Because I know this boy he's got a pretty bad rep
I only hope he doesn t end up bringing you down
He's been breaking hearts all over town
Slowly you can pick yourself back up
When that situation's got you down again
Slowly you can pick your self back up
Girl you've got to save it for another day
Because you don't need him anyway
It's just a game they play
I know this won't come easy girl
I know that it's hard
And deep down inside it leaves an awful scar
And to say I told you so
Won't help to ease the pain inside you so
Just remember that there's plenty of boys out there
Who could treat you much better
And remember I care
It just won't do to see you hurting so bad
I knew that boy was going to leave you sad

Good Riddance,"Have we really lost our way
I heard the people talking but I can't believe
The things they say
Seems like a million days
Since we chose a new direction
Tried to find the strength to change
Do you remember when 500 stood as one
And reached for the sky
Our pride was understood
Friendship & brother (sister) hood
Gave us the courage to try
Sometimes it's such a lonely road
Despair is everywhere
So much anger to unload
But I'll fight with every breath
In my heart I still believe
We can make a difference somehow

Who will hear their cries
The ones who cannot speak
As we dehumanize
Incarcerated innocents
Their sentience ignored
Slaughtered by the millions
For the pseudo-carnivores
What a waste of our time
Of our land of our humanity
Blood-spattered carcass it wets your appetite
Don't you fucking get it
Eating flesh it isn't right for you
For me our children the world
Destroy their machines
Burn their staughterhouses to the ground
Now it's time for us all to defend
The oppressed
Meat is murder
Still we consume the dead and rotting
Products of violence
We've got to make that change
For you for me our children the world

Shake the dust out of your shoes

And all my demonstrations too

Are the people here for fun
Or maybe looking for a fight

You can't come in if you don't look right
Doesn't the music make it right
It seems fashion keeps the youth confined
We have missed the whole idea
I thought we listened with our ears
But we keep them closed with fear

Will keep the cults at war
It's just music why such hate
There's nothing to be solved at all

I don't want to be alone tonight
I need you here to make it alright.
And every morning I need another taste
Please don't leave my love to waste.

Goodfellaz,"Yeah son, I know you can hear me man
Shit been crazy in the hood since that happen, hu
But I found out the cat that did that, word to minds
I'mma see him in a minute son, hu, it's on

I know the clubs where you rock at, the spots you cop at
Keep frontin' nigga, showin' ya Roley, getcha watch snatched
Watch that, know where your moms shop at
Gotcha block mapped and ain't afraid to push ya top back
Fuck if you stay straped, got the drop it's hard to spray back
That's what you get when you borrow shit, and never pay back
So nigga say that, frontin' like you can't lay flat
You a rat, plus you started this beef from way back
Cats you sip wit, even feel you on some flipped shit
Thought I was twisted, beat that, been home since Christmas
Got the word where your bird live, out in L.I
From this next bitched named Trista sell lye in Bed Stuy
So nigga what now? Got the whole game fucked now
Who you trust now? See you tinted up your truck now
No need to back track, next time know who you blast at
For gettin' black clapped, got your cousin killed and nap napped
Now the streets know, nuttin' left for us to keep low
Never sleep though, on point don't make a nigga reach low
Up in Brookdale, heard my little man took 12
Jagged hook shells, doctors claim it don't look well
Left his mom stressed, now it's time to bomb the projects
Teflon vest, four pounds could make your palm sweat
Put the word out, so vexed I even curse your bird out
She don't deserve clout, flippin' wit the cotton herb mouth
On Pottemscott, me and Wop, nickel gats cocked
The way we popped up, so shocked, niggas made our backs rock
Broad daylight, y'all hustle fake, and don't play right
Holdin' shit wit broken clips that spit, but don't spray right
Clothes, cars & ice, hard to remember starvin' nights
Niggas startin' fights, narcs in the dark, coke cloggin' pipes
Starvin wifes, used to buy weight at bargain price
Now we scarred for life, clog is desolvin', slowly outta sight
All illin', navigatin' four wheelin'
Alcohol spillin', marinatin' on your killin'
Like a contest losers fall, winner takes all
Judges make calls, kings stand behind the 8 ball (8 ball)

I know the clubs where you rock at, the spots where you cop at (yeah)
Keep frontin' nigga, showin' ya Roley, getcha watch snatched
(Get it snatched)
Watch that, know where your moms shop at
Gotcha block mapped and ain't afraid to push ya to back (uh huh)

I know the mood is right, I don't wanna be alone tonight
Come on lets dip shawty, dip
Lets dip shawty, dip
Lets dip shawty, dip
Lets dip shawty

Can I get a chance, grown man from afar superstar status
Holdin' on to the apparatus firmly
West shake show love heat 'em up in the club if you don't care
Conversations short, too many Newports blowing me away
To another broad, I mean cutie, with the nice round booty
Cut to the spot where all the girls wanna do me
On the low, nice and slow
T-mo on the floor, out the door lets go
Keep it on the hush, don't wanna rush when your ready
We can touch some G's, and blow trees in the wind
With a zip, I'm there, telling tales, out on bail
SWAT's tales of rolling boulders and breaking shoulders
Taking me closer to a poacher with that roll line
Shawty cause I'm down for mine

You know how good it can be, if I took you home with me
I know the mood is right, I don't wanna be alone tonight
Come on lets dip shawty, dip
Lets dip shawty, dip
Lets dip shawty, dip
Lets dip shawty

We at the club 112 on the front row
Shawty done shot the Cuervo
Even though she dancing with another niggeroe
Somewhere out on the floor
She told me Lo snap your finger when your ready to go
So you know I feel great, I can hardly wait
Hit the Waffle House and get a chicken-melt plate
Scrambled Eggs with cheese, and a pile of grease
And get full as a tick bout' ready to drip
And oh for trilly shawty don't be silly
Calm your nerves cause I'm back on that Philly
Cheifed like a champ, and everything is good
I got to much class, and I'll take you to school
I wanna act a fool, but I'm waiting patiently
It ain't good if it ain't been mentioned with me
And if your number fuck around and get hard to find
All I really wanna be is a thought in your mind

You know how good it can be, if I took you home with me
I know the mood is right, I don't wanna be alone tonight
Come on lets dip shawty, dip
Lets dip shawty, dip
Lets dip shawty, dip
Lets dip shawty

(Big Gipp)
Can I take you home
You grown, sip a tea, nice feet
Eyes fly too, saw you when you came through
By yourself girl, no crew
Can I hold you, can I show you
Everything in life, that I've been through
We can roll in the hills in my big wheel
98 Lank Lank with the Stank Stank
These lights, this night, my dream, your screams
Silk sheets, we meet, what you need a ride, I got Fleet's
Leather seats with the woodgrain head back
When I drop it like that, baby don't act
How many times do I say that I want your love
Lets dip this club

You know how good it can be, if I took you home with me
I know the mood is right, I don't wanna be alone tonight
Come on lets dip shawty, dip
Lets dip shawty, dip
Lets dip shawty, dip
Lets dip shawty

God led me to The Shark Bar
On a Wednesday, with the dreads
White derby, looking delicious, good enough to eat
And what do I see, staring at me
A nice pair of eyes, coke bottle figure, wig, done to a T
Dressed in gangsta black, ready to be attacked by a real mack
Playing hard to get it, so I dips upstairs
How long will it take for my earrings to withdrawl
You is such a cold and lonely heart, I'll make you warm again
But it was something different about you though
You didn't ask for no autograph or swarm
All you needed was a hug
We being snug like fingers in the glove
8th grade was the last time a nigga was in love

You know how good it can be, if I took you home with me
I know the mood is right, I don't wanna be alone tonight

But I stay cool,and observe them fool and let's just thank, and drank
And clear the way you think, actin out and about
That gat he pulled, that my partna sawed
And he worked quickly, was it worth it? He didn't deserve it

Well, my name is Sugar Low, and this is my trade
For years we been some players, what more can I say?
Saturday night at my dance, throw on a few clothes, uhh
Hit Atlanta live, and break a few rolls
Get some drinks, and stroll the halls, hold the walls
Just in case security can't control the brawls
I still roll the ball, but I done got a little too old
To get all sweaty dancin round wit y'alls

Young girls thirteen years old
Expose themselves to any Tom, Dick, and Hank
Got mo' stretch marks than these hoes
Hollin they got rank
See Sega ain't in this new world order 
Them experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
United Nations, overseas
They trained assassins to do search and seize
Ain't knocking or asking
Them coming for niggas like me
Po' white trash, like they
Tricks like her back in slavery
Concentration camps lace with gas pipes lines
Inferno's outdoors like they had back
When Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now, believe me
Later on in the future look it up
Where they say it?  Ain't no more Constitution
In the event of a race war
Places like operation heartbreak hotel
Moments tear until air tight vents seat off despair
Them say expect no mercy
Foot you should be my least worries got to deal with
Where my W-2's, 10-99's
Unmarked black helicopters swoop down
And try to put missiles in mines

Who's that peeking in my window, POW nobody now

Me and my family moved in our apartment complex
A gate with the serial code was put up next
The claim that this community is so drug free
But it don't look that way to me cause I can see
The young bloods hanging out at the store 24/7
Junkies looking got a hit of the blow it's powerful
Oh you know what else they tryin to do
Make a curfew especially for me and you the traces of the new world order
Time is getting shorter if we don't get prepared
People it's gone be a slaughter
My mind won't allow me to not be curious
My folk don't understand so they don't take it serious
 
But every now and then, I wonder
If the gate was put up to keep crime out or to keep our ass in

Who's that peeking in my window, POW nobody now

Listen up little niggas I'm talking to you
About what yo little ass need to be going through
I fall a victim too and I know I shouldn't smoke so much
But I do with the crew everybody on the average 'bout 4 or 5

Who am I to tell you to stop smokin
Now you're open to disease and colds
And ain't sixteen years old, this shit has got to stop
Let's take a walk through detox
I want outta this hold I'm in a cell under attack
Lock up folks they in the hood, got an eye on every move
I make open your face to info you ain't know
Cause it's kept low how the new world plan
Reeks the planet without the black man

So what's your angle, try to separate me from the blood
Is disrespect like coming in my home and not
Wiping your feet on the rug
The Citron Absolut has got me bucking no hang with no phony
Look out for the man with the mask and the white pony
On my back are bills staying off my toes always on my heels
Insane, plain, soldiers coming in the dark by plane
To enforce the new system by reign
Tag my skin with your computer chip
Run your hand over the scanner to buy you dish now
No more fishing for your fish
Kiss the days of the old days past ways gone
Mind blown, conception, protection

Good thangs come to those dat wait
Took a loss on church strait

Fo' mo enenmy to hide than behind religion
Done gee seen on I pray for you but I won't follow you to yo end

I know of a place not too far away
That maybe you and I can both go someday
But I gotta make sure cause I ain't tryin' to stay here
Don't y'all realize that the end is so near
But don't have fear cause you still got time
I hope you wanna come when I'm done with the rhyme
Let me explain so you won't claim you didn't know
And you can make sure that this is where you wanna go
It's all about preparing yourself for the return
And a trip to your soul is the only way you'll learn
But if you choose not to go that ain't my concern
I guess in hell you'll just have to burn
The devil tell lies and try to trick yo soul to receive it
They tell you that my Lord ain't coming' back and you believe it
Regardless if you listen to me
In the end we'll see

I'm so happy we made it

Talking 'bout all this blow traffic got to stop
So the big time players off John Freeman Way
Had to find themselves another back street to take
Cause back in the day we was outta control
We didn't understand, ""Naw nigga, that money ain't' yours""

Them better leave me alone, I'm in my zone
Prone to snap if you offer me a chance

It seems like he has a mouth full of gold teeth
I smile, because your eyes can't take the glare

And everybody stop and stare when we come in the place
And I can get on the mic with no time to waste
Get right up in your face, kick the flavor you taste
And when I'm on the microphone, it's a damn disgrace

Goodie Mob,"You 'bout to make me slam yo' back clean out 
But I luv her till death do us part 
Though she divorced my pop the hard way 
Back in nineteen ""yassey"" for the past sixteen years 
I took on the responsibility of daddy
Ma ol' burd, puttin a real buzz in my ear makin sho' it marinate 
And not go out the other ear 
Guess who? Stood beside me when why'all wouldn't force fed when I 
Couldn't lift a spoon to my skull 
God is good, God is kind mimmicin' her taught me how to say mine 
Grace improvised wit bakin' soda when it wasn't no toothpaste 
Now what that went with my ol' burd cried tears of joy 
When she heard I wasn't gon' serve time for possession 
Of the ""sawed off"" runnin' out of spurs 
When I came home blowed and couldn't find the key hole, guess who 
Unlocked the doors, my Ol' burd puttin' my hairs out 
I better eat before you bug me to death 
Shut-up you old ungrateful ass nigga, she trying to help yo' ass
I wasn't ready to eat yet but I enjoyed the dinner she said, ""I'm glad"" 
Slid down my esophagus wit ease, even though she have this skin disease 
That won't allow me to gain weight do my own eyes deceive me 
Guess who tuck me in before I started drivin' this Benz 
Again & again, told me not to and when I did
Guess who beat the dog shit outta me kid 
My momma didn't play, shit, I had to pick the switches 
You guess who!

My momma, destination unknown, went out on her own 
She was barely even grown and became my momma 
I never knew my dad, so even when the times got bad 
I was glad cause I had my momma 
For so long she had to be strong 
I know at certain times she was wrong 
But she still my momma, it still amazes me 
The Lord had to help her raise me judging from the way I used to be 
My momma, the biggest player that I know I love her so 
Hell everything I got I owe to my momma 
Thank you for caring, thank you for sharing yo' luv 
I guess that was yo' way of preparing 
Yo' son to be the one and not the two 
To make you and my daddy's dream come true 
But what a surprise a car wreck left you paralyzed 
The sheet was pulled over yo' eyes when the doctor advised 
The family that you might not ever talk again 
But you talkin' so I know that you gon' walk again 
But take yo time, guess who's the inspiration for the rhyme, my momma 

Who was the first to hold you in some arms 
The first to change your diaper when your stomach wasn't calm 
Your momma, wit that drama brought you into this world 
From a world of down under 
I wonder now she know when I was lying, when I was telling the truth 
With the proof she would explain how I've been skipping school 
With that boys putting wholes on my back with the same belt 
Around my waist that held my pants up 
Takin' back only got you closer to Southern Bell 
Got your forehead swell 
I swear she knew when it was real or when it was fake like Clampetts 
With dreads and if I couldn't handle a situation then I fled 
Behind closed doors I froze, in Garnett holes I rose 
Who that hell got my bond 
Standing in front of that two-inch glass 
A woman ready to hand the cash over for her son
My mama!

Sometimes we get it on, I know at times I'm wrong 
Lookin' into my eyes just to let me know she tried is enough for me 
I'm callin' a truce it seems we more like brother and sister 
Even though she pay the bills wit the mister 
Brought me home in '72 and gave me all she had 
Cause I was left at birth she knew it could work 
Since she gave me the first chance my song and dance 
Pearl, my world, what would I do without her spark 
Probably be on the street wit nothin' to eat but I got a happy home 

Ever since my first day it's heaven sent now I know 
What it's meant when I say 
I appreciate what you've done and what you do your only son
Guess who?
The only one that cares for real and really understands how I feel 
Help me over come my fears and never left me through the years 
So I dedicate this song for you, for all that you brought me through 
I know there will never be another that will love me like my mother",Guess Who,1995

He had such a peaceful expression in his face

I toss a rose but just can't seem to walk away yet
Damn I done fucked around and got upset
But it ain't nothing we can do
It's bigger than me and you
One day our time coming too
So ain't no use in being sad
Leaving here was probably the best gift he ever had
We should be glad
Maybe his life was something
That he had to give to show me
That I need to be responsible about how I live
I won't complain about my pain
But I just ain't gone let my niggas die in vain
So Bean I'm gone make it for you

Celery and blue cheese on my menu next

Southern Fry won't allow my body to lie still
Tied face goons surround me like cancer drill
Me with second-hand obstables
But, only to make matters worse
Plus I'm getting pimped by this temp lady Jackie
From Optima staffing figure laughing
Shut up clown don't talk to me
Like that looking stupid of course
Living day by day and you ain't hard
Trick hell you say?

It's such a blessing when my eyes
Get to see the sun rise
I'm ready to begin, another chance to get further away from where I've been
What I'll never forget everythang I went through
I appreciate the shit because
If I hada went and took the easy way
I wouldn't be the strong nigga that I am today
Everythang that I did
Different thangs I was told
Just ended up being food for my soul

Come and get yo' soul food, well well
Good old-fashioned soul food, all right
Everythang is for free
As good as it can be
Come and get some soul food

Sunday morning where you eating at?
I'm on 1365 Wichita Drive
Ole' burd working the stove ride
Churches dropping chicken in yesterday's grease
Didn't go together with this quart of Mickey's
Last night hanging over from a good time
Yeah beef is cheaper but
It's pumped with ""red dye"" between two pieces of bread
Shawty look good with dem hairy legs
Wish I could cut her up but, ma stomach come before sex
A house full of hoes now what's the ingredient
Spaghetty plus her monthly flow

They know they making it hard on the yard
Fuck Chris Darden, fuck Marcia Clark
Taking us when we're in the spotlight for a joke
Changing by the day I see it's getting bigga in my square
Looking at Lenox from the outside
With a stare no money to go inside
Tameka and Tiffany outside tripping
And skipping rope to the beats from my jeep
As I speak wuz up from the driver seat

A heaping helping of fried chicken
Macaroni and cheese and collard greens
Too big for my jeans
Smoke steams from under the lid that's on the pot
Ain't never had allot but thankful for
The little that I got why not be
Fast food got me feeling sick
Them crackers think they slick
By trying to make this bullshit affordable
I thank the Lord that my voice was recordable

(Come an get your soul food, well, well)
Hold up C it's what I write
And Miss Lady acting like we in jail
Says she ain't got no extra hush puppis to sell
Bankhead seafood making me hit that door
With a mind full of attitude
It was a line at tha beautiful
Jj's Ribshack was packed too
Looking to be one of dem days
When Momma ain't cooking
Everybody's out hunting with tha family
Looking for a little soul food

Come and get yo' soul food, well well
Good old-fashioned soul food, all right
Everythang is for free
As good as it can be

From the down underground are hangin' around the A-Town
Lookin' for a come up, workin' from 9 to 5
Just to get some change so T-Mo can stay alive
Not greedy or living' lavish yet but you can bet that when I do
Nobody from my crew will I forget
And if I start to get large and come up on some change
I won't change, everybody know they down
It's not the same, everyday life can be different
These laws got me ready to ball
Cause I fall a victim so I still be slanging them fat pillows
To make 'em meet, each and every day as I comb my city streets
Sometimes I wish I never had been apart of this mess
Cause the system got us fucked up
It put us to the test, women and men if you black you in
Food for the soul listen to what I tell you it don't matter
Young or old it's time we loc' up and do like we suppose
We killin' each other over this bullshit and some clothes
We're trapped off in this world and society with no place else to go
So how you feel?

Frustrated, irritated, sometimes I don't know myself I be too numb
To feel something sometimes so I dig deep, get in the Cherokee
Let my mind fly free into the wilderness so I can get this shit off my mind
That's why I be smokin' that dank sometimes, it keeps me from snappin'
Keeps me calm, keeps my mind open, keeps me fond of what I gots to do
Off in the studio to get my old burd back on her feet, and my little bro'
In Statesboro and my little 'cause Mark Twain, all my
Folks that hang with me when I was out in the trap or when I was goin'
Through one of our episodes, only god knows, what I go through so I get down
On my knees, sometimes I come home too high to pray, but I get on my bed
Lay on my back and meditate, anyway, in the ceilings, the four walls
It's like cell therapy I got nothing to do but write about my L-I-F-E, put it
Down on paper, so what you feel?

I live for today, motherfuck another hour, it might be sour
Never know my day, so I'm prayin' in the shower
Look up and thank the Lord for forgiveness, a witness to bad
I'm lookin' for good in the Southwest, God bless my neighborhood
It's people killin' in the street to eat
Surviving the day is the only goat that I set
Just to make it home, I'm not alone
Someone's out to get me when I haven't done shit wrong

My head felt swoll, mista couldn't see past my mouth
What route did you take man
Caught me by that loops of my pants
Got me on the curb lettin' tha traffic pass me by
No questions I said nothing
Lookin' for the mutant to be buckin'
The law naw, man Gipp show him my shit
Close my mouth then I dip
See to me G is a person who understand the plan
Can't make no moves when you in the hands of the man
They got some new suites down Peachtree
Left wing for the Feds, right wing for tha hardheads
Makin' more deals than Buddy Folks made with Hartsfield
Somebody don't want my face in the place, for 96 shit's slick
Got me clean, lookin' fresh, dogs be scratchin' at my chest
Under the order of who? Guess who ain't non-iller than miller
Want to 1, 2 your ass no more life what you gave was the past
'cause ain't no future want to millicamp your case
Disgrace your face, make it seem to be safe
But ain't no place to run

Sometimes I don't even know how I'm gon' eat
'Bout twenty dollars away from being on the street
Shit, you might see a nigga on tv
But hell it's almost like I'm rappin' for free
That little money be gone, got dammit, I'm grown
Gotta help keep the heat and lights on
It would be nice to have mo' but I kinda like being po'
At least I know what my friends here fo'
I want to lie to you sometimes, but I can't
I want to tell you that it's all good, but it ain't
It's nigga's hurtin' and uncertain 'bout if they gon' make it or not
That's why we got nigga's killing
Feelin like they coming up off a little dope they sold
You can get some gold but we won't make it as a whole
Cause without you there'd be no me
And without no unity there will never be any happiness
You could smoke a pound of sess and it still won't relieve yo' stress
God bless my, thought process

The thought process
Now as an Outkast I was born, wasn't warned of the harm
That would come to meet me like Met Life, but yet life
Done sent me through a lot of up's and down like it ain't nothing'
Like elevators but I ain't the one that's pushin' the buttons
I got off at the 13th floor, when they told me that it wasn't one
They said it skipped from 12 to 14
Still smoking, still drinking, no I'm sittin' on the Lincoln
4 A.M. thinkin' that in reality the world is like a ball full of playas
We trapped off in this maze with walls made of layers
And only prayers is the tightest game that you can have
The devil's takin' a swing that might explain the broken glass
But my crystal ball see the pistol fall to the wayside
Nobody would die in cops and robbers when we used to play right

Huh, the only thang we feared was Williams, Wayne
Never though about hittin' licks or slangin' caine
Didn't think I'd be the one to give in to abortion

Trying to keep my head above water
Selling myself short to meet the fucking quota
Still there's niggas at my heels to get my paper
Stacking up in the bank, the layers on the cake-a
Thinking like Jimmy, Tami, oh it's low down
Niggas be getting mad as I go 'round like Pac
The shit don't stop, I hid the rock in my sock
Did my day and a half, now it's autographs I be signing
Instead of police papers
Caught scheming, not pulling capers, no fed time
Just mental healing
What you dealing with? The angelic uplift
It's a way to save everything with your gift
(Yeah)
Now a seed to a tree was to be
(Yeah)
A boy to a man comes up quickest like a dream
You really don't understand why
'Til you gone and dead
So when your time comes
Just remember what I said
Human'll find truth to tell a lie
Take away my past and don't show me I can fly
Sly like Stone, it's on, you say peace
I can't relate homes, I'm on the fucking streets
Believe it or not, I'm sure there be calmer situations
When dirty cops approach me joe, I'm on probation
Hesitating could get me took
What can I do? Mildew?
Can I take your place on your next trip to
The islands of Alto, so it's going down like that
I'm back to bat dropping wits on wax
To fit into the mix of the rich and scan'lous
Can't let 'em handle us any kind of way, fuck it
And run away, I don't want it torn joe
I think they gay, don't want to play my shit up north
But that's okay, jealousy can go a long way
And what goes around comes around in the A-town
[Big Gipp]
Have you ever thought about what it would be like
If everybody woke up and said ""Fuck work""
Webs of small talk, people caught up in this thing
I try to relax, but I stay shaking like the blue flame
It keeps coming, this and that, that and this
Another suing me, well I add him to the list
Flows and flows, with the girls with the tight clothes
Saying anything to get off in these back doors
Irritating like what's on them thirties
Ain't looking for no more friends, I got enough buddies
A thousand attempts with thirty cents to their name
I got enough pine but I can't find the flame
Sweet like honeysuckles, country like that cha cha on the green
Jumping fences and rooms with large laughter
Original gene grafter, more and more ways to eat
Brews tested by the astronauts, turn the turn the watts up
Listen to what I said
CNN all day in your eyes and your head
[Khujo]
No longer can I ask when I'm in your presence
Now it's hard to tell whether you're trying to hurt or help me
At the bottom of this barrel scraping
Next time I promise to stand for self-determination
Instead of always taking from cool 
Keeping the same color as you and me, continue to battle DNA
Let's travel to a remote city get back, have mercy
Unravel and break the chains of chemical dependency
Plastic can eventually explode bits and pieces of my soul
Shattering, just not being put back together
We can rule, but still brothers won't use that tool
In between their shoulders, click
Hearts cold as bricks, nipples what better way to cripple
An entire race on the paper chase
Getting my toes stepped on, then kicked in my face
Every time I open my mouth I represent the South
Dirty like red, it was the lifestyle I led
Worshipping vanity, fornicating out of wedlock
Locked in yesterday's trunk of secrets, I fled
Went from sugar to sheet rock 
Get your rocks, sweet licks turn sour
By the hour, over on tiger flower
If that light went on that meant go
Say what you really mean, I atone
For all the women I abused as a youngster
People got four fifths out this dumpster
[Cee-Lo]
Compositions should be able to make the connections
From reflections of living
Why every breath is God-given
Appreciating, especially waiting
Letting time do the educating
In order to know
Sunshine and the rain are both needed
Or the seed can't grow
It's given me some form of inner vision
How the paragraphs are prepared with precision
Unveiling evidence that this is no coincidence
We've been sent
Judge not by my skin color but my character's content
In no way is this an attempt to claim to be exempt 
From my people's situations, but I have moral obligations
See I want to be all right with God
Long conversations at night with God
My arms are gonna always be too short to fight with God
To all this might not be appealing
But I can't help feeling the way I do
I realize that my reward won't come from any of you
See everybody got a little light under the sunshine
But unselfishly I still want to share mine
And what you choose to do is on you
You've got to stand on your own feet cause I ain't got but two
I can't knock you for not knowing
But I could for you not wanting to learn
Nor for asking, but I could for you not wanting to earn
No I can't, cause somebody even had to tell me twice
So this music is my sacrifice, so I'll be dedicated
Determinated and dependable, to demonstrate directly
And use the opportunity correctly
So forget the gold teeth
And uh, and uh
Forget the bald head
Forget it sound country

I'd kill for my only brother, even though he might be wrong 
At times I'm gon' do what I got to do to come through every scary moment

I wear Calhoun jeans 'cause I don't like Calvin

Can't do nuttin' but take what them folk give me

Caught in the crossfire between Yankees and 49ers
Rivals, but the South remain calm
Neutral but we see blood that make homeboys hate at each other's lives
Over colours and thangs, that they can bring
To the next plain, but the toots in blue, badges
Who are the biggest gangs? 
In Babylon, dyin slowly but surely
Malicious drivers with hairpin triggers
On the loose like juice
And white America couldn't stand it

But we talkin outside the courtrooms
Shootin birds at the judges
Fuck Teks and go and plug us out on racial slurs
Destroyin documents or complaints from black workers

was the last resort, I knew that goin to court drama wasn't likely
I nicked scrimis like a chemist
Cookin up a pan like the Witch Doctor
Stroll beside cha like a thousand volts
Over the edge pf the Hope with the CIA sellin coke

Let your eyes close to what your contract shows

Knee-deep in the struggle

Gotta lady and a see that you can't hardly feed
Any day your life could end so you depend
on the reciting and the writing when you got the spare time to spend
To keep you stable, hopin one day you'll be able
To be a commodity on somebody's record label
Got your chance, twenty thousand dollar advance
and a car and all of a sudden you a star at the bar
ballin, callin the waiter to bring one of they finest wines
Then you started snortin lines, your life defines
the misconception of stayin down
You can't be influenced by everybody you hang round
You shoulda been more appreciative
of the life that you were blessed to live
A hundred percent is what you got to give

There's no such thing as coincidence in, me finding you here
And I really hate screaming in your ear, so some other time, OK?
I waited a day hello?
This is Carlito from a couple of days ago, you sound tired
Forgive me if I've called you too late
But what better time to relate mind-state? Where could I begin?
Hasn't anyone ever told you you got beautiful skin?
You're more than welcome, what do you desire within?
I just, wanna be, there's no need to put titles on you and me
Those are limitations, living and learning are our only obligations
Equality, honesty, independence, intelligence, emotion and devotion
Humbly seeking to hear God when he's speaking
At one time, my mind, just, couldn't conceive
A woman had to dress a certain way to believe
But, in the same breath, a-llow me to say
That, if you believed young lady, you wouldn't dress that way
And I, was attracted to your class, I couldn't see all yo' ass

Brought a baby girl into this world, made our parents grandfolks
Household with no hope, took care of ye, you me
When shit got put out on the curb
Closer than the skin on the back of my hand
Through the thick and thin, we can win
Beautiful black skin

Well, I say you're my, beginnin my end
You're my sista lover and friend
God is, your light from within
It shines through your beautiful skin
What they, say bout you ain't true
There's no me if there is no you
I hope, that you understand
You got to respect yourself before I can

No need to compete, with the music loud
Or stairs cold, put on a scale, of one to ten, you a twelve
I chose, her over jail and hell
Originally from ATL

Compatible souls come together, under bad weather
To discuss distrust amongst the so-called
Good in every wo-man, how I wish this was true
I deal with facts only, already done cloned me
Why I sang the blues, when there's only one God
That watches over our every step, I need his help
When I'm walkin, lookin for the right female
I can't tell sometimes
They tell me the devil's comin humble in his approach
Spontaneous with the game
He caught the naive of a girl fallin for the OK
Let the pistol smoke the one you live by
Die by, examples of how relationships can be

I rolls the dice, takin a chance at crappin out
Like today boy, I lost one of my best hips
Natural thick lips, no animal fat implants
Wide load, just started workin at the airport
19 years old, worth more than her weight in gold
But it was all my fault, so don't cry, understand
If down the line I want you back and the feelin ain't mutual
Just promise me you'll find a new man that's bout some business
Hope she find what her was lookin for, like a dreamto my end
I wanted to be more than friends

Then they steady move them ki's like Bob James

November just died, December's alive
Thus it ain't no typical ride
Just individual's way to bring home

Belligerent thoughts of militant ways
Camouflaged in the brush, love or lust
Which can we trust hidden in the cuts
Terr-i-ble they bounce 'em every third month
Yeah, after the big flood of truth
Caught in your own evidence
Now you hesitant to believe me
You back to hangin with Parks
That's what you called her
Now you run cause you know that's what you want
If I felt like everything was good
Maybe then I could knock on wood
To protect the good
That surrounds my innermost thoughts
Until my thoughts were caught unguarded
As hard as it is to be perfect I try
And I still flaw listening to the next guy
That knew more and saw it before I did
Came up big, to dig an early grave
Get locked up, and turn a slave for the rhythm
We rap, still get slapped by the system

Blowin bubbles out the wrong end

Transforming hustlers and players into sissies

Swore, couldn't nobody put a finger on his naps
Now he up under the bridge stankin
In his birthday suit
Used to always holler about how he was gon do a brother (get him!)
Beat him to the punch-line, one time
Being forced into early retirement at the age of 26
Palms feel like bricks peeling from distributing crack
Crumb snatchers and goo-gobblers struggle
To stay on top of sand dunes
Some mouths born with silver spoons

Make your bed you gotta sleep in it
Mistakes made
Baking soda kept the neats clean
Narrow like a ravine

Once the temperature rise

Half the pipes are gettin sold out convienience stores
Where ya at now?
Comming around trying to sniff out sounds
Well rounded kept you strictly grounded for your ear
The dogs are gettin closer to the coons now can you hear?
I smell fear and even if your eyes was closed
Your ass couldn't catch your tear

Lies, straws, mirrors and plates
Nicks, dimes, fifties, and cakes
Why can't I escape
These lies, straw, mirrors and plates?

In the land of jacks I got my axe over the tracks with stacks
Upon the map in the vault
Where this cat's trying to sniff me out
I'm in the southwest woods working all about
Paper capers, never hurtin brothers to obtain
If I can't refrain cause some of these niggas snortin cain
And really don't know which way to go
Confused, you'll abuse anybody for a fix
Hits go for ten bucks, go for 20 and they good and plenty
Fat baggies like ?Maggies? muffin
Where the kid do the stuffin
Silly of these young niggas watching me
As I turn figures into solitare
Twirl up my hair (down south)
Pray to God I don't have to do him
Like I never knew or had no clue to who you was
Cuz, face to face with a scar engraved upon his left cheek
So to speak, I'm more like a icon when it was done to approach my mosse
Be on that Rossie like The Click
So I stay ready for combat and watch the rich get rich off it

I got that thang with me cause it's necessary

But I kept seeing the same headlights running stop signs and red lights

This sad, of course I'mma be mad
Well here you can have it got damnit if you want it that bad
You would try to take from me, my nigga I ain't no star
I value both of our lives more than this car
You lucky nigga, I used to be you
Shit and I'd bust a hole in your chest somebody could see through
Now remember, shit, you could've died tonight
And I would've been in the right

But when I go to sleep I don't dream no more I just lay
A wise man knows his limitations
Concrete, concrete like Greg Street

Lord got the door
Shot down to the pavement
Remove yo hat under the ceiling

A rebuff from the usher of sorts
Deacons leading hymns rooted stems
Most strive for the diamonds and overlook the gems

Boulders become shoulders to depend on
Which way to explore
Reform, refrain, we gain inflame
Every thought you walk through the trails is hell
Airborne for one

Now you lost it wasn't worth it look what it costed
Yo life young nigga
Didn't go out without a fight behind the gun trigger
You better think fast or get swept off yo feet

The minds of knuckleheads that grow up to be base heads
Don't say I didn't tell you cuz you gon see in the future
I hope I don't have to shoot you
If you switch
Went from hardcore to beggin like a bitch

Well I woke up this mornin with the same frustration from situations like these
Got a call about some work from one of them temporary agencies
No high school diploma or any college degrees
I can't enlist but they'll draft me if there's a war overseas
Oh please
Of course I can slice some OZs
But see I'm one of those aspirin MCs
And uh bills are due so at times I'm doubtful and everyone disagrees
But I'd rather struggle on my feet than to live on my knees
So my uniform tight workin all night at Mickey D's
Got about 90 dollars and some change after the government
Get they fees
These minimum wages ain't enough to feed my babies
Purposely these limitations on black folks opportunities
So I quit cuz I'm tired of being one of those overworked
Underpaid employees
Stop carin at all went on and did a few small burglaries
It seems like my faith done turned into forgotten memories
And I ain't gettin away with nothing because I know He always sees
But see right now I need to see how I can get this here dope sold
I done stuffed in my pocket as many rocks as it can hold
They gonna get high so I'm gonna get my money even though it's freezin cold
Now how many times you done heard this story told?
Believe it or not, there's some very intelligent junkies
But dependencies is eating away at they souls like disease
Anyone can turn into somebody who covets and envies
Unequal economics can easily make you some enemies
And the crime rate never drops so the cops ride around in threes
I knew he would have killed me if I did anything but freeze
They found the rest of the dope in some nearby shrubberies
In a dimlit room being questioned by these authorities
And they gave me some time in correctional facilities

It's either crumpled up or torn without lettin the thought be born

Have a thought that I couldn't raise, nurture, and care for

Why girls want to be Satan to the niggas incarcerated, I got one love 
Cause I can't get no where hatin, the funk I will not be rakin 
Uh, I know one nigga that met his match, cakin 
I'm not goin tell you how to live your life, boy you bakin 
[T-Mo] 
Bitch I'm a runnin all through you, you's a PT nigga 
Cause we run with TRU niggas, all about them dollar figures 
Ready to take the war, mafia said go get em 
Hair growin long, my hunger pain got my game goin strong 
From the Twats to the Third Ward 
Shippin them tens across the board like keys 
Blowin D's all the way down to New Orleans 
Baton Rouge, have you blues, don't snooze 
Or you might lose your life caught up in the fight 
[Khujo] 
Chorus x2 
[Big Gipp] 
Slugs and thugs go together like pumps and trunks 
Ready to dump, yo, laid back, crunk 
Blowin like king jumpin hoggin in the 99's 
Sizzlin out my fuckin face, jumpin out your polo's 
Back up in the blunts birds, flip flop to the rolls elbows 
With the look, down here, rushin all up on the curb 
Good bye night please, what you think 
Murder can a nigga get up in a tree 
[C-Murder] 
Goodie Mob, real mail, A-T-L, where them killas dwell 
Southside niggas pushin motherfuckin platinum figures 
That many bitches want to roll with us 
But like the weed with no seed we just roll em up 
Beats By The Pound ain't No Limit, Goodie Mob and Murder man like 
Jackie Chan 
Hittin hard and pushin weight by the sound 
You hit the I-10 and head west or we'll test 
Cause down in Twats, fuck the cops, killas packin glocks 
Lo and Gipp never trip, we goin sank a nigga ship 
T-Mo and Khujo in a motherfuckin studio 
And gettin crunk, bumpin in a trunk 
And rap when I want to rap so where my real niggas at 
[Cee-Lo] 
Oh, suga suga please, take it eazy eaz, 
Already beat him to his knees, he goin give you your cheese 
Talkin bout the day ?? your tippin the scale 
I work your ass like a woman, make you sale your tale 
Throw your ass on the stove and repay you there 
I'm a let see-Murda make your teeth turn red 
I'm a bet, hot enough to make the concrete sweat 
Fuck with me the wrong way and know you'll never forget

Goodie Mob,"Now TLC will challenge Goodie Mob
To a game of ghetto laser tag
When they say 'What it is'
You scream 'What it ain't'

1999 (Yeah)
TLC, M-O-B (And Goodie Mob)
The synergy of ghetto sounds for the Y-2-G
(What'cha wanna do with it?)
What it is, what it ain't
(What?)
Either you bring it
(We gon' bring it)
Or you can't
Sometimes it gets kind of messy out there
(Sometimes)
But we get by
(Well what'cha wanna do with it)
One day at a time

Stuck on me at waffle house
After 1:12, when I go out
Where do you hang?
Or do you slang?
Or wear a chain?
Wear platinum rings?
I still maintain my ghetto siren
Keep my pride
Get in my ride
Twenty-inch rims
I sport a brim
And when my girls
Go to the mall
Around the world
And keep the change
The finest things
We still remain so ooh

You don't even look from across the room
You don't know enough about this world to
Ever get it on with me
Or hang out where I do
You don't even look from across the floor
You don't have game enough any more
Come up on a girl like me
And that's not a possibility cause

You big plastic girl
I'mma big boss man
I like old model cars and big sedans
You like two doors
Frontin' their clothes and Rolls
Or sit on the porch sip something real cold
I like the nine when you up and not O's
I do suits while you prefer the lows
Tonight I'mma choose cause you already chose
Grown for the business and I run to flow

Cause you ain't ghetto enough for me
And you ain't hot enough for me
And you ain't fly enough for me
And you're too tight with your money
Cause you ain't ghetto enough for me
And you ain't hot enough for me
And you ain't fly enough for me
And you're too tight with your money

Check it baby
So ghetto like hot fries
I come from Melvin and resemble
Twenty-twenty with his blood shot eyes, got 32 loads
Went from two O's to 32 loads
Which is enough to buy a Roll
But nobody knows
Stay in my place
Keep my diamonds out of your face
You wanna be with this player
You got play at my pace
I'm slow but I can still come over there from where you're from
If you want some bullshit you better buy you some

You don't even look from across the room
You don't know enough about this world to
Ever get it on with me
Or hang out where I do
You don't even look from across the floor
You don't have game enough any more
Come up on a girl like me
And that's not a possibility cause

Shorty with your booty showin'
Shorty with your gold teeth
Shorty with your long nails
Shorty with your fake hair
Shorty got the attitude all up in the news
To represent the Nineties girl
Doing it oh I need to
I got the back you got the front
That's how we do up in the woods
With the bump on the log, ain't no scrubs over here
I'mma ghetto millionaire, can you see me in the clear?
I'mma keep on serving 'em like I'm supposed to baby

We custom navigate to the club
With some of the hardest of beats

Is you sleeping with all the shit I've been through?
Cause I'mma keep doing all the things that I gots to do
(I'm ghetto) Uh dammit I'll put your ass to work
(I'm ghetto) Comb your nappy hair till it hurts

Oh what I'm saying
Stop using the rope take 'em real off these streets
Or you might hurt your throat
You know you ghetto
When you don't show up at court
For not paying your child support
Are you too bossier for me?
You act like you too good to eat
At Church's, Popeye's, and Arby's

Say say say say Crack, what's the word on the street?
Nothing but hard times, working this concrete
I'm getting dirty looks from niggas, on the next street over
They was in my filthy, fiending getting closer
I'm in my seventy-nine, flying
Mobbed out so they can't see me when I'm riding
They slow me down, holla like we buddy buddy
But at the same time I know these motherfuckers want to mug me
Okay gun play at the one-way one day with you

Keep point four-five calibers of chrome

Uh oh hoe, Willie cutting virgin broads tonight
Blowing like a boss, that champion chief in cost

There's something bout these guns that give these hoes asthma attacks
These are actual facts, I ain't been in no actual car-jacks
But let me tell you this, I'll burn a nigga ass up to a crisp
Riding with these two glocks, we goin' bounce on off, on the new shocks
My nigga don't hate me, cause I ain't hated, but we related
No one including me, should be underestimate
But don't you dare ride through the SWATS without, at least 30 shots
Cause I'm telling ya, these Southern boys goin' get all they got

Out your cornbread dream too, if you got those, leaving deaf hoes
Brown, on the outside, pink, in the middle
Ain't, barring none hundred round draw
Nothing under seventy-five, and I get slick ?
Taking no prisoners cuffed, they die fighting for they freedom
Everytime son, rhymes too pretty'll get your mascara smeared
When they did, my buddy Spanky I bust out in tears
The world would be a better place to live, if it was less queers

Why'all from the section where the straight shit, straight up off the top

Gone up off the Purple Haze, when you see me call me Mr. Gipp
Shoot em from the hip, every time I'm in my 84 Sedan Deville
Block me off and watch me peel, Big Boi grill riding through the park
On the weekend ain't no stopping keep it dipping that's how we tripping
Looking mean, you too clean behind the glass
Watch yo' ass, keep yo' elbows out the windows
And my hands upon the wood wheel, money in my socks
Looking out, for the cops, and for the haters got a fifty shot

T-Mo cuts the record down to the bone
And now we back rapping on the microphone
I say signing autographs for little kids delight me
We can't help but be some stars in the shining night
See I was raised in the SWATS by my mom and pop
To be a cold little brother that you can't stop
On top of the charts, I'm a ladies man
The type of brother with heart, weak suckers can't stand
Cause I want to be free, hear my spirit it's the clearest
Can you hear it in the gospel
I came down here cause I gotta believe
Don't follow me, I say I need someone to take me to the Rave

Goodie Mob,"Yup, yup, yeah.. uhh..
Yeah..

All night like a corner store, twenty-four seven
Hood hanger; we gets hot like a wok
in the Chinese kitchen, switchin up on my shoe wear
How we get down, we blew down, nigga big bank style
Sit and chill a while, wait a minute yo we blows big nigga
Sip on bottles with funny names, holla holla
Deep in this thang, keep it simple and plain
and watch my chain hang, watch my chain hang

Listen here -- I got a book that you should read
It's about me, and I suggest that to any nigga who doubt me
it will correct you, affect you, it will make shit clear
Now switch to the next nigga with that bullshit here
Keep readin -- it will also say
that if you, disrespect, anything up in this way
that will guaran-tay an awesome array of gunplay, okay?
This is Carlito's Way, all day

Shake it shake it shake it shake it hang out all night
and don't stop until the DJ quit spinnin what's right
Everybody sweatin gettin closer and closer, be shoulder to shoulder
Bouncin, bouncin, we tipsy, danceflo' is slippery
But we groovin, keepin this bitch movin
Provin, we bang in this game watch my chain hang

Back and forth, back, and forth
Style, whatchu know bout ridin out
from the Kroger parking lot to the Paramount
and Birmingham then back, punk is spittin his jack
When the leaves turn ur-ange, and you see your breath
uhh, fifteen eleven colossal
I'm weighing in at a Knighton
If you don't know nuthin else
believe that it is some ol' real niggaz

Whether you slang 'caine, or you gang-bang
or work a nine to five, just tryin to maintain, mayne
Do your thang, mayne, it's all the same, mayne
and let your chain swang, and let your chain hang

Lyric assassin while mashin they blastin come fast and
scatter from every rational imaginal
International region, under my seeds and, over these airwaves
Manipulate the rhyme with my mind so it's good to grind
through your speaker, this one's a keeper
Like Ebenezer, it was his decision, to live his life
through a tunnel vision, followed by the reaper
who knows your past deeper, don't let him creep ya, from behind

Before I was rudely interrupted, house fallin down
but we straight, you should save yourself ??
It's rainin suckers cause they greed sickens me
Poverty stricken, hand pickin, in the corner cleansin
Lights out poor, slip and you nails hell
Everythang for sale, be eat with they plastic
Let's enhance it, I'll be good til Saturday
Thick volume gravity

We bout to mix and mingle, meet a match for the next single
Money stashed away in jars like Pringles
Keep it hard for the Tunnel, we make it bump
for the 5 5 nina skull-cap boot-wearin renegade motherfuckers
Throw yo' hands up, you give it up we give it back
Yo, this is how we act when it's packed from the back
Lady don't snatch, let my chain hang
Everythang is everythang boo

Behold, the stolen soul, the ancient scroll
The game of control, roll the Swisher swoll
Open the gate away, lay to lay, I getcha gotcha greaterly
Even when you hate me, you educate me
So try to trill, I will take ya to the battlefield
Crack your motherfuckin, windshield you better yield
cause I got the right of way, night or day, alright okay
This is Carlito's Way

Whether you slang 'caine, or you gang-bang
or work a nine to five, just tryin to maintain, mayne
Do your thang, mayne, it's all the same, mayne
and let your chain swang, and let your chain hang

A better place for these ghetto children
I ain't gonna let 'em take the O out my JOY
Before you can rebuild, you've got to destroy
And these walls gonna come tumbling down
These walls gonna come tumbling down

Well I remember when, I was slanging nothing but weed
I ain't round here that can't tell you about me
Fortunately I done changed the way I used to be
When so many didn't have an alternative to see
Music saved my life and now I'll never forget it
Thats why I try to glorify God with it
But it still remains, its in my veins
I know that I'ma sin, I just hope he'll forgive me again
Okay, I'm right and wrong in the same day
And it's always gonna be someone who'll see it the same way
And if I react, who was that guy to blame, hey
You fuck with me, I fuck with you thats how the game played
I had a choice to let it go, but if you don't let it go
Then I ain't got no choice no more
Two lives gone to waste, one dead and the other caught a case
With 50 years to face
I'm raising ghosts, I'm rebuilding

And we blame it on them, but we stuck in the same frame
Trapped inside a mental instrumental bond
Hoping to run, but theres a gun, what could you really do
Everybody new kicking the old shit to the floor
But now its more shit, crooked, shady, talking 'bout the president
He's fucking other ladies, blowing up spots we supposed to hit
And casually they spreading billions to the little children overseas
Niggas moving G's, I'm on my knees praying god please
A nigga just wanna eat and sleep
With my gun in my own little world and raise my little kids
Doing the best I can nigga

Shit, look who talking now
You gots'ta crawl before you walk, Ohh don't follow to close
Where I think you might stop 
We all can see that the grass is the same color on the other side of the fence
Give thanks, people thank alarm clocks, wake 'em up
Every morning brother I gotta stay prayed up
Cause the pistol ain't gonna save my life when it's time to go
Its just in case I get a chance to retaliate
I used ain't have nothing positive to say
Doing my little five minutes of fame
Who done forget from which they came
Acknowledge his name, Lord, you've been so good to me
Better than I've been to myself
Keep us in good health

But I gots'ta be strong, to defeat my enemies

Grown for the business and I run to flow

And her decision making skills were still in it's early stages
You know what I'm talking about
Therefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which
She thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood
Pause, just like a brother with a thousand pauses
Should I, shouldn't I, I cant, I have to, mama will never see me the same
Daddy and Big Mama I know all of them gonna be ashamed of me
Are just a few thoughts racing through her cranium
As she sits on top of the pale,
Cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house
The unthinkable moments away from becoming reality, sadly with no clue
And no way of expressing her feeling
To her mam or anybody else in her life
Tisha done came to the crossroads and now she got to choose
Fatality, fatality, fatality, fatality",Toilet Tisha,2000

I see your mom and dad got a new Jag
Little Jason work at Papa John's, saw your other brother Kelly
In the basement at Killer Bee's house

Tuesday night fights, ESPN, Sportcenter, Big Screen
You know how these Eastpoint vets do
Can you recall riding bicycles in the trails behind?
Krissy Collins dropping Huffys like BMX's

Your first car was a Honda, my first car was a Rabbit
Cut parties with a tall can or something
Off in the 800 Ol' E, man, that old girl
She always fell, drunk off the pink champagne

Don't need to remind me about the divine, he polishes
He demolish his competitors, who was the editor
To bad mouth these boys that bred in the South

Where chicken's fried on the daily and rebel flags fly
I have no love for confederate sons but guns
And no hogs' good for me, people like my type
To spark the spiritual fight with the devil off tonight

When he's white, at anytime, and any rhyme
With substance is looked at as racist
When good ol' boys is still doing hangings
And Mississippi having no pity on my color skin

Not having a choice from the begin
Little brothers like me to pose a physical threat
But check let me grab a hold of my black steel
And I'll show all y'all who's real, c'mon

Reeks the planet without the black man

So what's your angle, try to separate me from the blood
Is disrespect like coming in my home and not
Wiping your feet on the rug

Look out for the man with the mask and the white pony
On my back are bills staying off my toes always on my heels

Me with second-hand obstacles,
But only to make matters worse.

From Optima staffing, figure laughing.
Shut up clown, don't talk to me
Like that, looking stupid of course.
Living day by day and you ain't hard.

Get to see the sun rise.

Sunday morning, where you eating at?
I'm on 1365, Wichita Drive.
Ole' burd working the stove ride.
Churches dripping chicken in yesterday's grease,
Didn't go together with this quart of Mickey's.
Last night hanging over from a good time.
Yeah, beef is cheaper but
It's pumped with ""red dye"" between two pieces of bread.
Shawty look good with dem hairy legs.
Wish I could cut her up but, ma stomach come before sex.
A house full of hos know what's the ingredient;
Spaghetti plus her monthly flow.
They know they making it hard on the yard.
Fuck Chris Darden, fuck Marsha Clark.
Taking us, when we're in the spotlight, for a joke.
Changing by the day, I see it's getting bigga in my square.
Looking at Lennox from the outside
With a stare, no money to go inside.
Tameka and Tiffany, outside tripping
And skipping rope, to the beats from my jeep,
As I speak, wuz up, from the driver seat.

A heaping helping of fried chicken,
Macaroni and cheese, and collard greens.
Too big for my jeans.
Smoke steams from under the lid that's on the pot.
Ain't never had a lot but thankful for
The little that I got, why not be
Fast food got me feeling sick.
Them crackers think they sick,
By trying to make this bullshit affordable.
I thank the Lord that my voice was recordable.
Come an get your soul food well, well.
Hold up, see, it's what I write,
And Miss Lady acting like we in jail.
Says she ain't got no extra hush puppies to sell.

With a mind full of attitude.

Looking to be one of dem days
When Momma ain't cooking.
Everybody's out hunting with tha family,
Looking for a little soul food.

And the way he dances

And contract killers got them hanging from the ceilings
What with America in a cubicle replacing
All of your free flows will come to basement

Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots

Remain to love until they droop and die

As the lands from which they came

Our hearts are still the same

Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear

We teach the young our differences
Yet look how we're the same
We love to laugh, to dream our dreams
We know the sting of pain

From Leningrad to Lexington
The farmer loves his land
And daddies all get misty-eyed
To give their daughter's hand

Oh, maybe when we realize
How much there is to share
We'll find too much in common
To pretend it isn't there

Pulls us all together, never apart
And once we learn to speak it, all the world will hear
Love in any language, fluently spoken here

Though the rhetoric of government
May keep us worlds apart
There's no misinterpreting
The language of the heart

Ridin' on a rollercoaster

Sailing on a boat across the sea

Here you are in Honolulu

Resting by a big palm tree

Drove a cart through a raging blizzard

Took a steamboat down a river

Clean the gears of old Big Ben

Won an Oscar

Climbed a mountain

Wear feather in my cap

Directed a band with big brass buttons

In a tornado kept conducting

Was lucky for a mouse like me

You were the captain of the space patrol

The driver of a Model T.

Aha, that was a pretty bumpy ride you know?

Chased by a grizzly

Kicked by kicked by a mule

Wandered through the Sherwood Forest with a band of Merry Men

Here I'm a knight in shining armor
Wrestled with a rope and didn't win
Chased a chicken 'round the barnyard

Rode a camel through the desert

I was a soldier, was a king

A big game hunter on safari

You did almost everything.

I was apprentice to a sorcerer

Tried a spell, but would've been worser

Was lucky for a mouse who wrote with a quill

I splashed it with water trying to make it make sense
I stumbled to the kitchen she was standing at the sink
All she had to do was just give me that wink

And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

Well it's her way of saying she's on my side
An unspoken message that works every time
When my brain starts smokin' and I can't even think
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

And slam bam I'm feelin' alright
Troubles take a hike in the blink of an eye
Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

In this complicated world it may sound absurd
But simple little things are the miracle cures
Pushed to the limit or standing at the brink
All she's gotta do is just give me that wink

And slam bam I'm feelin' alright

Don't need to psychoanalyze or have a stiff drink

The rain, the oceans, the sun and the moon.
One time in your life you'll came to the point
When you realize.
There must be a supreme being,
And there must be God.

See the birds fly up in the sky.
Look at the mountains, the stars that shine.
God made in one by one, in seven days.
He made the golden sun to watch your ways.

Life's a wonder to little boys,
So full of hunger and full of joy.
One day you'll understand the meaning of it all,
Then you'll walk like a man, free, proud and tall.

Chorus:
Child of the sun, child of the earth,
You're just a part in God's universe.
And only God knows what will be.
He loves you till the very last day.
Child of the sun, in his hands forever you'll stay.


Close your eyes dear, here comes the night.
I wish you sweet dreams till the morning light.
I'll sing you a lullaby till the bluebird comes
And keep my eyes on you, you're not alone.

But the gates of Eden will ever be closed

Goonrock,"She never been on a flight,
She never been in a limousine
And now she's living the life
Popping bottles in LA
She's dancing up on the table
Got everybody's attention
She put my hands on her body
And then she whispered in my ear

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Could last forever

Let's make it last forever

Let's make it last forever

Let's make it last forever

Let's make it last forever

I hope this ain't a dream
(This better not be no dream)
Please don't let this be a simulation
(This better be real)
'Cause you a pretty thing
I hope it's not my imagination
(It better be real)

I'm dancing on the floor
I'm dancing with you, girl
We spin it round and round
You spin me round and round
I'm falling for you girl
I'm falling in love

I know you want it
You know I want you too
I know you like it
I know you like my moves
On Saturday, on Saturday
Tonight be for free
Now that I got you
I won't ever leave you alone, alone, alone
Call your on my phone
Baby let's party the night away
I'm dancing with you
I wanna party with you, girl

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever

Let's make it last forever

Let's make it last forever

Let's make it last forever

Let's make it last forever

You never know how it's gonna go
When you bring a chick up in the limousine
Seeing things she never seen
And you walk up in the club, straight holding her hand, like you the man
But deep in your hear you know she's a fan
'Cause she's struck by the stars
And the stars find her striking
You try to play it off 'cause you see a sign of frightening
Will.I.Am is spittin' at her
T-pain is winking at her
Ludacris is with his chick but his homeboys gettin' at her

What's the matter? Oh nothing
I reply straight buffin' , grabbed the bottle started chuckin'
She grabbed my hand, pulled me to the dance floor
We dance close, and then she pulled my hands low

Oh, I know where this is gonna go
I've seen it in a dream before
I love it when you hold me tight
And then we kiss to the moonlight

This is the best night of my life
And I wish this between you and I
Can last forever

Let's make it last forever

Let's make it last forever

Let's make it last forever

Let's make it last forever

(Let's make it last for)",Best Night,2011
Goonrock,"[Chorus]
We came here to party
(Rock)
We didn't come here to fight
I say, ""We grab ourselves a bottle""
And toast to the good life

Just 'cause a guy got a suit and a tie
Don't mean he gonna text ya
Just 'cause I walk with a limp like an old school pimp
Don't mean I'll slap ya

But If you wanna talk tough
And you wanna puff up
Then I might just have'ta 
But I ain't come here to clock ya mouth
I came here to rock the house

Yeah, I get crazy, wild anything 
For the fans to make you smile
Goose egg girls that's my style
If you think I'm a front then you in denial

But you know when push come to shove
We protect ourselves and the ones we love
Stay at home, sit and judge
Or celebrate life and hit the club

Everybody just wants to feel good
From up on Capitol Hill to the hood
Often times we get misunderstood
But tonight is our night

[Chorus]

They call you suit and tie and you's a politician
They call me super fly, I'm always with two bitches
You know that church type, I grew up with them scriptures 
You mind your Ps and Qs, I sip that Jesus juice

We both get a lot of attention in the press
You sellin' books and wanna be the president 
We fell in hooks and the flow is heaven sent
We both hustlin' so why we tusslin' 

Everybody just wants to feel good
From up on Capitol Hill to the hood
Often times we get misunderstood

And you can't buy it on time

If you're wantin' somethin' old and tired of somethin' new
Come out to the country when the trees are all in bloom
Cleanse your mind, cleanse your soul and give your head some room

Of shame birthed its gift

Than a man
More than you ever were
Driven and burning
To rise beyond Jesus

I'm born again with snakes eyes
Becoming Godsize

I found my life was slipping through my hands, perhaps
Through death my life won't be so bad
I can see you, can fuck you, inside of you, staring through
Your eyes
Belittle your friends to serve me, to suck me
To realize my saving grasp

Her beauty destroyed and turned men into boys drove their senses beyond,

She was my all, I'm a brick in her wall, another book on her shelf
I'd run when she called, summer, winter or fall, I couldn't help myself

It's been a long time, but she's still on my mind, the way she moves should be a crime

Watch her get down (sweet lord) watch her get down (oh no)
And she don't stop, she rock until your eyes are sore,

Watch her get down (sweet lord) watch her get down (oh no )
Maybe you got the shot, but you ain't ever gonna score

She's got the skills, dirty dreams are fulfilled, when she walks in the room
When will you learn, if you play you'll get burned, like a heatwave in June

Outside in the rain, broken hearts cry her name, until the early morn'
She's heaven on earth, like perfection gave birth, let the word be born

With nothing fancy
Nothing much

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Göran Marcusson,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2002
Göran Söllscher,"Words are flowing out like 
Endless rain into a paper cup

Possessing and caressing me.

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Dance before me like a million eyes,

Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Talking perfectly loud

Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

Sees the sun going down

See the world spinning round

They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

Here, making each day of the year

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

A cup of coffee and a kiss goodbye
In a hurry and we always miss
The best part of a morning sky

But here we are eight hours later
At home where the world winds down
Couldn’t paint a better picture
Than the one we’re in right now

You and me in the amber glow
Side by side on the back-porch swing
Watching that ol' sun sink low
Ain’t life a beautiful thing
A little breeze and a wind-chime song
All the worries of the day let go
I’ve been waiting for it all day long
You and me in the amber glow

Long shadows slowly fading
Telling us the day is done
Move a little bit closer baby
This night has just begun

Here comes that final moment
Like a candle going out (burning down)

On the wrong side of the bed
Should have took it as a sign
And gone back to sleep instead

Oh but I just kept on moving
Trying to find my way
Nothing went right
It was one of those day, but

Tomorrow the sun is gonna shine again
And tomorrow I'll get myself a second chance
Take my wrongs, turn them round 
Get myself together 
Give me a brand new day 
And I can do it better

Should have said a prayer 
To start the day off right
Should called that friend
But I never took the time

I should have run that errand 
That my brother needed done 
But I let it go and now the day is gone, but

But she'd rather where cowboy boots
Cut off jeans and a baseball hat

Hey sweet thing let me hold you close
(Hold)
Cause there is something that you need to know
(Hey)
When it comes to lovin' you
(Hold)
There ain't nothin' that I'd rather do

She's pretty as a field of daisies
She's sweeter than watermelon wine
Way hotter than the alabama asphalt
And when I get her in these arms of mine
Lord have mercy I love her kisses
Man I can't get enough

Maybe two and a bucket of wings
And you walked in and changed my mood
In your cowgirl boots and your rose tattoo
Don't wanna be all outta line
But the way you're lookin' girl is blowin' my mind
I'd be a fool to let you get away so I just gotta say

There's a groovy kind of feelin' in the air tonight
It's playin' with the rhythm of my heart
Got it beatin' just right
If you can feel it and it moves you too
I'd gladly spend the rest of this night groovin' with you

So what do you say we grab some beer
Jump in my truck and get outta here
Take a long ride down a little country road
Let the moonlight take us where it wants to go
We can park somewhere and put the tailgate down
Let the crickets and the critters be the only sound
If you wanna hang out til the morning light
Baby that'll be alright

Know that I will give up everything
To make a brand new start

I just sit there in my chair by the window
Watching the lights as the cars go by
Scratching my head, wishing that I

Was a fly on the wall, creep and crawl to you
Listen to you breathe while you sleep
Just a spot in your heart, give it all
Every breath for a chance to be a fly on the wall
Wherever you are

When I get by like an unhappy camper
Think high like 'em to smile for the camera
Pass me a torch, pour me a round
Drinking a drop to buzzing around

Like a fly on the wall, I'd creep and crawl to you
Listen to you breathe while you sleep
Just a spot in your heart, give it all
Every breath for a chance to be a fly on the wall
Wherever you are

If I was to beg, dime to dollar
This book in your bed, warm glass of water
The alarm clocks set for six in the morning
But you can't sleep, yeah, you stare out your window

Just scratching my head and wishing that

And passed out in the tall grass on Portabello Road
Yeah, the sky was alive held you like a gemstone
Got lost on the way home and never told a soul

Now it feels just like it's rainin' rubber balls
You get to run like hell just to watch me crawl
Bet you just can't wait 'til the whole thing falls

And you're, you're gonna be my great regret
Though I guess it hasn't hit me yet
Slow drag on my last cigarette
Just a good excuse to take all I can get
You're the lesson I never learned, you're my sunburn

Sure cuts the groove, makes it hard to be humble
But I trip and I stumble, like a scratched 45
Now it feels just like I'm tied on to a stone
You get to step on a crack just to break my bones
Guess I got my wish, guess, I should have known

That you're gonna be my great regret
Though I guess it hasn't hit me yet
Slow drag on my last cigarette
Just a good excuse to take all I can get
You're the lesson I never learned, you're my sunburn

You change your mind like you change your shirt
You cover my skin so it don't hurt
But it don't work
It just makes it worse

You're gonna be my great regret
Though I, I guess it hasn't hit me yet
Slow drag on my last cigarette
Just a good excuse to take all I can

Roll the bones and double your bets
I got a lot to lose and a lot more to get
Gonna watch it rise and watch it set
Every drop of sweat, 'til it takes away my breath
You're the lesson I never learned you're my sunburn

You're my sunburn
