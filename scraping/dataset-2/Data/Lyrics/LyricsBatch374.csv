Ian Burdge,"I was the one
I who could, pull in all the stars above
Lay them on your feet, and I gave you my love

You are the one who got me started
You could have let me love anyone but I only wanted you
So why did he make me cry
Why didn't you come get me one last time

You'll always know
The reason why
We could've had the moon and the sky
You'll always know
The reason why this love, reason why this love
Ain't gon' let you go

You let me down
Left me for alliance
A long long time ago

You left me there dying
But you'll never let me go

You'll always know
The reason why
We could have had the moon and the sky
You'll always know
The reason why this love, reason why this love
Ain't gon' let you go

You'll always know the reason, why
The song you heard, will stay on your mind
It ain't goin' let you go, no
Cause you have removed the light in the sky

You'll always know
The reason why
We could have had the moon and the sky
You'll always know
The reason why this love, reason why this love
Ain't goin' let you go

Ain't goin' let you go

You have the keys to car

You have every star

Everyone of them twinkling

Thinkin 'bout what you thinkin'

We have the sky fall and I gave you my love",The Moon and the Sky,2013
Ian Burdge,"In Heaven's name why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love.
In Heaven's name why do you play these games?
Hang on to your love.

Take time if you're down on luck.
It's so easy to walk out on love.
Take your time if the going gets tough.
It's so precious.

So if you want it to get stronger you'd better not let go.
You've got to hold on longer if you want you love to grow.
Got to stick together, hand in glove.
Hold on tight, don't fight.
Hang on to your love.

In Heaven's name why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love.
In Heaven's name why do you play these games?
Hang on to your love.

Be brave when the journey is rough,
It's not easy when you're in love.
Don't be ashamed when the going gets tough
It's not easy,
Don't give up.

If want it to get stronger you'd better not let go.
You got to hold on longer if you want you love to grow.
Got to stick together, hand in glove.
Hold on tight, don't fight.
Hang on to your love.

In Heaven's name why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love.
In Heaven's name why do you play these games?
Hang on to your love.

So if want it to get stronger you'd better not let go.
You got to hold on longer if you want you love to grow.
Got to stick together, hand in glove.
Hold on tight, don't fight.
Hang on to your love.

In Heaven's name why are you walking away?
Hang on to your love.
In Heaven's name why do you play these games?
Hang on to your love.

When you find a love, don't let it walk away.
When you find your love, you got to make it stay.
Don't let it walk away.
When you find your love, you got to make it stay.

You've got to hang on to your love.
You've got to hang on to your love.
Why are you walking away?
Why do you play these games?",Morning Bird,2013
Ian Burdge,"In my heart
Your love has found
The safest hiding place
Inside is a field
And trees and a lake
Around is a wall
No-one from hell could break

In there you'll shine
In there you will cry
My heart has been a lonely warrior

Who's been to war
So you can be sure
In my heart your love has found
The safest hiding place

Inside is a stream
Around is a wall
No-one from hell could break

In there will shine
The light of heaven's eye
There you will cry
My heart's been a lonely warrior

Who's been to war
So you can be sure
Your love's in a sacred place
The safest hiding place
My heart has been a lonely warrior before
Who's been to war
So you can be sure",The Safest Place,2013

Ian Burdge,"I've lost the use of my heart
But I'm still alive
Still looking for the life
The endless pool on the other side
It's a wild wild west
I'm doing my best

I'm at the borderline of my faith,
I'm at the hinterland of my devotion
In the front line of this battle of mine
But I'm still alive

I'm a soldier of love.
Every day and night
I'm a soldier of love
All the days of my life

I've been torn up inside (oh!)
I've been left behind (oh!)
So I ride
I have the will to survive

In the wild wild west,
Trying my hardest
Doing my best
To stay alive

I am love's soldier!

I wait for the sound
(oh oh)

I know that love will come (that love will come)
Turn it all around

I'm a soldier of love (soldier of love)
Every day and night
I'm a soldier of love
All the days of my life

I have lost but I don't doubt
So I ride, I have the will to survive
In the wild wild west,
Trying my hardest
Doing my best
To stay alive

I am love's soldier!

I wait for the sound
I know that love will come
I know that love will come
Turn it all around

I'm a soldier of love
I'm a soldier
Still wait for love to come
Turning all around
Still wiat for love to come
Turning all around
Still wait for love to come
Turning all around
Still wait for love to come
Turning all around
Still wait for love to come
Turning all around

I'm a soldier of love
I'm a soldier

Still wait for love to come

Ian Byington,"Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see

You were only waiting for this moment to be free.

Blackbird fly Blackbird fly

Ian Campbell,"Oh what will you give me
Say the sad bells of Rhymney
Is there hope for the future
Cry the brown bells of Merthyr
Who made the mine owner
Say the black bells of Rhondda
And who robbed the miner
Cry the grim bells of Blaina

They will plunder willy-nilly
Cry the cells of Caerphilly
They have fangs, they have teeth

Put the vandals in court
Say the bells of Newport
All would be well if, if, if

And what will you give me

Ian Campbell,"Broken windows and empty hallways
A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen smiles to chase love away
It's human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Bright before me the signs implore me
To help the needy and show them the way
It's human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

No, I think it's going to rain today",I Think It's Going to Rain Today,2009
Ian Campbell,"Oh you are a mucky kid
Dirty as a dustbin lid
When he hears the things that you did
You'll get a belt from yer dad

Oh, you have your father's nose
So crimson in the dark it glows
If you're not asleep when the boozers close
You'll get a belt from yer dad

You look so scruffy lying there
Strawberry jam tarts in your hair
In all the world you haven't a care
And I have got so many

It's quite a struggle every day
Livin' on yer father's pay
The beggar drinks it all away
And leaves me without any

Although you have no silver spoon
Better days are coming soon
Our Nelly's working at the loom
And she gets paid on Friday

Perhaps one day we'll have a splash
When little woods provide the cash
We'll get a house in Knotty Ash
And buy your dad a brewery

Oh you are a mucky kid
Dirty as a dustbin lid
When he hears the things that you did
You'll get a belt from yer dad

Oh you have your father's face
You're growing up a real hard case
But there's no one can take your place
Go fast asleep for your mummy",Liverpool Lullaby,2009
Ian Campbell,"My Donald he works on the sea
Where the waves they blow wild and free
He splices the ropes, he sets the sail,
Southward he goes, in search of the whale.

He never thinks of me left behind
Nor the torments that rage in my mind
He's mine for only half part of the year
Then leaves me behind, with nothing but a tear.

Oh you ladies who smell the wild rose
Think for the perfume to where a man goes
Think of the women, the children that yearn
For men never return from hunting the sperm.

Oh my Donald he works on the sea
Where the waves they blow wild and free
He splices the ropes, he sets the sail,
Southward he goes, in search of the whale.",My Donal,2009
Ian Campbell,"I am a young man from the town of Kiandra 
I married a young woman to comfort my home 
She goes out and she leaves me and truly deceives me 
She leaves me with a baby that's none o' me own 

CHORUS:
Oh dear, I rue the day ever I married 
How I wish I was single again 
With this weeping and wailing and rocking the cradle 
And rocking the baby that's none o' me own 

While I'm at work, my wife's on the rantan 
On the rantan with some other young man 
She goes out and she leaves me and truly deceives me 
And leaves me with a baby that's none o' me own 

Now all you young men with a fancy to marry 
Be sure you leave those flash gals alone 
Or by the Lord Harry, if one you should marry 
They'll leave you with a baby that's none o' your own 

VersionTwo
On a bright summer's evening I chanced to go roving 
Down by the clear river I rollicked along. 
I heard an old man making sad lamentation; 
He was rocking the cradle and the child not his own. 

cho: Hi ho, hi ho, my laddie lie aisy 
For perhaps your own daddy might never be known. 
I'm sitting and sighing and rocking the cradle, 
And nursin' the baby that's none of my own. 

When first that I married your inconstant mother 
I thought myself lucky to be blessed with a wife. 
But for my misfortune, sure I was mistaken 
She's proved both a curse and a plague on my life. 

She goes out every night to a ball or a party 
And leaves me here rockin' he cradle alone. 
The innocent laddie he calls me his daddy 
But little he knows that he's none of my own. 


Now come all ye young men that's inclined to get married 
Take my advice and let the women alone. 
For by the Lord Harry, if ever you marry 
They'll leave you with a baby that's none of your own.

You don’t quite seem to recollect, it’s as if there isn’t a trace
Of all the reasons that I got you babe
All the ways you’ve done me wrong
Maybe I can’t drive your memory
By the time I’m done with this song

She said I got amnesia
No cards girl, I’m no reader

As her temperature gets higher.

Casts a soft and peaceful glow

And her breathing much more slow

Sailing boats and trains
The fairies come by moonlight
To take away her pain.

Trap you with the ordinary
Get your teeth into a small slice

Ian Dury,"You must have seen parties of Blockheads
With blotched and lagered skin
Blockheads with food particles in their teeth
What a horrible state they're in

They've got womanly breasts 
Under pale mauve vests
Shoes like dead pigs' noses
Cornflake packet jacket, 
Catalogue trousers
A mouth what never closes

You must have seen Blockheads 
In raucous teams
Dressed up after work
Who screw their poor old Eileens
Get sloshed and go berserk

Rotary accessory watches
Hire-purchase signet rings
A beauty to the bully boys
No lonely vestige clings

Why bother at all about Blockheads?
Why shouldn't they do as they please?
You know if it came to a brainy game
You could baffle a Blockhead with ease

How would you like one puffing 
And blowing in your ear hole?
Or pissing in your swimming pool?

Bigger brained Blockheads often acquire
Black and orange cars
Premature ejaculation drivers
Their soft-top's got roll bars

'Fill her up,' they say to Blockheads
'Go on, stick it where it hurts'
Their shapeless haircuts don't enhance
Their ghastly patterned shirts

Why bother at all about Blockheads?
Superior as you are
You're thoughtful and kind 
With a well-stocked mind
A Blockhead can't think very far

Imagine finding one in your laundry basket
Banging nails in your big black dog

Why bother at all about Blockheads?
Why should you care what they do?
'Cause after all is said and done
You're a Blockhead too

My reactions are my own affair

Oh Nancy, Leslie, Jack and Joan
I die when I'm alone, alone

Shake your booty when your back is bent
Put your feelings where my mouth just went
As serious as things do seem
At least you've put me on the team
And friends do rule supreme, OK

Oh, pardon you, me
With a capital 'see'
And who would have thought
With a capital nought?
In between the lines

Oh
Spread your chickens when you think of next
What the Dickens if they're highly-sexed?
Through channels that were once canals
Do lift the heart of my morale
To know that we are pals, yes

Oh, vanity fair
With a capital 'V'
You give me a share
You take it from me
Oh, jolly good show
With a capital 'O'

I walked right out with a silhouette of nudes

They think I'm off my crust as I creep about the gaff
But I'm really getting ready to surprise them all
Because I'm busy sorting out the problems of the world
And when I reveal all, won't they get a crinkly mouth?
I've given my all to the task at hand unstintingly
When it's all over, I'll rest on my laurels

Here, for a moment, is a glimpse of my plan
All the kids will be happy learning things
The wind will smell of wild flowers
Nobody will whack each other about or nasty things
All the room in the world
They take me for a mug as I smile
They think I'm too out of tune to mind being patronised
All in all, it's been another phase in my chosen career
And when my secrets are out they'll bite their silly tongues
All I want for my birthday is another birthday
When skies are blue, we all feel the benefit

Glimpse number two for the listener
Everyone will feel useful in lovely ways
Trees will be firmly rooted in town and country
Illness and despair will be dispensed with
All the room in the world
They ask me if I've heard the voices yet
They don't think I know any true answers
It's true that I haven't quite finished yet
When it all comes out in the wash, they'll eat their words
I've got all their names and addresses
Later on I'll write them each a thank-you letter

Before I stop, here's a last glimpse into the general future
Home rule will exist in each home forever

In case you couldn't tell
My given name is Dickie, I come from Billericay
And I'm doing very well

Had a love affair with Nina
In the back of my Cortina
A seasoned up hyena could not have been more obscener
She took me to the cleaners
And other misdemeanours
But I got right up between her
Rum and her Ribena

Well, you ask Joyce and Vicki
If candy-floss is sticky
I'm not a blinking thicky
I'm Billericay Dickie
And I'm doing very well

I bought a lot of brandy
When I was courting Sandy
Took eight to make her randy
And all I had was shandy
Another thing with Sandy 
What often came in handy
Was passing her a 'Mandy'
She didn't half go bandy

So you ask Joyce and Vicki
If I ever took the mickey
I'm not a flipping thicky
I'm billeicay dickie
And I'm doing very well

I'd rondez-vouez with Janet
Quite near the Isle of Thanet
She looked more like a gannet
She wasn't half a prannet
Her mother tried to ban it
Her father helped me plan it
And when I captured Janet she bruised her pomegranet

So you ask Joyce and Vicki
If I ever shaped up tricky
I'm not a blooming thicky
I'm Billericay Dickie
And I'm doing very well

You should never hold a candle if you don't know where it's been
The jackpot is in the handle on a normal fruit machine

Shoes like dead pigs' noses
Cornflake packet jacket, catalogue trousers
A mouth what never closes

You must have seen Blockheads in raucous teams
Dressed up after work
Who screw their poor old Eileens
Get sloshed and go berserk

Hire-purchase signet rings

No lonely vestige clings

Why bother at all about Blockheads?
Why shouldn't they do as they please?
You know if it came to a brainy game
You could baffle a Blockhead with ease

How would you like one puffing and blowing in your ear-hole?
Or pissing in your swimming pool?

Bigger brained Blockheads often acquire
Black and orange cars

Here, pour a locking fluid on a Bentley, 
Then let down his tyres

Start a few more fires

And you know the main objection

With your lazy grace and your crazy face

Flavor of the month, programmers try to dispatch
Always got the good batch, take it to the head
Got you wasted like Jerry from the 'Grateful dead'

Don't trip, get a grip, be strong and don't fake it
Or else you get beat down and stripped butt naked
I just kicked the lyric, straight from the spirit
You can tell I got soul first time that you hear it

If you rely on your skill, then rely on your steal
If you have no ideal or any thoughts to bill
What you sought was real to give 'em slots to fill

Busters stop and yield but I'll daze them
Quicker than takin' a box of pills, now you gots to chill
Get cops and shields, steady, hawk the fields
And they're lookin' for prey, ready to stalk and kill

As I lock the will don't you mock the drill

Got no mercy unless you top the deal
Quit talkin' nil, you won't top my will, bitch

And it's like that now and we won't settle for less
You can't beat the LP from the new Latin lingo
Nowadays you nothin' without a hit single

Time to get locin', put bodies in motion
Hit the stage in a rage and start up a commotion
No, I ain't jokin', see my mic smokin'
I slam it like the art and make sure it's broken
Broken, broken, broken, broken, broken

Ian Eskelin,"Welcome to my big mistakes
Selfish dreams and wasted days
Welcome to the part of me I hate

I come to You with head in hands the little bit I understand
Compels me to confess my wicked ways
I wanna be the man who can't pretend
'Coz nothing's left here worth defending now

Take my life, take it all
I surrender as I fall into Your arms again
Take my dreams, set me free
Let Your mercy catch me as I fall into Your arms again

Soon enough there comes a day
When no one here will know our names
And everything we made is washed away

I'm back again with heart in hand
'cause here's the thing I understand it?s all about
The way we finally break so I wanna be the man
On hands and knees, who doesn't try to hide his poverty

Draw me down to my defeat
Let your grace wash over me
We all need redemption just the same
Let it rain

Hold me in Your hands of mercy
Cover me, cover me

It seems to me a strange thing, mystifying
That a man like you can waste his time
On women of her kind
Yes, I can understand that she amuses
But to let her stroke you, kiss your hair
Is hardly in your line
It's not that I object to her profession
But she doesn't fit in well with what you teach and say
It doesn't help us if you're inconsistent
They only need a small excuse to put us all away

Who are you to criticize her?
Who are you to despise her?
Leave her, leave her, let her be now
Leave her, leave her, she's with me now
If your slate is clean, then you can throw stones
If your slate is not, then leave her alone
I'm amazed that a man like you
Can be so shallow, thick and slow
There is not a man among you
Who knows or cares if I come or go

No you're wrong! You're very wrong
No you're wrong! You're very wrong
No you're wrong! You're very wrong

Were at the best place around

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound

Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds

Ian Gillan,"I used to be a sinner, used to have my cake and eat it
They warned me of my fate, but I was quite prepared to meet it
You'll go to Hell they smiled at me
And told me of the roaring fires
But I was happy living wild
And fueling my own desires
I was a wild man
Drinking, smoking and messing around with women
Lots of women
No, not swimming, women

I wanna go to Heaven
The place to be is right up there
I wanna go to Heaven
It's gonna be good so I won't despair

I decided to reform and pray
Beg mercy for my soul
I prayed in church
Threw away my bad habits
Prayed out of church
Adopted an entirely different role
I gave my money to the poor until I was poor
But at least I ensured that I would go up there
Instead of down below to the Inferno
Where the evil flames of desire
Burned higher and higher and higher

I'm gonna go to Heaven
Paid my dues so I'm getting in
I'm gonna go to Heaven
It's looking good if I abstain from sin

I knocked on the pearly gates
Neatly side-stepping the long queue
Waved hi to St. Peter
Who checked my card and let me through
I smiled, threw my hands in the air
Laughed and got arrested
They said hey man, you're in the wrong place
Your behaviour is a disgrace
Here we pray every hour, on the hour

No party?
Let me out

Let me out of Heaven
I got it wrong, no I can't stay here
No laughing in Heaven
Let me out, I just can't stay here

Well I ran around in the state of shock and panic
This wan't what I expected
Here was what looked like a bunch of manic depressives
Can I get a transfer, I screamed
But no, once you're in Heaven, you're here for good
The good of your soul, but that's no good for me
If you want to go to Hell you've really got to be bad
Okay, okay, I'll be bad
Too late
What do you mean too late
Too late
No
In the meantime

Let me out of Heaven
I've got it wrong, no I can't stay here

Ian Gillan,"It really was a meeting
The bottle took a beating
The ladies of the manor
Watched me climb into my car and
I was going down the track about a hundred and five
They had the stop-watch rolling
I had the headlights blazing I was really alive
And yet my mind was blowing
I drank a bottle of tequila and I feel real good
I had the tape deck roaring
But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn
I went of exploring
I knew I wouldn't make it the car just wouldn't make it
I was turning tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing the bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye

I had started pretty good and I was feeling my way
I had the wheels in motion
There was Peter and the Green fly laughing like drains
Inebriation
The crowd was roaring I was at Brands Hatch
In my imagination
But at the canal turn I hit an only patch
Inebriation

Ooh Mr. Miracle you saved me from some pain
I thank you Mr. Miracle I won't get trashed again
Ooh can you hear my lies
Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes

So we went back to the bar and hit the bottle again
But there was no tequila
Then we started on the whiskey just to steady our brains
'Cause there was no tequila
And as we drank a little faster at the top of our hill
We began to roll
And as we get trashed we were laughing still
Well bless my soul",Trashed,2006

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds

Something in my vision
As I'm walking down the towpath
A feeling of aggression
Emanating from a psychopath

He was coming at me
The kids were in the way
I had to throw them down
I guess they thought it was a game

He was coming at me
He was coming through
Didn't need much imagination
See what he was trying to do

I was in the way
He was going to ride me down
Teach me some respect
This stupid smack head clown

Deal with it your own way
Deal with it tonight
Deal with it your own way
You gotta deal with it tonight

The step aside was easy
And the jab he couldn't see
Laying on his back
He was looking up at me

His dignity was shattered
And the rage began to burn
He started getting up
I thought this boy will never learn

Deal with it your own way
Deal with it tonight
Deal with it your own way
You gotta deal with it tonight

He was frothing at the mouth
And screaming 'bout his rights
So I threw him in the river
And then I threw his bike

About some charge he wants to bring

Don't have to wear my shoes

If we hold on to our tranquility

You had so much passion
Thought you were hip
But you slipped out of fashion

You lost control
You lost your mind
And then you sold your soul

You had so much passion
Thought you were cool

Now you're gone
You left no mark
You're forever in the dark

They burned down the gambling house

Pulling kids out the ground

All the heavy changes she's been going through
All the sons and lovers on her mind
Cause easy money's hard to find

I've been searching
All night long
You know, she's been searching all night long

[Chorus]
Easy money
She gets down on her knees
She's begging you please
Cause she needs
Easy money
She's out on a run
She needs someone can she please

Nightmare rides
A shadow limps across the great sunrise
And steals the hope that lies behind her eyes
In a sense it's hard to find

I've been searching
All Night long
You know, she's been searching all night long

[Chorus]

Easy money

Easy money
She ain't no fool
She's breaking her rule
And she knows
Easy money
She's out on a run
She's looking for someone who shows
Easy money
She's out on her own
She's looking for someone to plead
Easy money",Easy Money,

And you thought you were different but what did it mean
For you tricked yourself trying - life's still unseen
As it is, as it was, as it always will be
Will you find out at all what it is to be free

Just roll with the punches now, bruises can heal
Soften the blow cause I don't want to feel anymore
Just cancel out this fear

For I could not barely stand to see someone hold her hand
I felt I had to crawl away and hide
In my mothers living room I composed so many tunes
All the same - just a frame - for her name, and just to say
Gonna be somebody - someday

Wild as your name I soon left that country town
I been around, seen some fame, seen some ups and seen some downs
Smile through your shock when you hear your name aloud
Its that face in the crowd - didnt dig it - much too proud...

When I was just sixteen I stood waiting for a dream
A barker street bus station non affair
At the time it seemed so sad, but it did not turn out bad
If you hadnt messed me up Id still be there
And I think most folks agree, a little put-down makes them see
They aint no chain - just a link and thats why you made me think
Gonna be somebody - be somebody - be somebody - someday

Ride on down rock and roll
Blow my sweet mind

Said the world is coming to an end
She screamed out loudly

She got me up when I was down
She plays the music and when the music fades

Ian Hunter,"You don't look a day over ten so why be
Do you have to pretend to be older than you are
Beads and mirrors by your body
And in some roadside bar you feel the pain
Little star

Lost on a merry go round, on the game
You can never be found cause you don't know who you are
The reservation killed your nation
And in some tourists car you feel the pain
Little star

You know you know
We grow and grow
We never slow
We always win
And you feel lost
And you feel crossed
And you feel tossed
Just like the wind
Your father will have told you of the wind

Bowed those fine heads that, once proud, roamed the plains
They sought nothing to gain 'til our fathers civilised
And broken hearted arrows roamed the skies
Then you were born to feel the pain
Little star

You know you know
We grow and grow
We never slow
We always win
And you feel lost
And you feel crossed
And you feel tossed
Just like the wind
You know you know
We grow and grow
We never slow
We always win
And you feel lost
And you feel crossed
And you feel tossed
Just like the wind
Your father will have told you of the wind",The Ballad of Little Star,1977
Ian Hunter,"In the heat of the Indian summer
Out along the Appalachian Way
You can hear the sound of the Overnight Angels
As they pray

Charged by the light of some mariners lantern
Spitting out a cold but triangular spray
Can't you hear the screams of the Overnight Angels
As they play

Talking to the spirits through a silver curtain
Reaching out beyond the length of the light
You can catch a glimpse of an Overnight Angel
As he shines

Dancing through the toys of the dead and the living
Laughing at the poets changing their rhymes
Can't you feel the pulse of the Overnight Angels
Beating time

Can you hear us can you hear us
We're talking 'bout the Overnight Angels
Can you hear us can you hear us
We're talking 'bout the Overnight Angels Angels Angels
Children of the junkies led the revolution
Push yourselves over get yourselves there
Someone throw their arms round the Overnight Angels
Cause they care

Angels don't need no phony religion
Throw them out along with the ethnic nowheres
They will never speak to the Overnight Angels
They can only stare

And he wonders if he thinks he should cry
Oh mother the colour's gone and left your hair
And he wonders if he thinks he should care
She told him how to play a guitar
She told him how to be a star
But mother were you really there

My friend don't speak he's such a mixed up boy
I wonder if she sold him his toys
A kiss on the cheek a conversation decoy
In his cute little corduroys
Oh she taught him how to win the game
She taught him everything is your name
Oh mother did you have to destroy
Mother if you really cared
You'd talk to him cry for him
All you every did was dream
All you ever said was be cool be cool be cool
And I think you made a mess of his life

Lost and lonely through the night
My baby doesn`t hear me right
Cross my heart and hope to die

It`s there beneath me deep and strong
And when I speak it sounds so wrong
Oh cross my heart and hope to die
I`ll never know the reason why
You and I were so in love
And if the sun won`t shine
I`ll be warm enough for the both of us
To love a woman

Sometimes when I'm away from you
I love you more you know its true
Oh cross my heart and hope to die
This loneliness is good sometimes
And you`ll return smile over me
And I still can`t say what`s plain to see
But cross my heart and hope to die
You`ll never know how hard I try
You and I we fell in love
And if the sun won`t shine
I`ll be warm enough for the both of us

Just accept me as I am
Understand I'm a quiet man
Cross my heart and hope to die
I dread the day you say goodbye

And if the sun won`t shine
I`ll be",To Love a Woman,1977

I'll see you on your way;
And the sun will rise tomorrow
And wash my sins away.
For I know that I've abused you
But I only had a day.
And I know that's why you left me
In your own sad little way - 
I am gone - disappeared
But I hear a young dove crying
3000 miles from here.

Some would say you were a loser
'Cause you play a loser's game,
But then if I am a winner,
Why then am I so ashamed?
If you hear a young dove crying,
You'll know it's me to blame.
For I never got her number;
I never knew her name.
Now she's gone - disappeared.

So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned

Those were different times.
And the poets studied rows of verse, 
And all the ladies rolled their eyes

Now, Jack, he is a banker, 
And Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money...
Then they come home from work.
Sittin' by the fire...
Radio just played a little classical music for you kids,
The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

Some people like to go out dancing
And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you life is full of dirt.
And the women never really faint, 
And the villans always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
'Cause life is just to die.
But, anyone who has a heart
Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

Why not join some junky jewels, who wreck the clines on canvas fools
Who take the vapours from the mind. Neo nothing. Shallow kind.
A ritzy Nazi owns the game, he plays at God but that was fame
And music masturbates his mind, and stones get rolled up in the slime
A New York butch becomes a blond, while changing gears while from beyond

Work out their ages, turn the pages, caught in cages, locked in ages

Locked away in isolation, trying to figure out why they want to die

Life takes a little piece of you away
Most everyday of your life
Oh learn to get wise, you learn to compromise-
You learn to criticise yourself
I guess we all grow up 'cause one day everything-
Seems so further from the truth
And you try to find yourself- in this endless youth
I said you try to find yourself-and you
Beg a little love

Fate takes another stab at your face
And you can never cease to resist
And you take it on the chin-that old sucker punch again
Reminds you what you've missed
When the colors blazed and your jealousy raged
You were so sensitive to every touch
And it ain't to forget in this endless youth
So you find a perfect stranger- and you
Beg a little love

What do you get in the end
Did you really need that friend
Your emotions dulled to save your heart
From failing at the hardest part
But you still get down on your knees
I said you get down n your knees
And you beg

Now there's nothing left to laugh at
Nothing left to say-nothing left do
There's nothing left-so there's nothing left to ask for
But you still get down on your knees- and you beg

These words are my sacrificial lamb
Burnin' a hole down my heart
Dancin' down that river of no return
You know you missed that boat- but you still get
Down on your knees

Afterall o' those years
Afterall o' those fears
Afterall o' those dreams
Afterall o' those screams
Aferall o' those nights
Afterall o' those fights

When my minds had gone

I'm still a child
And I get down on my knees and I beg

At barker street bus station every night
When I tried to get it on - she just looked at me with scorn - my courage
Turned to dust and I took flight

For those looks they seemed to say
You ain't nuthin' - go away
You're just a face in the crowd so I went home and I vowed
I'm gonna be somebody - someday

Her name was irene wilde - oh such beauty for a child
When she started dating boys - I nearly died
For I could not barely stand to see someone hold her hand
I felt I had to crawl away and hide
In my mother's living room I composed so many tunes
All the same - just a frame - for her name, and just to say
Gonna be somebody - someday

Wild as your name I soon left that country town
I been around, seen some fame, seen some ups and seen some downs
Smile through your shock when you hear your name aloud
It's that face in the crowd - didn't dig it - much too proud...

When I was just sixteen I stood waiting for a dream
A barker street bus station non affair
At the time it seemed so sad, but it did not turn out bad

We used to go out to the track, we'd knock a few whiskeys back
I'd lose my shirt and then I would lose my way home

I was driving my Stutz Black Hawk through Justice in the dark
When suddenly the blood froze in my veins
She was standing by the road in an incandescent glow
My heart stood still, my foot slammed on the brakes

She said, ""Please, please would you dignify my wish?
I'm trying to get to Heaven, could you tell me where that is?""
On a wild Chicago night, with a wind howling white
I caught my first sign of Resurrection Mary

I was trembling like a leaf, I was scared beyond belief
After all my conscience ain't that clear
I used to work for Mickey Finn, I did the numbers for Big Jim
Perhaps my day of reckoning lies here

I said, ""Please, please, I would dignify your wish
But when it comes to Heaven, I'm just a little bit amateurish

I cheated time with Resurrection Mary

And I felt tears form in my eyes for the first time, I felt something
Deep inside and the first time I saw angels high in the air
For the first time in my life, and I said, ""Mary, go to the light
It's gonna be alright""

I got down on my knees, I said, ""Sweet Mary, please dignify
These wishes before you run"", will you tell him I've reformed?
Will you tell him I'm reborn? She closed her eyes
And then she spoke in tongues

I said, ""Please, please, tell me what he said"", she said

They don't cut across race, they don't cut across culture
But we all need something to believe in

Just stay true to your feelings
'Cause one man's god's just as good as another now
Gotta have something to believe in

Half an inch deep and twice as cheap
Oh, give me something to believe in

On the corner dealing
Makes more in a night than I can make in forty days
Give me something to believe in

Looks can be deceiving
Violence rages in abandoned hearts
'Cause they ain't got nothing to believe in

The chill chill is a bitter pill
When it comes to leaving
'Cause there ain't no easy way outta here
When you ain't got nothing to believe in

Just woke up in Sarajevo city
I watched all those mothers screaming
Kids getting shot and for what and for what?
Give me something to believe in

Now there's fire outside, mud that slides
Earthquakes shake the region
Willy and the Poorboys lost in America
They ain't got nothing to believe in

For every seed of knowledge found
For every grain of reason
For every shred of decency
There's something to believe in

Now I lay me down to rest
In the silence of the evening
And the moon road shines from here to eternity
I've got something to believe in

You believe what you want to believe
Just stay true to your feelings
'Cause one man's god's just as good as another
I've got something to believe in
",Something to Believe In,1997
Ian Hunter,"They say that some people never grow up
Lost in time, shackled to the past for ever, stung by love
Still weaving, still believing yesterday's dreams
If life is real then so is my imagination

All I feel is who I am? Who I am? Who I am?
And if I wished so hard I bled, would you come true?
All I need's a bottle and the memories come flooding back
And I see you though the rain, through the rain, through the rain

They say you can never go back
What if my love's still the same?
Still the same, still the same, still the same
Still the same, still the same

When love goes right, it's the ultimate high you can be on
Oh, baby, I've lost count of the times when things went wrong
Bit I pick myself up and I carry on, on, and on, and on, and on
And on, and on it goes

I can't pretend imaginary friends are better
All I know is people change, people change, people change

They say I'm supposed to forget and go on
What if my love's still the same? Still the same
Still the same, still the same, still the same
Still the same, still the same, still the same
Still the same, still the same, still the same
(Oh, baby, now)

What if your love, what if your love is still the same
What if your love, what if your love is still the same

What if your love, what if your love is still the same

Was to lose myself in you

It happens all the time
I never needed anything or anybody
Until your eyes met mine

I'm waiting for your answer, babe
What's gonna become of us?

It is too much to ask
That this man with a past
Could be happy at last
With a future like you

How come new mourners pass you by and think it`s so funny

I`ve looked on hangings `n parades `n city halls
And I`ve seen love in so many living rooms
And I`ve seen rich men slowly die inside their tombs

Have faith in me I said, now, look at time
I know you`re just a victim of your history but
Have faith in me, I said and you would be free....

I don`t wave madly `cos the climate`s civilised

Ain't it a shame when you lose someone?
Here tomorrow, gone today
Wash us away, wash us away, wash us away

There was never a fool like a young fool alone in
A world without someone he can find a home in
And for all the wrong reasons we rescued each other
You bandaged my heart I never would recover (oh)

No river runs true; it always takes a twist
Hearts can be broken, arrows gonna miss
How was I to know that it was gonna come down to this
And wash us away?

And we wrote our names on the Dead Sea Scrolls
The young and the restless, the brave and the bold
How was we to know it was gonna get outta control
And wash us away, wash us away, wash us away, wash us away
Wash us away, wash us away, wash us away?",Wash Us Away,2001

He said, this ain't yours
Where?d you get it from?
You must have stole it from a book, oh yeah

You must have stole it from a book.
?Cause you ain't frail
You ain't beautiful
And I don't fancy you at all

you'd be a ruin

Stiff with rage, screaming at the sky
Innocence breaks
Says she wants to die
I'm assuming I'm alive, oh yeah

I'm assuming I'm alive
She pushes and she pulls
My legs go weak
In fascinating terror

The whole world moves
And I'm standing still
In 23A Swan Hill

And it?s always raining
And you never ask why
You never give yourself a shot
You just sit and watch your life go by

Kicking stones at a still life
Want to pull it down, slash it, slash it
There must be some way out here
There must be some way out here

This ain't right, there must be more to life
Than breaking and entering
Doing people?s heads in alcohol, nicotine
Thinking what I might have been

You would be a ruin
If looks could kill

And the whole world moves
And I'm standing still

People used to stand and stare

You said it was relaxing
Now I walk in the places you walk
I talk in all the spaces you talk
It still hasn't sunk in

Are the words real
That come into my head
On a morning walk? 
Do the shadows
Play tricks with my mind? 

For it feels like
Nothing has changed
But I know it has

Won't you
Heal me? 
Nothing lasts forever
Set me free

Won't you
Heal me?

Heal me

You turned into a ghost
Surrounded by your pain
And the thing that I liked the least
Was sitting 'round hasker street
Lying about the future

In a room full of tears

Ian Hunter,"On a warm summer day, in the hour of my youth
I walked the four miles to your door
You wore a straw hat, high heels to match
And the whitest cotton dress I ever saw
When I tried to hold you, you turned away
You don't have to tell me, it's all over your face
I can see the writing on the wall
And there's a distance in your eyes that says it all

Read it and weep
I can't get no sleep
'Cos I know you won't change your mind tomorrow
I'm sinking under, I don't wanna lose you
This emptiness is more than I can handle
You gave me no reason, but you gave me rhyme
I put the words to music and I was out of my mind
All I've got's the letters that I keep
And sometimes just before I go to sleep

I read 'em 'n' weep
You swept me off my feet
Now I know, time's the only healer
This jealousy hurts
The thought of seeing you with someone else
Cuts like a knife
Into the heart of me

Ian Hunter,"Waiting on an elevator, in a hotel out in California
Smog clouds up in the windows, but there is a plaque up on the wall
That tells of the Agoras, people who were here long before us
Before the covered wagons, before they lost it all

They were hunters, they were fishermen und they often fought each other
But one small tribe was different, their leader was a peaceful man
They were weavers, they were painters, trading pelts for pretty colours
Protected by the warriors for the beauty in their hands
Roll back the years, roll back the years, to the river of tears

The chief he had a daughter, she was young and she was beautiful
He said, ""Go into the forest, get some berries for the dye
But make your way back quickly, for the old bear's getting hungry
I don't want you out there, when the sun falls from the sky""

Her basket filled with berries, she headed back toward the village

When a mighty roar erupted, she ran und hid inside a hollow tree
Shadows were getting longer, the forest was getting colder
And the chief began to panic, where could his daughter be?
Lost in the years, lost in the years, on the river of tears

In the camp the fires were dying when the old chief started crying
Soon all the tribe were crying, the ground grew wet beneath their feet
And the tears they turned to water and the water became a river
And the river flowed like an arrow, to the foot of a hollow tree

And the girl looked out in wonder, as she saw the water falling
She knew it was her father and she swam to his canoe
And all the tribe stopped crying, and the river started subsiding
Into the hill of the Agoras, and so the legend grew
Roll back the years, roll back the years
Roll back the years, to the river of tears

Until you met my drummer on the Grey tour bus

At barker street bus station every night
When I tried to get it on - she just looked at me with scorn - my courage
Turned to dust and I took flight

For those looks they seemed to say
You aint nuthin - go away
Youre just a face in the crowd so I went home and I vowed
Im gonna be somebody - someday

Her name was irene wilde - oh such beauty for a child
When she started dating boys - I nearly died
For I could not barely stand to see someone hold her hand
I felt I had to crawl away and hide
In my mothers living room I composed so many tunes
All the same - just a frame - for her name, and just to say
Gonna be somebody - someday

Wild as your name I soon left that country town
I been around, seen some fame, seen some ups and seen some downs
Smile through your shock when you hear your name aloud
Its that face in the crowd - didnt dig it - much too proud...

When I was just sixteen I stood waiting for a dream
A barker street bus station non affair
At the time it seemed so sad, but it did not turn out bad
If you hadnt messed me up Id still be there

They aint no chain - just a link and thats why you made me think

Hearts can be broken, arrows gonna miss

At barker street bus station every night
When I tried to get it on - she just looked at me with scorn - my courage
Turned to dust and I took flight

You aint nuthin - go away
Youre just a face in the crowd so I went home and I vowed
Im gonna be somebody - someday

Her name was irene wilde - oh such beauty for a child
When she started dating boys - I nearly died
For I could not barely stand to see someone hold her hand
I felt I had to crawl away and hide
In my mothers living room I composed so many tunes
All the same - just a frame - for her name, and just to say
Gonna be somebody - someday

Wild as your name I soon left that country town
I been around, seen some fame, seen some ups and seen some downs
Smile through your shock when you hear your name aloud
Its that face in the crowd - didnt dig it - much too proud...

When I was just sixteen I stood waiting for a dream
A barker street bus station non affair
At the time it seemed so sad, but it did not turn out bad
If you hadnt messed me up Id still be there

They aint no chain - just a link and thats why you made me think

There’s nothing you love more than what you’ve grown

But still, you took the hit and then the shit __ took over your life
Now there is no turning back, smack is the ruling enterprise

Take the wheel I’ll take commands
Now I’ve been walking through the city
Loosing vans and virginities
Be a brave don’t be a slave
Be in control and sing this phrase:
I don’t want to waste this
You don’t understand
I’m in the city and I lost my van",The Van Song,2004
Ian Kelly,"You’re an angel, sleeping,
I give you my life for the joy you bring

Bewildering love, 
The fruit of my wife you’re my endless spring

You’ll crawl, and walk
And if you fall and fall then pretty soon you’ll talk

And you’ll love, and you’ll laugh
When life gets you down I’ll teach you to react
So you can smile back


Where I come from, it’s known
There’s nothing you love more than what you’ve grown

When you’re smiling, I cry
So many words come from my eyes

You’ll brush, and floss
You better roll the stone before it gathers moss

And we’ll catch and toss
And then you’ll leave this home and then I will be lost 
I will be lost",Angel,2008
Ian Kelly,"Brown, is a beautiful thing
It’s a wonderful spring
Am I happy or in denial
Have you left?
Will we face something hostile?
Nature’s theft

While the lakes are drying while the trees are down or falling
Your coffee beans might not be what they seem
While the ice is melting and the fires keep on burning
Will you save your kind?

Brown, is a beautiful sound
It’s a wonderful town
Would you sing something pretty
In my ear
Would you kiss me o so gently
While I’m here

While the ice is melting and the fires keep on burning
Will you save your kind?

It’s the day that you say you love me

All my dreams are in your hands, you’ve been hiding away
You’ve been scared and you may just leave me

I still have faith
There is no one in second place

Would I lie to you, did I ever break the truce?
Am I just another puzzle for your thoughts?
Every day is new, but I feel so used
Would an ordinary love be so
Complicated

Still I hold on, complicated

I remember when we met, how you saved me from debt
You rerouted me from certain death

So I gave my life to you
We’re expecting number two
We have reached the point where I can’t live without you

Am I losing faith?
I can’t be in second place

Would I lie to you, did I ever break the truce?
Am I just another puzzle for your thoughts?

He doesn’t know that you lost your pride on that hazy night of May
You were wasted and they stepped on you
You were tired and there was nothing you could do

All these stories of abuse where minds were bruised they sickened me
I just can’t understand how you can pray on such unguarded chastity

It’s not the sunlight that has changed or the bathing in the moon
It was not right when they explained the lighter and the spoon
But still, you took the hit and then the shit __ took over your life
Now there is no turning back, smack is the ruling enterprise

Weeks on and on, basically, the same day’s different
You use to love waking up to catch the moment
Your Saturday was all about the TV’s colors
Now it’s the day, you wake up just reminiscing…

Will our ship make it through this tide?
Were you the key to me?
Sinking into the sea

Will I be man enough to cry?
Will I get over this?
The absence of your kiss

I can change, but nothing that I do will scare away that crow
It is strange, daddy’s little girl is really learning slow
I guess love needed faith, and my faith needed you
And now that you’re gone I have a whole new point of view…of you

Will our ship make it through this tide?
Were you the key to me?

Ian Kelly,"There’s a part of me that’s made entirely of generosity
Can I be a better man?
Can I go to war and make them understand

What’s the use in generosity if I just keep it all for me?
Can I talk sense into them?
Even though I have a weapon in my hand

Can you take me home?
For a little while
Can you bring a smile?

Can you take me home?
I wasn’t that prepared
To tell the truth I’m scared…of myself

I had to go; I couldn’t say no my country is as mad as the neighbor’s
We are killing for our wealth
We just care about our economic health

It’s sad to say but you and me we are no better than our enemy
We just follow the instructions
That are leading to destruction, so you see

I’m going overboard, the chances that I’ve missed

I used to have ideas not brain storms, my head above the water
But now it just appears that, the rainstorms have overgrown the river

Fame is such a lonely game, forsaken when it’s gone
When it’s on, it can’t last much longer
Pain is for the wiser man, I’m noteless when you’re gone

Where is the color of our peace?

If we’d done what we should we’d still have some balance

We have destroyed what was beautiful
We have destroyed what was pretty
We have reheated the sane cold
Now there is no, there is no remedy
There is no remedy

I’m scratching the surface in a song but the cut is deep
I can’t start with where we have gone wrong, and let’s not seek
Don’t waste my time with who’s to blame ‘cause we are all the same

Close to see the beauty in the spheres

Something like a savior
I think we did plenty of talking
It is time to change our behavior

Always, economy first

A meal, is a luxury item
I’ve burned your lunch in the tank of my car
It’s real, but nobody told them

The game is on or the timing’s wrong
And so you, wrote about it
And now I’ve turned it into a song
If I could see a little clearer, i would have listen to her
I would have understood
If I had given ears to her heart
If I didn't think I was so smart
I would have friends in the neighborhood
I wouldn’t be drinking alone
There is sentimental value
So when I think about you
I feel as if I am the plateau king
When all else fails I know you’re number
I’ll drink and call you later
I’ll tell you stuff that I really think is bling
Cause when I need to, talk about shit
I wanna know that it all gets through
I guess I am an, alcoholic

We breathe everywhere
Has defeated you

We are what we eat, sluggish poisonous meat
How we treat the disease, how we swallow the pills

Do you know what the calf’s fed is that fruit really red?
All the love that you had
Is just left to decay
A religious soul might bring it to the hereafter
But I can’t find the stairs
And a rational blur
is concealing some secret elevator

your joy is exhausted, and your gaze is dull
It’s almost time to close the lid

How can you not tell your own mind

For you’re tied down under the microscope

Who will save a soul like you, made of tears, you are sad and salty

When we couldn’t see

Ian Kelly,"There’s a table in the corner of the diner where I love you more
Than I loved you before
And we are able to get older and forever share a single front door
And never be cold
I swear there is nothing I would do any differently
I swear there is nothing I would do any differently
There’s a light that I keep on at night when I feel lonesome and blue
I feel empty without you
You are right thinking there is just one thing that I want to do
Spend my time with you
I swear there is nothing I would do any differently
I swear there is nothing I would do any differently
I swear there is nothing I would do any differently
I swear there is nothing I would do any differently

Ian Kelly,"Leaving through the side door
long before then end
I need to write one more
Music will transcend

Let it all out
It is such a relief
Let it all out
What is your motif?

Maybe I’m using all the same rhymes
When I write sorrow I’ll sing tomorrow
And the rain gets me going sometimes
Some don’t care, some want to know

This one’s not about lovin’
Nor about your eyes
Beats will get you movin’
Lyrics bring tears and smiles

Let it all out
It is such a relief

Maybe I’m using all the same rhymes
When I write sorrow I’ll sing tomorrow
And the rain gets me going sometimes
Some don’t care, some want to know",Let It All Out,2016
Ian Kelly,"! She has Mason jars for glasses
She laughs at every dog that passes
She has a warm soul

She drops a pin and we all hear it
She moves a pinky, we all see it
She has the leading role

Oh oh oh when I dream about her

 Everything she makes has got a sweet taste to it
Everyone she greets has got a good place to sit
She’s the key to my lock
And we’re a perfect ﬁt

She makes sushi on christmas eve
She has a smile you wouldn’t believe
Love’s got the best of me

And when we’re headed to the ocean 
under a velvet sky in motion
 I’m just a sucker for my baby

Oh oh oh and I dream about her

Everything she makes has got a sweet taste to it
Everyone she greets has got a good place to sit
She’s the key to my lock
And we’re a perfect ﬁt

When I don’t want to give
She doesn’t feel like receiving
When I don’t want to live
She makes sure that I keep on breathing",Mason Jars,2016

In the midst of an emotional drought

But you feel love
When I feel love
And you get scared
When I am scared

I am just a little drop of love
In an ocean of hate, that is my fate

I am just a small amount of me
Against a whole lot of you, what can I do?

Sipping on some wine
Everyone can tell
I already drank mine

Con quien tengo el gusto de hablar 
Solo llamo pa' conversar un amor 
Que quiero olvidar y es que me va mal 
Me va mal sin ti yo me eh sentido 
Eufórico mi amor para ti fue un periódico 
Y solo llamo esta noche para decirte 

Si tu me dejas verte bebe 
Y apagarte la luz (solo quiero verte) 
Hacerte el amor de nuevo 
Si la ves dile que la quiero 
Y que no me la puedo olvidar 
Si la ves dile que me muero 
Y que no eh parado de pensar 

Si la ves tu dile que yo 
Sigo siendo el tipo aquel 
Con lápiz y papel te llevo 
Asta la Torre Eiffel 
Yo sigo el mismo 
La fama me ha jugao con los 
Controles y no llenan este 
Vacio con cartier ni con los rolex 
Te eh tirao al bbm pa por si quieres 
Ser my friend y veo to las fotos 
Tuyas ten por donde estén 
Porque aunque tu me hallas bloquiao 
Quiero que entiendan lo que pesan 
Guardar tus cosas en el disco duro 
De mi cabeza dando vueltas en mi cama 
Me recuerda tantas cosas 
Yo le decía a la gente por hay 
Que eras mi esposa y que por ti yo 
Nadaría de san juan a nueva york 
Hiciera lo peor por eso estoy 
Solo en este ascensor 
Dime amiga como te ha ido nunca 
Tuve la oportunidad para estar contigo amor 
Dime amiga como te ha ido nunca 
Tuve la oportunidad para estar contigo amor

Y apagarte la luz

Si la ves dile que la quiero 
Y que no me la puedo olvidar 
Si la ves dile que me muero 
Y que no eh parado de pensar 

Aveces toy subiendo mi mente 
Van bajando mis enemigos van 
Porque yo sigo trabajando 
Me refugio en el estudio 
Pensando en tu pelo rubio 
Yo saco dos disco antes de julio 
Se que aveces la paciencia se agota 
Mi mente no flota porque estoy caminando 
En estas botas tengo el peso del mundo 
En los hombros míos pendiente a 70 lios 
No se si estés leyendo lo que envió 
Pero cuando sea de noche y te 
Encuentres sola con tu celular tu 
Me puedes llamar cualquier hora 
Y de cualquier lugar que sin duda y sin 
Demora yo te voy a contestar 
(Hello tu sabes donde estoy ,voy a esperar) 
Dime amiga como te ha ido nunca 
Tuve la oportunidad para estar contigo amor 
Dime amiga si fue que algún día falle 
Por eso estoy llamando, para decirte 

Si tu me dejas verte bebe 
Y apagarte la luz

Y que no me la puedo olvidar 
Si la ves dile que me muero

Ian Levine,"Our love will stand the test of time
Sweeter than the honey from the bees
When you're not here, a song won't rhyme
And the birds won't sing in the trees

You can make the sun come out
Without you the sky is grey
And love and laughter is what you're about
So don't you ever go away

Close to perfection
Close to perfection
We have reached a new direction
On our way to affection

Every day can fill like spring
'Cause you have the power to make me glow
Suddenly the bells start to ring
Life becomes a Broadway show

You make music fill the air
Like a symphony of love
I can see rainbows everywhere
Lighting up the sky above

Close to perfection
Close to perfection
We have reached a new direction
On our way to affection

There's a new excitement around
Every time I see you smile
An experience of silent sound
That's with me all the while

You have filled an empty space
Showing me that you care
It's a feeling I won't replace
A lifetime you and I can share

When I was walking down the street

That our eyes were gonna meet

That's when I fell into your arms

So many men, so little time

So many men, so little time
How can I choose?

I should just settle down
But I don't wanna stay with just one man
I wanna sell for what's around
Feels like heaven every night
Being here with someone new
A physical thrill, a beautiful smile
And wonderful muscles, too

So many men, so little time
How can I lose?
So many men, so little time
How can I choose?

So really, who cares about love?
Who wants to feel taken away?
For fifty-two weeks of every year

It's too hard a choice to make up my mind
So many men can turn on my light
Don't want true love, don't want friends
Just give me the bodies tonight

Worth more than my love and affection?

And rush off to her charms
(think it over) haven't I been good to you?
(think it over) haven't I been sweet to you?

He was walking along the road
And I asked him, ""Where are you going?""
And this he told me

I'm going on down to Yasgur's Farm,
I'm gonna join in a rock and roll band.
I'm gonna camp out on the land.
I'm gonna get my soul free.

We are stardust.
We are golden.
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden.

Then can I walk beside you?
I have come here to lose the smog,
And I feel to be a cog in something turning.

Well maybe it is just the time of year,
Or maybe it's the time of man.
I don't know who I am,
But you know life is for learning.

We are stardust.
We are golden.
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden.

By the time we got to Woodstock,
We were half a million strong
And Everywhere there was song and celebration.

And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky,
And they were turning into butterflies
Above our nation.

And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden.

And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time
And I feel fine

Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning
And I find myself careening
In places where I should not let me go
She has the power to go where no one else can find me
Yes and silently remind me
The happiness and the good times that I know, but as I had got to know them

It isn't what she's got to say
But how she thinks and where she's been
To me, the words are nice, the way they sound
I like to hear them best that way
It doesn't much matter what they mean
What she says them mostly just to calm me down

But she's the only one that's out there really dressed to kill

It's too late to change your mind'

In the southern sky

There is moonlight
And moss in the trees
Down the seven bridges road

Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild

Sometimes there's a part of me
Has to turn form here and go
Running like a child from these warm stars

From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair
And walk with me

All summer long
we sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts and the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new beneath the blue
Umbrella sky

Then softer than a piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you I lost you to
The summer wind

The autumn wind
And the winter winds
They have come and gone
And still those days
Those lonely days
They go on and on

It wasn't me for sure

Pillows
Put my feet on the floor
Cut my wrist on a bad thought
And head for the door

Outside on the pavement
The dark makes no noise
I can feel the sweat on my lips
Leaking into my mouth
I'm heading out for the steep hills
They're leaving me no choice

And see, as our lives are in the making
We believe through the lies and the hating
That love goes free

For want of an option
I run the wind 'round
I dream pictures of houses burning
Never knowing nothing else to do
With death comes the morning
Unannounced and new

To pull a little weight,
They forgive anything but greatness

Through Darktown don't be shy
Gather by the clocktower take your seats
Glad you're here it's for keeps
Festering wounds from years gone by
Toxic waste you buried inside
In Darktown
Take a turn step on down
Through an alleyway you'll find
By the backstreet trash resides
The underworld you tried to hide
And from a dark corner where walls loom high
You'll hear the sound of a small child's cry
In Darktown

Proudly accomplished their mission here

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2004
