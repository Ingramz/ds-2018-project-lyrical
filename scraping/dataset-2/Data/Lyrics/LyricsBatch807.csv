Out of Phase,"Nobody gonna take my car
I'm gonna race it to the ground

Like a driving power big fat tires
And everything

Alright hold tight

Out of Phase,"You're lazy just stay in bed
You're lazy just stay in bed
You don't want no money
You don't want no bread

If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw
If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw
You don't want to live you don't want to cry no more

Well my trying ain't done no good
I said my trying ain't done no good

Out of Phase,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water,2001
Out of Phase,"We had a lot of luck on Venus
We always had a ball on Mars
Meeting all the groovey people
We've rocked the Milky Way so far
We danced around with Borealice
We're space truckin' round the the stars
Come on let's go Space Truckin'

Remember when we did the moonshot
And Pony Trekker led the way
We'd move to the Canaveral moonstop
And everynaut would dance and sway
We got music in our solar system
We're space truckin' round the stars
Come on let's go Space Truckin'

The fireball that we rode was moving
But now we've got a new machine
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah the freaks said
Man those cats can really swing
They got music in their solar system
They've rocked around the Milky Way
They dance around the Borealice
They're Space Truckin' everyday
Come on
",Space Truckin',2001
Out of Phase,"People talkin' but they just don't know
What's in my heart, and why I love you so
I love you baby like a miner loves gold
Come on sugar, let the good times roll, hey!

So many people live in make believe
They keep a lot a going up their sleeves
But my love baby is no kind that folds
Come On Baby, let the good times roll
(Let the good times roll)

Ah baby, come on and let daddy fill your soul
Baby, let the good times roll
Hey!

A love is nice if it's understood
It's even nicer when you're feelin' good
You got me flippin' like flag on a pole
Come on sugar, let the good times roll

Hey! Yeah! Let the good times roll!
Feel me baby! Come on, good times roll!
Come on and let me fill your soul
Hey, let the good times roll","Come On, Pt. 1",2001
Out of the Grey,"Looking back on the memory of
The dance we shared beneath the stars above
For a moment all the world was right
How could I have known you'd ever say goodbye
And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain
But I'd have to miss the dance
Holding you I held everything
For a moment wasn't I the king
But if I'd only known how the king would fall
Hey who's to say you know I might have changed it all
And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end the way it all would go
Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain
But I'd of had to miss the dance
Yes my life is better left to chance
I could have missed the pain but I'd of had to miss the dance",Dance,1991
Out of the Grey,"I think you know something I don't
Have you seen a great light?
You hold a hope in your eyes
Like love waits just out of sight

What is it like, this love you speak of?
How does your heart believe?
What is it like to live and reach for
Something you cannot see?

I run in circles searching
For a good place to start
I run into a dead end again
Swallowed up by the dark

What is it like, this love you speak of?
How can my heart believe?
What is it like to live and reach for
Something I cannot see?

Oh, I know I'm getting closer
I can hear the sound outside my door
But can I hold it open now
Hold it open?

This love is like a perfect circle
Having no end, no broken lines
This love is light that shines above you
Uncovers the dark inside

It's like a perfect circle
No broken lines I find
No other love so perfect
I found it in the son

",Perfect Circle,1991
Out of the Grey,"I don't know why I get so crazy as the day goes on
The minutes slipping by feel like wasted time
I get confused, so much to do, don't know which way to turn
I run so far ahead that I can't catch my breath
Time to stop and close my eyes

And I give up on myself again
Help will come, but only when it's in your time
And I hold on for a better day, how long I'll wait I cannot say
But time will tell, I know time will tell

I never measure up to my own expectations
If I can't do it all, must be something wrong
I guess, I wrestle with an image I just can't project
By trying not to fail, I'm getting nowhere fast
Time to stop and close my eyes

And I give up on myself again
Help will come, but only when it's in your time
And I hold on for a better day, how long I'll wait I cannot say
But time will tell, I know time will tell",Time Will Tell,1991
Out of the Grey,"In the name of love
God is reaching down to us
Through the human touch
Something we all need so much
Sharing the embrace
Encircling the saints

All we need is to reach out to touch
All these open hands in front of us
All we need is to hold out His love
Share it with each other for all we need

Oh, the sacrifice
Of letting others in out lives
But when worlds collide
The impact reaches far and wide
Words that love has spoken
Can set our minds in motion

All we need is to reach out to touch
All these open hands in front of us
All we need is to hold out His love
Share it with each other for all we need

You come to us in the name of love
Reaching out through the human touch
Open hands in front of us
All we need, we all need so much",All We Need,1994
Out of the Grey,"Bird on a wire
You're gonna fly to where the skies are blue
World is on fire below
But you don't let it get to you
Arrows fly and lightning strikes
In the blink of an eye you can't think twice

What keeps you up in the air
Trying to live on a wing with no prayer
And what is it that makes you so sure
There'll be somewhere to land after the storm
You must be tired

Bird on a wire
You're gonna find you're not above it all
Maybe it's time to decide
Where you'll stand when the curtain falls
Arrows fly and lightning strikes
In the blink of an eye you can't think twice

What keeps you up in the air
Trying to live on a wing with no prayer
And what is it that makes you so sure
There'll be somewhere to land after the storm
You must be tired
Bird on a wire",Bird on a Wire,1995
Out of the Grey,"You are lighter than air
So high you can barely bear the freedom
To do as you choose
No, nothing gets you down

No boundaries no chains around your soul
Making your own truth
But don't you know balloons never really reach the moon
And even birds high in the sky must come down

With the Gravity
That pulls you to your knees
There has to be a final reckoning
Gravity
You know you won't escape
By grace or grave you'll feel the gravity

When you're nearing the end
Of your journey don't pretend
No, the light you see, it might not be the sun
For your heart will melt like wax

When your arms discover that the wings you've made
Cannot take you home
Oh don't you know balloons never really reach the moon
And even birds high in the sky must come down

Let the Gravity
Pull you to your knees
There has to be a final reckoning
Gravity
You know you won't escape
By grace or grave you'll feel the gravity",Gravity,1995
Out of the Grey,"You said you knew
What I said was true
Your actions betray
No privy to the truth

You caught a glimpse
Then closed your eyes
The seeds I threw
Never grew inside

I thought you'd change
I don't understand
I guess you were just
Pretending

I said I knew
What I should not do
My actions betrayed
The One I tried to prove

You saw the lie
Then closed your mind
And my regress
Became your best excuse

It's hard to change
I understand
You thought I was just
Pretending

It's so easy
To see right through me
Trying to be better than I am
What we need more
Is to be sure
We can be forgiven for
Pretending",Pretending,1995
Out of the Grey,"In the space of the beginning
Was the living Word of Light
When this Word was clearly spoken
All that came to be was right
All creation had a language
Words to say what must be said
All day long the heavens whispered
Signing words in scarlet red

Some failed to understand it
So God spoke His final Word
On a silent night in Judah's
Hills a baby's cry was heard

""Glory!"" sang the angel chorus
""Glory!"" echoed back the night
Love has come to walk among us
Christ the Lord is born this night

All creation sing His praises
Earth and heaven praise His name
All who live come join the chorus
Find the words His love proclaim

Find the words His love proclaim",O Holy Night,1997
Out of the Grey,"You say, you want to believe me
But it's too good to be true for you
Well, I say faith doesn't come easy
Sometimes, it takes a broken heart
To see the beauty of the simple truth

This is what it is
A love that doesn't leave
This is what it is
Forgiveness that forgets

This is what it is
A Savior full of grace
Who gave His life that you might live

So live your life, fill the time
While you hope for something more
Yet every morning begs the question
That every heart has heard
It's something deeper still
You can't put into words

You've got a purpose in this place
This is what it is
But it gets better than this
You've got a reason to live",This Is What It Is,1998
Out of the Grey,"You're the perfect love, you cast away my fear
No more shadows in the mirror
I go looking back, I always see you there
Shining through my darkest hour

And you make me brave, you make me strong
I'm not afraid, you've been here all along
In my weakness, you're my strength
And my song, you make me brave

Lord, I know you go before me on this road
Who could ever be against me?
Every step I take, I know I'm not alone
You're my courage for the journey

And you make me brave, you make me strong
I'm not afraid, you've been here all along
In my weakness, you're my strength
And my song, you make me brave

Living in the never knowing what's around the bend
Even though I know what happens in the very end
Gladly, I can face the ever-changing sky
And it's coming clear that you're coming near and it makes me brave

You make me brave, you make me strong
I'm not afraid, you've been here all along
In my weakness, you're my strength
And my song

In my weakness, you're my strength
And my song, you make me, make me, make me
You make me brave",Brave,2001
Out of the Grey,"Grace, mercy and peace
I wish for you these three
That you may know, they can be yours
From God, our Father and Jesus our Lord

Grace, mercy and peace
What more could we ever need
Oh, but to know this gift of life
Found only in Jesus Christ

Grace, mercy and peace
Are yours if you believe
I pray today you'll know His love
And feel more joy than you can show
But more than these, I pray you'll taste
His grace, mercy and peace

Out of the Grey,"I'm on this journey to the holy land
My heart is searching for a sacred romance
Following the echoes of a love song long ago
I watch for my returning hero

All these diversions and distractions
Leave my desires unsatisfied
Because he set eternity inside my heart
I'll be restless 'til I'm resting in his arms

I'm gonna keep searching, I gotta keep hoping
'Cause I want everything, I want everything
I'm never gonna settle 'cause I want better, I want everything
I want everything he promised me

What happened to the passion in our lives?

Through your head like water running

And I will listen if you let me in

Out of the Grey,"I hesitated for a moment
And now I'm waiting for some momentum
Because this journey comes with few guarantees

Of what happens in between
Between the start and the finale
What will become of me?

I've been waiting for a signal
Waiting for a sign
Praying for a single song with a catchy rhyme

To take me out of limbo

Me the moth and He the flame

Is calling my name

Holding out his arms to me

With all my mind, I thought I could
With all my strength, I did not hold him

But hope calls to the heart of me

I know he is mine but I must believe
With all my heart

And so I'm holding myself open

I'm signing off

We're Almost Near The End.
Well there's a right time and a right place

And a bb gun
Don't shoot your eye
And Kerouac is in the back
Fill the shelf
And clean the rack
It's apropos, what up bro
We on the go
95
Rocking till the wheels fall off the side
Ain't no rims to spin
To my chagrin

And converse shoes.

Outasight,"I wake up, and I can't get my head out the clouds, no, no!
One way or another, I found myself on the
'Cause money sure don't seem to make amend
But the men make the dollar real
Won't let a few things keep me down,
But you sure know how to cheat.
Some days I feel like a bird
Don't mean to think, no, no
One way or another I find the little bases to keep things real out, out
Cause world don't seem to make the man
But the men seem to make the moon

Let me see what I can do!

I don't know why but today I feel

Close my eyes on another day, now I gotta wait and see
Some days I wanna
One way or another I'm gonna reach you

You keep asking for but you never gon’ get

Fix you up when you were broke, truer words were never spoke
I can never be what you family wants, Ivy League, clean cut
Dream house in the burbs, yard as far as the eyes can see
I can never be standing there while you sitting round
Talking to your friends about shit I just don’t care about

No, it’s never enough, you got everything, all you want is more

I can never be the one to pick you up every time you fall

I can never be the one to light your smoke, laugh at your joke
Give you money when you were broke, truer words were never spoke
I can never be watching you with all friends
Talking all that junk again, sorry but everything’s changed

See, I'mma fool for your loving but I had to learn when push came to shove
When you spent my last dollar, don’t pick up my call at all

Outasight,"Caught the train on the later side
Looking for a place with a little bit of life
Been a tough week, can't deny that I thought about stopping
More than once or twice, oh no, some more advice
Keep your head up while you're pushed to the side
And maybe with a bit-bit more luck
You can get picked up from wherever you lie
I know, I know it's not enough, you know, you know it's hard enough
To get a decent chance around these parts-around these parts
I know, I know it's not enough, you know, you know it's far enough
That you can't get there on your own anymore

Hailed a cab on the early side, looking for a train to get uptown

For what can't be found instead of appreciating of what we have around
Or what we have now gets tossed to the ground
I know, I know it's not enough, you know, you know it's hard enough

Outasight,"I think my timing right
They saying it’s important that I live up to the hype
I don’t give in to the fame or fall into a vice
So lemme shine a light on who is Outasight
Used to hop up on the train with nothing really doing
This path that I’m pursuing, well I didn’t really chose it
It actually chose me but easily confusing
And I made some mistakes but to error is human
Wake up in the morning and all alone
Every single night somewhere unknown
Been around the world but can’t find home
You don’t know what you got oh till it’s gone
When you watch the clock, those days get long
Wish I could help but you’re on your own, you don’t know

[Chorus]
What you wanting, what you getting are two different things most of the time
What you ask for, what you needing, hope you getting yours ‘cause I’m getting mine
It’s life or something like it, it’s life or something like it

I think my timing right
Pursuing what I’m doing, not losing sleep at night
Maybe there’s some trouble when you get out of the huddle
And no one is behind you ‘cause they never really loved you
Not gonna raise my voice or even start a scuffle
Under pressure I don’t buckle, just belt songs so what up?
With your mumbling and grumbling, I’d hate to be a fuck up
And I played my cards right and it don’t seem like my luck up
Yet wake up in the morning on the wrong side of bed
Bunch of missed calls, inbox at the brim
One day the future bright, the next it feels dim
You don’t know what you got oh till it’s gone
Three hours sleep but I party till dawn
Hit the snooze a couple times, kill the alarm, you don’t know

[Chorus: x2]

From the moment you’re here to the moment you’re gone
Every second in between to making things right
Or they’re going all wrong, it’s all how it’s perceived
It’s life or something like it, see, it’s life or something like it

[Chorus: x2]",Life or Something Like It,2011
Outasight,"[Chorus]
I said so what? You got a little something on the high end
But does it ever really make you feel good? Got something to say?
Yeah, I said so what? They trying to put you down on the low end
But do they ever really-really feel good? Got something to say? Yeah

What happens when your material things become immaterial?
Does the fear in you bring you the same type of adrenaline
A few thousand hearing you sing or does it bring you to your knees
While you’re clearing your brain? I know I’m after the same
Treading water after every offer that has came
Trying to be myself in the valley of the fake
Trying to fix myself up, every hour could break
And when the times get easier, now they all needing you
Following the leader to the promised land
A modest man I was before, I won the war
And when things were difficult, no one ever gave a fuck
Maybe skill, maybe luck, either way I made it up and so what? So what?

[Chorus]

Where do you go when everyone is gone?
The same people who first appeared when you got on
It ain’t equal to the years that made it seem so long
For you to achieve the damn things you knew all along
And I battled the same, so original, they couldn’t give my style a name
Now there’s a million me’s but only one runs the lane
And scores points with honesty, I ain’t after the fame
And when it came to the breaking point, people raised they hands
So I had to make a point, roll it up and fold it up
I walked into the joint and made it mine and when it boiled to particulars
Getting down or living it up or giving it up
Or giving a who knows, where, how and what or maybe why

I said so what? You got a little something on the high end
But does it ever really make you feel good? Got something to say? Yeah",So What,2011

Who let go with the fear he's holding
Walk down of all his classes
Followed his so called passion

When you start to think about taking a chance you can't give a damn

Huh I'm a hopeless romantic fell in love with a simple idea
With a little bit luck and a whole lotta work
I can make everyone of these visions real
So we don't care what the people say
And we don't care what they want to do
And we don't care about it anymore we do what we want
I ain't wasting a no more time its now or never
I'm about to get mine It's now or never I'm about to get mine It's now or never

We do what we want I ain't wasting a no more time
Its now or never I'm about to get mine
It's now or never I'm about to get mine
It's now or never

It's time to decide if its worth the fight or letting it slide
And I drew the line at wasting away or waiting to be saved
Yay y'all made my own luck in my head on straight and kicked up the dust
And the money well it don't mean much I did it for the love and that was enough
The way I dreamed it ain't the way it played out missed
Every road that looked to be the safe route
No directions I made my way out I don't give a damn what they say no way now

We don't care what the people say
And we don't care what they want to do
And we don't care about it anymore

My baby's drama mama, don't like me
She be doing things like having them boys come from her neighborhood 
To the studio trying to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real

Me and yo' daughter, got's this thing going on
(We got a special kind of thing going on)
You say it's puppy love 
We say it's full grown 
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation

I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson (oh), I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times

Uh, uh, yeah
""Look at the way he treats me"" 
Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass home girls 
Done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle 
And ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speaking no more 
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about?  Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing
So who you placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
You and your mama

Original ghetto bastard, so now I makes a switch
I used to sell dope, but in 1994
I'm making Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
But see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing
About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
She had me making better grades to make a better life
But I never had no love or respect, cause we goin' be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives cause I was steadily in the mix, yeah
It was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now
I'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now
I call the wild because it's time to take the streets
So if you ain't got the vertebrae, ya big enough nuts, retreat
I'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal

Remember at the party when we served them niggaz dandy
They know not to test us, test me, do me, try me

Before I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead
From my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave
You fucking slave, you better try another way
To take me out, is truly something difficult
Don't even run up on me, unless you want your brain broke
I'm out of bullets letting loose my last clip

Steady is the gas nigga, don't fear it and it don't stop",Ain't No Thang,1994
OutKast,"I'll be coming around the ghetto when I come kicking one for the treble
Y'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the devil or whatever
I'm picking up and throwing 'em down like dishes
Call me Kenny Anderson cause I slam those Southern bitches
I ain't bragging, folks dragging me up and down the road
To be fucked up when I gets into my clowning mode
Then go to clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like I was Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggas with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question 'Should we take that bullshit from them people?'
I'm making 300 on my SAT and I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to forehead of niggas trying to serve us
To graduate is really becoming a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is trying to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishing and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly trying to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Stroking like hell without no paddle
But niggas is getting smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is

I hear voices in my head and they keep callin me

As I step, the stage is empty
No words as I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect
Don't call me T, it's a T thing with a G swing
Let my nuts hang down to the flo' main
Smoking that dang dang, making mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me
Cruising down the block, just like I was a squirrel
In a world full of nuts, damn
I'd probably be mad even if I called him Uncle Sam
So bring dough to the Goodie Mo-B
T-Mo, Khujo, Cee-Lo, J and my homie rather be
Don't flex on next, I break necks too
Rollin with Outkast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94
Ha-ha-ha
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?

I hear voices in my head and they keep callin me

Yeah, I'm steady bucking motherfuckers
Not ducking 'em like the goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggas
Squeezin rhymes like that noose around your neck
You can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breaking
Speaking of breaking, break on how to get your life taken, boy
Fucking around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringing the funk with the hollow tips
Player shit is how I'm kicking it
Comin around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a player
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
Shit, that's quickly how I run my shit and that's how it be
That nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, ye
See I'm a player, got my struggle on
Thinking about the volume and thickness of my bankroll
You see that cash is in my shit like colon cancer
Even though I never smoke that shit like...yeah
I give a call of da wild to my niggaz around the projects
So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG, original gangsta, not quite
But maybe when I'm locked up, lifting weights, getting swole right
Life's a bitch with a G-string cause off in your ass with it hey
So you can see who can really hang
But y'all don't wanna do nothing, y'all can go to hell
Ain't no players in office cause I'm locked off in a cell
So can you feel me, nigga

I hear voices in my head and they keep callin me

Khujo, coming in dope, bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe
So don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn
It's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird
K's madness into capping
Throwing to do more load, so my fire looking through the want ads
And only red hot, desire in your pot with something wicked
But you can't feel it, sticking out your monkey ass
I could let shit rot in the past, now it's time to blast they ass
Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scoping, oh my, peripheral vision got it
Made you go on your hoe's bar
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of living is beginning to be a risky business
Unkay, Parkay.
How do you like the taste of hot butter melting through your biscuits?
This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain,
Don't cut niggas I hang with before there were apartments
In Chapel Forest, it's getting horrid
The hunting child is on the prowl, yeah!
I let out a call to the wild
I let out a call to the wild",Call of Da Wild,1994
OutKast,"Well it is I, the pimp playing nigga that you heard about
Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses
I got the hookers on the go and player rhymes that I fuck with
I buy amps that pops my trunk swift
I've been a player since the age of two
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk
Do how them hoe sellers do
See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be
Always claiming true to what I do and then fuck what I see
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up
And make my money 'cause my daddy never showed up
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone
And nothing wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone
Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat
Finger waves and snake skins, shit, I got all that
But you ain't know I'm the one dipping and dodging bullets
The price you pay when you behind it steady trying to pull it
So Dolemite, Dolemite not shit, I studied the Mack and Rudy Ray Moore
They were my idols when I was a kid
From nappy head, greasy face, eating watermelon
To drug dealer, armed robber, now, to big felon

I wonder how you would react if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the players that's in back of me
I wonder how you would react if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the players that's in back of me

All heavenly Father, why do you even bother watching over me
Growin up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten
This ain't no secret garden, so you fly when niggas flee
If it is one of my own, I'm letting the trigger be
'cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me
And then I get a slap of dap when I'm slanging quarter keys
Just trying to make it, then of age, come through, take it
I ain't forgot about y'all women who be working niggas butt naked
At Magic City, shaking titties just to pay the rent
Lord, trying to hustle must be something that was heaven sent
But I ain't got no sense, that's what I got them thinking
I think about payback, strap myself and keep on dankin'
'cause I be taking the rough side of the mountain
If you cross my path, I'll leave you draining like a fountain
Yes it's been like that since way back, in 1975
Been taught to hustle with muscle and even try to strive
So little botty bwoy better say your prayers
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya

I wonder how you would react if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the players that's in back of me

OutKast,"Yes, let me dig into your brain, folks falling like rain
Property got me selling things, guess I'm gon' explain
Jane is rolled up, no gangs be throwed up
But still Andre got action, they Sweat like Keith, all on my teeth
I take it upon myself to handle mine, thinking that you
Got's ample to do this have you shot I thought you knew this
I'm crumblin', no time for fumbling selling my sacks watching my back
Wetting em up like splish, leaving em in a splash
Of blood, the clock is ticking niggas from my block is missing
I'm putting it down like it be hot before we all get shot
Got, only so much time in this bastard
Bitter be claiming broke but I be saying they pro-cras-ti-natin'
Settling for less, bet' be ready
When they roll up in your nest and, sink one in your chest and
You'se gone, up outta here for good
Y'all be bobbin back and forth to let me know you understood
Yeah, whats up

There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (what's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb

So check me out, see
Once in a while when niggas be trying to test me I gets frisky
Grab a pint of golden whiskey then they swing but shit they missed me huh
I'm getting nice with them things, because I do like that
You heard me on the radio and yes my man I'm true to that
I run my lyrics the way y'all wanna hear em
And shoot my dice like it's the brick the way that wall done flicks em
Nigga, so ring around the roses diamonds around my neck from flexing
But I'm running niggas over like a ninety-fo' Lexus, test it
Ten millimeters count em nigga fuck a nine
See I added a millimeter for y'all niggas doing crimes and drive bys
Kiss yo' ass bye-bye, sayanora suckers
I flipped the script and turned the page ain't scared of you motherfuckers
Be bopping shots, like them hoes be popping coochies
And I still be spreading bullets like them freaks be spreading cooties
So look here niggas, I'm Hunting Red October
I said my shit and ran my lyrics and now my verse is over

There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (what's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb

Wooo! Big Boi
Got a type of nugget, blunt box, it's empty
That's where the erb be dropping, it's simply marvelous time is ticking
But some of that time when I be laying vocals in the Dungeon
Sugar Bear and Mon be smoking ounces like it ain't nothing
It ain't shit, to take another hit so hit it
Of the canibus seteva weed reefer yeah smoke shit
It's all day any til they label me deceased
So fire up another one and smoke out and fuck the world peace

We, is gonna smoke out, until we choke out
Like some merry men, cowards I be burying
Coming around my shop with that see nigga you gets nothing
Just like DJ do the cutting I be having your posse ducking nothing but
King Shit, I am asking, sucker can you hand
That player with the pepper throwing salt off in your game
Sprinkle sprinkle motherfucker don't be crying on me
That stuff the sess be in my chest until I'm chilling in peace, yeah

There's only so much time left in this crazy world

D.E.E.P. you want to go D.E.E.P. I'll take ya D.E.E.P.
You know you fucked up when you let my mind creep
Deeper than the page of a book let me look
You let me hit the stage that's when I got my folks hooked like

[Dre]
Deeper than deep dish hammers and vogues
Deeper fish in the ocean
I got my gun I'll stamp out like Coast Guards
You boast hard, you'll get your salty ass crumbled like herb, word (hey man)
You heard it here first with your master plan in reverse
I ain't the one with the curse, so disperse, yes, catching blades
Niggas catching AIDS, niggas getting sprayed, niggason they way
To a dead end, you won't catch me spreading no white thighs
I only see Afro bitches up in my eyes
I don't eat no beef and surely not no pork
I used to drink that 8, but now I shove it down your throat
Quote, 'If they kill they own folks, what you think they gonna do to you?'
I'm Outkasted and claiming true
Aiming two at your motherfucking spine
No, I make that three cause I don't wanna hear you whine
Swine, got my folks blind, like Stevie
Me be, wondering when I'm gonna see the end
Andre 'gain slamming backs like King acts
Over Organized tracks full of facts
So you know that it's D.E.E.P.

[Chorus: x2]

[Big Boi]
Well, you want me to get D.E.E.P., well then, I will
What? What will happen if you shoot that nigga and don't kill
He will come back and return like Lalah Hathaway
Aiming for your skull, yeah I'm flexing on you that a way
So if you pulling a tool, nigga you better use it
Cause if you're threatening my life, better believe I'll be a fool with it
I don't take no shit from nobody, I got's the Goodie Mo crew right beside of me
Damn, no pain, no gain, some I'ma hurt you
Breaking knees and elbows like I used to break my curfew
My mama used to tell me if a nigga ever hit me
Just to pick up the closest thing and knock the living shit out of he
So if you run up, you get done up, I'ma end it
Throw the gun up out the window, see the corner that I bent it
It's just so simple when we get so D.E.E.P.
Learn a lesson, pick up the album when it hits the streets like

[Chorus: x2]

[Dre]
No, I ain't never been pimped by the system
That's because I ain't no slave
Don't be trying to sunbathe, never lived off in no cave
Bloody old chap and in this head of mine is full of naps
And the only thing I know is how to fuck and how to rap
Y'all think I'm stupid cause I shoots 'em up like cupid
And if you gave me a basketball, I'll show you how to shoot it
My head's polluted cause I'm truly bobbin to the bottom
If a pair of Jordan's came out, y'all figure that I got 'em
But no I don't because I don't be having fun
The gold that I am wearing is really made out of bronze
It weighs a ton and making my neck turn green
And I got a criminal record that will never come clean
Oh, and it seems that I make babies like a rabbit
And then never taking care of them has just become a habit
I grab my tablet and get busy with the pen
Y'all could not be just like me if y'all was my twin
So you get mad and try to make me inferior
You pissing me off, I'm in that ass like interior
Oh, step in my Cadillac, let's ride through the hood
Eh, why don't you roll that window down so you can see it real good
And take a look at all the pimps and all the pushers and the players
That's living on a whim, thin ice and a prayer
Oh and mayor, can I get a little backup
Please don't let them pussy motherfuckers put that flag up
But let me shut up cause they say we need dough
Whenever the fuck out record comes out in 1994
Yeah, yes sir, it's like that
Gonna take y'all deep, so go back

[Chorus: x2]

I'm getting D.E.E.P. like a prostitute's vagina
And pimping way mo' hoes than there's peoples out in China
I roll that black Lac with the crust velvet interior
Niggas try to bite their shit, but their shit is inferior
We rolling thick like the Pillsbury Dough boy
And I don't give a damn, motherfucker cause you know why
The Caucus Mountains and the mutant gene
You try to wipe a nigga like me slam up off the scene
You hear me bastard, work a little bit faster
Because of the shit that I done been through, I shall never call you master
You D-E-V-I-L, the cave is where you dwell
So stay up out the rain, it's beginning to smell like dog, yeah
I wonder how you would react if you was in my shoes
You'd probably shit your tightest draws cause I got a solid fuse
So what do you really wanna do when I get militant
Thought I was a pimp, flip the script if you can' get with this
They call me Big Boi, I be capping with a big gun
Run up on it if you want it, then you bite the big one, yeah
Uh huh, can you deal with it, D-E-V-I-L

Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time trying to get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I

I don't recall, ever graduating at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day, I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asking ""gimme some"", living life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit, and I'm probably gon do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though (Why not?)
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you I
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without
Damn, what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know something I don't
Do you have any suggestions?
'Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning
Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
But I'm also sick and tired of struggling
I never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling
Naw, that ain't what I'm about

Well, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you dickhead
See when I was a youngster, used to wear them fucking Pro Keds
My mama made me do it, but the devil, he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking Starters
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense I was Rosemary's baby
And then, I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money, so I never whipped 'em
See all the playas came and all the playas went
A playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit bitch

I'm also down with LaFace 'cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
And it's cool
Yeah, it's real cool, getting paid fat pockets
And all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha

You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time trying to get high nigga
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I

A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
It's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm digging through the ash tray, hoping to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to git up, git out and git something)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Se-dan DeVille, steady bouncing
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
'Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm busting out around the corner in my hog
Dipping from the area, I'm scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead
'Cause I have no time for jail; fuck Clampett cops; fuck Eldrin Bell
And crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country
Thinking that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo, OutKast, a vision from the past
Hootie Hoo, my White Owls are burning kind of slow

You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time trying to get high nigga
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I

Y'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh, why?
Ain't nobody black running but crack-kers, so, why I got to register?
I thinking of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes
So let me take ya way, back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta, ay
Y'all could not tell me nothing, thought I hit that bottom rock
At age 13, start working at the loading dock
They laying my mama off of work, General Motors tripping
But I come home banked like Hank, from licking and dipping
Doing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point, still actin a fool
Wasting my time in the school, I'd rather be shooting pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
Instead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not, thinking about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's fucked up I should've listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talking yang yang, so I payed her no attention
And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feeling broke and shit
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-UT-KAST
So get up off your ass

You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time trying to get high

How will you make it if you never even try

Follow the funk from the skunk
And the dank that is crunk in the Dungeon
It goes on and on and on, like that
Going out to the Jeeps and hoes in the 'llac
Ah Suki, Suki
All day and day, any day, every damn day
I be thinking about the good ol' days when I was a whippersnapper
Used to try to get a kiss, but now it be them draws I'm after
I'm just a Southernplayalistic pimp
I used to sling a fat rock, but now I'm serving hemp
I never even smoked a gram of crack, but yo I'm dope
Mo' doper than a junkie or a Pooky cause it's on
So each one, teach one, I be claiming true
To East Point and College Park and the things I used to do
Around ATL, home of the pimps and the money makers
Club niggas, Magic City and them Southern players
I never said I was a gangsta but I will do ya
So Hallelujah, Hallelujah
One for the players at the crib, drinking drinks
And two is for the sound, Hootie Hoo that I make

Hootie Hoo
Tight like hallways, smoked out always(Hootie Hoo)
Yeah, Hootie Hoo
Big Boi on the left, Andre's on my right
Tight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)

Now playing these bitches is my favorite sport
But ain't no game when they be calling your name in the court
Oh, it's Saturday night, I guess that makes it alright
Got an obese twenty sack, fully packed, it's so tight
That it's busting out the seams, yes sir, I'm set
Oh, but let me tuck the 380 before I jet
Hops off in the Lac with Big Gipp, you got a light (Hootie Hoo)
Communication device dun went off twice
Should I answer the call, yes, I'm macking 'em all
We met 'em up in the mall, recall Player's Ball
Well, it's Player's Ball 2, so I guess I'll call you
Later on, and then your whole crew can fall through
Now later on done got here
I takes a peek, now let me see, what do we got here?
Draws, falling down like niggas in a drive-by
I got up in them draws and I told her bye bye
About two weeks later, she called me with some bullshit
Talking 'bout her period late, guess what I did

No, it couldn't be me. Not me

Yeah, Hootie Hoo
Big Boi on the left, Andre's on my right

Uh, well you know we getting blizzard cause we got that chicken gizzard
In the dungeon and scope but some of you niggas can't cope with it
So, Opie, hip hop, to the front, to the back and it don't stop
From the streets of ATL to the slums of College Park
So god almighty no, it's Outkast for the 94 era
You heard the player's call, we taking it to another level
So 'lujah, Halle, let me get a swallow of that Martel
And you may go to hell

Set sail with a nigga from ATL, Southwest that is
It's that Southern ses in your chest that is
One mo' gen for my friend who don't take
No bullshit from no bitch who is stank
I ain't the sugar daddy nigga who will make you
Silly of you to think that I would, but I will lay you
Down like some bo-los, you can throw those

But if you fall in this category, then you'se a bitch",Hootie Hoo,1994
OutKast,"Time and time again see I be thinking about that future
Back in the day when we slaves up everyone's a cool ass nigga
But now we vultures  slam my nigga back out
To make his ass black out  or even pull your fucking head
To make his whole crew believers  you're harder than a bitch full of dicks
But that don't be sounding like he's shit to me
See now in the ghetto or should I say Lakewood
You better be strapped 'cause them niggas over there just ain't good
Just being a hustler, serving on all your customers
Rent was due on the 1st of the month so I'm hustling
I buy you 50 box of Phillies at the Citgo
And niggas be wanting drinks and shit from the fucking sto', yo
But that's alright, tho', 'cause I be getting paid
And every trip I take, there's a dollar to be made
I'm digging through my pockets for my earnings got you five
Deep, there it is, now it's time to smoke that jive

If you smoke a dime, then I'll smoke a dime

Hey 'Dre, Let 'em know what's up

I've been slipping, slowly but surely
Niggas I used to hang wit wants to act like they don't know me
Come and listen to my story, I gots a lot of shit up on my mind
I wipe the boo-boo from my brain then I finish your behind
Take a number, I caught you in a slumber
I hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer
But now it's the fall, I'm having a ball, making my nickels act strong
To my niggas got to serving when they beep and when they call
I got the Peter, Paul and plus that Mary Jane
I'm rolling reefer out of a Regal, how could I refrain
From being rough, from being tough, from being dangerous
I'm hanging with the P.A. Niggas, ain't no gankin us
See you can try, if you try, if you don't, you don't
If you want to battle, it's either that you will or you won't
See that rap shit is really just like selling smoke
If you got some fly shit, yo, niggas gonna how we tote
Dope, is not what I be slanging on this track
Niggas don't comprehend that it be deeper that Cadillacs
You know that, right, you bite, you fucked up
You won't be getting away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up
I rip shit wit pimp shit, I'm flinging it from the south

Deep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kicking the khakis and Adidas
Packing yo' heaters cause you 'sposed to, cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flow
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
See juice and gin used to be my friend from the begin
And now I'm just a player sipping sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee

Get sprayed like Raid cause it ain't nothing see

Taking em deeper than a submarine

Rather walk with the pimp
While my niggas are at East Point
With that College Park, hemp-smoke style
Is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac

Step up in my shoes you crews sitting on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through

The sun is beaming it seeming
That I glisten, rather gleaming

Young girls thirteen years old
Expose themselves to any Tom, Dick, and Hank
Got mo' stretch marks than these hoes
Hollin they got rank
See Sega ain't in this new world order 
Them experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
United Nations, overseas
They trained assassins to do search and seize
Ain't knocking or asking
Them coming for niggas like me
Po' white trash, like they
Tricks like her back in slavery
Concentration camps lace with gas pipes lines
Inferno's outdoors like they had back
When Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now, believe me
Later on in the future look it up
Where they say it?  Ain't no more Constitution
In the event of a race war
Places like operation heartbreak hotel
Moments tear until air tight vents seat off despair
Them say expect no mercy
Foot you should be my least worries got to deal with
Where my W-2's, 10-99's
Unmarked black helicopters swoop down
And try to put missiles in mines

Who's that peeking in my window, POW nobody now

Me and my family moved in our apartment complex
A gate with the serial code was put up next
The claim that this community is so drug free
But it don't look that way to me cause I can see
The young bloods hanging out at the store 24/7
Junkies looking got a hit of the blow it's powerful
Oh you know what else they tryin to do
Make a curfew especially for me and you the traces of the new world order
Time is getting shorter if we don't get prepared
People it's gone be a slaughter
My mind won't allow me to not be curious
My folk don't understand so they don't take it serious
 
But every now and then, I wonder
If the gate was put up to keep crime out or to keep our ass in

Who's that peeking in my window, POW nobody now

Listen up little niggas I'm talking to you
About what yo little ass need to be going through
I fall a victim too and I know I shouldn't smoke so much
But I do with the crew everybody on the average 'bout 4 or 5
I'm lucky to be alive at sunrise now I realize the cost
After I lost my best friend Bean I recognize as a King
Who am I to tell you to stop smokin
Now you're open to disease and colds
And ain't sixteen years old, this shit has got to stop
Let's take a walk through detox
I want outta this hold I'm in a cell under attack
Lock up folks they in the hood, got an eye on every move
I make open your face to info you ain't know
Cause it's kept low how the new world plan
Reeks the planet without the black man

So what's your angle, try to separate me from the blood
Is disrespect like coming in my home and not
Wiping your feet on the rug
The Citron Absolut has got me bucking no hang with no phony
Look out for the man with the mask and the white pony
On my back are bills staying off my toes always on my heels
Insane, plain, soldiers coming in the dark by plane
To enforce the new system by reign
Tag my skin with your computer chip
Run your hand over the scanner to buy you dish now
No more fishing for your fish
Kiss the days of the old days past ways gone
Mind blown, conception, protection

Could attract too much attention 
I gotta protect my own therefore 
I'm heated just like a kitchen 
Full of pots and pan Glocks in hand 
Shots rung out like ringin' the bells 
And then that sucker nigga ran 
Damn, I never thought that it 
Would come to this conclusion 
The folks that throwed us 
On them boats should be the one's I'm losin' 
But naw we don't see it that way 
In '94 this is the real no time for play play

Do they want me to grab my shit 
And lettin' that pistol go ruck 
See I be gettin' stuck and stuff 
Havin' to knock a nigga out about my clout 
That's not what it's about 
See yes indeed I got that weed 
Like Daddy Q be havin' them ounces 
That nigga the be-I-G be chokin' 'em out

I got that lyrical flow to make 
A hoe pull up her skirt 
I drunk that herk & jerk boi 
Thinkin' of future things to work on 
I got my fuck on and 
Then I took my clothes off 
Washed my nuts up in the sink 
And then I got more nuts off 
Cough it's time to be out 
See bein' a pimp is bein' a pimp 
I'm dirtier than the shit 
On the back of a shrimp 
Now ain't that foul 
The way a nigga can spit that style 
My nigga I spit it I did it 
Now suckas need to quit it 
'Cause it's real

Wearing Nautica V-necks 
And Polo sweats

And that cess off in yo chest

Where we stayed in '93 
See that nigga the be-I-G be-O-I 
That be me 
And when we rock it 
Niggas be jocking just like ? 
You snitch I fucked yo bitch 
See and my niggas G'd that hoe 
On the South side of Camelton Road 
No slippin' in this pimpin' 
She was just a horny toad 
See I'm a mystery like the 
Killing of Michael Jordan's father 
Was steadily packin' the hoes 
When I worked at Foot Locker 
I'm gettin' higher than learning 
Smokin' 'em up and then burning 
East Point is on the map 
And now my clothes is hurtin' 

Now shit done got boring ass 
Molin' when excess closed down 
But niggaz kept sewin' shearin' 
Stirrin' bein' the pharm assistant that missed 
Of the folks but some people 
Tend to joke about this 
But it's really dead spirits 
You can bet my lyrics 
Now ya wonder why that we 
Done stopped and got serious 
Wantin' to know where I'm from 
And where I need to be 
Now that I know comfortable 
Living give me meat 
Can I get back ya wonder why we split back 
Lure us into pitch black dark 
But I sit back and spark 
Another one to leave ya discombobulated 
In that dust livin' in a world 
Where in nobody do you trust 
Then hush never became a major trade 
But us in major trouble 
'Cause we made a too many mistakes 
Off in the past 
Thinkin' you could make it this world 
And now we laugh 'cause it's all faults (Chorus starts here)

That's all I can say, can't tell the future
Tomorrow's another day but today, they just might shoot you

Quick and snappy with a happy face before you bleed
Ask me, if that material shit is worth yo' life
I don't know about yours but if so you smokin pipes right

Deep in the dungeon for these many months
Amongst the Dungeon Dragon as we pass around dem blunts
Had to cut it out like shears, but for years I used to burn 'em
Gettin deep in my thoughts just to get shit off my sternum
Chest/chess, I never played but made many a moves
I still blame it on session cause I can't remember the due
I guess, I feel that gettin a Benz is out of the question
The world is yellin Hootie Hoo but in my pockets nuthin but
gum and lint, to sum the shit, of I'm broke
Nothin but hope, so Big Boi, tell em what you toke

I'm travellin up to Jersey with four keys off in my trunk
And thinkin of startin the ways to get that motherfucker krunk
See yes I be that nigga that with that sess off in my chest
Smokin and tokin them token blacks, that wanted to test
See strong niggaz survive and the weak niggaz they die
I never fuck no white bitch, I stop eatin at pig sty
Be activatin that Lo-Jack cause the Fleetwood has been stolen
Campbellton Road is open, the B-I-G has spoken
Cause it's like this

I got these thoughts, similar to the ones in call of the wild
Up in the Benz is where I be doin about a hundred miles
The world is FUCKED UP how these niggaz be drivin drunk
Vehicular homicide with their bodies off in your trunk
To me the cards is not belong I use that strong arm robbery
Robbin spree, look at me, W-M-B
Backwards, takin you to the cha cha with these verses
Comin around the projects make you sleep off in dem hearses
I got a word of wisdom, for those who must resist
You'll be needin a physical therapist, cause you can't fuck with this

While you sat down by the seashore thinkin about some seashells
I was around the corner from Pleasant Hill thinkin about the V-12
But maybe not for long because I just done seen the light
I'm packin my screwdriver so see I'm gon' be alright
Just moving the steering wheel side to side like a slalom
Now I ain't got no problem I'm just breakin the steerin column
I spot him, in the middle of the MARTA parkin lot
I'm hearin a voice in the back of my head yellin ""Andre stop!""
But do I stop, naw I figure it's a come up
But now I'm goin down cause the folks wanna run up
DAMN!!!

OutKast,"Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold
Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense
That we get em confused
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing
We wanna be at a presidential level, what are we doing?
Fooling our self, clowning our self, playing our self
By not being our self
We can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
Nimrod by the time we forty cause we can't get our meat
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
Look at the picture that's painted
Tainted as the mind who's blinded to the point
Where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fisticuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
It disgusts me to see my folks run up on
I say stand up on deception of time all of Revelations
And recognize this mind on the reality of horror
Known as mankind
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
The Devil say the end is the beginning
They teach that we were the product of incest
Invest no level of self into their system of Paganomics
Stand with us and don't look back upon it
Just face this mind state
Otherwise Babylon

(My memories of yesterday)

""Ninety-six gonna be that year""

I bet you never heard of a player with no game
Told the truth to get what I want but shot it with no shame
Take this music dead serious while others entertain
I see they making they paper so I guess I can't complain, or can I?
I feel they disrespecting the whole thing
Them hooks like selling dope to black folks
And I choke when the food they serve ain't tasting right
My stomach can't digest it even when I bless it
I'm confessing one mo' lesson from the South we in the house tonight
Now hootie who wants to oppose? Suppose
We rolls through Headland and Delowe
Where me and my niggas surpassed the flow
And got down for ours like hind catchers
My mind catches flashbacks to the black past
While my close niggas laugh at
The Southern slang, finger waves and Mojo chicken wings
I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thing
So go 'head and, diss it, while real hop-hippers listen
Started by African Bambaata, so you and your partner
Gather your thoughts

(Something's gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turns my teardrops to rain
Been bearing this burden for too many of my days
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday)

Born Antwan Patton but my partner they call me Big Boi
It's the nigga the B-I-G, be speaking the truth not talking that shit boi
I'm thinking of checking my traps and busting my raps and throwing them craps
Seven-eleven is no convenience, you pumping your gas, they're watching yo' back
For the robbing crew, thinking they robbing you, you must be cautious
To stand up on yo' game and pimping these crows you must be flawless
Like Mortal Kombat, but fucking these wombats got you dizzy
My nigga you know of I wanna be playing but running up on me like you miss me
You catching the wrong vibe, packing yo' shit and rolling yo' eyes back
Flexing up on the corner tossing your dice and rolling your Cadillac
But man it seems I'm reaching out and touching the wrong nigga
Don't expect me to be pimping get your index off the trigger
As we bust, us, we leaving 'em in the dust
So keep that clean up out of your nose I said my piece and then I hush
As the candidate keeps flipping, niggas dipping

(Something's gotta change
Sounds of laughter and happiness turns my teardrops to rain

I really be love it we are gathered to life
So pissed to lather we come clean
Some issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean
Oh like Liberty Bells yes them bullets keep on ranging
On fire like the Georgia mass choir we keep on singing
Bringing our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green
Light and we ain't gon' stop until we hit the big screen
Psych because no one is free when others are oppressed
So, we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest
Growing old

Like some eagles, people don't understand
Just like their parents don't be caring
I'm speaking about you playing with that phony stuff you sharing
In your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches
Thinking you got it, but get it get it, but you ain't pimping no bitches
Cause you flaw, in, falling like leaves into driveways
Isn't it lovely smoking good and sloppy head on highways
Friday's are tight but Saturday just makes it old
Winter night's are hot warm enough to feed your soul
Growing old

See all them leaves must fall down, growing old

Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellow brown

And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
Oh hell, there he go again talking that shit
Bend, corner's like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you bout to see this Southern player serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
Cause when we step up in the party, like I'm out-you-scurry
So go get your fuckin' shine box, and your sack of nickles
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy fat sacks, B-I-G B-O-I
It's that same motherfucker that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Giving the shout out to my Uncle Donnel locked up in prison

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Then everybody let me hear you say O-Yea-yer

Now, my oral illustration be like clitoral stimulation
To the female gender, ain't nothin better
Let me know when it's wet enough to enter
If not I'll wait, because the future of the world depends on
If or if not the child we raise gon' have that nigga syndrome
Or will it know to be the hard regardless of the skintone
I really feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone
The alienators cause we different keep your hands to the sky
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what a preach ain't no lie
I'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
Now breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply?

Everyday I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinking about the second album at the Dungeon shooting pool
Like E-S to the P-N, cause we adjust to the beat in the zone (zone)
Honey I'm home but I'm not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now I'm sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team
And like the daddy's wife you making the coffee
You heard the A-T-L-iens
So back the hell up off me

Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger not to embark
The world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part
God works in mysterious ways so when he starts
The job of speaking through us we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war okay

OutKast,"I came into this world high as a bird
From second hand cocaine powder
I know it sounds absurd
I never tooted but its in my veins
While the rest of the country bungies off bridges
Without no snap back
And bitches they say they need that
To shake they fannies in the ass clubs
They go the other route
Turn each other out
Burn each other out
Where a bona fide nigga like me
Can't even get no back rub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part
But let me hold it down, cause they shut you down
When you speak from your heart
Now that's hard
While we ranting and raving bout gats
Nigga, they made them gats
They got some shit that'll blow out our backs
From where they stay at

Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you, in you

I'm fascinated by the way yo
Nipples peak at me through yo blouse
Freaky me, freaky you
Can't help but be aroused
'Scuse me, Lord lustful thinking
But that's the way we was brought up
Sneaking to watch Playboy at night
We all must be caught up in worldly ways
Chemistry between boys and girls
Is a lot like when we went to the woods
And laid with the squirrels
During P.E., we'd be
Exploring each others privates
Hunching with all our clothes on
Until we felt excited then, ah
Oh now its on from here on out
Put yo hands in the atmosphere
If you know what I'm talking bout
Now if too harsh then walk on out
And I'll see you on the next song
They call it horny
Because its devilish
Now see we dead wrong

Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you, in you

People don't know the stress I'm dealing with day to day
Speaking about the feeling I'm possessing for Renee
Moping around and wondering where she stay
Saw her last that she lay
Give it another day I say
But the lord he taketh away
Now give it back lawd
Cause that's like backboards without the rims
Me and my auntie was tight like Southwest
Before the pinks moved in
Like the niggas who owned the liquor store
Crack cocaine, pimps and whores
Living up on this earth
Before a nigga like daddy was born
But they be making it seem
That my music and crime are a team
But I'm speaking the truth not dreams
So what in the fuck they mean
My lyrics ain't clean

Ooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying

I say ""What?"" ""Big Time got popped in his Benzo!""
I said ""Damn man, I'm riding in his Lexus
I'm bout to dump this nigga's shit in New Dimensions
Get to the crib so I can call Big Slate up
And tell em the money man done slipped and got his throat cut
And everything that we took from the warehouse
I heard somebody talking 'bout it at the White House
Man I thought you said that this job was for me and you
I ain't know that Bill Clampett wanted some too
You tell his folks that I'm sorry bout that Lexus
I'm 'bout to dip and see my sister up in nah!
Can't even tell you where I put my extra playa card
Cause them Red Dog police know we homeboys
Just tell everybody who owe us a dime
It's the ""great ho round up yo money"" time
I got to have mine, then I'm outta here!
Take a loss, come back up just like Coco Grier
Ain't got to worry bout yo' partner getting caught like a lame
It won't be over til that big girl from Decatur sang""
(It won't be over till that big girl from Decatur sang!
East Point police don't know a damn thang)

Yeah, it won't be over, check this out
Can you see what I be hearing talking to spirits when I sleep
Peep this out real quick Slick, we gets on this beat and speak
About that pimp shit, that walk with dat limp shit, that hemp shit
Looking up in your face I see a coward and a dimwit
Looking to run up in my private home just like you was the folks
Serving a warrant to a baby daddy, who didn't come to court
On a Tuesday, April Fool's Day, don't get caught slipping
Leaving the keys off in the ignition, making me guilty by suspicion
Penny pinchers trying to stack for ninety-six
Buying another Fleetwood, Diamond took it, so know we's in the mix
I need to take my ass to the crib and drop the baby off
Cause them niggas at the corner sto' been looking at me for too long
Staring like accidents on highways, high days are better than sober ones
Don't be biased, but I know it has to come
So I put two in the sky to let them know I'm babysitting
Y'all don't know nothing bout Big Boi cause that nigga steady dipping
It ain't over (why that, why that) till the bitch open her mouth up
And sang

Took me a long time to get here
Long time man
I'm talking about, years, and years
Riding past funeral fields holding bodies of my peers
If you don't educate yourself
Now how the fuck you gonna understand how you supposed to get paid?
Niggas walk around get with shade tree ass ways
Fuck a fade, let my hair drag
Back and forth like a see-saw
Jumping Lily, to lilypad dag
Looking to get my Goodie feel
I'm broke in like some old men
Who'd stop dem or would stop
I'm dropping lines for the big plot
Sixteen is when I started this dream
It's ninety-six I'm in your face
Can you hear that bitch scream?

OutKast,"Peep what I say
Everyday the sun sets just like clockwork
To put the Glock to work
And putting the body to standstills
Man it kills me
Taking that life is like taking a shit
Hit or miss, niggas are playing God
Trying to rob and steal
That's why ya gotta guard ya grill
Like a barbecue cause them harming you
Are just like honeybees swarming you
Vocally arming you was my responsibility
It's killing me thinking that all these niggas see they flauging
Thinking they Steven Seagal and balling
Falling to the wayside when ya try to call, I've fallen
When we was little nappy headed niggas in the projects
But now they carjacks, wait on income tax and unsafe sex
Still yet they tend to flex like solo for tha lo-lo
Smoke same thing no-no, not this time
Niggas around my way can rhyme
So fuck that country shit we done a bunch of shit
And yes ya heard of this out of this world like E.T
Coming across ya T.V

Are you alien?
Out of this world
Are you alien?
Out of this world

Right now I'm smiling, taking advantage of this moment
Cause there might not be another soon
Holding on to memories like roller coaster handle bars
Tightly cause I'm slightly off my rocker
But to you I may appear to be your average Joe
But little do you know that even Joe got problems that he gots to joust with
Floating in this game of life despite how out of place you may feel
In this race oh you just can't quit
Ain't that a bitch that be in heat
I'm on the beat like cops
Only cultivate the stable dirt when I skeet my drops
No concentrating knocking other niggas out the box
Why? Cause in a sense see we all be kind of fly
Just can't be scared to spread your wings, head to better things
Maybe the mockingbird and nightingale they want to sing
Keeping this thing alive, to the table's what we bring
We like hailstorms and blizzards in the middle of the spring

My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can’t be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy, chill boi because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that man fuck them niggas I’m going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw em
With these old ghetto poems
Thinking it's better for em
When they can let they thumb down from hitch hiking
Inviting niggas into the temple they call the body
Now everybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes
Even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un
They fucking a different nigga every time
They get the feeling to
I’m willing to go the extra kilo-meter
Just to see my señorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no good ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it’s real Jazzy Belle

See what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw
Having the very best of life lots of steak and Perignon
Smoking an ounce of weed and every single day was personal FreakNik
Freaking these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception, looking into your eyes I see
You weapon and it’s depressing
They're digging up in your thighs
Leaving deposits keep your closets open knocking your boots and drawers
Hoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds
Steadily calling me Antwan
Cause you thinking that you my lady bitch don’t play me cause you’re janky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee, for running that Southerplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame
A nigga don’t even know your name
It’s a shame, you cracking em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up
I’m leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don’t get me see
I gotta be feeding my daughter
Teach her to be that Natural Woman
Cause you’ll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be
Dumb and Dumber, yeah you know what I’m saying

See me and ol' girl, in the black on black 'Llac no star
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra
Strap, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog-eat-dog world
Kitty cats be scratching on my
Furry coat to curl
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to earl
Cause most of the girls that we was liking in high school
Now they dykeing

Having no mercy for the disrespect-ful ones, some
Be hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be asking me all about mine
How she doing how she be
I know she’s sipping that wine
Behind my back they squawk like vultures

Thought provoking, spoken
Words of a chain I don't feel but I see
Visions from me
At twenty three making us free in my community
One day is what I live for
Ain't thinking about no hope no more
I got my boots I kick it till I get with
Adapt and overcome, oh hum hum
Go get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown
What goes round comes round from M.L.K. to cascade
I know its through them plenty figures
Cocaine dealers walk the wrong side
Up in they rides
Looking cleaner then I seen them the last time
Then selling dimes, now its quarter keys, stacking G's
In the South Indies
My nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles
Off in the hood
Knowing each and every nigga sellin', but can you blame
The fact the only way a brother can survive the game
The block hard to get by the dope dealing, fatal killings
In fair times so writing rhymes
It ain't just the police
We kill each other just lost another brother
Fast living will get you took
Thinking it can't happen to you and then it do
Off crooked schemes its just a dream
Floating face down in the mainstream

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the main stream

They swan divin'
Fit they name be thrashing an album
Go-kart rushin' to finish their album then you find them
Lost, dog paddling, back stroking, what done happened?
Be rhymin' catching the day when the recipe calls for black and
Wrong ingredients
Maybe too much herbs and spices
Maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish
Southern greens and this entice them how them joke the same
So I'm gonna sing just like them to get where they at
I'll even break my by back to touch their rim if I gotta
My alta mater be that I follow
I bite whatever that's looking tasty, water it down then swallow
I hope you vomit, won't call no names cause that's not my job
It just applies to whom it may concern you know who you are
But if you don't you never will, you just receive the steel
But then it might get ugly cause trust me niggas do feel
The way that I felt when I wrote this, but we must stay in focus
We kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers
Face down, face down, face down

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the main stream

I let you stay in my crib, now you know where I live
When you was hungry, fed you a hot meal, look at the hand you deal
Me crud ball business giving niggas inches so here, take a foot
Luck only counts in rabbit's feet and horseshoes
Experience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate
I hope you don't mind me eating off of yours
Process momma moping like Jerry
Meanwhile, fairies of the street tinkling pixie dust over greenery
Never to obtain another level of con-science
Only to test, to poke and see
Why laying here, they scheme over one another mouth to feed
? with a decision to make, now words shake your destiny
But a missile will take it all the way just as quick as you can say
I wish I never did what I did now face this bid
It was the company you kept, the many places you slept
When you shouldn't have, geeking like a rat, jumping like a trap
Contributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the court showing paper thin
Got you niggas where they want you again
Floating face down in the mainstream
That's why, that's why, that's why

Think it is when it ain't all peaches and cream
That's why some are found floating face down in the main stream

Everybody's a player, rubbing them Kangols on their head
Thinking its all about your clothes, nigga its all about your self
The way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with
Your friends and family, up and down like hoes give head
To dicks oh, six, serving them in the mix, but ain't no mystery
You know the history about this clique bitch
Oh, what, you want me to call you slut?
Then why you fucking all them niggas letting them all up in your guts
But see that AIDS I'm afraid that's why I play the quiet role
I lay in the cut, every month thinking I'll let that fire roll
Like chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even
My partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven
In the mainstream, home team banging them with these hits
In the mix flowing like some motherfucking swordfish

OutKast,"Me and everything around me, is unstable like Chernobyl
Ready to go at any moment, jumping like a pogo stick
Life never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience
Expect the worse but now I'm pacing, back and forth
Inside I'm melting like water on wicked witches
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
I had the best of life in my clenches, but monkey wrenches was thrown
Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem to long
I fall asleep before the ending, don't even get to say Amen
I hope He understand I be on bended knees
At times, I think I'm crazy, then I say forget it
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and like Riddick Bowe
I've been fighting this since them fetus days
I count from one to twenty, when I'm through, repeat the phrase
It's just a phase, it's gon all pass, but that gets old too

I'm writing this rhyme in faith, so when you hear it, hope you true it
My nigga, you do it like swooshes, the lyrical cleanse and new sense
Wiping away your germs and filling your cranium with juices
See Mo goes on, my slick flow flows on
Straight from west Savannah, Georgia, but the S.W.A.T.S. is my home
Never go wrong cause the click is tighter than gnat ass and that bad
Mosquito, now we goes, ""I'm proud of you peoples
For selling your crack in sacks, I'm glad I'm white not Black""
Shit, on the real, that's how them whiteys really act
When your back was turned, them slackers learned and now we falling apart
You looking me in my eye, but you ain't feeling me in your heart
Yes, yes Lord, give me the power within the final hour

You up to par and ready fo yo lesson
I got an ounce of dank and a couple of drinks so let's crank up a session
Like Tri-City high school, was pulling em in a broke down Rabbit
I spit a couple of words and laying em down was just a habit
Just like Smokey, choking off da pee-wee that we rolled up
Talking about the clique will get you laid down hella swoled up
Hootie hoo slapped ya boys across the cheek with Isotoners
And went to tell yo momma and yo pop that you was a goner
Tell em Big Boi did it, I swear that nigga be rhyming
Every lyric that he spit be turning charcoals into Diamonds and Pearls

Getting paid off what we made when we the ones that's fly like blimps
But ain't no Goodyear, I tell it like it is so I'm like look here
Just willing to get what I deserve my kids to have a mother
And a little house, with a dog in the backyard goin ""woof-woof""
Who knows what I must face soon's I leave this recording booth
Poof, back in the real world where birds fly
From Miami by way of Cuba to whoever wants to get that high
There's clouds of clowns, seas of G's
Pro-jects, packed with playas meditating on their knees
Just to make them ends meet, like ground beef, you won't believe

Enough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction
Speaking of pulling yo' girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches
Every time I rhyme for y'all, I'm looking to prove a point
Kicking a freestyle every now and then

Looking around the SWATS for the herb that's never tainted
Fainted when you heard the bourbon serving on the block
And all you biting individuals need to check yourselfs and stop

Yeah tight like nuts and bolts, sluts and hoes that get evicted
I'm dealing with Queens in my castle ain't worth to risk it
Now tricks be looking at me like I'm they way up out the pro-jects
Can't put you on my payroll, and no I ain't got no Rolex
Or no diamond at the exit with a sign saying ""We'll rap for food""
My face is bawled up cause I ain't in a happy mood
While my partner got the squeegee and the Windex
Cause somewhere in my life I done went wrong just like a syntax
Error, bring the terror to your dome like P.E.

The Pope and his folks got us under a scope
But for unknown reasons cause we don't sell dope
That you distribute, we don't contribute, to your clandestine
Activity, my soliloquy, may be hard for some to swallow

Chevrolets and Coupe De Villes
If you ain't got no rims nigga don't get no wood grain
Steering wheel for real you can go on chill out & still build
Let your paper stack instead of going into overkill
Pay ya fucking beeper bill bitch

Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes ""why""
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I Aquemini

Twice upon a time there was a boy who died twice
And lived happily ever after but that's another chapter
Live from home of the brave with dirty dollars
And beauty parlors & baby bottles and bowling ball Impalas
And street scholars that's majoring in culinary arts
You know how to work bread cheese and dough
From scratch but see the catch is you can get caught
Know what ya sellin' what ya bought so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge now meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady
It's lookin' bad need some hope
Like the words maybe, if, or probably more than a hobby
When my turntables get wobbly they don't fall
I'm sorry y'all I often drift I'm talkin' gift
So when it comes you never look the horse inside it's grill
Of course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it but it's needed so what have you
Now question is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw
So don't get caught in appearance
It's Outkast Aquemini another Black experience Okay

Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes ""why""
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever
But until they close the curtain
It's him and I Aquemini

The name is Big Boi Daddy Fat Sax
The nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets
Cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that some say we pro-black boy we professional
We missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nut sacks
You bust a rhyme we bust back
Get get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts
You hear that can't come near that maybe you need to quit
Because Aquemini is Aquarius and Gemini runnin' shit like this
Yea yea yea yea

My mind warps and bends floats the wind count to ten
Meet the twin Andre Ben. welcome to the lion's den
Original skin many men comprehend
I extend myself so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in wit' yo' kin
Look again 'cause I swear I spot one every now and then
It's happenin' again wish I could tell you when
Andre this is Andre y'all just gon' have to make amends

Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie and sometimes ""why""
Nothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever

OutKast,"Somebody hit me the other day, for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie, and the Dungeon Crew
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew, cause she screwed a lot
Making a nigga hit that chonk, at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats or things of that nature
Had to hate ya player, I'm dicking the ho down never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette, all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty, that was shorty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Beamer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mamma beeped seven o'clock it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her though, maybe she had to work
I caught her in the mall, wearing a real tight skirt
She was, fine as fuck, I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, ""Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck""
I said, ""Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter plus my baby mamma beeped me too""
She said she understood then everything was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Will CD, and a fuckin poster, it's like that now

It's like that now, you better go on and get, the hump, up out your back now
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Llac now
We just, shoot, game in the form of story rap now
It's like that now, it's like that now

Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha, Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy yeah they threw a slumber
Party but you can not call it that cause it was slummer
Well it was more like spend the night
Three in the morning yawning dancing under street lights
We chilling like a villain and a nigga feeling right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite
All of the bullshit we on our back staring at the stars above (aww man)
Talking bout what we gonna be when we grow up
I said what you wanna be, she said, ""Alive""
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown, I came back home
To find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mamma said she with a nigga that be treating her wrong
I kept on singing my song and hoping at a show
That I would one day see her standing in the front row
But two weeks later she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due, Sasha Thumper

It's like that now, you better go on and get, the hump, up out your back now
It's about four, or five, cats off in my 'Llac now
We just, shoot, game in the form of story rap now
It's like that now, it's like that now","Da Art of Storytellin', Pt. 1",1998
OutKast,"""Baby, did you hear that?"" ""Yeah, baby, I heard it too""
Look out the window, golly, the sky is electric blue
Mama Earth is dying and crying because of you
Raining cats and jackals, all shackles disintegrate to residue
Silly mortals haven't a clue as to what the funk is going on
I'm on the telephone dialing the Dungeon (""Hello?"")
This Dre, bring the MP and the SP
Meet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully
Baby, grab the baby, cause baby, it ain't much time
Mama Earth is tossing and turning and that's a sign
Omega nigga I.F.O.s are landing in Decatur
Hope I'm not over your head, but if so you will catch on later
Played the track, guess she could not take it anymo'
Raping her heavenly body like a ho, coochie so'
From niggas constantly fucking her, never loving her
Never showing appreciation, busting nuts in her face when they done

Who says good folks ain't supposed to die?

The sky is falling, nobody balling, they done gave back they guns
For some tickets to the playoffs, but the Hornets, they won
Nigga, we slum, kept all the guns, I gotta protect my family
I drove the biggest thing in the house cause I knew they'd try to ram me
But I'm stabbing, making my way on expressway the best way I know how
Look up in the sky, east, west, no clouds
Him coming now, fuck that money now
I ask my honey how she feeling and is Jordan okay? ""Yeah, yeah, she chillin'""
We should be at the dungeon shortly, ain't nobody on they porch, see?
Approaching the final exit, I'm thinking I see four horsies
But I don't though, nigga you won't know until it's on ya
I put that on my dope boys from A-Town to California
All the weed smell like ammonia but at the Dungeon I know they're smoking
Writing the raps and doing the beats to make this last recording
Fuck abortion, I got in the booth to run the final portion
The beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion

All's well, nothing's well","Da Art of Storytellin', Pt. 2",1998

And to them rudypoots don't attempt to try this at home

But it's back on, another stormy night in Atlanta, Georgia
Overcast, but on behalf of Outkast, I cordially

Bring your umbrella cause young fella it gets no weirder

You are now about entering the fifth dimension of ascension
Our only intention is to take you high
High, yeah, yeah my lord

To make one bob they head would be the track job
Tour job's to spit that fire
Some of y'all MC's take this rhyming for granted I won't comply
With that slacking, popping and cracking 4th ward way we snapping
They won't that hardness that oddness that gets a nigga to start this
What's happening, see if do what yo won't do today boy
Will I live tomorrow like you can't even live cause you strayed
Motivational skills lacking, when I see you nigga packing
Understand that though, you behind a $75,000 car do'
But you still stay with mom though playing the King like Don doe
You chocked up, you was the nigga that supposed to be locked up

And there's a, and there's a fine, line 
Too late to pray that I'm on it
Ya yeah yeah 

Y'all, uh huh, y'all 

There's a fine line between love and hate you see 
Came way too late but baby I'm on it
And there's a fine line between love and hate you see 
Can't wait too late but baby I'm on it
Can't worry bout, what a nigga think now see 
That's Liberation and baby I want it
Can't worry bout, what another nigga think 
Now that's Liberation and baby I want it

(Let me hear it, let me hear it, let me hear those, let me hear those) 
Many times I sit back and contemplate 
I'm fresh off the dank, but I'm telling my story
My relationship, with my folks is give and take 
And I done took so much, now gimme my glory 
To have a choice to be who you wants to be 
It's left up to me, and my momma and 'em told me (yes she did) 
I say to have a choice to be who you wants to be 
Is left up to me, and my momma nem told me 

No, no, no
I'm so tired, it's been so long, struggling, hopelessly 
Seven and forty days, hey
Oh, I sacrifice every breath I breathe 
To make you believe, I'd give my life away
Oh lord, I'm so tired, I'm so tired 
My feet feel like I walked most of the road on my own 
All on my own, we
We alive but we ain't living, that's why I'm giving until it's gone 
Cause I don't want to be alone (I don't want to be alone) 
I don't want to be alone, yeah
Is there anything I can say to help you find your way 
Touch ya soul, make ya whole, the same for you and I 
There's not a minute that goes by that I don't believe 
We can fly but I can feel it in the wind 
The beginning or the end 
So people keep your head to the sky

Shake that load off, shake that load off

Folk in your face, you're a superstar 
Niggas hang around cause of who you are 
You get a lot of love cause of what you got 
Say they happy for you but they really not 
Sell a lot a' records and you roll a Benz 
Fall up in the spot now you losing friends 
All ya want to do is give the world ya heart 
Record label trying to make you compromise ya art 
You make a million dollars, make a million mo' 
First class broads treat ya like a nigga po 
You want to say ""Wait!"" but you're scared to ask 
Ya world starts spinning and it's moving fast 
Ya try to stay sane that's the price of fame 
Spending your life trying to numb the pain 
Ya shake that load off and sing ya song 
Liberate the minds, then you go on home

I must admit, they planted a lot of things 
In the brains and the veins of my strain 
Makes it hard to refrain, from the host of cocaine 
From them whores, from the flame 
From a post in the game 
Makes it hard to maintain focus 
Then from the glock rounds and lockdowns and burials 
The seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts 
Cause it's a hard row to hoe 
If your ass don't move, and the rain don't fall 
And the ground is dry 
But the roots are strong, so some survive 
To your surprise, no one voived their cries 
You got more juice than Zeus 
Slanging lightning trying to frighten 
Plains dwellers, of the Serengeti 
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded 
Melanin silicon and collagen injected 
Dissecting my pride, fool I don't want to get it started 
We be the lionhearted, without a fantasy 
It's like that red sprite, you can't imagine it 
Unless you looking at the canvas of life 
And not through the peephole of mortality 
Single minded mentality 
Getting over on loopholes 
Getting paid two-fold on technicalities 
Clicking your heels, scared to voice how you feel 
Pack the steel 
Picking cotton from the killing fields with no Toto 
I don't we in Kansas no mo' though 
Midwest or Dirty South 
Clean dressed or dirty mouth 
Whether robbing preachers or killing Poor Righteous Teachers 
You a scared demon 
Shouldn't be allowed to spread semen 
And your cowardly lies never defying the jackals of babble 
Running with they pack, tail between your legs 
Though the man on your head say the story 
As you downplay your glory 
Cackling, helping the shackling of your brethren happen 
Just by rapping

Down to your tummy, you wide open, you start smoking wit ya girl

Felines in heat, meowing for some yawn balls

Oh now it's really crunk, cause y'all silly drink
And your girl done got to thinking
She talking bout, ""Girl you look so beautiful""
You say thank you being nice you try to change the subject
Want some beans and rice? But she's back at you like a pit
Mixed with a chihuahua how much meaner can you get?
Don't let her have her way with you she's gonna have a fit
You're the candy apple of her eye and bout to get bit
Here's what you do, you
Grab her by her neck, throw her on the wall

Shit, cops and robbers niggas be bound to get them dollars and cents
They get in a slump like baseball players when they short on they rent

But in the real world you surrounded by these ladies and gents
Who hang around you cause you be buyin all the weed and all the chicken
Feedin everybody, smokin em out
When you was broke though they was missin
Now you ridin bout fo' deep, startin to tear up your suspension
And your baby mamma on child support, my fault, forget to mention
You don't even have a checking account wasn't thinking about no pension
I used to work at Steak 'N' Ale, Old Gold off in the kitchen
Had determination and graduated, now I got the whole rap world fascinated
I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it
Continue to sell dope, it's payin the bills so you gon' do it

We better watch what we doing, and look out for Joe Nab
And quit re-ing up and standing on this same old block
Before our gangsta ass partner get both of us shot
Niggas talking cause they making some flow
But still ain't did nothing that ain't been done before
You can't be trying to showcase, just put it down for your spot
And improvise and work with that little you got
So I think when I finish selling my last sack
I'mma take some of this money, go and give some back
Cause people won't forget about the time you gave, knowmsayin?

But I, was so engulfed in the Olde E
I never made it to the door you speak of, hard core

And the troubles of the day
While this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors
Lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear

Yes, when I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious Angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a Brown Stallion
Horse with skates on, ya know
Smooth like a hot comb on nappy ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter
Than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another
Life into this world

The next four years you & somebody's daughter

Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin that sack, now he's gots responsibilities
Stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work
And she couldn't watch my every move so shit I started servin
Around Frazier Home, down in the West Side projects
Changin over foodstamps, and hittin a lick was next see
I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin, or floatin, a Brougham is what I'm sportin
Sade is in my tape deck, I'm movin in slow motion boi
So meet me deep in the streets that's where I learned the capers
Us lickin blunts, lickin leaves, rollin reefer papers
I'm slightly slouched, in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggas around the Ave. and the hoes, they love me
They wanna be me and my family too
Because the money that I make be puttin cable off in every room
So follow the fiends, follow my lead through the nooks and crannies
It's everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me
But go 'head on, with that foolishness bitch
Let me get lovely with my swerve because I'm true to this shit
And if you comin with eight dollars, you shit out of luck
Because the West Side ain't takin no shorts on the dime
So fire it up

Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
(And it don't stop, and it don't quit, it's like that and ah)

See, niggas in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains
Been doin it for years, so these niggas ain't gone change
They comin around the ghetto so you might call em soul
Been wearin furry Kangol's, so that shit is old
You might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent
Five dollars for a table dance so now your money's spent
You listen to that booty shake music in your trunk
As long as there's that ""tic tic"" followed by that bump
I'm down to stick a ho if she got a G-strang
Cause the niggas in the Point ain't changed, main
You might call us country, but we's only Southern
And I don't give a fuck, P-Funk spot to spark another

Polished to shine, the season to rhyme

Been looking for love, now I bubble like suds

Live high up on the hills, to escape the floods

Baboon on your back, but what's sad is that crack
Was introduced to Hispanic communities and blacks
But then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention
Cause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it
Maybe your son tried it, rehab too crowded

Paper champions, leaving with they feet behind
Zap em for the pumpkin, at twelve
On the bottom bunk, holla at me
Six to the left, last one, can't turn over with dirt on ya
Slain dead, devils, don't have enough to purchase my essence
In the head, missing ounces, zip code, eight miles

And I will pause for your cause

I'll call before I come

I hope that you do too
I'll call before I come
I won't just won't pop up over, out the blue
No after you

I'm a gentleman, I'm a satisfy your soul
And then I'm a get mine
Like Wimbledon we back and forth across the court
Until we give out, do you take it all or spit it
Are you faking the funk and living a lie
Do you really know what it feels like
To have no control over the G spot?
It's like a brand new pair of Reeboks or a junkie freshly detoxed
You feel the tingling all over like convulsions or the rooster pox
I used to not give a damn
But now I make it a point just to please you
So you can go back and tell all your buddies, I Pretty D'd you

I'll call before I come

I'll call before I come
I won't just won't pop up over, out the blue
No after you

Let's see what you wanna do with the Gangsta Boo
Let's cut, nigga, nigga what, I'll cut you too
Coming through in a Escalade limo, tint with shade
Purple haze in the ashtray ready to get a blaze
What the biz nigga jump on in relax wit a lady
Wit a reputation known for sexing niggas till they crazy
What ya mean dog, telling a play like Boo to call before I come
You a game I'm fucking you for fun
Join the bandwagon nigga it's a Gangsta Boo party
Everybody wanna join come and freak wit somebody
Riding Jaguars, riding Prowlers all sports cars
Hitting strip bars wit the top down, fuck y'all
Groupie you need to be glad you even knew me
Do me and tell all my friends my truly blew me
Bitch

I'll call before I come

Nigga you better dial 404-584 well bump all that
But shit you'd better call before you get here and that's a fact
Before you get your feelings hurt
Because you caught me playing nurse
Wit a stethoscope running around in one of those cut shot white skirts
I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't respond to idle wishes
Peeped in the window saw me cooking shrimp
In high heels and washing dishes
For Daddy Fat Sax and it's something I couldn't explain
I know it's a dirty, dirty game, but you should called before you came

I'll call before I come

I hope that you do too

And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing

Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation

Without a paddle, you left to straddle
And ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speaking no more
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about?  Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing

Let these brothers know that your momma she got her house too
Let these niggas know that your sister wouldn't of
Finished college without you

And once I done had some cuervo 'bout six shots I'm nothin to play wit
Like plug sockets and babies, possums, raccoons, and rabies
Maybe lady luscious oba kaybee so they say thee
An old school playa pimp type ass nigga like tony mercedes
And will work every last muscle off in your body like billy blanky

Hello, I'm the man that god made you for
Profound don't think, okay let's put this poetry in motion
I'm shining simply because mother earth I'm your son
Our entire circumference engulfed in emotion

Or was it a pack of now & laters cause

Therefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which
She thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood
Pause, just like a brother with a thousand pauses
Should I, shouldn't I, I cant, I have to, mama will never see me the same
Daddy and Big Mama I know all of them gonna be ashamed of me

As she sits on top of the pale,
Cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house
The unthinkable moments away from becoming reality, sadly with no clue
And no way of expressing her feeling

You suckin' your tooth you treatin' her like a star boy
From a Figueroa to a herringbone
From droppin' her off to takin' her home
She tried to pull my rubber off with her pussy muscles that was wrong

Like smoke patterns, me on my way to Saturn wit a bomb
Numb be it view, or Saudi Shawty
I figure before the first gun blast, they know who gone win
Now won't that make us all fools
Like class clowns praying Private Ryan comes round
Sound travels at one thousand, one thirty, feet per second
Niggaz in the street they want it hurry
When niggaz start biting that's when 3000 starts to worry
A little knowledge from the college of wizard Ray Murray
Answer quick do you know what desire is? ""Huh?""
Apparently not that's why you get what you got
Now answer this do you know what fire is? ""Yeah""
The body of hot, the motivator of pots
Snot, spit, shit are characteristics of release
Ask your niece or nephew, you think we left you
What the future holds in its sweaty palms

White blood cell to the common cold rebel

We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade

Look at the way you look at me I see it on your face
All your hate emanates but you still hesitate
Cause you want inside of my head but don't know how
To brainwash me to be a commercial clown
Fuck that I see the way you were,
see the way you smirk I'm catching you where you work
God only knows all the trouble that grows
Deep beneath my soul dealing with you assholes
Can I blast those who point the finger at me
Who criticize and talk shit so freely
Fuck XXL you're a size too small
I should hire Eminem so we can kill you all
Whether you live to talk shit about the Real
Then kiss my ass in person how much you love the Hill
I'm the outcast comin to blaze the grass
Outlaw due to my life that's come to pass
Dre, pass me the glass of wine
So I can pour it over my homies grave and mine
For all those who fallen and answered when God was calling
Jump into my ragtop and get all in
I'm the bomb, planted in your car why you frozen
Pop the tape in ignite the xplosion
The world is mine, the world is yours, the world is ours
The world is lost, the world is tossed

We just can't be amazed
Even if you pull the pin from your hand grenade
And we some home-made bombs
Finna blow right up in your face

With a one-two punch, B-Real and Andre dropped they verses
Your homeboy Daddy Fat Sax playin clean-up so it worsens
People and persons on the opposite teams oh, yes its curtains
No bullets burpin' oh just lyrically twerking
Making a statement, when you freestyle
and your mind is in a free state
Is kinda hard to execute when you ain't feeling it that day
Jumpin the gun and rushing your flow
Babbling on the mikie like auctioneer, got the public's ears
Fucked up can't hear, Atlanta, Georgia where y'all at?
OutKast this Dirty South to death the Dungeon Family Camp
Got this thang lit like stamps and nine-volt battery end caps

And like want to be from the country and everything like that 
You know, like really like the south is like 
It's cool to be from the South right about now

Wise goes the neighborhood hand-me-downs and canned goods Won't cut the Grey Poupon we got that make you run 
Back to the drawing board can't afford to lose y'all make me yawn 
One slash one slash ninety-one 
My teacher sees potential in me says sit down son 
Now let me tell you like I heard it, when I felt deserted 
It wasn't no other way to word it got my feelings murdered

To the studio trying to fight me
She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I pay that
I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

You say it's puppy love 
We say it's full grown 
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin; fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
Become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads
It happened for a reason one can't be, mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation

Shit, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass home girls 
Done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle 
And ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speaking no more 
Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking about?  Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing
So who you placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on

Intergalactic tracks, I make 'em like magstrulium

We're talking about sons and daughters boy, not roots and clones

An embryo with no soul
Stuck in this green mini-van with my lungs in a choke hold

Daphne said, ""Don't do that""
Freaky Fred smashed the gas and slammed us into traffic

Call Vincent Price up on the Nextel
Tell him to send another package right through the mail

To get the Mystery Machine ready
I'm two-wayin' Daphne and Freddy
Me and Shaggy dressed in all black, strapped
Dippin' through the flash, tryin' to get our stash back
Roundin' up suspects, collectin' clues
I got a question, where the hell is Scooby-Doo when you need 'em
The hound's only found when you feed him
In fact he probably got my sack
Tell him holler back

Step into the realms O's space where nobody goes
Only the baddest motherfuckers are the ones that are chose!
Some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said
Best believe that we can buck or give a damn if we cared!
No collision supervision but my family is here
Now my mama taught my niggas that was under the stairs
One of those who chauffeured life and then was unprepared
But my hunger is the thought that no wonder it can't be smothered
Or buttered up, buttercup, melt your sauce
You a Chucky Cheese bouncer chumpin' off the boss
What I'm trying to tell you now is that you're softer that soft
And I'm sick as a cough, did I mention it's raw?
Your predicaments flaw
Flaw means fucked up and serving out the oven not fried, slow roast
No coast, tuck your tail and hide!
You scared?

(Give to you and I do what it takes!
To give it to you!)

I officially do it with guns on tour
We lock down traps, push caps galore
My wiz cook work 'til it scale like fish
My old earth even known to handle biz
I serve whipped, out of whips, whip out cash
Usually keep a G packed under the dash
Try to test my gangsta, I bring harm
I'm as slick as Freeway Rick and Nicholas Barnes
My uptown knights hold caps and cheddar
My waistline hold a 4-pound Baretta
I'll shoe lace your face just to learn you better
My ox so sharp it cut through leather
My rap name Killer, my street name Skunk
I mastered the music that was born in the Bronx!
I switch my slang spit from my mouth
I'm still all coast, my coast the South!

My bank account is frozen, I
Don't think that I can get out this hole
Feel like the figure four leg lock
Like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked
I can't move, I can't eat, I can't even breathe
Can't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds
No trees, no P's to ease the stress of everyday living
But homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they living
The unforgiven or the unwilling, live a life of sinning
And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginning

But what about repentance?
What about the tension?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
But what about repentance?
What about committing the same sin
Over and over again and again and ah

Why are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Please tell me, what are we here for?

Life, is nothing but a dream, so peaceful and serene
Unless you're being evil then you on the devil's team
Well I receive what you want to believe
But soon you'll have to sew those bad seeds
Please, any man can ask, to get a pass
Or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance
Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle
Whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle
Because he who lives in the upper room is never gullible
As you survey the syllables and sentences
The question that I'm merely trying to pose is as simple as me saying

But what about repentance?
What about the tension?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
But what about repentance?
What about committing the same sin
Over and over again and again and ah

Below I know I love her, but act like I don't want her
Surrounded by the lonely, but yet feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor
The way I give up my heart, but
Never know because shit, I never tell her!
Ask me how I'm feelings I'd holla' that it's irrela'
I don't get myself caught up in the Jello gella'
And puddin' pops, that others opt to call falling in love, but
For the record, have you ever rode a horse?
Like for you to take me to Pluto?
I said, ""Of course!""
But if you ain't a sweety indeedy, I won't endorse
Hans Solo till I'm hit by the bullet, so may the force
Be with you, and I'll hit you when better time permits
For now, show me samples, examples of why you're the shit!
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?
And if you do not know me, then how could you be my friend?

Something to make you ponder
The situation's ugly, like ""In Living Color""'s Wanda (word up!)
Well everybody play dumb, but there's some that succumb

And fall victim, I will overcome any hurdle or obstacle that's in my path
Fast cash should be the last resort so make it last for the risk you took
Trick, you shook your ass for some hundred dollar heels and a designer bag
Now that's ass backwards

All you got in the frigerator is bratwurst
Your stomach is balled in a knot, you got that phat purse
Pocketbook, stop and look, pockets look void
Destroyed by the need to indulge and enjoy the finer things in life right?

Your dignity, your only sacrifice, slim as your chances of being somebody's wife

Even though things started falling apart
Wanda went and bought a Honda
Now she's out of a job, she would slob on a knob
For a little less than a yard, a massage you could drill her like a sarge

She would charge and rob
Pick through yo' pockets
She got the tricks watch and the silver locket
That he bought for his wife but Wanda left her license

On the night stand fuckin' with this white man
She met in a little red Corvette, paid for sex
Made a deal that she would never forge,t you can bet
Every action has a positive and equal reaction

Therefore everything that goes around comes around in that fashion
Fast and furiously, the was a knock on the sliding glass door (bitch, it's me!)

But you slipped now I'm getting in your shit!

We starting hanging like Ernie and Bert
And in my idle head I'm thinking cool
Just when I'm thinking I'm going down your shirt
You're hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me folly if your hometown would be
Heaven or hell
The angelic nastiness you possess made you by far the best
Therefore hard to tell
You dropped me off by the dungeon
Never came in, but I knew that you were wondering
Now are these niggas in this house up to something
Selling cracks sack by sack so they could function?
Well, yes and no
Yes we were selling it
But no it wasn't blow
Cook it in the basement then move it at a show
Then grab the microphone and everybody yelled ho
Meanwhile the video starts playing
BET college radio and a van
Pack full of niggas with a blunt in their hand
And one in their ear
You know what I'm saying
But, I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chip flip with the roam roam
So it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home
But, when I got home I never did
By the time I did, heard that you had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur
Who replied see you later when he got the good news, that's life shit
Now, I'm nineteen with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold ?
Got a plaque but I'm living with my pop pop
So I got glock and a low jack
You kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw
And never said much ?cause half of what he saw
Was so far from that place you want to be
That words only fucked it up more follow me
Are you starting to gather what I'm getting at?
Now if I'm losing you tell me then I'll double back
But keep in mind, at the time keep it real was the phrase
Silly once said now, but those were the days
When spring break
And Daytona
And Freakniks
Made you want to
Drop out of college and never go back
Move to the south but that ain't a Kodiac
Moment, on went myself and big boi
Well you knew him as Twan
That's right you were around before this shit begun
When Twan had a daughter and
Sort of was made to mature before the first tour
We hit the road like jack
Laughed and cried and drive it back with some Yak
Girls used to say, y'all talk funny, y'all from the islands?
Laughed and they just keep smiling
No, I'm from Atlanta baby
He from Savannah, maybe
We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down hey we
Got to go because the bus is pulling out in 30 minutes
She's playing tennis disturbing the tenants
15-love
Fit like glove
Description is like
15 doves
In a Jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost
Making one woozy in the head in come a toast, agree?
Enough about me
How's about you?
How's the lil' kid?
She was about 2 the last time we spoke
I hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink
Cause I started the second album off on another note
Now, that note threw some niggas in the hood off
But see I'd balled out, and before I fall I'd
Slow my Lac down to a nice speed
The brain is that fried egg I might need
New direction was apparent
I was a child looking at the floor staring
So changing my style was like release for the primitive beast
Yes I was on the rise, yeast was the street
To make bread-Never primary concern
Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn
I'd meet Muslims, gangsters, bitches, rastas, and macoroni niggas ? impostors
So on a trip to New York on some biz wax
I get invited to a club where emcees at
And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head
Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with
Which I was rocking at the time
When I was going through them phases trying to find
Anything that seemed real in this world
Still searching, but I started liking this girl
Now you know her
As Erykah on and on Badu
Call Tyrone on the phone why you
Do that girl like that boy you ought to be ashamed
The song wasn't about me and that ain't my name
We're young, in love, in short we had fun
No regrets no abortion, had a son
By the name of Seven
And he's five
By the time I do this mix, he'll probably be six
You do the arithmetic
Me do the language arts
Y'all stand against the wall blindfolded me throw the darts
To poke you in the heart
And take you from the start
To one luxury transportation in a Marta car
Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays
Momma or her daddy let her borrow the Benz because she's smart
Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor
And he sells you that rabbit that's been sitting in his yard
You fix it up, you trick it out, you give it rims, you give it bump
You give it all your time because that's all you can think about
And that's as far as I got",A Life in the Day of Benjamin André (Incomplete),2003

You must begin to fend for self when the umbilical's cut
The doctor put you under the heating lamp, your spirit is touched
You know what, I take that back, why? You was alive

From T 'n A to DNA, feelings turn to children
The morning after pill didn't put a halt to our very existence

But parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages

You can handle if tomorrow never comes, right

And I couldn't have wrote this if I was hopeless
And see I focus to provoke this

`Cause my baby mama left me
Now there's nobody at home
Beginning to feel like Ms. Jackson done got cloned!
Well it's some real shit and I'm lving it through this song!
A moving vehicle took my family
As I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room
I woke up very upset!
I throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies
My daughter, my baby, my baby mama all escaping me!
In the wind, she was my friend
Like Princess Di before she died
Therefore we tried and tried again
But in the end you pay attention to the pluses
But the minuses behind make it seem like you can't win!

Throw your neck out! Throw your back out!

Throw a parrty? Not hardly!! I'm trying to stay up outta that womb!

Luther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed
Smashed, pushed to the limit! Smash and turned it timid!
Hell everyone was suffering, the house was feeling wicked hell
The cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold!
Both of our tempers were on swolle
For the most part you fuss, fight, fart!
You build it up to break it down and now take it from the start
Repeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash
Of two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the sign!

Throw your neck out! Throw your back out!

K-O, knocked out by technicality
The love has kissed the canvas
Now the whole family is mad at me
My daughter don't want me at her PTA meetings
And then my son he can't talk, when I change him he's peeing
I think he's pissed!
I can't dismiss the matter of the fact because he saw you and me argue
Now the energy is coming back
Set an example, a positive pattern, keep life on track
But I'm married to the music and committed to the wax, tapes and CD's

Now you forget your happiness came and went like mom and dad's relationship
Take a trip, you bring potato chips, I'll bring the hot sauce

Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!
Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!

1979, Dirty South, Local lounge (Flip that smile upside down now!)
I never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness
Now what used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit!
Graphic language, mild violence and the silence of the fams!

No members to remember but I know just who I am
I've grown into a man and like my nigga said we executed the game plan
'Cause we got that hot sauce!

Might as well have fun 'cause your happiness is done when your goose is cooked!

Come here and smell the Folgers, the soldiers are human beings
Man acting as if he was the supreme being
Clocking the souls of men out like he was G-O-D and
W-A-Rrah, there'll be no tomorrow but sorrow
And horror will follow the hollow hearts battle for dollars
Politicians, modern day magicians
Physicians of death, more health care for poor health
Who making us ill, they making us kill
That's making me spill my guts (chill Big, lay in the cut)
For what? I refuse to sit in the backseat and get handled
Like I do nothing all day but sit around watch the Cartoon Channel
I rap about, the Presidential election and the scandal
That followed, and we all watched the nation, as it swallowed
And chalked it up, basically America you got FUCKED
The media shucked and jived now we stuck - damn!

Was it full of bleeps and blunders, did they ever find Osama?
And why in the fuck did Daniel Pearl have to pay the price
For his life and his wife plead twice?
See Al-Amin got life and Fred got dead, Hampton
To dampen the dream of all the Panthers
They got they answer for ransom

Count your blessings whenever you feel that things won't be no better

Like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked

Can't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds
No trees, no P's to ease the stress of everyday livin'
But homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they livin'
The unforgiven or the unwillin', live a life of sinnin'
And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginnin

But what about repentance?
What about the tension?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
But what about repentance?
What about committing the same sin
Over and over again and again and ah...

Why are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Please tell me - what are we here foorrr?
Ow!

Life, is nothin' but a dream, so peaceful and serene
Unless you're bein' evil then you on the devil's team
Well I receive what you want to believe
But soon you'll have to sew those bad seeds
Please, any man can ask, to get a pass
Or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance
Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle
Whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle
'Cause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible

Leather in the summer, silk in the winter
This is such an art, where do I begin uh..
Used to sing tenor, in the church choir
Really I was flexin', but the girls they were fine
I'm the type of guy that notice subtle signs
When I cuddle mine, she ain't even tryin
To look sexy, but even if she was so what
Mother fucker grow up, don't mean to be so abrupt
But that lets me, know that she's a human being
And being human's hard, on the boulevard
Girl you got it bad, glad I'm not one
But yet you got it good, you are the hot one
But I'm Andre, Benjamin Andre to be exact
You hoped to meet a gentleman one day, well this is that
In fact, Dookie introduced at a show
About a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me
I'm in the southern states, you know where all the pimps be
Dressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups
And yes you're getting booed if your shit does not get down
And yes you're getting sued by women who didn't get up
Out their seat on the bus, and feet shouldn't rust
And beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust

So, you're going to find out tonightttttttttt!

Got a sweet lil' darling back in my corner
Below I know I love her, but act like I don't want her
Surrounded by the lonely, but yet feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor
The way I give up my heart, but
Never know because - shit, I never tell her!
Ask me about my feelings I'd holla' that it's irrela'
I don't get myself caught up in the Jello gella'
And puddin' pops, that others opt to call falling in love, but
For the record, have you ever rode a horse?
Would I like for you to take me to Pluto?
I said, ""Of course!""
But if you ain't a sweety indeedy, I won't endorse
Hans Solo till I'm hit by the bullet, so may the force
Be with you, and I'll hit you when better time permits
For now, give me examples of why you're the shit!
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?
And if you do not know me, then how could you be my friend?

When cars were metal instead of plastic value
Is what I'm talking about
Take two of these and walk it out

Ball it up and ball it out tap the bottle and then pour it out balling'

Now do the fade away, throw some paper away.
And we can skate away, tell the hoes I'll be late today.
Or I can thug it out or star stud it out.
I take a trip with my bitch and Louie luggage out.

Oh yeah we toss it out, you know what I'm talking about.

What if everything you ever knew or known was lost
The needs tend to freeze you when you gatherin' yo thoughts
You pause for the cause,try to recall and remember
But the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center
Cause your mind ain't free, constricting by the motherfuckin' boundaries
An ounce of weed or an pound of dro
Couldn't place you on the planet where 
I'm transmitting life from bro brother, bro hem
Cadillac on bows, strike a pose then the door slams, 
Wham nigga wham, don't they say that in they show damn
For show man, acting like a tadpole out of gonads, 
You now how catch the truth, hit the booth we making more jams
Spread the strawberry preserves on your nervous program, fuck the learning curve
We took our ramp to no man's land
Hello,is anybody home, is anybody giving dome
Serve me up I want some

Jam to the jam, toast jelly to the jam
Imagine me now jamming, shoving it up your monkey jam

Jam to the jam, toast jelly to the jam
Imagine me now jamming, shoving it up your monkey jam

When I'm left alone I get to thinking to myself
The mind is a terrible thing to waste so use it until none's left
Like everything is alright clearly tight to death
I can see clearly now analyzing every step
Clearly you can feel me cause it's beating through your chest
And you can see me clearly through the window paint drip wet wet
With no tint not yet,clearly I'm a vet
And not a veterinarian, but clearly pitbulls are the best
Like the O-U-T-K-S, cleary nigga you know the rest
And if you acting like you don't, cleary nigga you trying to test
Crystal clearly I confess, and I suggest, you clear the runway
Cause the ticket is a one-way, clearly back we won't be coming

Or some space between words

On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head

Still battling in this racial war
Trying to find solutions to the situation I'm facing
Only thing that's free is my flow that y'all be chasing
Letting my niggas know before I go I drop that knowledge
Like dropping books lets stop the crooks
From robbing you of your brains and such using welfare as a crutch

Bold ass soldiers marching off to war

Evidence and DNA drop down, stainin' her dress
She's making a great big one yes, can I get something off your chest?

School days are over, spike the punch, and you can stab it
Joog joog, more joog, kush, pull, more wood
Ice and tone her glove, bedding nicely cause we go good together
Like Salt-N-Pepa, cool Aid and sugar, mustard and mayonnaise,

Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars,
Success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce
Hollywood divorce

(And I'm a star!)
Yeah, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think they're stealing from us like a sample song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like Hammer's home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a darn country song
This whole country wrong,
Oh, but you right, if you just put a little ice on,
And cut your mic on
But you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra. 
I'm so not sober.
I'm high like a Hollywood coffee or soda.
You can call me a roller. (Hold up)
Your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different.
What's the real sense of it?
Bling bling, I know.
And did you know I'm the creator of the term?
I just straightened the perm
They let it sit too long. 
They just making it burn.
Make a movie of our lifestyle,
But they earn like a dead body burned on a mantelpiece
That's why I try not to lie on wax 
Like this candle grease
And I be's the little nigga
Cooler than anti-freeze 
Defrost on your window pane

But in Hollywood it's Little Wayne
Don't make me nut
So that's why I got a pre-nup

A is for Adamsville
Be is Bowen Homes
See if I give a fuck 
If you like me you know I don't
If she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song
D is for what I serve, 
I don't be on no curb
She ain't no junkie neither
I ain't no dope dealer
But she keep coming back 
Three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap 
She ain't know how to act
Now that I've got your un-
Divided attention I'm
Gonna say this and run 
Under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack 
Promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest 
Three fourths of it all
(For what?) 
So your kids' kids' kids can have some cheese
Can't get with it? 
Get get get get get on your knees
Cause 'wealth' is the word (yep)
'Rich' is 'round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write? 
Shoot me a bird

For me and Dre. to create

Public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears 
And think it's dismissed
Part two, the sequel 
All new cast
Just ain't the same 
Gang of nerds on the internet
Slandering your name 
Behind that screen name
They're lame 
And their life is pretty plain
M&M's with no nuts
Won't show up face-to-face 
Straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge
(What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin to plot?)
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen (Nigga please)
But even she can walk 
We'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes 
Must be something bigger waiting

Love you but you hate me at the same time
Lights, camera, action, 
It's game time
Do you take this here 
As your lovely wife?
To love her and cherish her 
For all your life?
I solemnly swear to dare share 
Take you there
And me and you together 
Baby we a lucky pair
It's been a long time 
We walked a thin line
Others say they got you 
But you been mine
As I sit back and watch all them cat fights
Domestic violence (Is that right?)
But you love the dog
Gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growing up 
Showing up 
Blowing up
I never ever thought that we would separate at all
But you played me 
Like a game of football
Used to feed me 
Need me 
Dress me
Now it's so messy 
Straight cut out and left me

Hollywood divorce. 
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing.
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
Not even talking about music
Everything else too.
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over.
But it's cool.
We just keep it going and make new shit.

Take our game
Take our name
Give us a little fame
And then they kick us to the curb

See the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock
The nigga big still hit the stage by himself and still rock
Cause when your faith is in the right place see he ain't gon let you flop
You can say whatever you want (Bet you can't do it like me) Boy stop!!

Before you can say you can't get going
There's no excuse this time don't be afraid to fly

OutKast,"So I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin' that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-see 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown, but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe
It makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap
No lookin' back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun
Would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon
High jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb
My partner yellin' ""Too soon! Don't do it!
Reconsider! Read some liter-ature on the subject
You sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty
We'll wipe her ass out in some detergent
Now hurry hurry
Go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart, three stacks, keep your heart
Hey keep your heart, three stacks, keep your heart
Man these girls is smart, three stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part, play your part

My bitch a choosy lover
Never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Kompressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck with $40 in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn head
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy

Baby you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side, if know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile
We pilin' up the paper on the dinin' room table
Cuz you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rock the freshest Sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B
Cuz what's a ho with no pimp? And what's a pimp with no hoes?
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin' to get chose

Eeny meeny decisions, with precision I pick or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit' girl
Don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life
That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
Cuz it's gonna get wetter
Better prepare ya for the C support
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she don't

""The lawyers couldn't stop me""
""Slaughter-slaughterin' them pockets""
""Had to tie her to a rocket""
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
Cuz he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty, just getting plump

Pick the tale for real sale for the who lose cash

Yellows and greens and blues and browns 
And greys and hues that ooze beneath dilapidated wood
Ain't a thing could explain but what pertains 
To cocaine it a thing that rain
See summer roll around n****s all about change
Then they steady move them keys like Bob James
'Cause old man winter's arrived 
The temperature dives
November just died
December's alive 
Thus it ain't no typical ride
Just individual way to bring home the bacon when bacon was all gone

The old streets with colonel air
Problems can't be hidden
But you'll find sweetness at you pass by
The palms like El Che bring pride to the landscape

Back up a bit
OK hold it there
We gonna watch the game 
Even though the signal ain't clear
Where I'm from they call it cricket 
Around here it's pelota
That's 2 great games
Coming from two proud cultures
You've seen them play their part on the streets from the start
Some of the greatest came from here you know they got heart
Role models from the block deep down in the ditch
Then they switch hit a 6 
A ball left man off the pitch

You watched me and hoped I'd talk to you
Even if it was just a few words
Askin' your opinion

Thankin' you for something good that happened, Lord
But you noticed I was too busy
Tryin' to find the right clothes matchin' with the right shoes
And I ran around the house getting ready

You knew there would be minutes to stop
And say hello, but I still, I were too busy
And at one point, I had to wait doing nuttin'
Then you saw me spring to my feet

Thought I wanted to talk
But I ran to the phone
Called a friend, wassup

Okay, now it's time for us to talk
So I find an empty room but hesitation is in my heart
A look down the hall, nobody there, so I close the door
Take of my new jacket, man, I can't put this on the floor

I'm a have this conversation standin' or my jeans will get dirty
Better yet, I'm a sit on this chair right here 'cause I feel a bit lazy
Almost forgot to pull the curtains so no one can look in
And just when I'm about to utter you some words

Someone steps in
Embarrassed by the moment
I jump up and come up with some stupid excuse
Like I was looking for something

All while you were watchin' me patiently
Ready to give more chances with the hope
That eventually at some point
I will speak to you

You give me so much

I felt embarrassed to talk to you
That is why I didn't bow my head
Glanced 3 or 4 tables over, saw some of my friends talking to you

But I did not, there is still more time left
Hope that I will talk to you yet, but I went home
And seemed as if I had lots of things to do
After that what is on TV

Suddenly I felt too tired to talk to you
Fell asleep in no time without a thought for you
I know it's hard to have a one sided conversation
Well, give me some days to try again, and again, and again

Built by Ibrahim, peace be upon him, circlin? 24 no doubt
I got closer, as did my heart, as did my soul, amazing
How everyone had their attention only on worshippin?
All concerns forgotten, focused on prayin?
Forgettin? everything matters and happenings just living

Sayin?: I swear I didn?t schedule to be here this early
I thought I?d come here like pops in my forties and fifties
And the doe I paid for the ticket, was meant for some hobby
But who am I to say if I will be alive tomorrow
Or 20 years from now, will my health be able to follow

In the cemetery, my corps in the same white sheets

Will see the beauty of eternity

Le pido a Dios que lo amparé en sus últimos momentos

Translation:
[I go out, take a walk and clear my thoughts
The anticipated feeling would be suffering or something similar
I ask God to be merciful in the final hours]

Looking back on my life
Life that?s gladly been given to me
Open my eyes and embrace the smile
Given to you & I
Looking back on my life
No regret only the sweet journey
Lessons from the simple steps
Taking by you & I

With my right hand first
I open the door to the room where my woman gave birth
To my first born son
Only minutes before
I was in the waiting room, nervous
Moms giving me comfort
Family support
As I approached I could hear him crying
I didn?t notice
That my tears were running
Pictured myself for a moment in the arms of my father
Flashback to the bended shoulders
On which I?d sit
Grabbing his finger
Taking my first step
Would I become like him?
After a certain age bottle up
Stop showing love
But cold handshakes throughout the years
Replaced by hugs
Father whispered in his ears
The family was gathered
Pictures were taken
My hands still shaking
My joy was beyond words
Him in my arms
3 generations of tears running so calm
He came with Gods blessing and grace so we named him Faizan

If I worship U in fear of hell, burn me in it
And if I worship U in hope of paradise, exclude me from it
But if I worship U for Your own being
Don?t withhold from me Your everlasting beauty

If I worship U in fear of hell, burn me in it
And if I worship U in hope of paradise, exclude me from it

You used to inspire others with your way of thinking and speech 
People came from afar just to hear us teach 

What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 
Greatness was known but now can you tell 
Mosques are empty, refrigerators are stocked 
We lost our deen, we feel secure because our mansions are locked 
In my teen years salat really wasnt that tight 
Now i gotta pray each one of them twice. 

What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 
Greatness was known but now can you tell 
Brother we prefer light skinned women 
while righteously maintain our deen against raicism (and tribalism)?

Greatness was known but now can you tell

What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 
Greatness was known but now can you tell 
We used to smile at each other with faces full of light 
Now we frown on each other, we bicker, and we fight 
Pops in the mosque praying, 
kids in the streets haitin 
kids on the corner selling pot and in the mosque preaching? 


What happend to the Ummah once known so well? 
Greatness was known but now can you tell 
The Quran has left our hearts - stranded hanging on our walls

This ain't a story 'bout race, color or creed
It's a story 'bout hate, envy and greed
Talk about ambitions but don't want us to progress
Ya talk about assistance but all we get is the stress
You don't really wanna see me grow
Hating on me choking on my flow
You say we rude, don't like our attitude
We crude, ain't got no gratitude
But I wasn't born to be low, I was born to rise
Wasn't born to pretend or keep my faith in disguise
Ain't got no freedom of speech
No freedom to teach - make our kids out of reach
Wanna break ties - alienated in their own land
Running riot in the streets, day by day getting out of hand
You don't want me to be an inspiration
You wanna blame me for agitation
How can you tell me 'bout participation
When all you really want is segregation

Una palabra no dice nada
Why al mismo tiempo
Lo esconde todo
Como aquel viento que esconde el agua
Como las flores que esconde el lodo

[Translation:]
One word contains nothing
And at the same time
It contains everything
Like the air contains water
Like the flowers contain the mire

Is it my religion - you keep seeing as a threat 
You think it's all about - murder, violence and death
But do you care to find - find the truth
Or is it easier to keep fronting and oppressing our youth
Is this why I'm a be awestruck? 
Damn these lies just make us stuck
Bow down to something greater
Nah forget that maybe later
Really must be joking, deceits and lies is all I see
Should I be your enemy or should I trust your lies
Should your treatment of my peeps make us forge them ties
Got to tell me the truth as it is
Or we'll be keeping coming back right here to this
Second class citizen in my own home
Been 30 years gone - and still no dome, still gotta stay strong
Thinking I'm thick trying to sell me this hypocrisy 
Heard it before, you must be kidding me! 

Wanna dictate who I marry
And even what my sis? should wear
Then prevent her from a job
Stuck on welfare - seems
To provoke and oppress us is ok - seems
Racism is cool - despite what you say
Wanna blame us for ya shortcomings
Just want a scapegoat
Still seeing us like a problem
Like we just off the boat
Guess you wanted cheap labour to build ya home

Una palabra no dice nada
Why al mismo tiempo
Lo esconde todo 
Como aquel viento que esconde el agua
Como las flores que esconde el lodo

Una Mirada no dice nada
Why al mismo tiempo
Lo dice todo
Como la lluvia sobre tu cara
O el Viejo mapa de algún tesoro

[Translation:]
One word contains nothing
And at the same time
It contains everything
Like the air contains water
Like the flowers contain the mire

One look contains nothing
And at the same time
It contains everything
Like the rain on your face
Or an old map leading you to some treasure

Where the next Abu Dharr at?
Where the next Khalid Ibn Walid aka Sayf-Allah at? 
Tell us how we fuel this crime
Everyday statistics, everyday media - plenty of us doing time
Why should I take the blame or shame
When I know you just looking for someone to frame
My individual freedom; abused
Redicule of my deen, my beliefs, guess I be the new jew
I've become the new ni**a of the world
Product of your society, adopted your values in their entirety
Wasn't born like this, I was made this way
You like it or not, player - I'm here to stay
We walk the same streets, breathe the same air
Add to this state, but do you even care? 
Guess you gotta reciprocate
Want us to be people of faith or people of hate?
You got your deen, I got mine - okay?

But of wisdom, pure intentions, conversation
Compassionate action, with purity of heart
We might get somewhere, become light
Fast and burn like a candle, right
Intertwine, u give me peace of mind
I cloak u and u cloak me
Responsible I feel with honesty
Between us God has put affection and mercy

Amor mío
Te adora como a la más bella estrella fugaz en el cielo
Y cuando me siento sólo, sé que tú me entiendes
Sé que me comprendes
Sueño apoyarme en tu sonrisa
Toma mi mano y ven de prisa
Siempre me imagino Viejo y arrugado
Mis hijos ya crecidos mis nietos a mi lado
Y la luz de luna a revelado
Que tu palpitar es por mi, que siempre a sido asi
He practicado que decir muchas veces
Y cuando Dios lo quiera estaremos frente a frente
Será el momento de embrujarte
Ojalá que en tus ojos me retrates
Que aceptes mi pasado, que mis locuras yo no pague
Yo te prometere mi vida
Aunque la muerte nos separe

And when I feel alone I know that you understand me
I know that you comprehend me
I?m looking for comfort in your smile

?Cuz  I?ve always seen myself  old and aged
My children grown up, grandchildren by my side
And the moonlight has revealed
That your heart beats for me
And it has always been like that
I?ve practised what to say many times
When God is willing
We?ll stand face to face
That will be the moment to put a spell on you

With no sign of REGRET
With each year we gain in force with ups and downs of course
Yeah my wife is my cousin
And thank God, Faizan my son was born without complications
Hina my love to you is unconditional
Not limited by typical Bollywood scenarios
Or by statistics when problems occur we leave
?Cause I know t u´ll stay till I no longer will breathe
Or if I?m crippled, blinded or anything else
I know I can rely on u helping my every step
Love is not just limited to butterflies and sex
It?s to recognise and respect each others intellects
Lots of regrets many things we shouldn?t have said and done
But that?s just part of our journey and it?s just begun
Define beauty ?cause one day looks will fade
But a beautiful mind still be young at an old age
And I know it?s hard me being away for so long
But I respect u so much for being so strong
I remember U being pregnant going to school
Cooking food taking care of my parents and the whole house
All in one something a man could never do no doubt
So I thank my mother for the day she brought us together
And I pray for our reunion in the afterlife forever

Outlaw Immortals,"[Featuring Outlaw Immortalz] 
Intro: (Voice speaking) 
You rang 
Is you down kichy or even might love to me 
Payin' bangin' another time 
Look we got the trigger to quicker the caper 
Fools leavin' they guns 
from the guns to the care to the bed to the scoop 
In this life ain't nothing they can think off 
But working overtime nigga 
Some motherfucking hard labor 
Verse 1: [Kastro Outlaw Immortalz] 
They got my, 
Kickin' in dust, dirty 
Bust me, they must be dreamin' 
Trust me these cowards heard a murder 
And they ain't tryin' to see it 
They got 'em in there 
When I was to young to be in 
So now I'm comatosed, shellshocked and barely breathin' 
But, 
still I respect the game 
Test me, you ain't Hussein 
Outlaw like Josey Wales 
Too tough to try to change 
see-Bo, they take me, change no 
We just slow at home 
Ready for war plus we deadly 
Verse 2: [Young Noble - Outlaw Immortalz] 
I remember when one of my teachers told me 
That I ain't shit, and ain't gon never be shit 
Look at me now bitch and fluwed your kid with this 
Now we're rainin' on our enemies 
Hennessy got me critically, 
suddenly, instantly 
Knew their planin' with my misery 
It's to me from Makaveli the general 
Military mind, outlaw with camisole 
Critical condition for that hoes he fold 
It Hard Labor, knowin' this rap shit might save us 
Not from death, but where we came from 
Chorus: x2 
[Napolean - Outlaw Immortalz] 
Nigga, all we do is act a fool is stay thugged out (Thugged out) 
And the first nigga that act up was gettin' thugged out 
Change the paper... 
[Young Noble - Outlaw Immortalz] 
...it's Hard Labor 
Made the biggest plan that niggas makin' 
Sound aped, cause it is rapin' 
They can't fake it more 
Verse 3: [Storm - Outlaw Immortalz] 
Gotta make more warriors 
Runnin' through my veins 
The story's told while the game's the same 
Fuck the world with your money, man, play the game 
Got stuck with your heartbeat, who's to blame 
What you know what I want, when you're bad as yours 
Got a vision of my enemies hittin' the floor 
From Makaveli to my Outlawz, I back 'em all 
Keep your mind on my riches, when I even the score 
First nigga where you at, speak, friend of fo' 
Got a 9-G locked, it's for if you fall 
Shoot first, let's play no different face 
I die for the shit, nigga Hard Labor 
Verse 4: [Kastro - Outlaw Immortalz] 
Pick up my block, cock 
Please not want to put a stop to my plot 
They locked my bitch up 
And even tried to lock in my pops 
It's Hard Labor, my moms, you craw me thinkin' to major 
Mad, cause, nowadays too many hoes is on my pager 
Pussy and paper 
Pencil, politics and praise you 
Chase you and even chase me 
Straight to the penitentiary 
Nigga, the hard life, hard fight and hard capers 
Nigga, we're all thugs, overdosed in Hard Labor 
(Voice Speaking): 
Walked in the club and said a nigga drugs do us all 
Looked up and see my nigga Big see-Bo 
Verse 5: [C-Bo] 
Check I was born to this life ,a sin, as a young thug 
Releasin' stress over (?) gin, laced with mud 
From day one I knew is wasn't no motherfuckin' love 
They use to jump doin' hands and now they jump in new as lust 
I was confused first to see a church 
on this hell on earth 
But it was them fools first to took earth 
for what it was worth 
I was raised in this great community, 
when there was no unity 
And niggas be on they own, 
as soon they reached (?cutety?) 
Be you and me 
Runnin' back, in a Cadillac 
Fresh of a jack 
With two straps in a Pontiac 
With only one life to live 
I guess the Lord had only one life to give 
It seems so trifully, bought a hill 
This fast nigga's life's a sin 
It's hell on earth, ain't nothin' worse 
Than givin' birth to kid 
Talk to sin until he buried to dirt 
It's been a thug life since day one, 
when I was thugged in 
25 Years later got rid off thuggin' Hard Labor",Hard Labor,1998

The power to reach
Each nigga on every street

What follows is the story
What proceeded was the glue
What lies between is the fiction
Don't fuck around and make it true

My adversaries crumble when we rumble it's a catastrophe
I pull revenge on bitch niggas that blasted me
Plus my alias is Makaveli
A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga belly
Bust him to see if he bleed
He shoulda never fucked around with a sick-ass nigga like me
They call my name out and niggas run
Best be prepared for the Outlawz, here we come

They call me Hussein Fatal, it's a two game table
I'm robbin' ya niggas' cradle with a knife in your navel
Rap-related, criminally activated and evil
I wouldn't wanna be you behind my fuckin' Desert Eagle
Til the end, I'm tellin' all friends and enemies
You see what I got to make you freeze, to touch me you need ten of these
Complete most, wanted on the streets of the East coast
Young Gunz fire and niggas bleed, I see Mo

I be shinin' like white diamonds and crystal
Glistenin' holdin' pistols
The mission's simple, fold up and roll up dead presidentials, sew up all the potential
Million, billion dollar baller potential
Sort it, oughta call on a nigga I'll be sure to get you
Take cash bro, fast yo, for my Kastro
Blast and I'mma last yo past all these Glass Joes
And assholes who claim, like they be runnin' thangs
I be gunnin' those same niggas runnin' late, to their fate

My alias is motherfuckin' Na-poleon, and I'd rather be
Robbin' again before these motherfuckers leave me sufferin'
But it ain't nothin', and I got no time for no bluffin'
Befo' a nigga finish with puttin' in work I betta end up with somethin'
I think these niggas got the game fucked up
If they don't believe, that a young nigga like me, would bust (Boo-Yaa!)
Perhaps it's a must, I'm facin' cases, fuck probation
Is what I'm screamin' when these money hungry cops be chasin'

Alias Mussolini mentally unstable G status

Six-three and cocky quick to hit your bitch if she jock me
Severely addicted to livin' like a fuckin' felon while beefin'

Since a short I been livin life defiant, nickel plated chrome
Got this baby Capone lookin' like a giant, and I ain't lyin'
It's like it's me against myself
With all these backstabbin' snakes grabbin' at my fuckin wealth

Mo Khomeini goes terrorist, mad man killer
The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers
I'm that nigga with the fifty cap pouch, with the murderous stacks
That increase, while these motherfuckers eat beef
It's been a long road, a lot of episodes
And as the Glock loads, I gotta teach hoes
Reach hoes, make 'em feel a nigga when I'm mashin'

Yeah!
It's all about you, one time!
I'mma say it's all about you baby, yeah!
It's all about you, it's all about you, yeah
This Dru Down in the house
With my boy 'Pizznac you knowhat I'm sayin'? (It's all about you)
Yeah I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeauh

You probably crooked as the last trick
Wanna laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin' I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one, uh
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club
I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby, if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin' boo, is this is all about you

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

I make a promise if you go with me
Just let me know, I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
I never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you
Yeah nigga
It's all about you

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well boo
I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold digging, cold digging a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
Every other video (it's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Every other city we go
I see the same hoes in the studio
Or kickin it in the video
It's gotta be the same ass and thighs
But you'se a groupie baby and don't look surprised
I can see it in your eyes that you nuthin' but a trick
Hangin' with us for some superstar dick
Wanna autograph placed on her napkin
After she asks ain't you the Top Dogg and don't you be rappin'
She know what's crackin, free shows like loot
From limos down to the Lexus Coup
We be flossin'
And all females love that
Especially when you're dope platinum and you own wax
When I met you I really didn't have to say much
'Cause me alone just made you wanna taste and touch
Don't be trippin' if I run up to your hoe and whole crew
I'm gonna still let you know girl
That it's all about you, you, you, you",All About You,
Outlawz,"[Chorus]
How do you want it? How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane; I'm for real
How do you want it? How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane; I'm for real

Love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad I'm bout to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, playa with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me, champagne, Hennessey
A favorite of my homies when we floss, on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin baby I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how you want it
(Tell me how you want it! La-dy, yeah yeah)

[Chorus]

Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor it's like erotic, ironic 
Cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster, I'm up inside ya
I ain't quittin' til the show is over, cause I'ma rider
In and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak
And let you get on top of me, get her rockin' these
Nights full of Alize, a livin' legend
You ain't heard about these niggas play these Cali days
Delores Tucker, youse a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother
Worse than the others, Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game is told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin' millions, niggas top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' bout us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga tell me how you want it

[Chorus]

Raised as a youth, tell the truth I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof, because I jumped from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, SkyPager
Game rules, I'm livin' major, my adversaries
Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetary
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin' fade em all, these taxes
Got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin like they know me
Hahaha, but I'ma mash out, peel out
I'm with it quick I'se quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga it's some new shit so better get up on it
When ya see me tell a nigga how ya want it
How do you want it?

[Chorus: x2]

How you want it?
Yeah my nigga Johnny J
Yeah, we out

Out befo' them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't get too close, my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
Plus we been beefin with the East coast, with casualites
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business, and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic, thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic cause we crossed the top

Sorry if I cuss but it's the suffering that I feel
Who can I trust and if I bust will she snitch
Even though you ain't the type to trip
Sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women
I see the boss for the third time, hope to see you soon

Outlawz,"I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears (if I should die before I wake)
Please God walk with me (grab a nigga and take me to Heaven)

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me? I'm not livin'' in the past, you wanna last
Be tha first to blast, remember Kato
No longer with us he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

Ah, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm havin' visions
Of leavin'' here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure, and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm goin' blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin'' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial, and when I die, 
Baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears

Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
To embrace an early death, now there's nothin'' left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standin', bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin'' me, in my sleep
Will I survive til the mo'nin, to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come

Lord, I suffered through the years (God) and shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Lord knows I.. tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady, cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the Lord to let me in
To Heaven's door,  shed so many tears
(Dear God, please let me in)

I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

My whole family been raised, on shit that ain't okay
Ain't nothing on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
I'm reminiscing, and catchin' flashbacks
When niggas ran up in my house
And I was too young, to try to blast back
What happend then? No one would tell me since I was three
Heard that God took my peoples, now they living somewhere free
But fuck that, you got what's mines and I want that
Never drop my guard, been on the squad, since ways back
And now I'm sitting, holding in anger because my parents missing
Thugging Immortal, got some war stories for you

Now look at me straight Outlaw Immortal
Never gave a fuck 'cause I was nobody's daughter
Outlawing from my tits to my clits, don't try to figure
'Cause the murderous tendencies of my mind can't be controlled, nigga
So who's the bigger, who's the quickest killer?
Would you try to trip with my finger on the 9 milla
When I got you on kay-nine-fourths
Prayin' to God as your life goes back and forth

Y'all know what time it is
This drink is guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
Now, if you with me
Pour a glass and drink with a nigga, you know what I mean?
I ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols, alcoholics
I'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
So come and get some of this Thug Passion, baby

I could pull out the drink and be good until it's relevant
But I'm a straight soldier
I'll roll up a nigga like it's Heaven sent
Tripping over dead presidents
They got these derelicts
I throw was down with this business
Trying to clown and get a cent
And so rather than stand forever, been thinking
Drinking over a felony
And hell of me and how it will be some other shit
People telling me to cool out
But they ain't feeling me
A motherfucking fool, about
My fucking cheddar cheese
And it pleases, passion of mine
Thugging, hugging plenty of G's
And laughing while I pass through times
And all these bastards be watching
Just keep it plain
And I'mma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game
I can pinkle with the rain twinkling
Diamonds and things go blinking
Enough to hold me, til I'm old and wrinkling
And these adversaries
They gonna have to be worrying
'Cause I'mma be illing, fulfilling my passion
Til I'm burying my Thug Passion

I heard it's the bomb
And you got it going on
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
You got me dripping wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
Ooh whoa

Now what if me
Turn this Hennessey into a robbery
The Prophecy probably suddenly
Switch and how it supposed to be and dirty money
Can't be evil 'cause it's filling up my tummy
Born in a position, death collision was futuristic
Twisting riches but there is only one way to make more
So I'm standing on the corner
Trying to hustle in the snow and my bigger bro
Couldn't know, but buy a .44, blasting at playa haters wanting more
With a Thug Passion

Putting down mashin'
Control by this Thug's Passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blasting
I'm asking what happened
To the niggas who kept it real
Like they claim to
That's when I bang, do, see thang true
Travelling this road my poor soul has been consolidated
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated
How I made it can easily stated
It's like my heart be gripped with the Passion
To be the fucking greatest
Load up and take shit

Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
Jack a stack 'til we got enough bank to split

Creep with me
Through that immortal flow
Thug Passion got you trembling, like Death on the Row
Make your move
So I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowing up the scene
Like my nigga Mr. Herb
Take a toke as your heart goes full arrest
I got the bomb, so nigga, fuck the rest
You need a dub to get you flowing
And let that loc see smoke
Feeling the strokes of the 9 squeeze tight and slow

I heard it's the bomb
And you got it going on
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
You got me dripping wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
Oh whoa

They say money don't make the man
But damn, I'm making money
Observing you motherfuckers
'Cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it but you bullshitting
Licking them lips, you got me about to act a fool quick
Sipping on some Alizé and Cristal
Meanwhile, buy me a drink and get to winking at me
She smiles, a niggas full of passion
Satisfaction is everlasting
""How does it feel?"" what I'm asking
While I'm rubbing on that ass
""Why you laughing?""
See, I'm digging as if I'm curious
Full blown and furious
Baby, get a grip
When I be doing this
It's so physical
My attraction driven by alcohol
Beware of my reaction
Baby I'm born to ball
Thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize and picture what I said, so
Now you can feel it, it's a portion for my niggas in motion
Forever blasting, bitches ain't ready for this Thug Passion

I heard it's the bomb
And you got it going on
Give me some of your Thug Passion, baby
You got me dripping wet

Blessed with the gift of speech, the power to reach
Each n**** on every street
May the Heavenly Father look down and be proud
Of what transpired since the day the seed was planted
The G grew but we knew he'd rise up quick
Smoked out, loc'ed out, all into s***

Complete most, wanted on the streets of the East coast
Young Gunz fire and n****s bleed, I see Mo

The mission's simple, fold up and roll up dead presidentials
Sew up all the potential, million, billion dollar baller potential
Sort it, oughta call on a n**** I'll be sure to get you
Take cash bro, fast yo, for my Kastro
Blast and I'ma last yo past all these Glass Joes
And a**holes who claim, like they be runnin' thangs
I be gunnin' those same n****s runnin' late, to their fate

My alias is motherf***in' Na-poleon, and I'd rather be
Robbin' again before these motherf***ers leave me sufferin'
But the s*** ain't nothin', and I got no time for no bluffin'
Befo' a n**** finish with puttin in work I betta end up with somethin'
I think these n****s got the game f***ed up
If they don't believe, that a young n**** like me, would bust (Boo-Yaa!)
Perhaps it's a must, I'm facin' cases, f*** probation

Ingle-Watts banger, keepin' one in the chamber
For the anger that I build inside, when it's time to ride
Suicidal thoughts lurk f***in' no end to revenge
F*** any, my alias Mussolini

They call me Idi, from the side of seedy
Young n**** greedy, so I'm runnin' up on these n****s easy

The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers

Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you want to ride or die

I ain't a killer but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness int he rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God hoping that he's listening
Seeing niggas coming for me, to my diamonds, when they glistening
Now pay attention, rest in peace father
I'm a ghost in these killing fields
Hail Mary catch me if I go, let's go deep inside
The solitary mind of a madman who screams in the dark
Evil lurks, enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break, to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupted, fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggaz is lucky if we bust out this shit, plus

One life to live but I got nothing to lose, just me and you
On a one way trip to prison, selling drugs
We all wrapped up in this living, life as Thugs
To my homeboys in Quentin Max, doing they bid
Raise hell to this real shit, and feel this

Hoping you'll forgive me for the times I bullshitted

Duckin one-time! (Lost Soul) 
How it start, how it start 
Started off with, runnin from copses duck and hide from helicopters 
We open fire, who can stop us 
Livin the life of trife juveniles, hopin for righteous 
Gettin twenty-five to life, if the judge don't like us 
In my clearest pictures, I see authorities itchin to get us 
ATF state feds scandalous bitches 
I wasn't promised to it, wasn't bitter or sweet 
See if a, nigga don't hustle then the nigga don't eat 
Only streets livin do or die circle complete 
Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for cheese 
Please understand my history a man of many acts 
Livin Thug Life, comin equipped, with many gats 
Maybe I was just a Lost Soul, trapped in time 
Livin in between life, and the cracks were blind 
Even though we had hope for dreams that never came 
Yet and still we all feel pain 
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine 
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life 
Duckin one-time! Stranded in the County in the worst way 
Hell of a way to spend my twenty-first birthday 
Born in the ghetto as a street thug 
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love 
Lost Souls... 
Lost Souls nigga, for my homeboys that passed on 
Words from the mind of a Lost Soul 
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine 
Cause I hate to spend, my life, my life, my life, my life 
Duckin one-time! 
[Young Noble] 
My brother Sean, first on my list, he stuck with 
a three-five when he get out would I be dead or alive 
He taught me the rules so much, but still In Thugs I Trust 
When in danger never hesitate to keep my fuckin trap shut 
My Mom Dukes got a little bit of Thug in her 
The Devil loves sinners crackheads and drug dealer 
Sometimes I feel like the streets are takin over 
Never stayin sober, the brain over and over backtrack 
My stack's fat, I used to take new 
One love to my crew aiyyo this one's for you 
[Tupac] 
R.I.P., rest in peace to Moo Brown 
Know what we gotta do baby, one-time 
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine

Duckin one-time!

One-time! One-time! One-time! 
[Idi Amin] 
I was born twenty-two years ago, yesterday 
But see I saw no reason for me to celebrate, let me demonstrate 
Entered the world from out a poisonous womb 
Heroin bein consumed already predicitin my doom, soon 
to be one of the many misguided 
Always the first one on the block to be done tried it and liked it 
Lost before I had a chance to find my way 
Now I travel through life, not knowin the time of day 
Crime for pay, I'm on my way, but don't know, where I'ma end up 
I swear to God, it's just a setup 
And these are the words from the mind of a Lost Soul (I'ma Lost Soul)

Outlawz,"Staring at the world through my rearview
Just looking back at the world from another level
Ya know what I mean? Starin'

Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
Niggas is calling cops, people shot, nobody stops
I wonder when the world stopped caring
Last night two kids shot while the whole block staring
I will never understand this society
First they try to murder me then they lie to me
Product of a dying breed
All my homies trying weed
Now the little baby's crazed raised off Hennessy
Tell me, will my enemies flee when they see me?
Believe me, even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
Listen, through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
And we turning bad boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga
Rollin' with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
To the end, my friend
I'm seeing nothin' but my dreams coming true
While I'm staring at the world through my rearview
See, I'm seeing nothin' but my dreams coming true
While I'm staring at the world through my rearview
They got me

Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly
And all my motherfuckers

Now you see him, now you don't
Some niggas be here for the moment, and then they gone
What happened to 'em?
Well, let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the truest
Thug Life until I check out this bitch, I thought you knew this
Who is gonna catch me when I fall or even care to?
While you thinking I see you lost up in my rearview
Hear you is down with them Outlawz
Outcast, left far, I'm through like southpaws
But still we keep mashing till our dreams come through
Staring at the world through my rearview

Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, counting days in this living black hell
Do you feel me? Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a 12 gauge pump for protection
Niggas hate me in the section from years of chin-checking
Turn to Smith & Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father, I'm a soldier
I'm getting hotter cause the world's getting colder
Baby, let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run, look at my bitches!

Now I know the answers to the question
“Do dreams come true?”
Still staring at the world through my rearview
I said now I know the answers, “Do dreams come true?”
Staring at the world through my rearview

Nigga Kadafi say

Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for Glocks
Cause fiends hitting up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowing rules to these streets
Something I learned in school
On some Million Man March shit for the piece/peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since a seed
We all die, breed bleed like humans
Towns run by young guns, Outlawz and truants
Shit's deep, turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty, or chosing my dough
So while you reminiscing all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too, I'm staring through your rearview

Hahahaha
You ain't knowing what we mean by staring through the rearview
So since you ain't knowing what we mean let me break down understanding
The world,  the world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
And what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more, the world is a game to be played
So now we looking at the world, from like, behind us
Niggas know what we gotta do
Just gotta put our mind to it and do it
It's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggas do they wanna do, bitch niggas do what they can

Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die

You raining, clicking niggas that will see us, man
But if you think, you can't do yo' thug thang, nigga
(Do yo' thug thang, nigga)

Fuck You
Fuck the Outlawz
Fuck the Regime, nigga

If you ain't loving this thug shit
You must be a bitch
Can't compete with the bricks
All the drug dealers rich

Or try to get in
Try to hustle and pear
Walking up and down block all day
'Til the rest of the fiends get here

A bitch named Tarifa
She owned 300 thugs
On a nigga to hold her beaver
From the blow, I fronted

And do yo' thug thang
Rapping [unverified] drugs slang
[Unverified] and have you losing you brain

Abusing the game
So now, you're in danger
Lyrically, I ruin your name

And keep one in the chamber
Nasty new street slugger
Catch you with a box cutter

Used to fight with my brother
And run the spot with my mother
You get after, ask her quick
And shit blast the bitch
Fucking around with this, Outlawz shit

Get your thug on, niggas
Ha, then do yo' thug thing
If you got to get your money on
From night 'til morn

You better then do yo thug thang
If you buy chronic by the zone
Then get yo' smoke on
Then do yo thug thang

If you resign the streets
Because you love to bang
Then do yo thug thang

If you don't give a fuck about life
I lost my family twice
So I'ma then do you thug thang

Niggas used to hit me up
Till they see that fuckin' Régime
Stick me up, up in the sky
Firebreatin' dragon

Niggas bout to die
Niggas feel like Armageddon
When I be headin'
And wait Niggas up at they own wedding

With they own weapons
Counterfessons
Ghetto lesson number one
Never try to go to war without your gun

Niggas get done
Since I quit fuckin' with Num
I did once like Big Pun

Off the books
Have your body in a coffin up
Nigga I'm off the hook

Like a phoneless chuck that burned out
Thugged out and turned out
Set that motherfucking perm out your head
Niggas dead

If you ain't Régime or Outlawz
Kiss the ring
I do my thug thing without y'all

Matter of fact
I gives a fuck about y'all
Put a nigga up in a ho
Just like a ground hole

Thanks of the Hounddog
They finally found y'all
Leavin' {unverified] on your face
And about twelve motherfuckin' bodies

Hangin' around y'all
I do my thug thang
Dopin' in and out of lanes
And I must thank

[Unverified]
Tats on my arm
I better ring the fuckin' alarm
Or be the first that get mashed on
Nigga, do yo thug thang

If you got to get your money on
From night 'til morn
You better then do yo thug thang

If you buy chronic by the zone
Then get yo' smoke on
Then do yo thug thang

If you resign the streets
Because you love to bang
Then do yo thug thang

If you don't give a fuck about life
I lost my family twice
So I'ma then do you thug thang

If you got to get your money on
From night 'til morn

You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
And still stranded, merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still, the best of us build, and reach monetary gains
Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change

I ride or die for Makaveli the legendary war thug nigga

Political prisoner, the two choices that they givin' us
Ride or die, for life they sentence us
Oh Black Jesus, please watch over my brother Shawn
Soon as the sky get bright, it's just another storm

Brothers gone, now labeled a statistic
Ain't no love for us ghetto kids, they call us nigglets
History repeats itself, nuttin' new in school I knew
E'rything I read wasn't true, Black Jesus

To this click I'm dedicated, criminal orientated
An Outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
Made for terror, major league niggaz pray together
Bitches in they grave while my real niggaz play together

We die clutchin' glasses, filled with liquor bomblastic
Cremated, last wishes nigga smoke my ashes
High sigh why die wishin', hopin' for possibilities
I'll mob on, why they copy me sloppily

Cops patrol projects, hatin' the people livin' in them
I was born an inmate, waitin' to escape the prison
Went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
God gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous

Blast til they holy high, baptize they evil minds
Wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine trick
Which one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?
Bitches freeze facin' Black Jesus

All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Some missin' souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
Like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus

Some say, some day, some how, some way, we gon' fail
And it ain't hard to tell, we dwell in hell
Trapped, black, scarred and barred
Searching for truth, where it's hard to find God

I play the Pied Piper, and to this Thug Life, I'm a lifer
Proceed, to turn up the speed, just for stripes
My Black Jesus, walk through this valley with me
Where we, so used to hard times and casualties

Indeed, it hurt me deep to have to sleep on the streets
And haven't eaten in weeks, so save a prayer for me
And all the young thugs, raised on drugs and guns
Blazed out and numb, slaves to this slums this ain't livin' Jesus

We believed in You everything You do
Just wanna let you know, how we feel
Black Jesus

Searchin' for Black Jesus
It's hard, it's hard we need help out here
So we searchin's for Black Jesus

It's like a Saint, that we pray to in the ghetto, to get us through
Somebody that understand our pain
You know maybe not too perfect, you know
Somebody that hurt like we hurt

Somebody that smoke like we smoke
Drink like we drink
That understand where we coming from
That's who we pray to we need help y'all",Black Jesuz,1999
Outlawz,"These is hard times we livin' in
Churches burnin, planes fallin from the sky
Murder, the good die young
The good definitely die young

This is a lil' somethin' 
To help you get through the day
If you could
It was more than a tragedy

Emotions be grabbin' me
Plane fell from the sky
We tryin' to figure what happened
Burnin' churches, fearin' God

Who can be so cruel
We all ignorant to AIDS
Till it happens to you
Just be a man, make plans

Listen to your voice
A woman's tryin' to make decisions
We should leave them a choice
'Cause who are we to say who lives and die

Breathes and stops
All this judgement on other lives
Needs to stop
What are we livin' for

Givin' more back than takin'
On my knees still waitin' for my own salvation
Now I feel abandoned
'Cause Pat Buchanan say I'm greedy

You can take my taxes, send me to war
But can't feed me
It's so easy to regret things
After they done

Babies catchin' murder cases
Scared to laugh in the sun
The tragedies that we all need
Love in doses

In times like these we feel closest
The good die young
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young

Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why 
Can anybody tell me why 
Now in my world will it get worse

When I been trapped since birth
But I had to sleep in a hearse
Cause it was my bed first
My grands probably burnin'

Turnin' in they grave
Some folks ain't even get to see a high age
But they did so I ain't afraid
And this money got me feelin like a star

And this murder got me 
Feelin' like my death ain't far
And the land of stolen cars
Don't get no better

Don't get no weaker or no harder
I was raised in a rush without my moms
And my father
So tell me somethin

If I grab my gat and get the dumpin'
Would God get to lookin' at me funny
Rest in peace to my mother Aquillah Beale
Rest in peace to my father Salek Beale

Rest in peace to my grandparents
And thug in peace to my brother Seike
You know I love you

My cousin Darren wasn't scared of goin'

I guess I see ya when I see ya soulja

Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why

I know my life ain't promised
That's why the wise move in silence
Analyze these scandalous times
It's hard dogg but we manage

Schools turn to war zones
Even homes unsafe
Leavin' children to play caged and raged
They hate, how come

Someone explain why the good die young
Why the bad die slow and outlive everyone
It's time somethin' is done
For our young kids

They growin' hopeless
That ain't the way to live
Tell me why
Days go past and as they pass

Time move quicker
No time for wastin'
Put your hustle down my young dealers
'Cause the end is nearer

But at least that's what they tellin' me
Hell, all I know brothers
Ain't ridin' 4 3 felonys
It's time to plan, plot, and strategize

Capitolize, mobilize
We in the war why'all
It's for all why'all
My family to the ones that stand me

Little bit mo' love is what's recommended
Yeah, and it's plain to see
The seeds from you and me
Gon' be the ones to lead us towards unity

That's if we treat them right
Man, teach them right
Raise your kids better than you was
And see what it does

But if you don't
Man, we sho' to be done

For every step I take you take
For every breath I breathe you breathe

Every dollar I make you make

You just got there a little quicker

Huh, increase the doses, busting whoever closest
Thug living, hell or prison, never losing my focus
I'm making money moves mandatory
In a discussion my past records tell a story
Picture niggas we rushing and still busting
Til the cops come running, duck in abandoned buildings
Ditching my gun, homeboy the motherfucking villain
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers, but now legit list
So I laugh til I cry, when the law come get me
No baby momma drama, nigga miss me, why plant seeds
In a dirty bitch, waiting to trick me, not the life for me
Living carefree, til I'm buried, and if they dare me
I'm busting on niggas until they scurry, I'm clearly
A man of military means in my artillery
Watching over me through every murder scene
From adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die
Selling dope to all the fiends, at times I want to cry
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
Never knowing if this game'll last, feeling ashamed
Of cocaine, the product of the devil, am I selling my soul?
Got tired of small time livin, niggas telling me no
I got mine! Fuck them other suckers! That's the mentality
Jealous-ass bustaz, make it hell for us

Gotta get that paper quickly and escape the sickness
If I fail, then I suffer, being broke is hell 4 a hustler
So I stay struggling and juggling with all the might I can muster
Since a youngster, been money hungry, moved in
One's five's and ten's was funny money
So I sets my sights bigger, four figures or mo'

Let me catch you slipping, you soft niggas is outta here

Yo, to every step I take, every foul I make
Every jail I break, every mill' I ate

On the block ducking charges, nigga fuck the sergeant
He got a job, all my bottles got a pinch of coke
Listen tho' I'm missing dough I gotta gather mo'
Hell no, dead blocks with red tops but now a nigga sell words
For all my young thugs in jail in Jerz
They made it hell 4 a hustler, I bails high as fuck son
Dying luck none supply us with much guns
I buck one, just to let you know that I can touch ya
Slanging cracks or raps, still hell 4 a hustler

Sensimilla bar your kids from the lessons I learned
And in turn I'm hostile guess you could call me anti-social

Try to politic, before I smoke em, like Sun Zu
Niggas do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they coming for my dogs in the morning
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me? Getting blowed out
High, watch me murder the bird, before he testify
Strikes, walking close to my third, I live a trouble life
And if you dream be a part of my team
From Long Beach to Queens, drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo' eyes on the prize, nigga watch for busters

These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops

Strapped and angry, with no hope and heart broke
Fightin' first my trained brain until it's not so
It's hostile, niggas lick shots to watch the glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
To people beefin' and things, squeakin' on they beefs for weeks
Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care
For a struggle out the gutter, twenty-two with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
So I'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share
Til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
Me and these 223's'll freeze the biggest with ease
I'm still a nigga you fear, bring the beast to his knees
And I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven sent
And I meant, every word, in my letter, to the President
Shit is still fucked up y'all
And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better

Heavenly Father may I holla at you briefly
I want to meet the President, but will he meet me?
He's scared to look inside the eyes of a Thug Nigga
We tired of bein scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin'
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bitch ain't never did shit for me
My history, full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin' hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
Is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin' let him die
Can't lie I'm a thug, drownin' in my own blood
Lookin' for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President

Blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin' low?
Y'all sniffin' blow and postin' what they hittin' fo'?
Tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin'
Til then we gonna keep it comin, Mr. President, hehe
And I meant every word in my letter to the President

Word motherfuckin' life
Fuck this nigga think?
Cuttin' taxes, takin' off welfare

To make a dollar in these here streets
I mean shit, I hear you screamin' peace
But we can't find peace
Til my little niggas on these streets get a piece
I know you feel me cause you too near me not to hear me
So why don't you help a nigga out?
Sayin' you cuttin' welfare
That got us niggas on the street, thinkin' who in the hell care?
Shit, y'all want us to put down our glocks and our rocks
But y'all ain't ready to give us no motherfuckin' dollars
What happened to our 40 acres and a mule fool?
We ain't stupid
Think you got us lookin' to lose
Tryin' to turn all us young niggas into troops
You want us to fight your war
What the fuck I'm fightin' for?
Shit, I ain't got no love here
I ain't had a check all year
Taxin', all the blacks and

Outlawz,"Dear Lord
As we down here, struggle for as long as we know
In search of a paradise to touch (my nigga Johnny J)
Dreams are dreams, and reality seems to be the only place to go
The only place for us
I know, try to make the best of bad situations
Seems to be my life's story
Ain't no glory in pain, a soldier's story in vain
And can't nobody live this life for me
It's a ride y'all, a long hard ride

Somebody break me I'm dreamin', I started as a seed the semen
Swimmin' upstream, planted in the womb while screamin'
on the top, was my pops, my momma screamin' stop
From a single drop, this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
Only plan he had for momma was to fuck her and abuse her
Even as a little seed, I could see his plan for me
Stranded on welfare, another broken family
Now what was I to be, a product of this heated passion
Momma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of ass
Look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me
Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive? Got me askin' white Jesus
will a nigga live or die, cause the Lord can't see us
in the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybody's sleepin'
I open my window jump to the streets and get to creepin'
I can live or die, hope I get some money 'fore I'm gone
I'm only 19, I'm tryin' to hustle on my own
on the spot where everybody and they pops tryin' to slang rocks
I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
Don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks glocks or a herringbone
You can ask my man Ishmael Reed
Keep my nine heated all the time this is how we grind
Meet up at the cemetery then get smoked out, pass the weed nigga
That Hennessey'll keep me keyed nigga
Everywhere I go niggas holla at me, ""Keep it real G""
And my reply til they kill me
Act up if you feel me, I was born not to make it but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise

Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)
Please give me to the sky (the sky)
And if (and if) I die (I die)
I don't want you to cry

I stay sharp as always
Runnin' ya bricks with blitz, through ya project hallways
Dumpin' crews like two's, nigga all day
Secrets of war prepare me for the worst
A life that's lavish full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
But now my dreams it seems though, be placin' triple beams and things bro
Diamond pinkie ring got the loot poppin' out my jeans

Now I plan to keep my glock cocked
If trouble was searchin' for me then why not?
Show em what I'm made of plus raised on, on my block
Chancellor Ave, where many turn to the street, thugs snatchin' bags
We out for power, makin' cash it wasn't fast it'll make me mad
I'm just like, pimpin'
My homey on the corner with his gat tucked, in
Youngest they buckin' somethin' the life he leads
the life he don't need, don't we all know
He tryin' to rise up and we just go doe, still he rise

Dreams of lost hope
I hit the strip broke where the fiends get coke
and still I rise now I float cowards ghost
Whenever we come around, I'm runnin' down
clutchin' a pound, live as sirens, duckin' the sound
I used to hustle with my moms til the sun came
My homey Harm doin' time from this drug game
Stolen cars, war scars, born a Outlaw
Behind bars, go to sleep just to see the stars
Freedom is ours, though we trapped on a firm block
Crackheads only ten learn to duck cops

In ninety-six my glock's my plastic, passion for blastin' bastards
No faces for open caskets, peelin' ya cap backwards
Ya cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
I send my missiles through your mattress
Leavin' holes in your body like a cactus
While me and my crew be boppin' more greens than topic
and loot to keep the seams in my motherfuckin' jeans poppin'
Leavin' ya spleen to pick up
Half of you niggas is softer than a Snicker
Let's go to war and see who draw quicker
and still I rise, and still I rise

Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)
Please give me to the sky (the sky)
And if (and if) I die (I die)
I don't want you to cry

Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)

Tell me how you feel homey
(Yeah, it took a week to go down)
You recollects and see how crasy it sounds
The whole town's on a mission, adolescents (penitentiary bound)
(Now introducin' Young Trigga)
Since birth, eyes set on gettin bigger
Just anotha wild-ass nigga
(But he was fiendin' for Precious) What?
(But Precious was a ghetto girl)
Couldn't be no sex without that gold Lexus
(But Lil' Trigga was heartbroken, he had to get his papers)
Seein' visions of people smokin' and niggas catchin' vapors
Got his man from around the corner (we'll call him Lil' Mo)
(Been in so many reform schools they had to let him go)
(Here's where the plot thickens)
They got a plot to make a profit with they glocks spittin'
(They call the squad, hittin' blocks with they guns blowin')
(Somebody's gonna die tonight)
Still no one's knowin', so they kept goin
Catchin' dealers comin' out they cars (will they survive?)
(Two semi-automatic nines, them niggas died)
(Plus nobody in the hood cries, it's like they celebrate
To death and wish they could die) So peep the lesson

Familiar face, but a man now, it's Lil' Trigga
Now Lil' Mo was a soldier to the fullest
Down for his homies, always the first to spit bullets

Never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love

Now Precious is pregnant, Lil' Trigga is happy
He wants to marry her now (not knowin' he ain't the daddy)
But Precious was lonely while Lil' Trigga was makin' dough
She's slippin' in secret places and gettin' with Lil' Mo
The neighborhood's buzzin, now people are talkin'
Lil' Trigga's gettin' pictures of the both of 'em walkin'
(Hand in hand, couldn't understand)
How his baby's mama could disappear with another man
(And his best friend)
Now jealousy's dangerous, and if you don't believe me
Then watch the way that this story ends and maybe you'll see
There ain't no heroes or villains, ain't no pleasure in killin'

Behind the curtains their privacy lust is already laid down
The results is the same with different names and it turns out

Y'all know how it is, same old thing in the same old town
Lil' Trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick, now he's played out
Think it's Lil' Mo (was plottin' plans on gettin' bigger)
(Precious was his way to put his hands on Lil' Trigga)
All the while let's look at Precious
Too dumb to see what's goin' down (too doped up to ask questions)
Used to be comrades (but now we blast on sight)
What could be so bad (God, will we last tonight?)
From misdemeanors to felonies, small-time to sellin' Ki's
I can't believe the shit they tellin' me

And if we die let the world understand why
Soldier my eyes hate to see a young thug cry
They seeing us inside a casket
That's how they see us
Oh God forgive us ghetto bastards 
We human beings
They leaving us inside this hell-hole
Just waiting to fail so they tell us 
That's what jail for
Adolescence young teens turned violent
It's floating, in a world turned silent

Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life

I live life High Speed 
Moving a million miles per hour
Towards my destiny
Making decisions carelessly
Yeah it's me, yo nigga man child
Bomb first stand proud
Ain't looking for hand-outs
Twenty-five years up in this bitch
And I'll be damned if I ain't leaving rich
And leave my kids a grip
I let my blood drip off in this thug shit
You can be touched, I catch you slippin' while I'm on a money mission
Like right now, 30 dollars to my John Hancock
Try to get mo' so my shit don't flock
I lick off shots for everything they owe me
And when it's my time to go
I pray the Lord hold me (You can be touched)

I was born in the city that never sleeps
Schooled by the realest of the real niggas 
That ever breathed
And I was big when I was young
And now I see that I was dumb
My nigga, Lonnie just got hit with 10, 10 years
For trusting a friend
They left him stuck in the Penn
I love him, we all here just to die here, plus
Nobody cares what got here
Touched by a angel and kissed by the Lord
Praise the thug ways and I'll never be bored
Touched by a angel and kissed by the Lord
Y'all praise the thug ways 
So forever it's on, baby

God forbid I'm touched, y'all keep living it up
Look and learn
Next it could be your turn, word

That got me here thinking robbery
Day to day all year long 
Teflon protects my body
It's such unimportant in this criminal cartel
I'm caught and supporting me 
So in these streets of hockey
I play the goalie, 
Secretz to war licks, and score shit
Share between clients and homies 
Remember what Patcino told me
Before he past
Watch them clowns with them crocodile smiles
Cause they phony, I get that cash, stay lonely
And I'm point like a thong 
And it's survive for the strong
Living outside the laws of this crooked world

Though it was dreams when he first told me Now it's true
I got love for you only to a certain extend
Niggas ain't worth shit
Cops and ride dick permits

I heard this and heard that 
About them O-you-T Lawz
Some of them soldiers got shot
Some of them soldiers fell off

Fuck y'all now everybody tied to us
Hollering out a nigga name 
But never said what up

You sure to see about 10 niggas in a bedroom
Eating off the same spoon
Sweeping with the same broom
It's hazard, it's you don't want yo life 

Well give me grab it
I was born inside a love zone
With a glock-nine young marriage
It's critical

Then one of them sat down living so 
Mystikal and impious
With a heart full of anger it's so ridiculous
So give me some with 21-gun soldier salute

With a 19-inch black handle snake knife in my boots
I'm straight from the strong, thug to your life
Right to yo wrong, I'll put the good to your evil
I'm the shells to your chrome, you dig that?

I'm life, I'll bring the moon to your night
I'll put the dick to your wife 
And I'm the Jesus of your Christ
You dig that? respect this

I'll bring the end to your claw
I'll bring the loc to your heart
And I'll put the snoop on yo dogs
You hear me? 

We follow, this little bullet so hollow
I can promise that ecstasy ain't promised tomorrow
With this two man mades
Me and my soul death astrayed

I watch my parents get blowed away
Now look what it made
I'm something to face
This lunacy then with me, then with chemistry

Got my eyes on you, the first time you cross me
I'll be frying you, cause y'all don't know me

Too busy trippin' off his shine
Now one time for my muthafuckin' Outlawz

Some Alize and Cristal guaranteed to get right
Like misdemeanors is a small thang
With DJ Quik in this b****, I let my balls hang
Runnin' through the street lights, 'cause we like, yo n****
Get your mobb on show 'em what a G like
Around the corner it's like Vegas, or better yet like Reno
N****s poppin, welcome to our casino, 'cause you and me know
Hundred percent like a c-note
Lookin' for a b**** that's half-black and Filipino
And when I meet her I'ma offer her some indo
Tongue-kissing on the window of a pearl white limo
Don't wanna be your man, I'm your n****
Touch me here, I'll get bigger
While I'm diggin' I'll get deep into your liver
I'm game type
Love f***in' b****es in the same night
My words are aphrodisiacs if you say 'em right

The city's full of surprises, you can live or you can die
You can f*** on the first night, or try, in the late night

Around my way we lamp, many styles get cramped
I clock rocks in the rain 'til my socks is damp
Ain't nothin' like bein' a thug when I can just
Sit on the Row of Death straight knowin' that I'm blessed
Hussein Fatal, flawless fatality
Overdosin' on crime, three steps from reality
Get up to get down, represent your town, last night
Was poppin' like like c***ed Glocks with hollow-tip rounds

From booty calls to bail sheets, it ain't no tellin'
If I wake up in the county in my jail sheets
My intuitions and ambitions up in the late night
Probably involves me comin' up with just to see another day
Might be me who bites the bullet
In these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who tryin' to burn me
I'm like a pit in a cage, spittin' my shells in a gauge
Deadly as AIDS, n****s gettin' crossed like a maze
Now picture me livin' my life like a king, maybe one day
Until then I'm livin' Monday through Sunday
Bringin' the Gunplay for all these beefs and battles
When we collide, I'm a ride on that hide like cattle
Cowards best to skedaddle in the late night

N****s in low-lows, pursuin' mo' hoes, then go home
The life of a California star, and when you see me
In the drop-top Jag', how many n****s wanna be me?
Game is automatic, mandatory I sell
To Live or Die, I survive, but with a story to tell
'Cause when you gettin' some riches, watch for dumb b****es
They have you labelled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissing
It's a mean world n**** you strapped, or be a throwaway
Will I survive the late night, to see dawn of day?
Nobody knows me, I'm a shadow
My army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
'Cause when I'm out in the streets, I'm on point, where the static?
Too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
I disappear whenever heated, ride whenever needed
For my n****s up in Clentin gettin' weeded
Continue to roll until I'm old, ride until I die
Supply long as you motherf***ers buy
My homies rolled by in a bucket, but they ain't short and duckin'
Slappin' n****s known for tellin' b****es f*** it in the late night

Yo, I've been abducted by the block
But I had to escape
Imagine my fate
Traveling and stacking the cake
After my wake
Bust 25 for me
'Cause I'll ride for y'all
And y'all ride for me
I ain't trying to have no sad story in the end
Me and my people all we want is glory in the end
I ain't gonna tell you again
Start thinking about your future nigga
No extra weight 'cause we ain't got nothing to do with you
If  time is money you wasting the clock
Pacing the block
They hooked now tasting the rock
Thinking of Pac and Yak
So we mash blinded
Gonna be Hell 4 a Hustla
Till the gats find me
And you can ask 1-2
He used to be on new
And you can ask swift gotti
Don't shit get by me
Ask tommy showtime if I did my time
And you can ask L Dog if I ever felt y'all
And ask rock jock if I ever chopped rocks

Hmm, damn, I feel ya
Turn, nope, don't nobody care
These Outlawz feel y'all (yup)
Yeah, don't nobody care
Sometime it get like that (When it feel like don't nobody care)
It seems like nobody care (nope, not nobody)
I care though, listen

[Kastro - Verse 1]
I been so sick lately, bellyin and not achy
These issues keep me with pistols for safety
I got plans that the cops ain't included in
And not a handcuff or shell could hold em in
Right at the end of my road, who been there before?
Now that I'm dead, it's like I've been dead before
Same story, it's raw, I'm an outlaw
A bread warhead, K-Dogg is a warrior
And when I stand, I stand on my own two
If I fall, I land on my own two
A soldier, and it been like that
Pac and Yak see us now and they could see all that
Who really care? Fuck the tarry hair
And the rest of the Outlawz was without a share
Don't nobody care, just like I thought
So I just stare at the world like I don't give a fuck

[Napolean - Verse 2]
I remember them days when it was dark outside
The only thing I felt I had was my nuts and my pride
I was different than them niggaz on the block sellin drugs
But I was always with em, actin like a thug
Runnin through the mud cause the cops was on us
We just walkin home from school but they always on us
It's like this, the streets is so lovely
I love the streets, because the streets made me
The ghetto seems so in peace
Man, that I moved to the suburbs and there's more police
Where I'm from, a fiend'll pack a gun
Overton, Jersey the harder the slum
But I made it up outta there, thanks to the Lord, kid
But I'll never leave my box alone, nigga I swear (swear)
And to the young kids wearin the streets do
I know nobody don't care, but the Outlawz do (cause we do)

[Chorus - Young Noble]
We stack clips, glack licks in the air
Smoke sticks on the stairs, dog, nobody care (nobody care)
We shot the fear when everybody was there
Beat each other half to death, but homie nobody care (nobody care)
My momma wasn't there and my poppa wasn't there
Couldn't find em anywhere cause nobody cared, yeah
We split mills, pop pills and shit
Ten on the floor, ten in the bed, damn, nobody care

[Young Noble - Verse 3]
Yo, hard times as a youngsta
Scarred by the hunger, wonder
How many gonna die this summer (die this summer)
We loud like thunder roamin the strip
Now everybody act cool, we approachin the vip (come on, come on)
Smokin a stick, hit, cause we live for this (live for this)
Just like shit is hard raisin kids in this
I got 'Outlaw' tatted on my stomach and all (stomach and all)
We can fight and hang out later like nothing is wrong
Laise your Timms up tight cause the ride is rough (uh)
You can tighten my cuffs, I'm still likin the cuffs (come on)
Fuck this and that, cause I'mma get you back (uh-huh)
I know you mother fuckers sick and wish that I couldn't rap
Hatin already waitin till my pockets is fat (uh)
Would you rather see me incarcerated, locked in the back? (come on)
Cockin a strap, have your whole block in a gat (yeah)
Every body down flat, where them dollars at? (uh, oh yeah)

[EDI Mean - Verse 4]
I put my faith in the Lord, pray for patience in war
Now only time'll tell if he heard me before
I see myself in the mirror, young nigga full of flaws
But in the streets, I'm a hero cause I give it to em raw
I'm just my momma's second son, and I just bought me a gun
Cause some niggaz want some, and I ain't got nothin for em
Me and my niggaz stay hungry, strivin for the old and gray money
Ridin while these niggaz think it's funny
But ain't a damn thing funny to a nigga like me (nah)
When you sittin on your ass broke and thirty
And don't nobody care about your sob story (nah)
I work so hard homie, you better be about your money (homie)
Oh yeah, it goes both ways, and momma used to say
'The Lord'll help those who help themselves'
I keep my eyes on the prize so there ain't no chance for me fail
Cause don't nobody give a fuck when you livin in hell

The only time I see my family 
When a relative die 
When you gone 
No pain 
Is it better to die 
Baby girl think I'm shy 
But I'm crying inside 
No tears in the jungle 
I'm a lion inside 
Nigga don't cry 
Like I said on the song 
God forbid I die early 
Please accept that I'm gone 
I lived mine 
Accomplished a lot in my time 
Soldier 
I sold mils for Pac 
Still I Rise 
You sympathize 
But I don't need it all 
But while we hearing breathing 
With the love that y'all 
We Outlawz 

Chorus 2x : Edi 

Some day 
One day we gotta go 
When and where 
Whom and why 
Nobody knows 
But when that day comes 
I'm ready to roll 
'Cause they won't roll when I go 

Verse 2: Edi 

Man 
Shit ain't right 
Yo it just ain't adding up 
My closest is gone 
I'm mad as fuck 
I'm more hurt than anything 
Not knowing what to do 
Completely wrapped up in confusion 
No clues 
Trusting other niggas thinkin shit is all gravy 
Mind unfocused 
'Cause I'm smoking daily 
Rolling with big ass body guards 
Niggas 
No guns 
Supposed to be protecting your ass 
He having fun 
Man fuck a vest 
My nigga did with one on 
Too much of a shock to my brain 
I could not mourn 
Do not shed a tear 
Close my eyes 
Said a prayer 
Hoping the lord let him in when he got there 
Still ride for Pac and Yak 
Seike too 
Still fucking the world 
You know how Edi do 
But I'm still crippled by the pain 
Still feel like I'm to blame 
Still want to go insane everytime I here your name man 

Chorus 2x 

Verse 3:  Kastro 

They say blood's thicker than water 
And I say love is thicker than blood 
Who's wrong 
And what's love 
With no honor and trust 
So I'd rather not bother 
Nothing much to discus 
These cards 
Dealt by God 
To my table 
Ain't the best 
And pretty much unstable 
And I don't know 
My friend from my foe 
So I move fast 
Think about shit slow 
Rightfully so 
I got my gun 
And walk through the slums 
Bubbling like gum 
Wide open 
I think I need more Motrin 
These streets is hot 
Man these bitches is smoking 
And everybody for out for self out here 
Man ain't no love left out here 
Just blood in my eye 
I can't even cry 
I wonder why 
So I don't even try 

Chorus  4x",When I Go,2000
Outlawz,"In the event of my demise
when my heart can beat no more
I hope I die for a principle 
Or a belief that I have lived for
I will die before my time
Because I feel the shadow's depth
So much I wanted to accomplish 
Before I reached my death
I have to come to grips with the possibility
And wiped the last tear from my eyes
I loved all who were positive
In the event of my demise

In the event of my demise don't shed no tear
I'll share my wisdom with the world, they'll know I was here
Know I was clear, every thing I said I meant
A outlaw, when I was born they prepared my ditch
Said I won't live long, statistic showed
I'm tryna past 24 realistic goal, listen all
You gotta stay cold inside
That's what I tell myself when I feel alone sometime
But I can't cry, I don't tear no more
I love god, from death I don't fear no more
A part taken in this movement to better my people
Though they see me on TV, I tell them we equal
Don't look at me as a stranger, I'm one of your own
We was rised in concrete and grew as a rose
Still I rise, but never get a chance to fly
Mama please don't cry 
In the event of my demise

In the event of my demise
can't breathe no more
hope I die for a principle 
something I lived for
dying before my time
feel the shadows of depth
Trying to fulfill all my dreams before I reach my death
came to grips with the possibility
The world's killing me, and my soldiers die young with no sympathy
I wipe the last tear from my eyes
I loved all who stand strong
In the event of my demise

If I should die before I awake
let my family be straight of the money I make
Give my son, what he needs, other than his father
Is it self respect, better get his honor
with the law come to swallow my soul, it's so big
Cause the street took enough of my life, we all see
It's a cycle make you feel psycho
Everything struggles behind this man, see nobody love you
Got a piece of the streets and it's gonna die with me
may your, soul forgive me
Makaveli's within me
In principle we stand by stronger than power
We gon' die by the rules you can never devour
On the earth from my birth fell nothing but pain
Only thing I ever gave was the baby the name
That's my heart, and if I should go I'll go on in sparks
That's the event of my demise, and it lurks in the dark

[Chorus]

Now as I stand here, a man here
Not a perfect one, but a searching one
Seek in another, blazing time
Sound crazy but I'm actually tryin' to escape my mind
Tryna rise in time
but hoping that you didn't notice
When i was at my low as
So I knew they were watching, I couldn't stop it
So many things I wanted to accomplish
Too many dreams, wasted with no promise
From out the darkness I struggle to see the light
Rumble deep in the night
Hustlin' with all of my might
Some won't see it that way
But us is given praise
But all of them will dream
That I did it my way
In the event of my demise

I was born to a storm that won't lead up
And I was raised to stay brave with my head up
But thing ain't got better
We still gettin' wetter in this bad weather
I need more than a sweater and a leather
Yo, ain't nothin' meant to last forever
So the struggling and the ?starving? ain't gon' last forever
And my will, probably be like two lines long
It will read I'm dead but my soul lives on
And my spirit still living though my body is gone
In the event of my demise I love all who stay strong
I love all who stay strong
In the event of my demise, com'on

In the event of my demise
when my heart can beat no more
I hope I die for a principle 
Or a belief that I have lived for
I will die before my time
Because I feel the shadow's depth
So much I wanted to accomplish 
Before I reached my death
I have to come to grips with the possibility
And wiped the last tear from my eyes
I loved all who were positive

You gon' croak
Suckin' up that smoke

I'm like a ball of smoke
Blown from a crackpipe
Into the hands of the street
My.. father to be since the age of 5
Real cold you gotta be just to stay alive
We the second hand smoke of a fiend generation
Swear we will
But they know we won't make it
Smoking a ciggarete
Breathin' ya last breath
Tasting my own death
Rest on my home steps
And just vision all the karma and all the drama
Inherited the pain of a lost father
Heavy black raining
With no umbrella
Life's like a dice game
You can throw whatever
And it might not be in your favor
And now ya worst enemy becomes ya neighbor
And that's life
Everything happens twice
Breathin' second hand smoke from my ancestors' pipes
(God help us)

The streets dog gave birth
Another nutty baby
Plus the son of a ghetto widow might make him crazy
On his own since he 16
Turning the block out
Sleep in the crack house
Making his cash routes
Fiendin' on the side
This nigga scheming on the side
This nigga....
Cream is always on his mind
Ain't been the same since he bought that .9
Promised him a life of crime
But he ain't been the same since he bought that .9
He was once a child of god
But he ain't been the same since he bought that .9
Listen to me closely
I'ma tell you how it roast me
He's a victim of second hand smoke and choking
It's only cause he lonely cause his father ain't home
Became a victim of the gunsmoke..... he gone (damn)
Second hand smoke

And you could see it in my grill
And I can't chill
Too much my blood don' spilled
I give you the deal
Just to see if you can feel
I grind for mines
I don't cheat and I don't steal
I'm about a half a mil from a half a mil
And I'd still be this real without a rapper deal
And thus.... I fight a truck for a pot of luck
And bite dust so my kids don't hurt this much
We come a long way
Still we got lots to learn
We.... toss and turn like a roster burn
So I'm concerned
Youngster, I'm still amongst ya
We grew up in the sewer
Raised up in the dumpsters
It's like we all suffer for somebody other
Born from my daddy to my baby mother
All my folks
All born with high hopes
Crying.... dying from second hand smoke

Hold the fuck up nigga why you lookin so tough
You don't know that I'm an outlaw and I'll fuck you up
Punk nigga, the street change everyday,
But I'ma change a long will 'cause the streets where I lay
Nowadays it ain't about runnin your mouth
It's bout (gun cocked) and (gunshots); assed out
Turnin me out nigga, I turn the streets out
With this underground thug shit that killers come out
Where the gunz be at, where the money be at
I stand full, nothin but the uncut shit I'm hardcore
And ain't nothing changed since back in the day
Just new money frays and new hand grenades
When the war pops off I'ma knock the street lights off
y'all some paper back soldierz nigga you too soft
And killin in my raps I'm too real for that
But if I say I'ma do it, if you say you have too, prove it to me

It ain't nothin but a freshin to me
And if ya fuckin with me,
Then you can die if you want to nigga
And all my life I had issues with me

And if you soft too me
Then you can die if you want to nigga
You act tough
And you can die if you want to nigga
You in a rush
And you can die if you want to nigga

I'm a street nigga, check my background
I did a couple of driveby's with the fo-pound
And I was never ever scared to bust a couple of rounds
It's all in me, my whole family was raised wrong
Nigga, my whole team strong, buck buck, double glock dead wrong
And imitatin Pac nigga, you know you wrong
And runnin your mouth will get a gun in your house
There is money down south so I gotta take some
There is money on the west coast I gotta chase some
There is money on the east coast I gotta take some
So I bought me a gun, I'm bout to rob everyone
It's like a 2000 jack the rapper, fall down
Empty down your pockets nigga and pass it around
And what was you thinkin when Pac was around
He wasn't trainin Outlawz to burn shit down
I strategize for the dough dough, cock block with the fo-fo
send four more at the po-po, his whole ass like Zorro
it's real nigga so I'ma bleed for mine
with money on my mind I'ma get it, it's mines nigga

Hustlin' and bubblin' 
And ain't ask niggaz for nothin' (shit) 
Shit that made other cliqs I split 
Made us tighter
Fuck the industry
Cause I ain't no dick rider
You see me nigga

Still eatin', still breathin' 
Still reackin' off that cali shit
And I ain't never want muthafuckas to handle shit
You see me pushin' .22's?

Worse the betrayal

Stay away from the barrel
And I ain't never been a rat
Or been scared to ride
A lot of niggaz act tough
But know they pie inside
Death before dishonor

When a nigga say he love you
But all awhile he don't think nothin' of you
And that's just what love do
Stab ya in the heart
Grab you in the dark
And rip families apart
Damn... we was supposed to be fam
We had plans
Now I claim to understand you
I guess life is a gamble
I shook the dice
But I betted on the peasent
Then I took a dive
Like oohhhhh.... 
How come I ain't know
I should've seen it was simply soul
Now I know.... what's loyalty
It's all clear to me
These words is for the birds
You ain't real to me
Life is a liar
Got me spinning like the tires
Hug a drunk driver, back and forth
you ain't ready and you petty
So I laugh it off
But it's a cost to be the boss
You gon' pay for not being loyal

I'm damn near 'bout to go in tears
Writin' this verse here
I feel like I'm cursed here
I'm choked up since I lost my peers
But I know one day we be back again
One love to my Mexicans
Tryin' to run across the border
To see freedom all over again
Man... One love to my Africans
They try to kill us with AIDS
But they smart again
It's like I die once that I be born again
With the grace of Allah
Kept away my sins
From the ghetto where they play with heavy metal to win
Lost my parents so I moved with my next-of-kin
Life.... just so mych pain to me
To tell the truth I don't want to die angrily
Makaveli and Kadafi, them trained me
I feel y'all in the dark steady hatin' me

Hard to believe one night in Vegas changed all that

Back for everything they owe

The heart of a soldier
The mind of a militant
Was blessed by my mother
The inspiration of my life

With 15 years on the pipe

Never forget her mah'

Needles and pens
These 2 Tims was my Beemer
Before I heard of a Benz
I got lost tryin' to find my ends
And got crossed tryin' to find me a friend
That's life.... 
We sacrifice for better days
We pray for a better way that never came
Hey! (hey.. hey)
What's more precious then a innocent child, smilin'
??? was foul, look at his smile
School's not cool
Them big body rules
The workin' mans a fool
If he can't afford the jewels
Look at how life use ya
Abuse and confuse ya
Remember we was suppose to be the future?
Now we grown
The future is here and we gone
Oh where did we go wrong
Let's live...
And do right by these kids my friend
They the only shot we got at living life again
c'mon

All the little homies postin' near
Thug walkin' to the dance floor while I'm chokin' a beer
I got a little hot mama with a lot of dollaz
She can spend that shit on me
Instead of mines up
Bringin' it back to the days when it first started
Bringin' it back to the ways that were cold-hearted
Noble farted like my shit don't stink
I like her mouth real wet
Her pussy real pink
So holla at cha dog
Just make sure you swallow it all
And when you cuttin' up bottle it all

I'll do it again if the girl was broke
Imma street wise nigga
You flipped the prize nigga
Fo'Fo' five cause my bank account bigger
You could look in my eyes
You'll be scaring yo-self
Cause ain't nothin' worse then a World Wide Mobb Figga
I blew this hoe from San Juan, Puerto Rico
Put her up in eco, you know
Let me say no more

Gettin' hoes ???

[Chorus: Edi]
We ain't stoppin' til we get enough
What's poppin'?

Let a muthafucka know if you can crush in the ride

[Edi]
Imma straight playa
Type to hata-hata
Type to kick back if the shack blow evader
Type to bump yo hoe then I'll let her keep ho'in
Type to see the law then I just keep going
I'm a Outlaw baby, now you after that
Awo.. She fuck ?? to  fuckin' with that
I don't sniff no coke

But I shoot shit to kill
Lately, I got cha gone off the Red Bull & Vodka
Now ya own ya knees

True me, it's the California way
You got 2 more homies?

Life as a rap star shouldn't be so rough
They gon' find you buried in the backyard
Keep talkin' bout us

Let a muthafucka know if you down tonight

[Chorus: Edi + Young Noble]

But we the last motha fuckaz breathin
You don't believe us then watch us ya tuned in
To them Outlaw ridaz, block survivors
Killa Kadafi beside us
Reppin that thug shit until they bury or hide us
Tellin all of my street souljah's to rise up
From East to West Coast yo, don't let 'em stop ya
It's a cold, hard way we livin
Can't out just me, and live to smoke a little
Watch my children grow a little
Get this money, escape the prison
My jail niggaz doin time I feel ya pain, get out rise
It ain't nothin but a come up
Outlaw Recordz it's official street niggaz gettin this money legal
We all in together now, ballin together now
Secrets of war young busta you better learn about
Bust, if you must, plus
Get in the business when the jealous niggaz fuck with us

(Chorus-Kastro)
We was taught, at all costs hold down fort
And let the Lord be the judge in this all out court
Where money, power, guns is boss
And countin big funs is the favorite sport
We must rise, maximize our size
Look alive, be advised it's a war outside
It's like dodge city, not pretty
But don't nobody notice it really you feel me, we must rise

(Verse 2-Napoleon)
Pause nigga 'fore these shells fall with ya
'Bout to four fifth ya, still don't get the picture
Thuggin on 'em actin sleep when I'm plottin on 'em
This little bitty bullet will make his body turn rotten on 'em
Sick them rottweiler's on him, did snatch some dollars from him
Bling bling that punk nigga, take the diamonds from him
Never had no love for him, nigga we solo
Passin out bullets like they promo
Oh no, Outlawz comin through
Nothin but trouble too, we still do the shit that Pac used to do
Who would of knew, that I'd be pointin guns at you
Takin funs from you, makin fun at you
Busta, ain't nothin but a Jersey ride nigga
Have my fanny so white, enough to sniff lines nigga
Napoleon, a.k.a Maximus 
My plans for this, is rise up, stack chips, nigga rise

(Chorus-Kastro)
We was taught, at all costs hold down fort
And let the Lord be the judge in this all out court
Where money, power, guns is boss

Look alive, be advised it's a war outside
It's like dodge city, not pretty
But don't nobody notice it really you feel me, we must rise

(Verse 3)
(Young Noble)
Addicted to adrenaline rush
That the streets give off from 5-0 when the heat bust off
And I paint it the same 'cause I mastermind
And every game ain't the same gotta change with the times
And get left behind, blessed by God
The judge tryin to stretch the charge
Young niggaz gotta rise up fuck the narcs 
Motha fuckaz can't take orders
You ain't a souljah nigga don't blame Noble
It's the life of ya kid 25 to life bid
Four five to wig, dyin tryin to live
The streets is a restin place and yesterday
And nigga ain't no such thing as extra pay
So give me mine today, and get yours tomorrow
Nigga Pac left the Thug Life love to follow
And I'm O-you-T loyal 'till my casket drop
Hustle hard 'till it's hard for the cash to stop, we must rise

(Big Syke)
Makaveli Kadafi, meant to Big Kato
Only ridaz in this day that's killin willin and able
Gang related incorporated, you can't fade it 
Haters gotta hate and ridaz glad that we made it
Make it take it to the next level
Now change the game, fuck the fame
Bang 'em scrape on the hang
It ain't no thang to rise above the rest
Pass any test, you mention Thug Life you mention the best
So invest in a vest, come bang with the best
The sunrise in the East but my set in the West
Still risin for my nigga Stretch, keep a tech
My paper stay risin whether cash or check

(Chorus-Kastro)
At all costs hold down fort
And let the Lord be the judge in this all out court
Where money, power, guns is boss
And countin big funs is the favorite sport
We must rise, maximize our size
Look alive, be advised it's a war outside

So many stories in the city I live in
I soak up the game, that everyone plays
I'm not the one so when they get caught sleepin
Out for the glory, there's so many stories around my way

It's been hard on us, day by day
Watchin my step gotta play where I lay
Now why this mother fucker want to test me out
It's this thang I'ma protect myself and blow his brains out

Cold on the streets never talk on the phone
And the main thing is never bring a snake in your home
But that's hard black, why?
'cause half the time them niggaz be in your face

smilin and shit but you don't know that
And I don't know why that nigga jealous of me
When he could do the same shit that pay me
In the streets breed a lot of killaz

That's why corners full of hate and the young ones is cap peelers 
But they don't feel us when we're drownin in our own blood
And they don't know when we go home it's no love
So what's the use of us carin and shit
And that's the reason we buy guns, load 'em up and spit 'em at shit

So many stories in the city I live in

[Young Noble]
I know niggaz that was kings that turned into fiends
The nigga lost everything jewels and dreams
He losin teams, the murder rate higher than ever
Niggaz need more than weed gettin higher than ever

Nuts in the streets my roots ain't nothin but deep
Niggaz roam with the heat just for somethin to eat
Niggaz sell to under covers then snitch on they brothers
Everybody sayin fuck us, I know God love us

(Mil a.k.a Hellraza)
I was raised when I cried in the household
Turned me into a nut
But these niggaz didn't know 
Just from bein home I seen enough before I learned the streets

I knew all about a gun 'cause my background was deep
A little dirty nigga holdin my pants when I run
It's a chance you gotta take everyday in the slums
This for the hoods where, certain people scared to come
I had a heart as a young nigga, now I don't fear none

[Chorus]
So many stories in the city I live in
I soak up the game, that everyone plays
I'm not the one so when they get caught sleepin
Out for the glory, there's so many stories around my way

I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
What more can I say it been that way a long time
And anybody, who think that rude
Can suck my dick until they spit my baby girl need food

I was young, when Pac put my hands on a gun
And told me life is what you make it
And stripes you gotta take them
It took a while for me to over stand

I was only 12 but I felt like a grown man
And livin on, and that which does not kill me can only make me strong
But ya'll niggaz don't hear me though
My souljah story, for glorious pain

While I'm game you niggaz playin, played out and lame
This shit hurt, my mind blind my dick in the dirt
And I'm so sick of bein tired, and tired of bein hurt
I search out the truth, and that shit worse

I swear it's a curse that the church can't nurse, come on

We goin all out (aiiiite)
We goin all out, watch ya motherfuckin mouth niggaz
(That's right, fuck these fag niggaz)
Do it, do it, do it

Come hell or high water, down to slaughter opposers
Just another lost soul, stuck, callin Jehovah
Outlaw 'til it's over, brand as my strap
Back like a cobra, I stay drunk, cause I'm a mad man
Whenever sober, on a one man mission
My ambition to hold up the rap game
While I pluck holes in niggaz like donuts
And still down to die for all my souljas
Like hillbillies, they don't fear me
So refuse bringin war to the city
With each breath, death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me, no apologies, your honor
A general in war, I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers, quick to move shit heavily armed
I'm similar to Saddam, sometimes I question Hussein
Like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me
I take the figure of dirty niggaz, who all got me
While bitches wonderin who shot me
No love, keep a grudge, shootin sluggs like Muammar Quadaffi
Murder my friends, build a new posse
We takin shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me
Another gay rapper, bustin caps to Jay-Z
(buck buck buck buck buck buck)
And still avoid capture, while y'all caught up in the rapture
Still after me, I'm in Jamacia sippin daquiris, no doubt
We used to havin nothin, then grabbin somethin and bustin
Wanted to be the thug-nigga, that my old man wasn't
I came to a field, catchin cases, litigation
Niggaz playa-hatin, got me crooked in all 50 states
I'm screamin DEATH ROW, throw my WESTSIDE, ain't no thang
We was raised off drive-by's, brought up to bang
We claim mob, M.O.B. if you be specific
We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific
And get this, I'm hard to kill, when I peel with this live spot
Father, how the hell did I survive, these five shots?
Live it up, of give it up, and my demons
Late night, hear them screamin; we goin all out!

We goin all out, bomb first till they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle ya own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga go all out
Bustas playin with ya peeps, betta go all out
Try'na see the next day, nigga go all out
Obstacles in ya way, you better go all out

I'm on my land sled, walkin through the belly of the beats
Feelin like I'm all out, drunk as can be
It's plain to see, that we mobb niggaz hidin' in bushes
Claimin that they ride rough, but they soft as they cushion
They softer than bitches in the worst way, drownin in blood
Outlawz my blood brothers, I'd die for these thuggs
Say hi to this slug, it's a shame how some niggaz on the west coast
Was ridin with Pac, but when he died, they went pop
I'm on the Jers to the fullest, like some west coast love
But after Pac stopped rappin, it ain't no west coast thug
Just westcoast what? To my real niggaz stuck in the street game
Cause rappers like Jay-Z be pumpin cool-Aid through they veins
Is it true what I'm sayin? Slap your soft ass to the floor
And watch my fo-fo put peek holes through your door
I ride or die, but these other fag niggaz be bitin this
It's all from my heart when I was writin this
All out

We goin all out, bomb first till they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt

Obstacles in ya way, you better go all out

Now, we all ride, and down to die who wit us
Speak up, or get treated like you comin to kill us
Ain't nothin but squealers, in this rap game, swearin they rough
Tattooed up, and now them niggaz swearin they Pac
Stop that, and watch ya back, we ain't forgot bout cha
These glocks hot, and when shot, it'll bring the bitch up out cha
It's me, Kastro with the goattee
Walkin' like a OG, cause all these fag motherfuckers owe me
I pray to the thug lord, like that motherfuckers holy
Frontline soulja, till the heavens call me
I go all out, and if you real, you real
Feel what I'm talkin' bout, cause this game is ill
I live it, forbidden fruit, shoot, 'till they feel it

But don't twist it 'cause none of y'all niggas worry me

M.O.B., n**** 'cause we mob on you tricks
and you know we keep it money over b****es

Thugs known to bust on sight
God bless my crazy life la vida loca homie livin' that thug life
Been raised in violence homicide's my lullaby
Came with the homies and learned to kick it until we die

Boss players you wonder why
I live the life of a ghetto kingpin, just let me ride
B****es and n****z in penitentiary suits
I send 'em letters and money orders and make 'em my troops

As for you females, I got no time, I gotta get mine
You cannot blind me addicted to a life of crime
My time as shorty was full of car chases
While runnin' with John Gotti's and Scarface's

N****s knew, I'd be the Don in my own crew
A million n****z with automatics who swarm through
You wonder who shot me here's a clue, stay alert
'Cause we comin' for you, and keep it money over b****es

[Chorus]

I blow you up on the spot, these glocks hot 'til you drop
All you wannabe cops, you don't want to see shots
I beef deep with the police peep what these streets do to me
Actin' all new to me I creep on you like puberty

You don't want to see the bad image of this scrimmage
From here to East Greenwich through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in the cooter, ten plates to soup ya
1 2's we ought a cruise right by the state troopers

When I'm drinkin' Cristal, start thinkin 'bout Al
Bacardi coverin' my body at the wink and a smile
Bag a hottie or two, cause butter shotties for you
I got more bodies then Drew, I drink Mynotti on New, f*** your crew

This type of s*** I do for a petty hobby
F*** the world it's Fatal dog against everybody

[Chorus]

My s***'s phenomenal, droppin' like domino
Comin' with the real yo and f*** what you feel yo
This is not for all the freaks in short skirts
This is for my n****z nationwide doin' work, get your feelings hurt

Lose mo' faith than a composure, money and the doja
B****es is a cobra with deadly venom
Move as smooth as I get 'em, stackin' G's
My n****s crosstown got ki's

Hoes get diseased and fleas, for these enemies money over b****es
(N****!)

[Chorus]

I'm hittin' sixteen switches, my money over b****es
The struggle continues I'll miss you on my road to riches
I'm contribed to strive never laggin'
Disappear in the night with my 64 dragon, rag flaggin'

As I get 'em up and leave 'em stuck
Pager blowin' up but I don't give a f***
I'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin'
Loc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven

So what can you do for me and what can I do for you
But stay true, and do the things that we do
Blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring
Reminded can't find it complications what the future brings

Losin' my mind why you sweatin' me all the time
I'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind
Rather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches
I'm 'bout my riches, money over b****es

[Chorus]

That's from the time a n**** close his eyes I'm hopin, I hope he awoken
Payin' my own that's tokin' chokin' off-a glocks smokin'
Money and power watch these b****es cause they skanless
Gettin' n****z f***ed 'n stuck from Timbuk' to Los Angeles

Ain't a n**** ruggeder than this grimy Heine' guzzler
Cowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin' ya
Me and my troops play blocks in groups, runnin' in flocks
Deuce-deuce in my socks keepin' a watch out for cops

Gettin' kicked, I keep my mind on my riches
While uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin my money over all my b****es

[Chorus: x2]

That's right n****
Money over motherf***in b****es
M.O.B. on 'em n****
Keep your motherf***in mind on your money, f*** these hoes

(Thug life baby) You don't need no motherf***in b****es
You need some motherf***in money
Get your mind right n****, keep your game tight
Play right play by the rules and you'll get paid f*** the fools

Sip off the Hennessey it's necessary to finish me
I'm in this social immortal when it comes to the phone book
Jersey them n****s they think I'm crazy and creepy
And as we speak they tryin' to find me a therapist
Rapid fire I clap and hire till you die a liar
Strap in back to the corners droppin' on to spin the tires
My man define ya 357 anaconda
This enough to bring your mama then turn around and hear the drama
Havoc I gotta have it steady blastin' at Prodigy
Mobb 6 feet deep you try to blast me till death
And I suppose you got the dopest moves like Chucky on fresh
You know the verdict, who what when why he died murdered
Get your physical diverted and your vision deserted

Ever since mama got f***ed and papa ducked out
Look at us murderous thugs showin' less love in the drug house
Similar to savage it's a wonder we manage
Bring chaos causin' damage on our quest for cabbage
They ask my style similar to cash we flaunt it
Most wanted by the population murdered you for it
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin' the war to the streets
Why fear me, fear the s*** I speak
Once this s*** drop it's heard on every f***in'' street
Like the sound of police who run the street really
And every hood let you grow 
From the hustlaz up at Harlem to the shot callers in O'
And though, Congress, don't want us to progress our step
My homie buried at an early age hustled to death
His last breath, a lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin'

Halfway thugs are bugged when we stalk the streets
Sort of like thugs and narcotics when we walk the streets
You speak the big p**** throw down and drop it
Hit you with 6 shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Getting mine with nine coked extorting
Block shots with 22's with my socks with the butt hangin' out the chalk
You never seen time I travel across the mean crime
My rolls like a million dollar bills folded in green slime
With my foes erased drink my henney straight no chasin'
Catch my body like Haitian 5 minutes from the station

Hit the hole like Allen Iverson with confidence
The bigger prick don't mean no evidence or proof the I was present
At the scene of the crime around 10 n****s bleed
After they made this punk fag motherf***er bleed
All the money was bloody as s***, y'all n****s shoulda seen it
Bust a cap and freak with, bow down on your knees s***
The glock to your head n****, don't let inside action
Hit innocent by-standers when he blasted, shot f***in' backwards
Little homies puttin' work for stripes
But is it worth your life a g-rides runnin' red lights
I wish somebody would have t old me then
Since I'm an outlaw like Napolean ain't no cell they can hold me in
Caucasian crazy like Arabians
Hold this spot like some n****s fade me in having the scene chase me
When they want the product n**** I got the smoke
Got the weed and the coke what you need what you want
What you working with I'm some immortal s***
Outlawz we straight hurtin' s*** use artillery to murder with
Put then on the box gangsta party like Pac
Life's hard from the ox me and my n****s on top

Burpin and smurkin got on his knees before I grave em

I don't doubt you
See the simple fact of the matter is they don't give a fuck about you
Or them five mouths you forced to feed (uh-huh)
No including yourself
All you want is what they perceiving as greed
So as you loaded up that mack and continue to buck em
I was on paper, thinking they don't give a fuck about us

I'm seeing it clearer
Hating the picture in the mirror
They claim we inferior
So why the fuck these devils fear ya?
I'm watching my nation die genocide the cause
Expect a blood bath
The aftermath is y'alls
I told ya last album, we need help cause we dying
Give us a chance, help us advance cause we trying
Ignore my whole plea, watching us in disgust

Down to catch a slug for me
Guaranteed to bleed deeply
Now that's love
Shit
Nobody else could give a fuck
If I'm tore down, from the floor down
Six-feet deep in the cut
What the fuck done went wrong
How long will I be mourned?
When I'm gone, same song
Ain't gave a fuck all along
And who am I to blame em?
Just do or die through the rainin'
Since they don't give a fuck
I don't
Feel what I'm saying?

I grew up on the other side of perfect, a life of hurtin'
Man I still hustle, so I'm dyin' certain

So I stay ballin' season to season
Why you stuck thinking that they give a fuck?

You tell me my world is in peace, but nigga your lying
'Cause half of my niggas, long gone, buried in the dirt just for trying
Sometimes I think my block is dying
And that it's awful
To wake up to another day, shit ain't change that all fool
I wake up sweatin', dreamin', coughin'
Seein' me upside down backwards head twisted
While I'm layin in the coffin
The shit comes around so often
So tell me something
Before I take it out on the world, and get to dumpin'
Nigga I been so through pain go through the struggle
Doin' the same thing you did at my age and that's hustlin'
On the edge of straight bustin'
Well since you don't give a fuck

Around the corner it's like Vegas, or better yet like Reno

Hundred percent like a c-note
Lookin' for a bitch that's half-black and Filipino
And when I meet her I'ma offer her some indo
Tongue-kissing on the window of a pearl white limo
Don't wanna be your man, I'm your nigga
Touch me here, I'll get bigger
While I'm diggin' I'll get deep into your liver
I'm game type
Love fuckin' bitches in the same night
My words are aphrodisiacs if you say 'em right
The club be poppin' so I'm stoppin' at the Fat Burger
Look through the paper it's another black crack murder
The city's full of surprises, you can live or you can die
You can fuck on the first night, or try, in the late night

I clock rocks in the rain 'til my socks is damp
Ain't nothin' like bein' a thug when I can just
Sit on the Row of Death straight knowin' that I'm blessed
Hussein Fatal, flawless fatality
Overdosin' on crime, three steps from reality
Get up to get down, represent your town, last night
Was poppin' like like cocked Glocks with hollow-tip rounds

From booty calls to bail sheets, it ain't no tellin'
If I wake up in the county in my jail sheets
My intuitions and ambitions up in the late night
Probably involves me comin' up with just to see another day
Might be me who bites the bullet
In these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who tryin' to burn me
I'm like a pit in a cage, spittin' my shells in a gauge
Deadly as AIDS, niggas gettin' crossed like a maze
Now picture me livin' my life like a king, maybe one day
Until then I'm livin' Monday through Sunday
Bringin' the Gunplay for all these beefs and battles
When we collide, I'm a ride on that hide like cattle
Cowards best to skedaddle in the late night

'Cause when you gettin' some riches, watch for dumb bitches
They have you labelled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissing
It's a mean world nigga you strapped, or be a throwaway
Will I survive the late night, to see dawn of day?
Nobody knows me, I'm a shadow
My army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
'Cause when I'm out in the streets, I'm on point, where the static?
Too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
I disappear whenever heated, ride whenever needed
For my niggas up in Clentin gettin' weeded
Continue to roll until I'm old, ride until I die

Locks it down, take it when I cock the pound
Rock ya town, and roll when the top is down

Toured with Yak, watching fake niggas spit out
Ignored the eyes, told them jake niggas ""get outta here""

Handiling techs, lick off and hit your man in the neck
And you was next, you ran so I spit on your back

Stop with your job, I cock and put my glock in ya eyes

The dawn comes after the night
And there's a silver lining surrounding every cloudy day
Seems like hard times been a friend of mine I can't shake
Still I rise with a clique of thugs they can't break
Pain mixed with rain and no sunshine
And all we wanted was to be happy just one time
We had no choice, no voice, only our faith in God
And the hunger to hustle and get this paper, Lord
Out in the cold, lost souls, nowhere to go
Hooked up with Jay [Name] then we found a home
See, with y'all on the side the world can be against ya
And they still gon' lose, that's the realer
Feel us, we ain't killers, we just riders for the have-nots
Cause some of us ain't got it all, tucked in a stash spot
Oh yes, we're back, baby, run and tell a friend
Let em witness how we get us through this hell again
Come on

Is you comin back just like they said you would?
I need you here now, I'm yo child, it ain't good
But I'ma keep my faith in you and that's the truth
We live ( ? ) thugged out without a clue
Waitin for revolution, with a love for shootin
At each other, even brothers kill each other stupid
And that's the way it been since I could remember
Born into a storm 3rd day of December
1976 I shot in the mix
Popped out mommy twat, how did it come to this?
I know my God love me and that's a real fact
He ain't gone for long, my dog comin back

Nobody cared but you took time to teach us
Bear with me even though it seems my heart empty
Somethin's always missin without y'all with me
Tupac and Yafeu, I pray to you
And still we live every day for you
I'ma stay loyal till I'm dead and gone
Outlaw till I die so forever it's on
Use my body as a vehicle
It lead a soldier through the storm, I believe in you
Stayin true to everything you worked for
Hurt for, had fingers in the dirt for
I know it's worth it, Lord

You gon' live on, soldier, every breath I take

I know this young nigga who love to keep his gun in his pants
14, little Ant will snatch your shit to enhance
He lost his moms at a early age, pops was cracked out
His brother ran a drug house where they slept with they Mac's out
And where we from, fuck them basketball teams
And your neighborhood PAL cause it's all about makin cream
He stayed dirty, copped a clip for thirty
He'd rather be sellin drugs early instead of young, black and nerdy
He had his hard hat, born ready for war
This young nigga heart's gone and I saw this before
He lived day by day, prey by prey, stray by stray
Blunted on Chancellor Ave. 380 hallway
He bought a AK and I know he gon' sway, it ain't no damn way
That this young nigga can turn his life around, mang
Now where is God when you need him, he's internally bleedin
Little Ant's barely breathin but he gotta stay eatin
So he robs again but this time he all smoked out
He put his finger on the trigger and let the death fly out
Some man got hit, he's layin on the pavement stiff
Blood drippin from his face and he drownin in it
Now what a surprise that little Ant can't come around
That it's his own man dead on the ground
Dead on the ground

Damn
He can't come around
That it's his own man dead on the ground
Dead on the ground

Baby girl, I can see you in that crazy world
Spinnin out of control, nowhere to go
At one point in time, huh, you could've been mine
But you was movin too fast, couldn't take the chance in losin yo ass
In high school, we was homies, but that was before we
Started keepin each other from bein lonely
With my mama workin all the time and your daddy drinkin
Sneakin, tryin to bump and grind, what is he thinkin?
We escaped in each other, became friends before lovers
More like sister and brother, at least we can trust us
But I had dreams, yeah, my plane leavin soon
Had to hook up with Pac, huh, continue to bloom
I called twice just to see if you alright
Both times you wasn't home, I knew somethin was wrong
And then I knew I was right, when they said they found you one night
Barely holdin on, tell me where did you go wrong?
Was it when you started strippin for tips?
Then sellin it for mo' chips?
And sniffin powder just to deal with it
Can you tell me, I guess that you can't
Cause I'm hearin you about to take your last dance
Let the game get the best of you, baby
Shoulda called on a Law, he was testin you, baby
But now you gone before you can be found
Gone without a doubt, lost and turned out

My brother Sean, he home now, he cool for a minute
I love him to death but bullshit he stays in it
I'm gettin older [Name] middle school around the corner
The drug dealers need and teach what they want to
""Moms, can I go to the park and play?""
Didn't play, I was countin every single cent them niggas made
Then his moms lost her job, no more money-stackin
On her way home she slipped on some ice and caught a back spasm
And that's what happened to Aline
She said she had lotta pains, just an excuse to be a fiend
Low on food, though it was good what my mama made
But you know a hungry nigga at school can't concentrate
be	 to an F student
Think about the bitches and the sneakers, my whole childhood ruined
I made my first sale ( ? ) in a alley way in 164
I was scared as shit
I wasn't scared of the cops though, this is true
I was more scared of what mom duke'd do
So I chilled for a few instead of ( ? )
Spent weekends with my peeps just escapin the block
Little [Names], I knew em since seven
We had a room, they had a house, just no way to compare it
But they parents taught me shit and gave me shit
Fed me, treated a nigga just like family
You gave me love and you neglected me too

It's only us, me, Kastro, EDI and Napoleon
It's on again, young niggas born again
I wish somebody coulda told me then
That we was gon' grow up to be some lonely men
Now I found out I really don't got friends
Cause nobody come around when I not spend
I walk around this fuckin planet feelin boxed in
Smokin stoge after stoge like it's oxygen
When there was 10 of us we all ate from one dub
Let's turn the dirt to glory for Pac up above
Yak one love, I know you gotta be free
Havin conversations with you when there's nobody but me
I guess whatever don't kill me make me stronger
But I don't know if I can take it any longer
But I got to, cause family live they dreams through us
It's like 5 million lost souls that cling to us
But I know one thing, it ain't shit without y'all
Thug Life for life, Young Noble Outlaw
It ain't shit without y'all

[ CHORUS: Noble ]
The only thing that we got left is us
If you don't have nothin else, son, you got my trust
Loyalty come first, I put my life in your hands
I'ma die as a man and die together is the plan
Keep the team stong, make this cream real long
Cash last long enough for our grandkids to eat on

Watch my back, I watch yours and we make it through the strorm

Early on I knew life wasn't shit
Just made 2, drugs and love made my daddy split
Mama's now forced to turn a boy into a man
Impossible task, still she doin all she can
And I'm growin quickly, slowly started seein things
All the wrong in this world, taught me not to believe in things
Not even man, cause we all change daily
Best friends be tryin to bring each other death quickly
Only the strong survive
As long as I'm alive I ride
Hooked up with some niggas that I knew had my side
O-you-t-l-a-w-z
Me for you, you for me eternally
Makaveli-trained riders
Cause the Don may be gone but he remains deep inside us
It comes out every time niggas try us
y'all my family until the Lord'll have me I make this promise

[ CHORUS: Young Noble ]

[ Napoleon ]
I been wakin up, stressin lately
Sheets wet from the sweat and my hands shaky
I got a kid on the way, I'm kinda nervous
I did some dirt in my life, hope it don't curse it
And all I got left is my Outlaw niggas
My cousins and my brothers and some Jersey drug dealers
I keep my faith in the Lord and stay strugglin
He keep on pushin me forward to stay hustlin
And when Pac died nobody never knew
Or gave a fuck on what the Outlawz was goin through
We kept your heads to the sky and our guns too
We had to ask straight for a dollar to split a cold brew
And through the process our family was still dyin
I got a grip of this shit, there's no complyin
And I'ma be the solid rock that I am, nigga
And I'ma give it all I got to raise my kid, nigga
I got the blood of Malcolm X in me
I got the dirt from the cemetery runnin in me
One way up and that's how we goin, nigga
Now put guns up, the world ain't friendly, nigga
And just wait till you get to hold reality
And just wait, I bet you try to up your salary
And these crackers be doin too much
Let's start the revolution so we can rise up
Come on

Outlawz,"Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the mornin'
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screamin'
'Cause they seein' destruction before they a see human bein'

So they start smokin' weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
'Cause they all broke an' why do ghetto birds die?
Before we learn to fly, somebody else's child caught in guns

Smokin' weed can all make a change
So I'm told but I haven't seen the change unfold
I keep hopin' please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead

Keep your eyes open now, can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free

Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens, rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the door to open wide, my brothers be wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies

We can only learn to take our anger an' our hate
Control our mental state, settle down an' just set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump our brakes
'For we said it, regret it later an' let it escalate

'Cause by then it's too just late, there's so much we can take
And there's only so much someone can swallow an' tolerate
Up to the point that he just breaks, snaps an' that's all it takes
You'd think that we was learnin' from other rappers mistakes
But we ain't

It's plain to go against, with every artists comes the image
He portrays an' a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger an' this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster
An' I ain't hear no complaints

But I know that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead an' never follow no one else's shadow
There will never be another me an' that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free

To this day the game will never be the same
No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me an' no matter what they do
There will never be another you

You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time
But in your hearts an' your minds, we will never die
We are forever alive an' we continue growin' one day at a time

Don't be caught in the publicity an' caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money an' light
Searchin' for fortune an' fame an' super stardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest

Now the hip hop police, the villains is watchin'
An' kids think beef is they only option
Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories could die but Makaveli lives on

You think the industry is fun an' no pity with guns
An' when your money is up, that's when your enemies come
So if he died an' came back, would he try to save rap?
We needin' a change, the drama remains

I spent my whole life fightin' myself
That I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help
An' every now an' then I take rights from the left
I'm still just like a kid lookin' for stripes on my belt

An' that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray an' hope God take a like to myself
No matter how much, I try stay alive
I'm gonna die mad, still standin' there in love with my pride

My heart frivolous beats, we past that
I'm tryin' to keep some income comin' in an' collect on my ass cap
The rappers in the game ain't changed
An' I finally realized that we not in the same game

The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it
Them 4 5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery an' keep your eyes on the rollers

They do what they gotta do to shackle an' hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'

Man dats what my nigga got shot for, 
Bein to motha fuckin raw for these fuck boys. 
See the darkness see the light he wanna feel it 
Misery loves company
And that's the real shit 
But in 2005 I'm on some kill shit 
Four niggaz sneak upon my and peel this.

So if a nigga wanna get at me 
I be out in them streets, my thang cocked 
Cause really all I got in the game everyday is me

Everyday is a new challenge 
I'm a savage in my new balance 
A lot of rappers but not enough raw talent 
Blame the machine but fuck it I'm a hustla bitch 
So we start our own label sellin' bricks legit 
Power to the people

Years later last members fuckin feelin the same.

Rounda tough with some niggaz 
I seen prison put religion in the roughs of some niggaz.

Call me cocky you tennis I'm hockey 
Mix a little bit of Pac and Yaki with black rocky in my Paps you got me.

(Why you got
to go and make things so complicated?) Just rock with me, baby/
Instead of walkin' around, come cool with me/ Instead of
havin' your doubts, come rock with me, baby so... 

-Kastro- 
All of your life all she wanted to be was
somebody with a college degree/ So up and down that you
ain't need me/ I used to tell you all the time that it
ain't easy/ Puppy love's what we had in the past, now
you a lady and you full of pizazz'/ You tell me that
I'm crazy and my life won't last/ I'm
gettin' cash comin' out my ass/ I got game, I
can't change/ I swear, all I love is family and beer
(Beer)/ Most niggas' square, but my mind ain't
designed to care (That's right nigga) 

-E.D.I.
Amin- 
Now, you can move slow, or you can shake it fast/ It
don't matter, girl, go on and bounce your ass/ See,
I'm a boss playa, just like my big homies/ Addicted to
money, weed with the cig on it/ Now, you ain't a dime piece
(Nope), but you's a strong lady/ Your ass is think,
lookin' sweet like a prom date/ But I ain't the prom
king, bitch, I'm the prom fiend/ E.D.I the crunk king,
c'mon do your thing

I'm a thug and he a thug, be
showin' love to the Thug Brothers/ In the streets or in the
club we some cool motherfuckers/ Come and kick it with me,
shorty, we tryna get to know you/ Don't need anything
'cause my clique is wide; We bonafied soldiers/ Dance floor
is where I met her/ Sean Paul was in the speakers, twistin'
the hips and doin that reggae shit/ Damn, I wanted to freak her/
But instead I played it mellow, like ""How you doing? Hello""
(What's up, girl?) If you ain't got no fellow, let me
take you to that other level/ And she was with it, with it;
I'm talkin' about off the hinges/ Grey Goose and
Hennessy/ This bitch was Dennis Menace/ Pullin' my sleeve,
and I'm like ""Damn, baby hold on. You fuckin' up the
Phat Farm suit, bitch roll on"" You complicate my pimpin'

Constantly, money over bitches

Got the police bustin at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah

Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind nigga
My ambitions as a ridah!
My ambitions as a ridah!

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothing without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressing the mad public
My attitude was, ""Fuck it,"" cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
And my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
While she hot, and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the tele hoe""
Equipped with money and a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smoking bomb-ass weed feeling crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustling and prayers, to breaking motherfuckers to pay-up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal-ticket mission, want a mil', so I'm wishing
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressing (boo-ya!)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the bidness so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches getting suspicious
Started plotting and planning on schemes, to come and trick us
But Thug niggas be on point and game tight (yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart, wrap it up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uhh, yeah, and now ya got me right beside ya
Hopin you listen I catch you payin attention
To my amibitions as a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
My ambitions as a ridah
Got the police busting at me
But they can't do nothing to a G

(I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah)
Peep it, it was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
I'm ready to die right here tonight, and mother fuck they life (yeah nigga!)
That's what they screaming as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me (that's all you niggas got?) witness my steel
Spitting at adversaries envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal thinking thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flying when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doing jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thugging for life and if you right then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die to be a man you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the Thugs before me
Pay off the block evade the cops cause I know they comin for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleeds
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
Didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfucking menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried (I been)
Getting much mail in jail, niggas telling me to kill it
Knowing when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a who ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggas that played me,
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's yo' nigga right beside ya
Hoping you listening, catch you paying attention
To my ambitions as a ridah

This life of sin, done got the both of us in trouble
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why I love you
Reminiscin' needin' tissues, fightin over childish issues
Swear I can't live wit' you but without you every day I miss you
When we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-ich

Plus we been beefin' with the East coast, with casualties
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business, and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin'
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin'
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic, thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic cause we crossed the top
I found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

To throw it all away (I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came.. Way too far pretty baby
To throw it all away, throw it all away (I swear I'll never call you bitch again, hey)

I know, I know
All that is dead though, I'm changed, I'm tellin you..
I know what time it is, gotta give a nigga time

You're my nigga, my best friend
Never gonna call you a bitch again
Yea yea yea, oh

Never meant to hurt you, can we make this work boo?
I know you been feelin pain, things are not the same

Keep yo' head up, cause things are gettin better
My cellmates shed tears off yo' last love letter
Told 'em you would find a friend so keep yo' eyes peeled
Sorry if I cuss but it's the suffering that I feel
Who can I trust and if I bust will she snitch
Even though you ain't the type to trip, sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women
I see the boss for the third time, hope to see you soon

Drug warlord, riding Concorde jets
Rag Vette's, shakin' bitches and snitches and trippin' on sets
Ingle-Watts banger, keepin' one in the chamber
For the anger that I build inside, when it's time to ride
Suicidal thoughts lurk fuckin' no end to revenge
Fuck any, my alias Mussolini

They call me Idi, from the side of seedy
Young nigga greedy, so I'm runnin' up on these niggas easy
It ain't nothin', 'cause if they wantin' somethin', so I'ma commence
To dumpin' stomp down and struck up while my beat is bumpin', thuggin'
To my fuckin' last nut, with Lo-Pole and Kastro
Who you thought was on that asshole, don't ask though
Outlaw Immortalz doin' this dit-nirt on the sli-zow
Ain't no chance to hide when we ride

My alias Khadafi, Trump tight so feds can't copy
Six-three and cocky quick to hit your bitch if she drop me
Severely addicted to livin' like a fuckin' felon
While beefin' with rookie cops the cookie rocks a nigga sellin'
Since a short I been livin' life defiant, nickel plated chrome
Got this baby Capone lookin' like a giant, and I ain't lyin'
It's like it's me against myself with all these
Backstabbin' snakes grabbin' at my fuckin' wealth

Mo Khomeini goes terrorist, mad man killer
The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers
I'm that nigga with the fifty cap pouch, with the murderous stacks
That increase, while these motherfuckers eat beef
It's been a long road, a lot of episodes
And as the glock loads, I gotta teach hoes
Reach hoes, make em feel a nigga when I'm mashin'
Now I'm surpassin' any assassin

Thug nigga till we die, no mercy
On these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why, when we ride!
Thug nigga till we die, no mercy
On these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why, when we ride!

Thug nigga till we die, no mercy

Outlawz,"You find an MC like me who's strong
Leaving motherfucker's aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those
Who can withstand, the more power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain
Imagine and keep on wishing upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstanding, faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'm a ride
Breaking in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies

So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facing
We must be patient nothing better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waiting
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that ass shaking
I'm busting and making motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
But thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm activating your souls
You know, the way the games get controlled
You, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fucking rhyme I wrote
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat

[Chorus]
I got my mind made up, come on (come on)
Get in get in too (get on it)
Let it ride (get wit it) tonight's the night
I got my mind made up, come on 
Get in get in too
Let it ride tonight's the night

Well I come through with two packs
Of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fucking sac won't collapse
Cause nowadays, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifying like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfucking poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's the fucking bom-bay
Your got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly vibes spread through your head like sand pine
There's no escape, nah I ain't blasting
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those asking
Opposed to laughing, raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killing
Why is that? 'cause smiling faces deceive
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under seige, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
Your already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat

Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler, sticking up (Jews) with German (lugers)
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket blow!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clan's three deep felons
Niggas best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfucking mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight, you can pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and falling fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

Hey yo, lyrical gas spitting the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this, mad underground basement, shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor who? Spock bitch don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless, the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust till every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out till your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
With, this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit your fam' by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake or a snake bust it
I'm the one pushing the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke, off this anecdote got you ope
Get roast, by my lyrics Billy Dee .45 Colt
And I'm out for nine nickel (INS the rebels)

Outlawz,"Yeah
Clear enough for ya? Yea right
Why you niggas look mad?
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Ho bustas!

Picture me rolling in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be telling
Know there's dope being sold, but I ain't the one selling!
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from going under
The federales wanna see me dead
Niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by me bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shooting at your crib
Mama, I'm still thugging, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheming on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossing a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beating and my hands are swollen
Thinking of the G's I'll be holdin', picture me rollin'

Can you see me now? (Oh picture me rollin')
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Picture me rollin' (picture me rollin')
Yeah nigga!
Ay, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?

I got keys coming from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss 'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug, branded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swanging
Make me wanna start back banging
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packing 40 Glocks, contain em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy coming from my enemies
While I'm sipping on Remy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 Big body, sitting on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facing is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm living a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine picture me rollin'!

Picture, picture me rollin'
Rollin', picture me rollin'
Wheelin', picture me rollin'
Picture me yea yeah

I gots to get the fuck up in it
Formulate a caper
'Cause a nigga straight suffering from lack of having paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some ballin' ass niggas, and they slippin' in my spot
And, uh, diggin the plots (so what?)
Checking in the park, 'Pac

We caught em sleeping, he didn't peep you niggas creeping?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
Cpo, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you could get the females
This crooked shit that we inflicting getting street sales!

Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
I'm as cool as a motherfucker, I'mma get mine

I play and sing - pack my things and move along

A pretty face, another place I never get to know
A one night stand, another show

My guitar - a railroad car - a bus or plane
Chocolate bar - and there you are - the price of fame

If I could do what I want to, I'd stay and never go
A one night stand is all I know

I wish that I could be two people
Instead of bein' on my own
I wish that I could be two people
And then I'd never be alone

Photographs of where I've been and all I've done
In this whole world - is there a girl - no, not one

Throw it up fool, hey n****
Tell me how you feel homie
Yeah

It took a week to go down, you recollect and see how crazy it sounds
The whole town's on a mission, adolescents, penitentiary bound
Now introducin' young Trigga
Since birth, eyes set on gettin' bigger

Just another wild a** n****
But he was fiendin' for Precious, what?
But Precious was a ghetto girl
Couldn't be no sex without that gold Lexus

But lil' Trigga was heartbroken, he had to get his papers
Seein' visions of people smokin' and n****z catchin' vapors
Got his man from around the corner, we'll call him 'Lil Mo
Been in so many reform schools, they had to let him go

Here's where the plot thickens
They got a plot to make a profit with they glocks spittin'
They call the squad, hittin' blocks with they guns blowin'
Somebody's gonna die tonight

Still no one's knowin', so they kept goin'
Catchin' dealers comin' out they cars, will they survive?
Two semi automatic nines, them n****z died
Plus nobody in the hood cries, it's like they celebrate

To death and wish they could die, so peep the lesson

Was the victim, from a dime to a nickel
Hopin' God's blessings stick with ya
Picture the neighborhood kingpin, who's gettin' bigger

Familiar face, but a man now, it's lil' Trigga
Now Lil' Mo was a soldier to the fullest
Down for his homies, always the first to spit bullets
All he wanted was to be a thug

Never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love
Here's where it gets ya
Now Precious is pregnant, lil' Trigga is happy
He wants to marry her now, not knowin' he ain't the daddy

But precious was lonely while lil' Trigga was makin' dough
She's slippin' in secret places and gettin' with Lil' Mo
The neighborhood's buzzin', now people are talkin'
Lil' Trigga's gettin' pictures of the both of 'em walkin'

Hand in hand, couldn't understand
How his baby's mama could disappear
With another man and his best friend
Now jealousy's dangerous, and if you don't believe me

Then watch the way that this story ends, and maybe you'll see
There ain't no heroes or villains, ain't no pleasure in killin'
Just the smoke from the cap, peelin' a man with no feelings

Now with the problems of poverty, and the tricks to these tales
How many people will die? How many will live to tell?
Although best friends before, Lil' Trigga and Mo
They in an all out war, over a fiend they ain't know

Behind the curtains, their privacy, lust is already laid down
The results is the same with different names and it turns out
Y'all know how it is, same old thing in the same old town
Lil' Trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick, now he's played out

Think it's Lil' Mo, was plottin' plans on gettin' bigger
Precious was his way to put his hands on Lil' Trigga

All the while let's look at Precious
Too dumb to see what's goin' down, too doped up to ask questions
Used to be comrades, but now we blast on sight
What could be so bad?

God, will we last tonight?
From misdemeanors to felonies, small time to sellin' ki's

With approximately two and a half years before the year 2000
Repeatedly it has been reported that
There will be a time soon approaching
That a major disaster will be striking all levels of existence
It has also been reported that this disastrous thing will be
Approaching in the form of many, many as in squad
Squad as in Flipmode Squad

It has also been reported that everyone out of the many will strike
But this particular motherfucker will strike with an unmeasurable blast
That will fuck up everything within it's 360 degree radius
Warning, prepare yourselves, store your food, stamp your paper
Because when this motherfucker gets here
It's about to get real fucked up for everyone and everything
Everywhere!

Well, Busta Rhymes
Come on over here and let me talk to you son
See now, Dolomite just got back from some shit that you about to be it
Well, are you prepared? I hope you are prepared nigga
'Cause you know this is album number two
Yes more bitches than before
There'll be more bitches, more and more and more
More thirsty niggas, tryin' to get inside your shit
Tryin' to throw your whole chemistry off
Oh yes, there's gonna be a lot more money
Yes a lot more money than before

Close to you

On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true

So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

The wack crap you yappin about get you cracked in the mouth
Want to be president, put me in office
My old ??? ran for European horses
Skiing off cliffs, G'ing off this
Rob banks, clearin Porsches
Me and Nawshis, y'all shoulda been being cautious

My Night Life'in, make cats get liars
When Axe pass the striker, I rapid fire
Nauseous, I'm main coursin', no appetizer
The emcee sacraficer, like a rap messiah

Diagonally bent, dying in agony in a magically event
Outs in a fear of family presents

Write it down on the paper
And still be able to read it (Sorry)
I can't read, but I still write to my pen pals (Uh, uh, dear)
I can't fly, but I still float on cement clouds (Whee!)

I can't see cause my eyes already been gouged out

Yeah, Outsida style, yo Axe, D.U., Nawshis, come down!

[D.U.]
See me in a wool cap, black boots, takin' Prozac
Gives me a rush like a full back
When my niggas wild out they don't act human
I punch out gorillas lookin' like Pat Ewing

[Axe]
Pull out the gat, clap to it; no protection from the blow
Smith & Wesson turn your bulletproof vest into a robe
On another level, dig it, with the metal spitted
Beef got settled with it, roam the ghetto (?) rockin' devil fitteds

[D.U.]
Yeah, Axe...
Underneath their ski masks haters be mad
See me in the green Jag' playin' Sega Dreamcast
Sometimes I be on some He-Man shit
Pilted up, more sticks than tree branches

[Axe]
We can't miss
Ill like Arabic soldiers, bustin' shots at cop cars
Blowin' shit up, yellin' (???????)
Hardcore cats, gettin' dough like pop stars
Ski pulled out the glock, turned your block to hot tar

[D.U.]
Now, before the beef get any further
I make y'all see-Murder like Master P's brother
I pack a 4-4 nozzle that's so-so-colossal
Now when I cock it back it'll blast off both nostrils

I make niggas trade places like Mortimer
Slaughter 'em 'til their house boarded and girl's been fucked

[Nawshis]
We be ridin' through your block slow, like 5-0
And hit up your Tahoe with more shots than Dialo
Call me Nawshis, poison's my blood
I'm more than a thug and iller than the boys in your hood

[Yah Yah]
Gats, you know I ride aimin' 'em, gray titanium
Buttin' niggas over the fist in Shea Staduim
Ever since the raid I gotta wait because I wave the gun
Save the lump, Outz blazin' up with laminated rum

[Nawshis]
Comin' through the back door
Nawshis spits like chewin' tobacco, two in your backbone
I'm tweakin' lungs like Cheech & Chong's (?) bong
y'all ain't seein' mine like Peeping Tom bein' blind

[Yah Yah]
Boys, you'll lose if you ain't glocked up, payin' your dues
Plus the college don't fuck with the neighborhood schools
Got tools, better sleep with a pair
'Cause Brick layers start sprayin' right after early mornin' prayer

[Nawshis]
Catch us swervin', son; chickens chirpin' from me workin' 'em
Sippin' Bourbon rum, not givin' a fuck like a virgin nun
You herbs is done when I start releasin'

Fuckin' wit God, producin' nothin' but hits

You a virgin? You know you do this often
You're thing is so deep you can drown a school of dogs in
It's like every M.C., she done did it
Redman tapped, Lil' Weezy done hit it
Even them Boys from the Beastie done did it
Lil' Cease and R&B singers split it

When I seen it, it made me wanna nut right then
Yo, we got fly, we talked, she stopped bye
Lit the choc' lye, and passed it clockwise
Let me knock the boots, 'Til I was cock-eyed
And now she trynna act like she ain't got time
I told her, think of this before you try to be foul
There's ladies at the bar that could be buyin' me rounds
And all type models that be eyein' me down
I stay and you say good-bye to me now?
Fuck that, diss me, that's what's up here
You better get ya fat ass back up stairs
And if you try to creep, I'mma tie you in the basement

No matter what the race, we share a common cause
Everything be everything, get treated like a queen
'Til we give up the drawers
Now just when I thought, everything was cool
Let a brother even have a key
I said I let him use the car, then he took it too far
Brother out there cheatin' on me
Time to face the truth, when I really didn't want to
How the hell all these hoes keep gettin' my number?
Who was it? A distant cousin, came to see you
In prison, they said you already had a visit
Beefin' wit these strangers, how do you explain this?
Came this close to lettin' you put it in my anus
Wakin' up, middle of the night, brother out

Rollin' 4-5-6 on ya cross eyed tricks

Ballin' like the Nets, like ten pass ya marks on my net
Woman love me, wantin' lust for me like people do money
They hungry, I might start livin' too lully
Got a A+ average and I'm bound to make honor roll
Jumpin' in and out of holes, lives like geronimo

And years later, I'm gonna still be the tighter

Who that smoked-out kid that do more drugs than a rock star?
Not far from bein' in the back seat of a cop car
Top dog that falls the fuck off, now he fiendin'
The need for drugs got his ass stealin'
He asks you for pocket change and cigarettes every time you see him
White shit around his lips; he got open sores, bleedin'
Kid blast more fast than Pete Rock could flip a remix
Hope he don't OD like River Phoenix
Hope his ass gets himself together and his people live to see it
All his felonies become misdemeanors
He shootin' up hot heroin, one dub, intravenous
Robbin' niggas cleaner than the cleaners

They slip and get addicted, drop a G on it
Next thing, they trip and they think their house haunted
Niggas never should've got what they wanted

Plus Axe fatter than the ass on Jennifer Lopez
Sniff lines with cokeheads and bring the Rawkus like Mos Def

Remember this; bad habits only get worser
When your lungs insert lye, they just tryin' to reach the first high
I used to smoke, drink mad brew straight
Still be sober, so I had to graduate

Didn't know not to, havin' rap a role model
Until I heard Redman hit the rope
I heard Mobb Deep sniffed coke

I figured out the riddle; ain't shit wrong with you
(??????)I take acid with pain tablets
A strange habit but that shit keeps my brains blasted
Unbalanced chemicals bend the rules; break in lockers

Guns cock back, crackin' all of that, it's more than rap
Bless my turf, and all those curse

But it's so hard dealing with people just like you

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""

How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,

Remain to love until they droop and die

Cue up the celebration (Come on, come on.)
We caught our constellation (Come on, come on.)
The ties that bind the points of light all swiftly come undone.
The lifespan of the planet is just a glimmer then its gone.

Dishonor, Disorder, Dancing to the beat.
The beat of the Breakdown.
No feeling, No meaning, still so out of reach.
The beat of the breakdown.
The beat of the breakdown, take a look around.

Tomorrow is going to get us (Come on, come on.)
It never forgets. (Come on, come on.)
To heed the call from headquarters to leave no stone unturned.
There may be no second chance but at least we got this one.

Still out of reach, still out of reach, its gone.

The out of reach is just a beat away.
The out of reach is just a G to A.

You would turn your head away?

I follow the moonlight to where I'm sure I've watched her shadow dance,
But the light she casts in these eyes bears an unknown wavelength,
So I sorrow to be cursed with my condition.
The night laughs, this lens is flawed
Cause I cant bend the light her heart still casts in darkness
There I go again, lost in my heart's persistent questions,
Is it wrong? Can I survive if morning never comes?

Refract her light in me,
I believe that she's there , I've watched her waiting.
I believe that she'll save a little space for me in the night

How you build me up.
The cross-tolerance could kill an army Of friends
The way your love blinds like a drug,

I know its no use, there are times I watch myself surrender so thoughtless
But you've no will you're just the scapegoat I abuse
Afflicted with
Illusions I've let in.
My sickness fills me
Till my indignation spills
Though I still feel empty.
Sometimes I see beyond the haze
And I think that I could free myself

Close you eyes

And open up your mind
And hear me say

Restoring everything that once was taken
Symbolizing agony that made the women weep

Spilling my glass there's ice on the floor
But I've been busy gathering wood
Hoping our fire will burn all the more
I've been stealing hundreds of bells
Ringing my way along your shore
And I've been smiling all to myself

To glare
To grin
To chill you now

She still comes around

Did you perceive the wilderness
Resting there so did I
Laughing he stalls me
Crazy he calls me
He thinks me artless

From certain australian vines
Have mercy sister
He's travelled 'round the world
He's like a shadow
There by the window

No man's an artesian well

And bundles of contradictions,

Hands across my eyes.

It's always the same old question.
Who am I and whose invention?
This armour's full of dust.

Of all I wish I was.
I hate you just because I'm everyman's daughter.

I am hurting someone just like, just like you.

Insulting the wounds of others,
My sisters, my brothers,
My vision's way too good.
I carry the inward aching.
Like you, I too am naked.
I don't look that good,
But this is flesh and blood. I'm everyman's daughter.

Look at all the blood we've spilt.

And makes the wind die down, calms the troubled sea

When politics would ever mean a thing

And laid it at the bottom of my stair
And waited by the garden gate
For one more rendezvous with fate
Kept a pistol in your dress

As trigger-finger twitched at your command)

And sold your stockings at the county fair
And how the clowns did dance and sway

In the faces of a stranger
In the dark and weary corners of a mind""

As far away as you are from yourself
No matter just how bad it gets
It does no good to blame somebody else""

Made out of the feces of a bull

Can bring the whole wall tumbling down like Jericho
Hmm, decisions
A wise nigga asked what direction your penis point when erect
Your answer should be straight ahead, he said
That's your future, make sure you aim it correct, I reflect
Man the same things that make you scarred
Evolve you into who you are
Cried a river, built a boat
Got it to float, and wrecked into an epiphany
Now ain't that about a tiffany
Perception kept you from finding the light in the darkness quicker, my nigga
You fucking up your energy
In the wrong place with the wrong kind of empathy
The soul is in the abs
How else do you explain that funny feeling once you catch feelings
You ain't never too young for lust
And you ain't never too young for drugs
And you ain't never too young for clubs
And you ain't never too young for trust
So you ain't never too young for love

Ain't gotta front girl, I just wanna dance with you
More for romance, so let me get your hand, yo
You got an ass, make a nigga drop bands
Broke niggas, they could never understand
Just face it, them niggas basic
I'm a billionaire boy, and I ain't ape shit
I hear 'em all bluffing in they conversations
Or they [?], I'ma raise them
Get a real one, you in it for the thrill of it

People going nowhere, taken for a ride
Looking for the answers that they know inside
Searching for a reason, looking for a rhyme
Snow White's mirror said ""partners in crime!""

Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

Sunday's satisfaction, Monday's home and dry
Truth is on the doorstep, welcome in the lie
All dressed up in sorrow, got no place to go
Hold tight, do it ready, taking it slow

Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

Don't you ever say die
Don't you ever say die
Never say die

Panic, silver lining, writing's on the wall
Children get together, you can save us all
Future's on the corner, throwing us a die
Slow down, turn around, everything's fine

Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again
Never say die again

At the feet of the need

Watch it feed

Are you here to abide
Have you come from the falling

Wash away the pain with a hit

Will you reach out, will you take my hand?

And who is the last of the last men to make it all right, damn right

You can give me liberty or I can give you death

In a world where tears are just a lullaby 
If there's any answer, maybe love can end the madness 
Maybe not, oh, but we can only try

Overtures,"My life has been a tapestry of rich and royal hue,
An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view.
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold.

Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky,
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by.
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide,
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side.

He moved with some uncertainty, as if he didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go.
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree,
And his hand came down empty.

Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road,
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad.
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell,
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well.

As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard.
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black.
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back.
He's come to take me back.

Waiting for summer, his pastures to change

And closing his eyes as the doggies retire

With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go

A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep

Doing something we might 
Regret in the morning.

You're tired of all your friends.

Wants to drive me home?

Misplacing time like I've got it to lose.

And even I think
That you're blinded by conceit

And basement shows
Don't mean you've made it
It's what you do
Not who you were, what you wear, where you've been
So do something

From across the room
They aren't
If anything, they feel sorry for you
'cause you try so hard

But it's the truth
So you might as well hear it
From a friend

Like holidays at home
Continue to remind you
Of who you were
And who you are

some pages bent,
The spines creased and worn
All signs of being adored
And those words somehow meant more to you
Than who they were written for

those blankets in your bed
So tattered and sad
They've seen enough sleepless nights
Both good and bad
To pen a short story
Use your words
For a few love songs
Well ain't it about time
You've moved on

those books that you've read
You will read again
After enough time passes
You'll remember some names
But not how they end
After enough time passes
And your heart will break all over again
After enough time passes
And so on and so forth

Not knowing where I am
And this was a lot of fun

I won't stray too far, or be gone too long

windows and doorways, I don't know which way
To leave this room because I'm afraid of heights
And I'm afraid of you tonight
Those striped socks and punk rock pajamas
Some ways I changed, in most ways I'm the same

for better or worse I can't say
Only time will tell
Like an addict, I'm cursed in a good way
I've done it so long and I'm not sure how not to

the same way that the earth moves around the sun will be gravity
Pulls on everyone
Dead beats and dead friends
My god, when will it end?
