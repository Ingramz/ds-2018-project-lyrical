Vetusta Morla,"Antes del frío levanta las velas 
Guarda en tu falda los granos de arroz 
Y haz ceremonias de luna llena 
Antes del frío, lánzamelos 

Cuida este vals que tenemos en vena 
Cuida del baile y riega el salón 
Lleva la barca hasta la albufera 
Y pon el verano en un mostrador 

Y que San Juan no nos queme en su hoguera 
Cuando descubra quién la asaltó 

Deja el equipaje en la ribera 
Para verte como quieres que te vea 
Deja el equipaje en la ribera 
Y quémalo 

Haz que este baile merezca la pena 
Yo haré lo propio con esta canción 
Y si al final no hay más que comedia 
Deja que el río nos lleve a los dos 

Y que San Juan no nos queme en su hoguera 
Ni haga de esto un negocio menor 
Cruza los dedos por mí 
Y antes de que vuelva a mirar 
Busca el viento a favor 

Y deja el equipaje en la ribera 
Para verte como quieres que te vea 
Sabes que todo está bien 
No hay error 
Deja el equipaje en la ribera 
Para verme como quiero que me veas 
Lánzate al agua otra vez 
Aquí espero yo 

Deja el equipaje en la ribera 
No te sirve cuando cruzas la frontera 
Todo está en regla esta vez 
No hay error 
Deja el equipaje en la ribera 
Para verte como quieres que te vea 
Deja el equipaje en la ribera 
Y quémalo",23 de Junio,
Vetusta Morla,"Antes de hacerlo estallar 
Quiero que aguantes mi mano 
Dime si el pulso es constante 
O es un murmullo lejano 

No arrastro nada esta vez 
Traigo el carrete velado 
Es pronto para la amnesia 
Y tarde para irnos intactos 

¿Qué hay que hacer? 
¿Qué hay que hacer? 
Ahora que todo está hablado 
Lo intenté 
Lo intenté 
Hoy tu recuerdo es un pájaro 
Que bate sus alas detrás de mí 
Y guarda en su pico tus labios 

Tienes la forma precisa 
Guardas la herencia del mármol 
Fuiste la Venus de Milo 
Y yo puse el mundo en tus brazos 

Y rodé 
Y rodé 
Como resbalan los años 
Lo intenté 
Lo intenté 
Hoy tu silueta es un pájaro 
Que bate sus ales detrás de mí
Me silba y enreda mis pasos 

Reunid otra vez al Consejo de Sabios 
Ponedme una vela, estoy atrapado 

Sácame del corredor 
Cuando caiga el santuario 
Sácame de este fortín 
Llévame en tu vuelo raso 

Quiero un punto ciego 
Quiero tu arrebato 
Llévame contigo 
Llévame sin pactos 

Y llévame al puente que no explotó 
Al muro que crece en mi mano 
El mismo que impide tus pasos 

Caerán los imperios, caerán los estadios 
Pero antes tendrán que caer nuestros santos",Consejo de Sabios,
Vetusta Morla,"Si necesitas esta guerra para estar en paz 
Podrás hacer de mí tu campo de batalla 
Y un adversario en el espejo a quien culpar 
De cada derrota 

Si te hace falta un buen pretexto para disparar 
Puedo coserte un ramillete de amenazas 
Un amasijo de rencores por saldar 
La trama de tu venganza 

Y sonarán más 
Más alarmas que dirán
""Hay un lobo en tu puerta"" 

Y lloverán más 
Piedras para levantar 
Un refugio en la oscuridad 
ah ah ah

Si necesitas un gatillo, una mecha, un plan 
Puedes contar con mis palabras incendiarias 
Y miraré para otro lado al enredar 
Mi cuento en tu garganta 

Y sonarán más 
Más alarmas que dirán 
Hay un lobo en tu puerta 

Y lloverán más 
Piedras para levantar 
Un refugio en la oscuridad 
Un refugio en la oscuridad 
ah ah ah

No serás el mismo tras la guerra civil 
No saldrás ileso de esta guerra civil 
No serás el mismo tras tu guerra civil 
Nadie sale ileso de una guerra civil 
No serás el mismo tras la guerra civil 
No saldrás ileso de esta guerra civil 
No serás el mismo tras tu guerra civil 
No serás 
No saldrás 
No serás 
No saldrás",Guerra Civil,
Vetusta Morla,"Donde la hiedra no se atreve a trepar, y amanece en secreto
Donde el invierno no consigue llegar, en el último intento
En la antesala del derrumbe total, donde el filo es el estrecho
En el auxilio del penúltimo bar, en el beso más lento

Hay un sitio para cada lugar, queda espacio para ti
Es tu turno, sólo tienes que verlo

De la oración del violín principal, al aullido del viento
Del contrapunto al redoble crucial, todo nace en el pecho

Hay un himno para cada final y una frase es para ti
Es tu turno, sé que puedes hacerlo

Compartimos el mismo andén
Hemos sido cabaña y temporal
Gotas que prenden cuando caen
Hemos sido un amante impar
Y ahora el círculo vuelve a cuadrar

Hay un himno para cada final y una estrofa es para mí
Es mi turno, sé que debo romperlo","Mismo Sitio, Distinto Lugar",2017
Vetusta Morla,"Hay un umbral, hay, un punto sin retorno 
Sea o no el final, quítame el disfraz 
Y salva de la ruina nuestro hogar 
Me lleva lejos, la inercia más feroz 

Hay un sedal 
Haz, que enreda nuestros cuartos 
Cose a mí tu adiós, capta una señal 
Y tira del anzuelo sin piedad 

Seré la llaga 
La venda y el dolor 
Me lleva lejos 
La inercia más feroz 

Ven, vedaval 
Ven y barre mis papales 
Ahora nos da igual 
Si no soy el de ayer 
Y ya no queda fuel para volver 

Seré la llaga 
La venda y el dolor 
Me lleva lejos 
Me arroja en su ciclón 
La inercia más feroz 

Seremos naves, en plena colisión 
Caeremos lento, qué inercia tan feroz 
Voy montado en su ciclón 

Seguiremos el sedal
Sin fuel para regresar 
Seguiremos el sedal
Sin fuel para regresar 
Seguiremos el sedal
Sin fuel para regresar 
Cruzaré este nuevo umbral
Sin fuel para regresar",Punto Sin Retorno,

Veust Lyricist,"L’équipe de choc est de retour, crie-le!
Un son classique designé pour faire baliser les frileux
Quelques mesures feront l’affaire
Pour t’expliquer en détails le genre de gars à qui t’auras à faire
Le terroriseur, le lance-flamme, le pyrolyseur
Les détracteurs pleurent, leurs gueules est dans le rétroviseur
Le mornifleur, le distilleur de claques aux frimeurs
Je vais même en faire une marque ouais #TommyHillGifleur
Le fossoyeur, le bouchon sur la bouche des brailleurs
Que j't’écrase tes merdes à tour de bras #SaniBroyeur
Le perce-conteneur, le foudre-jeteur
Le tueur de minuit, qui a déjà fini son job à dix heures

Je suis le mélange entre Skywalker, Black Panther, Pink Panther
Pour les frères blacks, blancs, beurs qui préfèrent Marc Landers
Le décor-planteur, le rappeur schlasseur
Le Maybach Exellero accélérateur
Je suis dans le building comme Peter Parker
Je kick comme si y avait un videur par terre
Le métaphore-rédacteur, le Predator-prédateur
Le T-800 et T-1000, Terminateur
T'as des armes dans tes clips ? Pauvre caméra de braqueurs
Les uns font du chiffre, Porsche Carrera acheteur
Je suis le four à charbon, t'es le radiateur
T'es le gars qui a peur, je suis le gladiateur

Le Royal Quinte Flusher, le, je te faire dire ""Yeah"" comme Usher
Ça c'est dans mes cordes, Double Dutcheur
Le pote à Cut Killer, le vil kickeur
Le ""Je couvre ta ville avec ma seule figure sur le sticker""

Le Jack Herer cultivateur, le THC élévateur
T'es défoncé avec les putains d'vapeur
Ces deux putains d'rappeurs
Chaud comme l'Enfer, en face t'as juste un ventilateur

Le rappeur du deux majeurs entre dans le chargeur
Le tortureur de ceux qui rêvent de voir le Führer
L'anti sniffeur, épureur de baladeurs
Le déménageur qui fout le souk aux soirées de l'ambassadeur
Le ""J'écris au marqueur dans l'ascenseur""
Le petit aux Starters maîtrisait les classiques par cœur

Devant les flics j'suis baratineur, t'es baragouineur
Baisse d'un ton quand tu parles aux winners
Moi je t'insulte en face puis je t'insulte sur Twitter
Et l'German Luger vise ton Zinger Tower
J'rappe tranquille mais c'est pire que du rock vénère
Qu'un combat de rottweilers ou que le compte de Rockefeller
Trop d'rage autour de moi mais je m'appelle pas Pasteur
Si t'as peur de l'eau ne teste pas les maîtres-nageurs

Le mutilateur, le tarteur d'affabulateurs
Qui jure ""J'fais mieux que Dre avec mon ordinateur""
De sales challengers, le plouc-basher, le MC
Spit le venin ravageur comme un cobra cracheur
De rap game Swiffer, le bada bing kiffeur
Le transformeur d'MC hardcores en Claudia Schiffer

Plus de punchs que 1000 kickeurs, le scribe-niqueur
Le street-sweeper les cainris m'appellent ""real nigger""
Sers-moi de ta pire liqueur
Tu vois que les jetons, c'est que je suis le chip-leader
J'transforme ta femme en cheerleader
J'suis le Francis Hustler, le Claude Brasseur

L'effaceur, celui qui faisait pleurer ta sœur
Le casseur qui écrivait ""grosse pouf"" sur le classeur
J'ai changé, merci j'y pense ça m’écœure, le rêve-briseur
Elle était cool, j'étais le loup-garou, le thriller
Le dope-rayeur, le dope rime-sayer
Le j'prends ton instru, je le shoote et je le sors en meilleur

Le fucking player, le régicide, le king slayer

Le Marseilleur, le faiseur de sale quart d'heure

J'suis un cul-botteur-rappeur, t'es un Harry-Potter-rappeur
Crime-rapporteur, blunt-crapoteur

A base de couplets tapageurs, de rimes-cutters
Je suis le outsider qui fait peur aux champions comme Clubber

Le Jean-Claude Van Damme-validateur, le kickboxer

Veysel,"Bonzen rappen Ghetto, haben ein Familienhaus.
Fernbedienung, Knopfdruck, Garage geht auf.
Mercedes fährt raus, ihr könnt euch alles kaufen.
Meine Mutter fährt immer noch mit Ticket 2000.
Richtung Heisingen, bei Reichen putzen gehen.
Es geht ums überleben, weil man sonst untergeht.
Lass 'ne Runde drehen, tritt ein in meine Welt.
Du hörst grad was du siehst, AUDIOVISUELL!
Hier will man schnell, schnell an das große Geld.
Ich gib dir'n Beispiel, die Kahba Isabell.
99 Tatort Berliner Platz,
Die Schwänze frisst für dich, doch bis der Pariser platzt
Jeder macht Cash Kriminell, doch keiner hält sein Money fest.
Jeder Satz den ich Drop, ist Manifest.
Weil jeder böse Augen, wie Dollar und Alice zeigt.

Komm in die Hölle rein, hier gibt's keine Bruderliebe.
Bruder verkauft Bruder, für den Wert eines Cuba Libre .

Stürmt jetzt in die Charts, dank meinem Bruder Haft.
Ghetto Star über Nacht, seid ihr überrascht?
An die Neider, aus meiner und deiner Stadt.
Veysel rappt, und macht eure Weiber nass.
Walla krass, alle schieben auf einmal Hass.
Wegen was? („Ich bin im Ghetto geboren“)
Wegen das!
Weil jede Stadt, jetzt meine Mukke pumpt.
Bin ich fame und nicht mehr Untergrund.
Das Hilton Hotel, ist zurzeit die Unterkunft.
Scheiß auf die Vergangenheit, ich bin die Zukunft Punkt.

Veysel,"Du bist kein Mann, wenn du ne Frau in die Augen siehst,
Dabei lügst und ihr einen vorspielst.
Für eine Frau ,die für Dich in den Tod zieht,
Die einen Sohn ohne Vater groß zieht.
Was ist das für ein Vater der nicht seinen Sohn liebt
Und lieber im Casino auf Schwarz oder Rot spielt .
Du bist kein Mann, wenn du kein Brot nach Hause bringst,
Und deine Euros bei anderen Frauen sind.
Denn Vertrauen sollte bei Gott und Familie sein,
Und du findest ein glückliches wieder sein.
Und du sagst wie schön kann denn Liebe sein,
Besonders dann, wenn man es mit seinen Lieben teilt.
Also soll Niemand sagen das es keine Hoffnung gibt
Nobody is Perfect, glaub mir,Gott vergibt

Mann, Frau, es macht keinen Unterschied
Nur das Herz ist bedeutsam,
Nur die ehrliche Liebe besiegt und es wir mehr zur Freundschaft
Du weißt ,das ist kein Liebeslied, weil ich so oft enttäuscht war
Du unterdrückst jegliches Gefühl doch dein Spiegelbild kannst du nicht betrügen

Du bist keine Frau 
Wenn du deinem Mann fremd gehst und das nur weil vor der Tür kein Benz steht,
Während der Mann 40 Stunden in der Woche schufftet, bist du in Discos,
Bistros am lutschen
Weil deine Affäre dir teuren Schmuck gibt,
Meinst du dadurch wirst du Glücklich?
Er liebt dich nicht, sondern sagt bück dich,
Mach dich nützlich und du fühlst dich putzig
Du bist keine Frau, wenn du hinterm Fenster stehst, im roten Licht
Was willst du deinem Kind erzählen ? Wenn es mal groß es,
Überlegs dir, lohnt's sich?
Du nimmst kein Gucci mit, wenn du mal Tot bist
Also änderst dich, Gott hilft dir wenn du in Not bist, 
Der Code ist Fünf Dinge was Groß ist
Was Gutes,glaub mir,Gott verschont dich,
Entscheid dich, Sonnenschein oder Mondlicht

Mann, Frau, es macht keinen Unterschied
Nur das Herz ist bedeutsam,
Nur die ehrliche Liebe besiegt und es wir mehr zur Freundschaft
Du weißt ,das ist kein Liebeslied, weil ich so oft enttäuscht war

„Only God can judge me“, Zitat Tupac Shakur
Im Flur rauchen Kids pur, träumen von Flus
Parallel dazu vom Teufel besucht
Morgen wird es besser, nichts hat sich geändert
Immer noch Gangster bis das Boot kentert
Viele kennen das, viele auch nicht
Ob das was ändert, ich glaub nicht
Vertrauen bricht, sobald es um Geld geht
Fuck fake friends, bleib du selbst, Selfmade
Weiber drücken auf die Bremse vom AMG
Wenn sie mich sehen, und fragen mich was heute Abend geht
Nichts besonderes, Business auf der Street
Rauch in der Lunge, Kunden brauchen Weed

Ich sag's wie Hubert, bis hierhin lief es gut

Ich hab mein Geld gemacht auf der Street
Ich hab mich in den Duft der Straße verliebt
Ich hab mein Cash gemacht mit Gras oder Piece
Ich hab mich in den Duft der Straße verliebt
Jeder grüßt mich, wenn er mich sieht
Ich hab mich in den Duft der Straße verliebt
Ich kenn mich aus in jeder Street
Ich hab mich in den Duft der Straße verliebt

5 o'clock in the morning
Was willst du tun, was neues besorgen
43 die Gegend, ein Leben ohne Morgen
Wenige geblieben, viele gestorben
Ein Beispiel, Cemal, er wurde 13 Jahre alt
Und ein Drecksbulle machte ihn auf der Straße kalt
Das ist halt, was du hörst, was du siehst
In meiner Welt, Ruhrgebiet, Industrie
Beton, pechschwarzer Rauch
Genau das ist, was ich zum Atmen brauch
Und damit wir uns ein bisschen leichter fühlen
Siehst du uns meistens jeden Freitag knien
Doch ich weiß,
Das ist noch zu wenig
Denn ich weiß, dieses Leben ist nicht für ewig
Doch du hast Zeit, 'ne Nase zu ziehen
Du hast dich in den Duft der Straße verliebt

Ich hab mein Geld gemacht auf der Street
Ich hab mich in den Duft der Straße verliebt
Ich hab mein Cash gemacht mit Gras oder Piece

Diebstahl mit fünf
Direkt vor der Tür

Satan verführt und er hat viele Namen
Versace, Armani, Gabbana tragen
Mit vierzehn Jahren ging ich in den Laden
Fesseln mit Kabeln, die Waffen geladen
Die Straße am Fliegen
Am Fliegen wie Balu (Balu)
Die Junkies am Liegen
Sie lieben ihr Alu (Alu)
Jeder Zweite am grüßen, man kennt die Visagen
Die Kripo kann blasen, bunker' Weed in Garagen
Spielautomaten besetzt wie Toilette
Fünf SKlassen drinne, keine Gewinne

Veze Skante,"Never was a killer but I spilt enough blood.
Never thought I'd be the one to sweep your fucking ashes underneath my rug.
People come and people go. But I ain't people.
So tell your people when they see me they gonna feel the evil.
You missed the past off them city lights make you last.
Now you're sayin' rest in peace.
Packing all your bags.
Say goodbye, say goodbye, but save your last dance.
Take your last glance at me now. It's your chance.

Goodbye, goodbye. Everything will be alright.
Goodbye, goodbye. I promise I'll be by your side.
Goodbye, goodbye. Rest in peace alone.
I wouldn't put a fucking flower on your gravestone.
(If you died.) Goodbye, goodybye. Everything will be alright.

I used to be the boy, the only boy my mama had.
Now I'm sittin' in this house underneath my past.
Cleaning out where we used to drink and laugh.
Thinking what had happened, how it happened, how I didn't see the past.
Seems like all it had happened all too fast.
Thinkin' sound was my mask. I was caught up, lost in the mask.
Now it's dark, and now it's black. I missed the contrast.
You say it's black and white, black and white my ass.
And in these moments I was wrong. These moments seem so long.
Ticking on the clock till the moments gone, and I don't wanna go back.
Relapse the day, collapse the faze while I'm looking down the drain.

Goodbye, goodbye. Everything will be alright.
Goodbye, goodbye. I promise I'll be by your side.
Goodbye, goodbye. Rest in peace alone.
I wouldn't put a fucking flower on your gravestone.

Goodbye, goodbye. I promise I'll be by your side.
Goodbye, goodbye. rest in peace alone.
I wouldn't put a fucking flower on your gravestone. (If you died.)

See my conscience don't work no more, it don't hurt no more.
And it don't hurt to see you lying, it don't work no more.
So when I'm sayin' 'Stay away!', realize I ain't fucking playing.
Younger like my younger days. Maybe hungry but I'm crazed.
Raised by criminal ways, hear the chandelier break.
It ain't no mistake. I'm waiting on Nolana's grave, and can't get any pictures from my veins.
Ain't no fucking me for Jane. Naked for my brother's rein.
On my arm you'll see the same.
And if I never see your face, I will always feel the same.
Divide me from the wrongs.
So when I'm gone my spirit will live on. Let my lyrics show you God.

Je ne suis pas en sucre
Je ne suis pas en sel
Mais je sens bon l'amour
Jusque sous les aisselles
Si j'avais une voix
Et la moustache qu'il faut
Pour passer sur Nova
Tu reviendrais bien tôt

Quand j'y pense
Rien ne la panse
La béance que tu as laissée
C'est vrai que quand j'y pense
Faut que j'avance
La séance est terminée je sais, alors

Alors je laisse aller les doigts sur mon clavier
Je viens gifler mes cordes plutôt que ton fessier
Je crie de tout mon être sur un morceau de bois
Plutôt que dans tes oreilles qui n'écoutent que toi
D E T E S T E, te déteste
D E T E S T E

Et tu n'es pas la plus fine
Non tu n'es pas la plus folle
Quand tu veux la jouer comme
C'est comme et restera comme
Comme ce que tu n'es pas
Mais que tu me montrais
Tu peux changer de voie
Mais pas ce que tu es

Vianney,"Je n'avais aimé le froid
Auparavant que depuis chez moi
Mais sur les Champs Elysées
Tout dépend ce que l'on en fait
Il y avait des types qui vendaient des vins chauds
A d'autres types qui se pelaient les os
Parmi les chant de noël il y eut
Un parfum de fleur, un frisson un début
Et comme le froid fait bien les choses
Avant toi il fallait que j'ose

Labello
La belle, la belle aubaine
Ce labello
Labello, Labello, Labello sur tes lèvres

Des centaines de chinois
Promenant avec des caméras
Mais sur ces Champs Elysées
Il n'y a que toi que je voyais

Et j'entendais des types criant ""Aux marrons chauds""
Quand d'autres types recherchaient un métro
Si c'est noël dans la rue
Dans mes bras mon cadeau ne bouge plus
Comme le froid te fait les joues roses
Contre moi je veux que tu oses

Labello
La belle, la belle aubaine
Ce labello
Labello, Labello, Labello sur tes lèvres

Vianney,"Elle peut très bien avoir l'air d'une souillon
Je ne retiens que ce qu'elle a de bon
Ses cheveux gras pourraient bien me cacher
Un souriant visage que la fin a creusé

Ça sent fort la sueur et la piquette séchée
Jusque dans son cœur bien trop alcoolisé
Madame a les dents grises ou bien noires ou tombées
Ne défait sa chemise que deux fois dans l'année

Dans leur silence les gens sont méchants
Le monde avance pendant que le temps
Du nous du bien s'en va la la la la
La la la la

Dort-elle vraiment quand le mercure s'enfuit
Et que le blanc vient habiller la ville
Quand une bouteille a remplacé maison 
Fout la voire qui s'y baigne rouge comme un brugnon

Dans leur silence les gens sont méchants
Le monde avance pendant que le temps
Du nous du bien s'en va la la la la
La la la la

Dans leur silence les gens sont méchants
Le monde avance pendant que le temps
Du nous du bien s'en va la la la la
La la la la

Et pour les coeurs étranges aux rires et aux émois
La vie commence quand on chérit le moi
Et ma seule ma belle ma racine sans arbre
Survira-t-elle si le monde est de marbre?
Si le monde est de marbre
Si le monde est de marbre
Si le monde est de marbre
Si le monde est de marbre",Les gens sont méchants,2014
Vianney,"Tes jolis chaussons roses
N'ont pas l'air torturés
Par tes mouvements grandioses
Ma danseuse de ballet
Ballerines qui s'échinent
Sur un brillant parquet
Qu'une pointe déchire
Au point de l'écailler

Quand t'enveloppes, dans du blanc
Du bleu, du brun, du rose
Tu fais valser le tulle
Comme une tulipe éclose
Les étoiles n'ont de grand
Que la grâce qu'elles épousent
Parfois en découvrant
Vos poitrines trop douces
Je l'avoue, j'imagine
Que malgré ce Chagall
Dans le noir, tu devines
Qu'il y a mon cœur loyal
Et je rêve qu'un d'ces soirs
Sur la place des Vosges
On discutera Béjart
De petits ou d'autres choses

J'imagine, qu'au réveil
Quand tu étends le bras
Un rayon de soleil
Semble invité chez toi
Et quand d'un coup de peigne
Tu remets bien en place
Le chignon, ce diadème
Qui range ta tignasse
Hahaaaahaaaa

J'imagine que c'est dur
Que ça sent le travail
Dans tes tristes blessures
Physiques ou bien mentales
Repose toi, dans mes bras
Dis s'ils sont à ta taille
Ma danseuse, mon étoile
Redeviens petit rat

Compte moi",Mon étoile,2014
Vianney,"Tout petit caneton j'attendais la plume
Qui ferait que mon nom soit dans les tribunes
Des canards, des journaux, des vendeurs de brume

Les pattes dans la mare j'avais beau tenter
Un jour j'en eut marre, j'ai dus me barrer
Loin de tous ces oiseaux qui se ressemblaient

Sous mon jaune plumage, je me suis construit
Un cœur tout en couleur et l'orage
Et l'orage s'est envolé et moi aussi, mes ailes
J'ai déployées, ma belle
J'ai survolé un monde où l'on s'aime

Et moi aussi, mes ailes
J'ai déployées, ma belle
J'ai survolé un monde où l'on s'aime

Une palme après l'autre j'ai gravis les dunes
Les collines et les autres, j'ai fait le plus dur
Au milieu des vautours, des mauvais, des enflures

Au milieu des aigris qui brisent les rêves
Lentement j'ai compris que le vent se lève
Jamais seul, non jamais, que quand on l'appelle

Sous mon jaune plumage, je me suis construit
Un cœur tout en couleur et l'orage
Et l'orage s'est envolé et moi aussi, mes ailes
J'ai déployées, ma belle
J'ai survolé un monde où l'on s'aime

Et moi aussi, mes ailes,
J'ai déployées, ma belle,
J'ai survolé un monde où l'on s'aime

Et toi aussi, quand tes ailes
Tu déploieras, ma belle
Nous survolerons ce monde où l'on s'aime
Où l'on s'aime

À la fin du chemin, alors je serais vieux
Loin de tous mes chagrins, loin des envieux
Je me rappellerais et puis encore
Je m'envolerais",Notre-Dame des Oiseaux,2014

Si tu tombes je ne t'en veux pas
Dans ton monde tu m'emporteras
Si je me trompe, on est bien comme ça
Oh, oh, oh, oh, on est bien comme ça

On débat sur des sujets qui nous font
Toi et moi, nous sentir un peu cons
On n'a pas le bagage qu'il nous faut
Ça je ne sais pas, mais je t'aime trop

Si tu tombes je ne t'en veux pas
Dans ton monde tu m'emporteras

Ça n'en vaut pas le jour
Pas plus que la chandelle 

Car si j'ai l'air débile
Dans mon mouchoir trempé 
C'est de voir mon nombril
Et me mettre à pleurer

À l'aide, à l'aide, à moi 
On m'a pas fait comme ça, nan 
À l'aide, à l'aide, à moi 
Comme un fils à papa 
À l'aide, à l'aide, à moi 
On m'a pas fait comme ça, nan 
À l'aide, à l'aide, à moi 

Ils disent j'ai de la chance 
Et je déteste ça 
Je connais mon enfance 
Et je déteste moi 

Car on est jamais trop riche 
Et puis toujours trop pauvre 
Et les autres, on s'en fiche 
Jusqu'à ce qu'ils nous sauvent 

À l'aide, à l'aide, à moi 
On m'a pas fait comme ça, nan 
À l'aide, à l'aide, à moi

À l'aide, à l'aide, à moi 
On m'a pas fait comme ça, nan 
À l'aide, à l'aide, à moi 

Il est tard, il est tard 
Et je voudrais qu'elle vienne 
Dans mes draps, dans le noir 
Et fasse bomber mes veines 

Contre un petit sein blanc 
Comme en suis-je capable 
Comme un gâté d'enfant 
De verser une larme?

On écrit des chansons 
Sur des accords mineurs, et moi
Moi, comme un con 
Je le fait de bon cœur 

J'oublie que fut un temps 
Un temps soit peu d'amour 
M'avait donné l'élan 
De savourer les jours 

À l'aide, à l'aide, à moi 
On m'a pas fait comme ça, nan 
À l'aide, à l'aide, à moi 
Comme un fils à papa, nan 
À l'aide, à l'aide, à moi 
On m'a pas fait comme ça, nan

Vianney,"T'avais des yeux de terre 
Et des voiles à gadoue 
Mille millier de mers 
Sur tes joues 
Je te tiens par le bras 
Je ne dis rien tu vois 
Il faut dire que le dire 
N'aide pas 
Si on pensait à rien 
Le temps d'un galopin 
Parfois penser peu 
C'est bien 
Et se dire qu'on est bien 
C'est mieux 

Y'a des milliers de voiles 
Qui n'ont jamais vu l'eau 
Nous faut pas qu'on s'installe de trop 
Passés les milles matins 
Si le temps nous éteint 

Alors parler peu 
Sera bien 
Mais se dire qu'on est bien 
Sera mieux 

Regardez les étoiles 
Et nous sentir humain 
Se dire on est que dalle 
Oh que rien 
On fera comme on peu 
On aura des gamins 
S'inquiéter un peu 
C'est bien 
Mais se dire qu'on est bien 
C'est mieux 

Il y'a tant de parfums au marché de Clichy 
J'y ai trouvé le tien samedi 
J'en ai fait mon savon 
J'en ai fait ma chanson 
Ça parait je sais 
Très con 
Mais tu verras demain 
Ce que font les refrains 
Oh pleurer un peu 
C'est bien 
Et se dire qu'on est bien 
C'est peu 

Mais mieux",Le  Galopin,2016

Completely cool and casual
They hardly knew each other was there
I mean Both of them had their own getting off to do
And they had to dream about their own self 

When they were through
But the modern girl was elated 
With what the revolution gave her
And since she was liberated she could have
Everything that striked her fancy

And she fancied quite a bit
I mean if it felt good she did it
And she did it every chance she could get
With her main modern man and otherwise
And her taste wasn't limited to just modern guys
Since another modern girl showed her
That modern girls know how to hold her

And after she had her eyes opened
All her old close friends started getting closer
And new friends weren't that far away
But the modern man he just wasn't so lucky
He being shook from his usual role as the heartbreaker
He was completely battered and bewildered
When he actually started in feeling something for her

And he discovered a new emotion
When they stopped ending up together as frequently
And when he finally confronted her with the question 
""had she been bedding down with others in the periphery without him?""
And she replied ""Hell yes! ain't it funny!""

I had no complaints,

So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away:

Gets you through the darkest day.

A song in blue
Like a flower crying

From my tender sentimental woes

Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind

And once you told me I was mistaken
That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

Vic Damone,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

Vic Damone,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1989
Vic Damone,"Love, soft as an easy chair
Love, fresh as the morning air
One love that is shared by two
I have found with you
Like a rose under the April snow
I was always certain love would grow
Love, ageless and evergreen
Seldom seen by two
You and I will
make each night the first
Everyday a beginning
Spirits rise and their dance is unrehearsed
They warm and excite us
'Cause we have the brightest love
Two lights that shine as one Morning glory and midnight sun
Time, we've learned to sail above
Time, won't change the meaning of one love
Ageless and ever evergreen",Evergreen,1989
Vic Damone,"Falling in love with love is falling for make-believe
Falling in love with love is playing the fool
Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy

I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full
I was unwise with eyes unable to see
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting
But love fell out with me

When you appear close to me, dear one
There in that dusk we'll share a dream reverie

In the blue of evening
While crickets call and stars are falling
There 'neath the midnight sky you'll come to me

In the shadows of the night we'll stand
I'll touch your hand and then
Softly as your lovely eyes entreat
Our lips will meet again

Vic Damone,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,1992
Vic Damone,"They asked me how I knew my true love was true
I of course replied ""something here inside cannot be denied""
They said ""someday you'll find all who love are blind""
When your heart's on fire, you must realize smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed to think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away, I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say ""when a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes""

When we met last night
I had always loved you it seems

And I felt the fire

That you kindle

And suddenly
The whole world changed
To a new design
In the arms of love
Heaven and Earth were mine

Oh, what empty things
Are the dreams of kings
When love's all that's worth
Dreaming of

Have their day and cease

Vic Damone,"Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm 
That pit-a-pats through my brain; 
So darn persistent, 
The day isn't distant 
When it'll drive me insane. 
Comes in the morning 
Without any warning, 
And hangs around me all day. 
I'll have to sneak up to it 
Someday, and speak up to it. 
I hope it listens when I say:

Fascinating rhythm,

When a mess you're making!

Why I'm always shaking 
Just like a flivver. 
Each morning I get up with the sun 
Start a-hopping, 
Never stopping 
To find at night no work has been done. 
I know that 
Once it didn't matter 
But now you're doing wrong; 
When you start to patter 
I'm so unhappy. 
Won't you take a day off?

Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?

That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

I will know right away, 
Soon as it shows. 
It may come cannonballing down through the sky, 
Gleam in its eye, 
Bright as a rose! 

Who knows? 
It's only just out of reach, 
Down the block, on a beach, 
Under a tree. 
I got a feeling there's a miracle due, 
Gonna come true, 
Coming to me! 

Could it be? Yes, it could. 
Something's coming, something good, 
If I can wait! 
Something's coming, I don't know what it is, 
But it is 
Gonna be great! 

With a click, with a shock, 
Phone'll jingle, door'll knock, 
Open the latch! 
Something's coming, don't know when, but it's soon; 
Catch the moon, 
One-handed catch! 

Around the corner, 
Or whistling down the river, 
Come on, deliver 
To me! 
Will it be? Yes, it will. 
Maybe just by holding still, 
It'll be there! 

Come on, something, come on in, don't be shy, 
Meet a guy, 
Pull up a chair! 
The air is humming, 
And something great is coming! 
Who knows? 
It's only just out of reach, 
Down the block, on a beach, 
Maybe tonight...

Vic Damone,"Every time we say goodbye, I die a little
Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know
think so little of me that they allow you go

Might never be cross or try to be boss,

Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,1996

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad

Vic Damone,"I'm recalling times when I was small, in light and free jubilee days,
Old folks praying everybody swaying,
Loudly, I chanted my praise.
How I sang about the Judgment morn,
And of Gabriel tooting on his horn.
In that sunny land of milk and honey,
I had no complaints,
While I thought of Saints
So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away:
When cares pursue you, ""Hallelujah!""
Gets you through the darkest day.
Satan lies awaiting and creating skies of grey,
But ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!""
Helps to shoo the clouds away.",Hallelujah,1996

Vic Damone,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together","There's a Small Hotel, song (from ""Jumbo"")",2000

I don't want to lose you,

I'll be the hero you're dreaming of.

I guess that I could leave
And find someone whose love
I'd never doubt (danger)

And should you break my heart

And my heart's in danger
When I play the game

And I see danger, danger
Danger, danger in your eyes
There's danger, danger

I know that I should stay away

The danger disappears
And when you're close to me
I have no doubts or fears

Far away, far away.
And if they call for me to come,
Then I must go, and you must stay.
So, Mary, marry me, let's not wait.
Let's share all the time we can before it's too late.
Love me now, for now is all the time there may be.
If you love me, Mary, Mary, marry me.

Far away, far away.

Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me!

Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Vic Dickenson,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Fancy white gloves has Macheath dear

When I tell you, all about Mack the Knife babe
It's an offer, you can never refuse

And this wonderful, great big band, bringing up the rear

Vic Dickenson,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland

The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
Then you and I came wandering by
And lost in a sigh were we

Your arms opened wide and closed me inside
You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly",Tenderly,2000
Vic Dickenson,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart

Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears?

But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me

Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;

And take her to that home on high

And come to you when I die

Our names are carved upon the tombstone
I promised you before you died

And so I pop pain pills until I feel better
And I'm hustling, now we got that phone bill
And I got me a job but no it won't cut it
So I step on that work because the dope will
All we know is and skyscrapers
Yeah it's concrete
Where the kids at? Let me go speak to 'em
But if you've never seen any mountains or the stars
How you ever 'sposed to know that's the thing you should reach for?

I'm sayin' though, I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever

We won't do what they tell us
Pill popping just to feel better
Times getting hard we try keep our head up
If we die, we gon' live forever
We won't do what they tell us
Pill popping just to feel better
Times getting hard we try keep our head up
If we die, we gon' live forever

We never die that's why my motto still alive
Like Aaliyah's spirit I told you one and a million times
This is a dream, the one I used to fantasize
So I'm looking at me from heaven
Through my grandma's eyes
And I know that she be proud
So you hear me screaming loud
""I'm on a billboard just so you could see me now!""
If she's in the clouds, why pour my drink on the ground
So I pour it up for you, you want Henn' or a Crown?
Chi-Town ambulances don't come around
When shorties' brains blown out
You want me to dumb it down?
That's why we get high, roll trees and Backwoods
It's hard to know you can when you raised off canned goods
All we know is U.S.D.A checks and Save-A-Lot
Never had money so we had to save a lot
But how you gonna tell the kids
They capable to rewrite pop culture
When all they had was pills to pop?

I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did voltron
Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the obi-wan kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
Ima end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need em but the chronic all up in my clothes

I got God on my side and I know the devil trying to take a nigga under
Really makes me wonder
And I'm feeling like the 2nd coming
As I fucked the world for the first time and she love it

I think this life is the only one for me
I wouldn't trade it for nothing, unless
She was 5'7"", pretty waist, coke bottle, basket case
You know me I like the danger

I'm on I-95
Double fist tequila while I drink and drive, yeah
2016 I gotta get it now
Pray to God I'm still alive
Put your lighters up
Let me take you where I was
Southside ain't safe outside
Seen a nigga standing on 47th street with a black Glock nine in the sky
Put your bangers up, twist your fingers up, bangers up
Niggas yelling ""Gang!"" but niggas ain't tailored up
Nah, inked up, I'm tatted up
Run up on the studio and Rata-Tat-Tat it up (rt!)
I let all my niggas talk for they self
They like to jugg, man they like easy money
They like making that shit hard for they self
I just realized I don't fuck with y'all
I just gotta stack my money tall
You know that feeling when you at the bank
Tryna quit cigarettes going through withdrawals
And you always knew you had what it takes
So you feeling like it's time that you take it all
Lying through they teeth niggas too fake
That's the reason really, really why I hate you all
That's how I feel out here, shit is real out here
Young niggas really out here in the field out here, yea
What's the deal out here?
Trying to turn a couple hundreds to a mil' out here, yea
And it's still our year

I wouldn't trade it for nothing, unless
She was 5'7"", pretty waist, coke bottle, basket case
You know me I like the danger
You know me I like the danger

I don't like the way that niggas talking like they bullet proof
Until they gotta find out what a bullet do
Catch two in your Canada Goose
It'll turn a nigga into proof, ooh
Shout out to my niggas on 8 Mile
Shout out my niggas on Flatbush
Shout out to my niggas up in K-Town
Gangbanging, rolling up the ops in the Backwoods
Don't get turned into a pack kid
You know how to act kid
You know where we at yea
You know what The Blueprint is
Ain't really shit for me and Jay to lay a nigga flat yea
And we build it from the ground man
I made the foundation like bitches with make-up
You're flexing your Jacob
Get cut like a shape up
The city so hot it might dry the whole lake up
I need a yacht I could ride like a race horse
I need a bitch that's A1 like the steak sauce
Pussy so good I might stay like my pesos
Bitch and my gang, I'm the chief like a Halo
I go hard in the paint like a DayGlo
I tell Steve Aoki he look like Towkio
I'm on my new Hov and Nas it's a takeover
Young boy but I'm an OG like I'm Maco

Vic Mensa,"There's a lot goin' on, but this the dynasty

The crazy man's keepin' me up, I'm not sleepin'
My fit too fresh to be doin' the housekeepin'
The maids cost too much, started cleanin' my own closet
Livin' childhood fantasies, dealin' with grown problems
Got a brand new bae, she keep me good like the music
If the Roc is here, throw up your diamonds and hood cubics
No I.D. said it's time to take these goofy niggas out rap
Drop bombs over Baghdad on these SoundCloud outcasts
I stray away to say the way my days would be without rap
My mind drifts to back before the Chi was labelled Chiraq
Then Chief Keef dropped in 2012, now it's a drill
I was waitin' in the wing like a bird on a windowsill
Now I'm the fresh prince, I think I know how my uncle feel
He sent this dope shit to my veins like fiends on any deal
After we build on existing structures, shift the culture
Like George Bush searchin' for weapons of mass destruction
Think I'm 'bout to blow! But this ain't the Middle East
This the midwest and we the royal family like Della Reese
SAVEMONEY the new dynasty like Death Row in '93
The same year my mother's water broke on 57th St
Mama Mensah knew she raised a very special man
Young Muhammad in the ring with the power in my hands
To defy the federation like Ali in Vietnam
The Roc is still alive, throw your diamonds up again

Yeah, I carry the Roc like a runnin' back, hundred miles and runnin' back
Hov the president, he flyin' private in Obama's jet
Vic the young hitta, I want it with any nigga
My problems' deeper than rap, ain't a problem to bury niggas
Cemetery diggers will be ready for your favorite rapper
Catch him stompin' in my yard, I step up like a Beta Kappa
I am nothin' like these actors, they're only on camera
I hit 'em in the head like Holly Holm hit Ronda
And my home is Rwanda, blood diamonds and minors
High school students with guns hidin' in their binder
Gotta wear a clear bookbag and wear a hood pass
Hit you from the blindside, that's a no look pass
Rookie season, Steve Nash, they are just my sons
Catchin' alley oops, catch 'em in the alley, oops
I heard a certain who's who mad that I like the danger
Get your priorities straight like Hermione Granger
Sixteen in the magazine and one in the chamber
Sneak it in the club, that's a club banger
This is not a diss song, this a disclaimer
Sorry that your management can't manage my anger
Violence is not the answer but, lord, they done brought it to me
You gon' see a side of me, the South Side taught it to me
They gon' think I'm Akeem when I pull up and pull
A semi Uzi, auto, fully out the robber yellow hoodie
Yeah, Pelle Pelle bloody, Motown Berry Gordy
With the shits, levatory, tell a nurse, purgatory
Minimums is mandatory, crack sentencin'
Bad parentin', put his dad on Maury, just another classic story
I know there's no master for me, I don't even buy chains
I don't rock diamonds, I just need the Roc chain
I don't get high no more, I go high octane
They should call the rap game my name, this is my game, Vic!

You will not

It's 2016 who would think
Kids in America don't have clean water to drink
Like they cut the EBT took 'em off of the link
I read a story about a woman with her daughter in Flint
She got lead poisoning, from showers in the morning
When the governor switched out the pipes to bring the water in
To the city river 'cause he said they can't afford to get, clean water
So now the poor people get the shorter end
Of the stick, ain't that some bullshit?
Shorty thirsty, he just bought his fourth fifth
It's lead in the water gun, he dying from a full clip
And they got toddlers drinking toxic waste
While the people responsible still ain't caught no case
I don't get it man, I just ain't wit it man
They got 'Damn Daniel' distracting you on Instagram
Back again with the all white media coverage
They do it over and over like remedial subjects
The people with the least always gotta pay the most
We the first to go when they deleting them budgets
Can a nigga get his basic human rights?
Is that too much to ask, should I say it more polite?
And everybody broke so we in the same boat
But would they let that bitch sink if we was white?
It got me shades of blue

Rain or shine, it's all blue, it's all blue
Ain't no sun, it's all blue, it's all blue

We can't trust ourselves, and we don't know who to trust

I'm a part of him, he a part of me
I'm a prodigy in these Prada jeans
I'm tryna' make my partners a part of the election
So you ain't gotta presidential pardon me
And pardon me, but why is it that the darker must suffer?
How do we protect the culture from the vultures?
There's a Cold War every summer in the Chi
It's a snowball effect from the Cold War in Russia
But Vladimir Putin ain't in the hood recruitin'
And Derrick Rose ain't the only one out here shootin'
They set fire to their own squad cars
And a bitch on the news gon' blame it on the lootin'
Now here I am talking 'bout a revolution
And I can't even spare a dollar to the movement
But I'm in the strip club spending dollars on that movement

Remind me of you, babe
You pick me up in your old Buick station wagon
With the radio broke
I roll the window up
You turn the AC on
Who knew you'd be so cold?
Newports burnin' on our lips
A shootout in the background as I told you that I love you
A gunshot to the heart couldn't have hit me as hard as you did
As hard as you did, no
Ash my cigarette
Waitin' for your response
It burns slowly as a spirit
Who knew you'd be so bold?

You were only seventeen, fallin' in love with everything
Except for me, except for me, except for me
These cigarettes is burnin' like a dream
And all this money heals everything
Except for me, except for me, except for me

We wrote our names beneath the bridge
To be sure that the city never forgot us
Who woulda known you'd be so quick to forget about me
I guess that's memory loss
I wish you loved me as much as weed
Shit, even half as much as weed
I know you love to smoke
Marlboro 27s were your favorite
Only thing you loved more was your little sister
I hope she never grows up to be as fucked up as you did
Fucked up as you did, oh
Light my cigarette like we did when we were young
Who knew we'd grow so old?

You were only seventeen, fallin' in love with everything
Except for me, except for me, except for me
These cigarettes is burnin' like a dream
And all this money heals everything
Except for me, except for me, except for me

I recently realized I'm a hopeless romantic
I ask a lot of questions, but I'm not open to answers
And all of my girlfriends just fall into the same old patterns
Like sudoku puzzles we cross words, spoken in anger
I must be the best at turnin' the good girl crazy, that's like my strong suit
'Cause every time we should be breakin' up I'm right there on cue
Like a pool stick with some bullshit 'bout what I'm goin' through
You should have an amber alert for me, I swear they should have warned you
I mean, young rap god, what do you expect from me?
And women are like a greatest hits album, they get the best of me
I give 'em my all and then forget to call the next morning
I used to play my tape in the passenger while she bend corners
She was only seventeen, first girl that broke my heart
Now I think I take it out on every girl I take out on
Dinner dates, to somewhere nice to sit like Rosa Parks
Guess that's just the way it is, it all ends the way it starts

That's the difference between me and them
When they thought it was the end, I was still trying to see a M
Another difference between me and them

I was backed into a corner
Sat chasing, catching charges
It's re-election season
Bitch, I think I'm back in office
You don't know my pain, how far I came
Those days have gone, you curse my name
I pray to God to shine the sun, he gave me rain

Marching harder than a million martyrs
On my darkest day, I'm still a star, I shine regardless

You can see the pain still alive in my eyes
I've loved and I've lost, through heaven and hell
They turned their back on me too many times to turn back now
My nigga, I won't stop now
I can't, I can't, I can't stop now
I can't, I can't, I can't be stopped now

And I thought they said light skin niggas went out of style
André 3k said you only funky as your last cut
So I'm state to state, and I act like a Mack truck
Plus I gotta keep a Mac tucked
For these big soldier niggas on the net trying act tough
Y'all too alternative, get your facts up
I shoot to Heathrow, get my stacks up
I get pounds to spend, that's English
Bitch, I think I'm 'bout to rack up
You don't get it, do you?
When you on that big screen, there's a lot of little people living through you
When you don't stick to the script
They assassinate your character and act like they never knew you
That's just how the game goes, I guess
Change clothes, I dressed like Project Runway meets the projects
Write like Noah but a little more complex
I fed niggas and they shitted on me
Took the piss out me, then spilled it on me
When I broke down like Britney Spears
Said they throw me ""Oops"" and never did it on me
So I wrote 'em out and make a bigger story
Vic's story, that's victory
Niggas never did shit for me
Show them the ropes and they jumped ship on me
But I never drowned, stayed down
Sang songs for my hometown
Made homes for the broke kids
Steppin' over needles in the playground
Y'all the only thing that matters to me
If y'all love me, fuck everybody
If y'all love me, they can never stop me
If y'all love me, they can never stop me

Out of the fire, I found a fire inside
You can see the pain still alive in my eyes
I've loved and I've lost, through heaven and hell
They turned their back on me too many times to turn back now
My nigga, I won't stop now
I can't, I can't, I can't stop now
I can't, I can't, I can't be stopped now

All in the store tryna go O-Dog
Poppin' at the sales clerk in a lil' skirt

Whatever it is, you got me hooked
Whatever it is, you got my new girl shook

Bbeen a while since we spoke but it's hidden fo'

Sad it had to be at another funeral
That was a wild summer, same one that took Rod from us
When I heard they stabbed him in his side
Swear to God I could feel that shit in my stomach
Yo I heard it was some niggas from the wild hunnids
That sneaky bitch set you up man
Fuck man that shit was tough man
Over some petty ass weed
I was like anybody but Cam
I called Autumn immediately
Needed someone to feed it to me
I'm I couldn't stomach it on my own
I wanted to throw up like I was chuggin' Patron
Every time I run through your number in my phone
I think about bullet holes runnin through your dome
I just saw you that week on 53rd
I'm tearing up man it's hard to put this shit in words
It's like Macklemore at the Grammys, man
I just feel like you got some shit you didn't deserve
You was a good nigga, but the good niggas always die young, fucking with them hood niggas
I know you had your hands in that dirt, but
They ain't have to end you out outside that Kenwood Liquors
Now shit'll never ever ever be the same for me
None of this money takes my pain from me
Yeah, but still for whatever it's worth

It's been a while, what's good though?
I see you on the road like 10-4
I ain't surprised I knew you was gonna kill em tho
I heard your song holy holy
That shit really touched me man
You were just a little bony homie
To see you in front of thousand of people
Screaming my name, man that shit did a lot for me
Sometimes heaven gets lonely
I talked to your grandma, she said ""tell Vic I'm proud for me""
I got that little liquor you poured out for me
I was drinking with Rod yesterday, I know you you miss him
You really need to keep your squad closely, I mean Joey, Kanay, Smoko, Towkio
You know? Your ride or die homies
'Cause to be honest them other niggas is all phony
But you know you got to stay off them drugs man, they no good for you
I see you in that bathroom stall suicidal with that gun in hand
How could you wanna die? Shit is so good for you
Heaven ain't that bad though
Just a lot of sunny days, mad dope
I smoked with Kurt Cobain yesterday, he said he liked your shit
And to tell you that you on the right path though
Don't cry I'mma see you when its time

What up young vic?
You don't know my name
I'm just another nigga caught up in the street game
I been through things, seen things
I know this was might sound crazy but let me explain
It was a dark night, I got call from this broad right
She said I'm hittin you about this shit
Because I know you got stripes like off white
I got a lick for you, you got a car right?
You'll need it for my crib in an hour
Hold on one second, he just got out the shower
Who you talkin' to, nothin' I'm talkin' to my momma
Now listen close, I can't talk any louder
He got 10 pounds in his trunk
He's bout to take it up north from my crib to drop it off to the plug
You could get him raw for the cash if you quick
And I know he ain't strapped because I just hid his gun
I asked her who the nigga was she ain't say a name
I just had a baby man I had to make some change
I was hurt, how could I turn away a stain
So I called up my brothers like Damon Wayans
We piled up in my Monte Carlo, pulled up to the bitch crib
Seen a white Ford Explorer shorty just told me to follow
He was sittin on 75th, he bent on stony and made a stop at the Kenwood Liquors
He ran inside to get a drink
When he stepped out he had a bottle of Hennessy in his hand
We rolled up and put that banger to his face
I told him give me everything in the car, nigga everything
He start stumbling like ""I ain't got anything""
I said ""shut the fuck up man, open the trunk up fam
Before I gotta let this hammer bang""
He reached for the keys and put him in
The trunk popped open I saw the weed in saran
I told him step the fuck back, he ain't listen though
His hand move he started reaching again
I was scared, I ain't gon lie
That's what it was
I thought he had a gun, my eyes went black
I let two shots go
Before I knew it he was layin' in the ground in a puddle of blood
I know it ain't right
I think about it every night
I ain't even mean to take his life
We livin' in the streets where ain't shit free and your man just had to pay the ultimate price
A week later I saw your post on the 'gram
R.I.P. Dare with a picture of him
I recognized the face from somewhere and then I realized

Vic Mensa,"The metaphor of the bird is eternal

As I stood in the bathroom with a 9 millimeter in my mouth
Empty Henny bottle on the couch
The mirror in front of me reflected everything I hated in those around me
I felt like a hypocrite
I wanted to fly away from it all
The lies, the betrayal, the rage I felt
To turn every page I'd ever written into flames and let it burn

This is what it sounds like
The streets cry
When the streets cry
I'm startin' to think that this is all my fault
Niggas under them hoodies, we above the law
How could I think that we wouldn't get judged at all?
Always in the club when them guns go off
Layin' under that preacher when he talk that talk
My mother is thinkin', where did it all go wrong?
Father thinkin' if he spent more time I coulda played ball

Oh
I am the first son of Betsy and Edward Mensa
Made love and made a legend, Woodlawn and 47th
Gunshots outside my window, drug deals out by the Citgo
But mama always made sure the tooth fairy found my pillow
My pops was always workin', he put the family first
Chicago Saturdays in the park and Sundays at church
Kept me from off the corner where Stones and GDs was warrin'
And Kings and BDs and VLs all had dreams of bein' Jordan
Even dope fiends was scorin', swish, tryna be like Mike
Shootin' through that baseline in their veins tryna reach that height
I was a little rockstar, dressed up like Jimi Hendrix
In Hyde park in the good part in the hood like Kimmy engine
Teachers didn't see my vision, had me in IEPs
Kicked out of kindergarten, they didn't know that I was me
Tattooed my tears, wrote my story in my skin
Because even as a boy I always knew I'd be the man

I saw it in my sleep (yeah)

Sebastian got me high

At age 12 I learned the difference between white and black
Police pulled me off of my bike, I landed on my back
Back to reality, oops, a victim of gravity
Where they pull you down and keep you there
Dependin' on how you keep your hair
Now it's fuck 'em up and nothin' but NWA
Smokin' a 7 or an 8th, way before 7th grade
My classmates sellin' yay
Sebastian got me high that first time
In the back of an abandoned truck by Webster Place
Couldn't feel my face
Sprayin' paint to see my name on trains, try not to catch a case
Age 13 a crammed granny house, watchin' him shoot up the Ace
He took the needle out and waved it in my face
If I ain't tell that boy, ""Be easy, dog,"" I coulda died of AIDS
I started realizin' my talents 'bout the time I was 15
Tryna take over the world like Pinky and the Brain
Sellin' kush and hittin' stains, still in True Religion jeans
16, I was shinin' just like a Stanley Kubrick scene
Sneakin' into Lollapalooza, I fell off of that bridge
15,000 volts went through my elbow, fell over 30 feet
The doctor said I should be dead, still alive and still ain't scared
In the hospital bed, writin' these rhymes in my head

In my dreams (in my dreams)
I saw it in my sleep (yeah)

With all of these backstabbers I feel like The O'Jays
I wanna open up my parachute but it's cold playing this 
Role when you never been the type to role play
There's something about this game and it fucks with you mentally
Like football players leaving the league with traumatic brain injuries
And eventually, you'll never be the same as you were
Then you look back at your life and everything is a blur
Like did I really turn twenty-three and see a mill before twenty-four?
Did I really blow it all like a hand grenade in the middle of a civil war?
Am I still down with the same niggas that I came in with?
Do they value my friendship?
Or do they just love the attention?
Not to mention my girlfriends, what went wrong?
Did they do me too right?
Am I the same as the snakes? Is the past coming back to bite?
Did I waste too many days? Did I fight too many nights?
Will they love me when I die? Will I ever learn to fly?

The beat is my therapist, Skateboard, paint the picture
A portrait of the artist formerly known as Vic
I read the signs I was close to overdose like Prince
Picking pill pieces up out of the bathroom sink
Like an armored truck ridin' the rink
I'd probably be a vegetable if not for medical attention
My self destructive habits have me itching like Tyrone Biggums
In the cyclone of my own addiction
The voices in my head keep talking, I don't wanna listen
""You'll never be good enough, nigga, you never was
Nobody fucking needs you, you should just jump off the bridge
You hurt everyone around you, you impossible to love
I don't want you to live, I wish you were fucking dead
I wish you were never born, we would all be better for it
I don't love you, I don't like you, like a fucking metaphor
Fuck everyone song you ever done, you lie to everyone
And ask them to tell the truth when that's something you never done
You a fucking embarrassment, how dare you win
Nigga, you let the devil in
You're still a drug addict, you're nothing without your medicine
Go and run to your sedatives, you can't run forever, Vic""

One day I dream of telling my mama
""You ain't gotta work no more""
Same for my father, born in Ghana, down on that dirt road floor
Far as he came I can't complain, but pain is so subjective
Spend so much time countin' issues, I forget to count my blessings
Watch my cousins back at home, getting water out a well
While I watch my brother stacking stone, whippin' water by the scale
Tryna' get a mill' on the other side
They ain't got a meal, we don't recognize, we in heaven
So we think we live in hell
It's been getting kinda hard to tell
But

Sometimes I wake up and I look up in the sky
Asking why I'm alive when so many niggas died
And my pride won't let me give up, Lord as hard as I try
In those times I try to remember

Why they flood Baton Rouge?
Why the city singing Alton's blues?
Why, why, why, why?

What the fuck I got to lose?

You fools, saying ""all lives matter""
But it's black lives you refuse to include
Blocked from the polls
Locked in the hood, trying to stop you from voting and stop you from growing
And cops keep blowing and blowing
Keep black people rocking the cotton
They don't want you to own, but

Sometimes I wake up and I look up in the sky
Asking why I survived all the days that I could have died
Who am I in my place
To contemplate suicide?
In those times I try to remember

That we could be free, truly
If we only knew we were slaves to the pains of each other
One thing I believe I can learn

I'm still in the hood, tell Zimmerman shoot
Hold my nuts with an OJ glove, fuck the judge
You rappers is false flagging, you a fashion blood
What's brackin' cuz? What you know about gangbanging?
What's V-lone thug? Why Bari leave your head rangin'?
Free Vic Mensa, I'mma start chain swanging
This that crack music, nigga, you can blame Reagan
I'm Balmain'ing, without paying, y'all playing
We higher than a bitch, my bitch Himalayan
Suicide-ielago, that's sacrificial lamb
I'm killa season Cam, no lives matter

Pullin' up with the coupe (Oh my goodness)
Must've done something with the roof (Oh my goodness)
You sittin' lookin' stupid on the stoop (Oh my goodness)
I would take notes if I were you (Oh my goodness)
This was designed with the stars, the square and the cross
So with no true north
Smilin', with 50 karats in my jaw
Fuck the law
It's a shame nigga, rhyme, nigga
Love crime

Every other night I’m outside with the nine
You ain’t got chips, fuck the world
You got chips, you could fuck the next man’s girl
Sounds harsh but they been ripped apart my world
The way 'Kiss told us should never be misquoted
Them guns that you wave on the camera we been toting
Selling love potion my whole rap career
So your streams and downloads could never match the kids
We could go foreign for foreign until it’s boring
My sheep will keep jumping the fence until you’re snoring
Street poetry I’m on Wale Folarin
'Til the world is mine like Illmatic and Lauryn, written on the globe
Face to a table full of blow
Fresh powder skiing in the snow
Type of rappers we know, got the right numbers on a kilo

Vic Mensa,"Command, we've lost control
The engine's bound to crash
The lightning strikes went bright
Do not go gently
It's just my luck
You shot my bluff down from a thousand miles
I'm falling fast
I'm falling fast

I want you to rage into the night
I want you to blaze into the light
Before your final flight
But boy, you're fine, you're fine
I want you to rage into the night
I want you to know, know you're right
Before your final flight
Racing, racing, red eyes are burning rogue

I always wondered whether leaving meant something deeper than freedom
To be able to see everything I see when I'm sleeping
Niggas waking up with no job, no mob lynching, we still hangin'
White man telling niggas to ball like Phil Jackson
Pray to Jordan, the play was enough to put up the bail
And a train don't stop
And we ain't have to ride the rails
Gas in the tank, hardly enough to make it home
They say home is where the hate is
I'm from where they kill their own
Probably film it on they phone, a generation addicted
To technology, problems we face are so conflicted
To take the burning road and just roll with the punches
Niggas thought I was gone, I Derrick Rose from the trenches
Same fences we jumped as a shawty still in the way
Sometimes I wish I could fly far, far away
Where my sins fall down like pouring rain
I'm on slip my knot, hope I don't fall again
Standing on my feet, feel so small to look into space
It's heavy just to stare up there and wonder what waits
So much we still don't understand, still right in front of our face
I light a match, for the jets

I want you to rage into the night
I want you to blaze into the light
Before your final flight
Before your final flight
I want you to rage into the night
I want you to know, know you're right
Before your final flight
Racing, racing, red eyes are burning rogue

Riding a burning road
Running low, not a soul who could know
It's every man who swept the burning ashes from the road

I put the Halloween pistol out the trunk
Inside my mouth, if it was real, but I would dunk
That's fucking dumb
How many thousand of kids would give they life to have mine?
Without a clue about the times I'd give my life to have time
I'm tired of waiting
Tired of chasing pills that I'm tired of taking
Tired of court cases, tired of judges
Tired of saying ""fuck it""
Tired of balling around the president, deciding this shits a gift
Two shots to life, only got one to live
You could lose it any night
Or down it in a fifth
Or win a championship game
As a man I feel pain
As a king, I feel reign
Ask me how I deal with fame
As I write you from my basement
The cards ain't changed yet
Niggas on 47 still dealing the same shit
Rocks, blows, ducking cops in clothes
Came into the world naked, now I'm in all this BAPE shit
Tryna buy a Rolex, can't even face time
I feel like it's all wasted
The underground getting wasted
I spent 1500 on these bottles and this table
I shake it before I pop, I promise I'm not stable
But that boy do got horse power, ignore hours
These days I lose tracks of days, been years since I felt this way
Count on me to rage

Before the final flight

I want you to know, you know you're right",Rage,2017

Vic Meyers & Vic Myers,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,

When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.

I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;

Vic Schoen,"C'est si bon
Lovers say that in France
When they thrill to romance
It means that it's so good
C'est si bon
So I say to you
Like the French people do
Because it's oh so good
Every word, every sigh, every kiss, dear,
Leads to only one thought
And the thought is this, dear!
C'est si bon
Nothing else can replace
Just your slightest embrace
And if you only would be my own for the rest my days
I will whisper this phrase

What?
Yeah, first to Montmartre!
Then the Moulin Rouge!
The Folies Bergere!
Not at all
Not Montmartre?
No.
Not the Moulin Rouge?
No.
Not the Folies Bergere?!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. They are

Only for Americans
The midnight life in gay Paree
The Frenchman he would never see
It's only for Americans
The prices in the smart cafe
The Frenchman he would never pay
The price that's more is only for
Americans from the U.S.A.

A Montmartre lady drops her hanky
And slyly winks her eye
That's only for the Yankee
The Frenchman wouldn't buy

Only for Americans
The Frenchmen on the boulevards
Don't buy those dirty postal cards
They're only for Americans
The little holes for peeping through
To see what naughty people do
The French would bore, they're only for
Americans from the U.S.A.

Only for Americans
The shops with many real antiques
Antiques as old as seven weeks
They're only for Americans
The bed on which a king made love
Which there are sev'ral dozen of
The French pooh pooh, we sell them to
Americans from the U.S.A.

That recently were made
They're not for Frenchmen's tables
They're for the Yankee trade

Those fancy sauces with ptomaine

With little ulcers on their tails
And all that cheese was made to please

While the American carouses
Where crimson shadows creep
The French avoid those houses
They go to bed to sleep

To see a show with girls undressed
That's only for Americans
The French don't go to naked shows
They've seen what's underneath the clothes
And each encore is only for
Americans from the U.S.A.

Only for Americans
The Frenchmen don't keep company
With south of France society
That's only for Americans

To pay for Barons, Dukes and Counts
That you adore, they're only for

That nothing must upset
We give you decorations
That Frenchmen seldom get

The ones the experts don't approve

I'm gettin' corns for my country, you should see the pounds fly

I served the drama, arts and the ballet
But the theatre guild came over and said, 'Forget about Pavlova '
