Alan Jackson,"Way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgie asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught

Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned how I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love

Well we foged up the windows in my old Chevy
I was willing but she wasn't ready
So a settled for a burger and a grape sno-cone
Dropped her off early but I didn't go home

Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned how I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love

Alan Jackson,"Love's a gamble every heart will take
You roll the dice in hopes that it won't break
One night I bet on your blue eyes and took a chance
And won a whole lot more than one night of romance

[Chorus]
I won the ace of hearts,that night in the dark
How lucky can one man be
I hold the winning hand any way life deals the cards
No way to lose, cause I've got you my ace of hearts

Love's a numbered wheel you have to spin
There's no need for me to spin again
Cause loving you is paying off more than I knew
I took a little risk and hit it big with you

[Chorus]",Ace of Hearts,1989
Alan Jackson,"She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man

The lady I love loves silk and satin
She was raised uptown with a silver spoon
Well, I was born on a farm just south of Jackson
We had an old Ford tractor and a country moon

She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man

She's Saks Fifth Avenue perfection
Caviar and dignified
Well, I live my life in WalMart fashion
And I like my sushi southern fried

She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man

She loves a violin, I love a fiddle
We go separate ways but we meet in the middle
Don't see eye to eye but we're hand in hand
A blue blooded woman and a redneck man

She's a blue blooded woman, I'm a redneck man",Blue Blooded Woman,1989
Alan Jackson,"Well I first kissed you on a hollow log
Down by the river they call the Dog
We fell in love and we vowed that day
Like the flow of the river our love won't change
Well we married that spring and we built a house
On the bank of the river where the rock juts out
Now the river's still here but you've long gone
You left me and the river here all alone

[Chorus]
I got the Dog River blues
I've walked holes in both my shoes
Now I still got the river but I ain't got you
I got the Dog River blues

Well the rain came down and the river rose up
Filled up the cab on my pickup truck
It came in the house and down the gall
And washed your picture right off the wall

[Chorus]

Well my heart still yearns and the river still rolls
And I pray someday it'll bring you home
So if you change your mind honey I'll be here
Waiting on the banks of that ol' Dog River

[Chorus]",Dog River Blues,1989
Alan Jackson,"In a small town down in Georgia over forty years ago
Her maiden name was Musik til she met that Jackson boy
They married young like folks did then, not a penny to their name
But they believe the one you vow to love
Should always stay that same

And on the land his daddy gave him, a foundation under way
For a love to last forever or until their dying day
They built a bond that's strong enough to stand the test of time
And a place for us to turn to when our lives were in a bind

And they made their house from a tool shed
Grandaddy rolled down on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
They taught us 'bout good living
They taught is right and wrong
Lord there'll never be another place
In this world I'll call home

My momma raised five children, four girls then there was me
She found her strength with faith in God and love of family
She never had a social life, home was all she knew
Except the time she took a job, to play a bill or two

My daddy skinned his knuckles on the cars that he repaired
He never earned much money but he gave us all he had
He never made the front page but he did the best he could
And folks drove their cars from miles around
To let him look underneath the hood

And they made their house from a tool shed
Grandaddy rolled down on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
They taught us 'bout good living
They taught is right and wrong
Lord there'll never be another place
In this world I'll call home
No there'll never be another place in this world
That I'll call home",Home,1989
Alan Jackson,"Has it been ten years
Since we said I do
I've always heard marriage made one seem like two
But you're looking better than you did back then
You still make this old heart give in

[Chorus]
And if I had it to do all over
I'd do it all over again
If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again

The preacher man said till death do us part
That seemed like forever to a young man's heart
Now the days seem much shorter
The longer we love
And the memories just keep adding up

If tomorrow I found one more chance to begin
I'd love you all over again",I'd Love You All Over Again,1989
Alan Jackson,"Well she puts her dancing shoes on every night
And comes alive there in the smoke beneath the neon lights
And she don't like those hurtin' songs
Cause she's already lived 'em

She don't get the blues, she gives 'em
She checks her broken heart there at the door 
She ain't looking for romance, she's danced that dance before
Well I pity the next poor fool that gets caught up in her rhythm

Cause she don't get the blues, she gives 'em
She's been on the losing end of love too many times
And she ain't gonna go for anything you've got in mind
So before you start let me impart

These few words of wisdom
She don't get the blues she gives 'em

[Chorus]

She don't get the blues, she gives 'em",She Don't Get the Blues,1989
Alan Jackson,"I could see it coming from a mile away
A heartache lookin' for a place to stay
But I couldn't resist her and I couldn't be cool
Lord can't a woman make a man a fool

[Chorus]
Its an age-old story but it still holds true
There ain't no end to what a man won't do
Hell love some woman til he goes insane
Its a short sweet ride on a runaway train

I was drunk and crazy from her sweet perfume
But I knew stone sober I was being used
Now the heartache lingers like a cheap cologne
She took all she wanted then she was gone

[Chorus]

It was almost worth if for the time we spent
But there ain't no future in a heart for rent
Still she taught me something bout the facts of life
Love cuts quicker than a switchblade knife

[Chorus]

Its a short sweet ride on a runaway train",Short Sweet Ride,1989
Alan Jackson,"Cowboys don't cry, and heroes don't die
Good always wins, again and again
And love is a sweet dream that always comes true
Oh, if life were like the movies, I'd never be blue

But here in the real world
It's not that easy at all
'Cause when hearts get broken
It's real tears that fall
And darlin' it's sad but true
But the one thing I've learned from you
Is how the boy don't always get the girl
Here in the real world

I gave you my love, but that wasn't enough
To hold your heart, when times got rough
And tonight on that silver screen
It'll end like it should
Two lovers will make it through
Like I hoped we would

But here in the real world
It's not that easy at all
'Cause when hearts get broken
It's real tears that fall
And darlin' it's sad but true
But the one thing I've learned from you
Is how the boy don't always get the girl
Here in the real world

No, the boy don't always get the girl
Here in the real world",Here in the Real World,1990
Alan Jackson,"Excuse me, ma'am can you help me
I need to place an ad with you today
No ma'am tomorrow may be too late
I'd like to have it started right away

What's that, no this is personal
I'm not buying or selling anything
Yes ma'am, I know just what to say
I wrote it down, this is how it should read

Wanted one good hearted woman
To forgive imperfection in the man that she loved
Wanted just one chance to tell her
How much he still loves her
He can't be sorry enough

What's that, no that's all I want to say
I just hope these few lines will get to her
Yes ma'am, she means everything
I hope she comes back when she reads these words",Wanted,1991
Alan Jackson,"Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her
She made leaving me look easy
I wish she'd made it look a little harder

I took her out of Texas
When she was just a girl
But old Tennessee and me
Couldn't take Texas out of her

Oh how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
Then nothin' else would come between the two of us
If Dallas was in Tennessee

By now she's leaving Memphis
And everything we had behind her
Lord I hope the gold band on her hand
Will serve as a reminder
That true love is a treasure
That's very seldom found
But you can't stay together if there's no common ground

Oh how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
Then nothin' else would come between the two of us
If Dallas was in Tennessee
Oh if Dallas was in Tennessee

Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her",Dallas,1991
Alan Jackson,"Don't rock the jukebox
I want to hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song

Before you drop that quarter
Keep one thing in mind
You got a heart-broke hillbilly
Standing here in line
I've been down and lonely
Ever since she left
Before you punch that number
Could I make one request

Don't rock the jukebox
I want to hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin'
Since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox
Play me a country song

I ain't got nothin'
Against rock and roll
But when your heart's been broken
You need a song that's slow
There ain't nothin' like a steel guitar
To drown a memory
Before you spend your money baby
Play a song for me

Don't rock the jukebox
I want to hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready
For the Rolling Stones

Alan Jackson,"Just another bar
With loud guitars
Smoke and candles burning low
And the same ol' boys
Their backs to the bar
Staring across a crowded floor
Then I hear a familiar sound
Your voice laughing out loud

From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance

So I take a chair
In a corner somewhere
You can't see me
But I can look at you
And I remember those times
When I looked in your eyes
The way that he now looks at you
Deep down I know it's over
But it hurts me when he's so much closer

From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance

And if I can't hold you near me
I'll just hold onto your memory

From a distance I can see you
Dancing slowly with somebody new
But I can't hold you like I want to
But I can love you from a distance
I'll always love you from a distance",From a Distance,1991
Alan Jackson,"I parked my car 'round back 
I've got the shades pulled down 
I told everybody including my mama 
I was leaving town 
But I've been right here 
Since you've been gone 
Belly-up at the bottom of a bottle 
Listening to George Jones 

And just playin' possum 
Laying low 
I've got hundred watts of hurtin' 
Coming through the speakers of my stereo 
Don't want to see nobody 
Nowhere I want to go 
I'm just playin' possum 
And laying low 

I'm gonna hide my heart 
And be a love recluse 
Oh I could cry on my best friend's shoulder 
But there ain't no use 
I need an expert on 
The pain I'm going through 
So I'll keep George on the old turntable 
'Til I'm over you 

And just playin' possum 
Laying low 
I've got hundred watts of hurtin' 
Coming through the speakers of my stereo 
Don't want to see nobody 
Nowhere I want to go 
I'm just playin' possum 
And laying low 

He's playin' possum 
And he's laying low",Just Playin' Possum,1991
Alan Jackson,"Midnight in Montgomery,
Silver Eagle, Lonely Road,
I was on my way to Mobile,
For a big New Year's Eve show,
Stopped for just a minute, 
To see a friend outside of town,
With my collar up, I found his name,
And felt the wind die down,
And a drunk man in a cowboy hat, 
Took me by surprise,
Wearin' shiny boots, a nudie suit, and haunted, haunted eyes,
He said: ""Friend, it's good to see you, 
It's nice to know you care""
Then the wind picked up and he was gone,
Was he ever really there?

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery,
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky,
Feel that lonesome chill,
'Cause when the wind is right,
You'll hear his song,
Smell whisky in the air,
Midnight in Montgomery,
He's always singin' there, 

Well, I climbed back on that eagle,
Took one last look around,
Red tail lights, shadow moves slow across the ground,
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passin' by,
I can hear that wistle moanin',
I'm so lonesome I could cry,

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery,
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky,
Feel that lonesome chill,
'Cause when the wind is right,
You'll hear his song,
Smell whisky in the air,
Midnight in Montgomery,
He's always singin' there, 

He's always singin' there

Well, Hank's always singin' there",Midnight in Montgomery,1991
Alan Jackson,"She looked me in the eye and said it's over
I can't take this heartache anymore
She said don't tell me lies and try to please me
I've heard it all so many times before

And I took her by the arm and said don't leave me
There's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do
Just give me time I'll be the man you've needed
She said I wish that I could take that for the truth

And I said someday
I'll get my life straight
And she said it's too late
What's done is done
And I told her someday
She said I can't wait
'Cause sometimes someday just never comes

She said all I've ever wanted was to love you
And somewhere deep inside me I still do
But now I think it's time I stopped believin'
'Cause I'm never gonna see a change in you

And I said someday
I'll get my life straight

And I told her someday
She said I can't wait

Alan Jackson,"I had to look through our old pictures
To see the way we used to smile
Before we left love in the closet
Like it just went out of style

Can we pull out those old feelin's
Wipe the hurt away like dust
Make love shine the way it used to shine
Find the gold beneath the rust

That's all I need to know
Do you want to stay together
Just say let's don't let go
And I'll keep holdin' on forever
Have the teardrops that you've cried
Drowned the fire in your eyes
Is there one flame beneath the smoke
Tell me is there any hope
That's all I need to know

Is it too late to recover
Those old smiles we used to wear
Can we save a love that once was strong
Before it breaks beyond repair

That's all I need to know
Do you want to stay together
Just say let's don't let go
And I'll keep holdin' on forever

Alan Jackson,"There's a lady living right above me
Pretty as a picture on the wall
Once I helped her with a bag of groceries
We met a time or two out in the hall

She told me somebody hurt her feelings
The hurt that's in her eyes is plain to see
Slowly she's been wearing out my ceiling
Walkin' the floor over me

Every night I hear her cryin'
Cryin' over some old memory
A little of my heart is down here dyin'
'Cause she's walkin' the floor over me

Back and forth I followed every footstep
Countin' long enough to fall asleep
Had the sweetest dream last night 'cause I dreamt
She was walkin' the floor over me

Alan Jackson,"A calloused right hand
Holds a shiny gold watch
For thirty rears spent on the clock
But you won't see no tears
From this working class hero
He's always been hard as a rock

But he knows he's too old
To really start over
Besides he just wouldn't know how 
I guess he's just glad
That he's not alone
But he's got to wonder what now

There's no hall of fame for that working class hero
No statues carved out of stone
And his greatest reward is the love of a woman
And his children
So after he's gone
That old working class hero lives on

Well that three-bedroom house
He build in the '50s
Seems so much bigger today
With just him and mama
And not many bills
'Cause all of the kids moved away

What he's done with his life
Might not be remembered
But he's got every right to be proud
'Cause the blood sweatin' years 
Of this workin' class hero
Is really what livin's about

'Cause there's no hall of fame for that working class hero
No statues carved out of stone

And his children

There's one lonely pillow on my double bed

Your letters wallpaper this shrine to the blues

We'd built this thing between us
I'm not sure what's the cause
So I swallowed all my pride
And tonight I climbed the wall

Tonight I climbed the wall
And took her by the hand
We'd come too far to fall
Couldn't stand to see it end
So tonight I climbed the wall

Makin' love is so much sweeter
When you love the one you hold
After all these years of holdin' her
You'd think by now I'd know

Now as we lie here together
All our troubles seem so small
Just these satin sheets between us
Cause tonight I climbed the wall

Up to my ears in tears

Well I found some old love letters you wrote me years ago

The angels knew what was to come
The reason God had sent His son
From up above
It filled their hearts with joy to see and
Knowing of His destiny
Came tears of love

And wondered if they realized
That star so bright
Was sent to tell all the land

Lately it just ain't my style

For a sound like the sun going down
In the magic the morning is bringing
There's a song for the life I have found
It keeps my feet on the ground

And the midsummer days sit so heavy
But don't they flow like the breeze through your mind
When nothing appears in a hurry
To make up for someone's lost time

She keeps my feet on the ground",Song for the Life,1994

Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women

So she packs her bags to try her hand
Says this might be my last chance

She's gone country, back to her roots
She's gone country, a new kind of suit
She's gone counrty, here she comes

He's been writing songs, speaking out against wealth and privilege
He says, I don't believe in money, but a man could make him a killin'

I hear down there it's changed, you see

But the bills are piling up and the pop scene just ain't on the rally
And he says, honey, I'm a serious composer, schooled in voice and composition

Alan Jackson,"Well I was sitting at a roadhouse down on Highway 41
You were wiping off some ketchup on a table that was done
I knew you didn't see me I was in a corner booth
Of course you weren't my waitress mine was missing her front tooth
So I flagged you down for coffee but I couldn't say a thing
But I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name.

I'm in love with you baby
I don't even know your name
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name

So I ordered straight tequila a little courage in a shot
And I asked you for a date and then I asked to tie the knot
I got a little wasted
Yeah I went a little far
But I finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car
The last thing I remember I heard myself say
I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name

I'm in love with you baby
I don't even know your name
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way
I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name

The next thing I remember I was hearing wedding bells
Standing by a women in a long white lacy veil
I raised the veil she smiled at me without her left front tooth
And I said where the Hell am I and just who the Hell are you?
She said I was your waitress
And our last name's now the same
'Cause I'm married to you baby and I don't even know your name

Yeah I'm married to a waitress

Hell the Olympic rings will be five old tires nailed together
See that's my fear, they're gonna get the list of events
They gonna have no idea what half this stuff is suppose to be
Like for fencing, they'll be giving people bailing wire and sheet metal

There probably have to cancel water polo after
The first two or three horses drown
I tell you instead of discus throwing
They'll be flinging Ford hubcaps

You can't blame them for the way they are
But you can sit back and grin
'Cause they'll do something that's so bizarre
You'll want to see it again

If you could ever get into their minds
There's no telling what you might find
They just do things in a different way
All the games that the rednecks play

And you know they haven't even thought about it
But the river they're having the kayak races
On is the same river they filmed deliverance at

That ought to add a whole degree of difficulty shouldn't it?
'Cause if Ned Batty couldn't make it down
That thing a French man in a pair of biker pants ain't got a chance

Be prepared to watch the wildest show
Making her out in the line
You may not see them bringing home the gold
But they'll sure make mama proud

If you could ever get inside their minds
There's no telling what you might find
They just do things in a different way
All the games that the rednecks play

Hey Ed, I got a white one

There's Johnson's hardware and Morgan's jewelry
And the ol' Lee king's apothecary
They ware the little man

I go back now and the stores are all empty
Except for an old coke sign from 1950
Boarded up like they never existed
Or renovated and called historic districts

There goes the little man

Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
Bout the little man that built this town
Before the big money shut em down
And killed the little man
Oh the little man

He pumped your gas and he cleaned your glass
And one cold rainy night he fixed your flat
The new stores came where you do it yourself
You buy a lotto ticket and food off the shelf
Forget the little man
Forget about that little man

He hung on there for a few more years
But he couldn't sell slurpees
And he wouldn't sell beer
Now the bank rents the station
To a down the road
And sell velvet Elvis and
Second-hand clothes
There goes little man
There goes another little man

Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
Bout the little man that built this town

You can buy the world with just one trip
And save a penny 'cause it's jumbo size

In just the first few seconds after I first seen her

My best old jeans and broke-in sneakers
A home run pitch floatin' right down the middle
The sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle

She goes direct to my heart
When it comes to lovin' me
She's everything I need, bulls eye-perfect

She's a three point jump-shot that's nothin' but net

Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw him,
You would even say it glows.

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.

Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say:
""Hey, Rudolph with your nose so bright,
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee:
""Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,
You'll go down in history!""

Alan Jackson,"It's painted red, the stripe was white
It was eighteen feet from the bow to the stern light
Second hand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
Put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, made for the water
Ran her for years, till the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
A '75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it make me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make her whine
He'd say, you can't beat the way an old wood boat rides
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half-ton shortbed Ford
My uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
Couple of burned valves and he had it going
He let me drive here when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
Sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With three-speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
And he'd say, a little slower son you're doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now three daughters of my own
To let them drive my old Jeep across a pasture in our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile, and say

Just an old worn-out Jeep
Rusty old floorboard, hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say, turn it left and steer it right
Straighten up girl now you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain

Thought it would be for all time

The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head.

The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.

But little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.

And stay by my side until morning is nigh.",Away in a Manger,2002

As we go along,

Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man,
But you can do the job
When you're in town.
Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid,
The plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland.
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,
Until the other kiddies knock him down.

Alan Jackson,"I just took your picture off the table
And I just took your picture off the wall
Hide from you anywhere I'm able
But there's one place I can't hide from you at all

[Chorus]
Tennessee, you don't make the whiskey
California, you don't make the wine
And Mexico, you don't make tequila
Strong enough to get her off my mind

Memories seem to know just where to find me
And lately they're all that I recall
And everything in this old house reminds me
Of the love I had and how I lost it all

[Chorus]

Days go by and I still feel the sorrow
And time don't make a difference in the pain
Just sitting here and waiting on tomorrow
Will drive me crazy if I don't go insane

Strong enough to get her off my mind",Strong Enough,2004
Alan Jackson,"The mechanic raised up from under my hood
He shook his head and said, ""This ain't good
Your timin' belt's done shrunk one size too small
Those spark plug wires are a little too long
And your main prodsponder's nearly gone
Your injector ports are stripped and that ain't all""

""Your torque converter's runnin' low on torque
And that water pump's nearly down a quart
But we caught it all in time so you're in luck""
He said, ""I've got the time and I've got the parts
Just give me the word and I'm ready to start
I think we can bring her in for eight hundred bucks""

But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money

Then he said, ""Ain't you that songwriter guy""
And I said, ""Yes I am,"" he said, ""So am I""
He sat down and played me a song by the grease rack
When he finished singin' he gave me a smile
And I closed my eyes and pondered awhile
He said, ""What do you think
Now don't hold nothin' back""

Well, I gave him my most sorrowful look 
And I said, ""This song's got a broken hook
I can order you a new one from Nashville but it won't be cheap
And I know you've been using a cut rate thesaurus
'Cause your adverbs are backed up into your chorus
Now your verse is runnin' on verbs that are way too weak""

But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny
It won't take too long, it'll just take money

And I said, ""Hold on friend now I'm not through
I hate to be the one to give you the news
But your whole melodic structure's done worked itself loose
It's got so many dotted eighth notes in it
I'd keep her under fifty beats per minute
I mean, that's just me talkin', it's really up to you""

""And you've got a bad safety problem with
That dominant chord with the augmented fifth
Just see how dangerously high it raises you up
So just go on over and work on my car
I'll sit here by the fan and chances are
I can straighten this thing out for..eigh..nine hundred bucks""

But don't be downhearted, I can fix it for you, sonny

Alan Jackson,"Starting over again is a bit like dancing,
You just need someone to lead and take it slow,
So lay your head on my shoulder,
Let me hold you close, that's it
There you go
There you go, you're doing fine
Take each day like a step, one at a time
Put one foot in front of the other
And the next thing you know
That's it
There you go

Every day is like a new beginning
One door opens, while another starts to close
But just slip your arms around me
Cause life's a dance, don't know
That's it
There you go
There you go, you're doing fine
Take each day like a step, one at a time
Put one foot in front of the other
And the next thing you know
That's it
There you go

I know how it feels to have your heart crossed
Like the wings of the butterfly
But you gotta try

Alan Jackson,"I've been a waiter, a roofer, a clerk
I've shoveled manure till my pride hurt.
When you're starting out, it's all part of the work
To do what I do.
I've been evicted for not making rent
Made my Daddy wonder where my good sense went.
For the price of a dream, my years have been spent
To do what I do.
So I stand here tonight with this six string guitar
To be something I've always been in my heart.
Just for the chance to play you my song
The thrill when I hear you singing along.
It's been worth everything I've been through
To do what I do.
I've played for empty tables and chairs
The drunks that don't listen, the crowds that don't care.
Been told countless times Boy you ain't goin' nowhere
To do what I do.
So I hope the critics and skeptics alike
All bought a ticket to this show tonight.
And they'll see firsthand that I have survived
And what doesn't kill you makes you more alive.
And I'm one of the fortunate few
To do what I do.
There's so much joy this music can bring
So I count my blessings when I step up to sing.
Cause they're so many people who would give anything
To do what I do.
And I thank you.
I can do what I do!",To Do What I Do [Live],2004

An' half the night
Tomorrow mornin', I know there'll be hell to pay

I ain't had a day off now in over a year
Our Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here

And pa comes in full of gin and he's mean as a rattlesnake
And if the well runs dry and we cry and cuss the garden hose
Then mama draws a bucket full of creek water just to wash our clothes

Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women

Vowed we'd never give it up

As another day grows light

And the road call me to roam

To the place where we call home

I love you more than I can show you
More than I could know in my heart

So lay down beside me and hold me tonight

While the dew is still on the roses

Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

This lunch break is gonna take all afternoon and half the night
Tomorrow morning I know there'll be here to pay, hey, but that's all right
I ain't had a day off now in over a year
My Jamaican vacation is gonna start right here
If the phone's for me you can tell 'em I've just sailed away

And pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

I could pay off my tip
Pour myself in a cab and be back to work before 2
At a moment like this, I can't help but wonder
What would Jimmy Buffett do?

I say, pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care

Pour me somethin' tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane

Alan Jackson,"It was painted red the stripe was white
It was eighteen feet from the bow to the stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine; put on a motor
Built out of love, made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood that will never be forgotten

It was just on old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson with electric choke
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make her whine
He'd say, ""you can't beat the way an old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton shortbed ford
My uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With a three-speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it mode me feel
And I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
And he'd say, ""a little slower son you're doing just fine""
Just a dirt rood with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

It was just an old worn out Jeep
Rusty old floorboard, hot on my feet
A young girl two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say, ""turn it left and steer it right,
Straighten up girl, you're doing just fine""
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When daddy let me drive

When daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive
Daddy let me drive
It's just an old plywood boat

Alan Jackson,"I'm getting out of this high-rise penthouse suite
Where we pretend life's rosy and sweet
I'm going back to the folks that I used to know
Where everyone is what they seems to be

And these high-class friends that you like to hang around
When they look my way they're always looking down
I'm tired of spending every dime I make
To finance this way of life I've learned to hate

I'm going back to a better class of loser
This up-town living's really got me down
I need friends who don't pay their bills on home computers
And who buy their coffee beans already ground
You think it's disgraceful that they drink three-dollar wine
But a better class of loser suits me fine

You say the grass is greener on the other side
From where I stand I can't see grass at all
And the concrete and the steel won't change the way you feel
It takes more than caviar to have a ball

Until for death it's crying
Only to have the lord refuse
Then you've been near my side
 
If in your heart somehow you know
You'll fail whate'er you do
Then you have walked a road of pain

Destroyed and cast away
Then watch a heart that once knew love
Grow sadder day by day

That's never felt the dew
You're traveling on the street of grief
Yes you've been lonesome too
 
If for your wasted wicked life
Your soul cries out in shame
And you could live it all again
It'd never be the same
 
If you've cried ""god please bless the one
To whom I was untrue""
You've lived the life of regret
Yes you've been lonesome too
 
If when the storms light up the skies
It seems you can't go on
Then from a vision your darling comes
You speak but she is gone
 
If then the tears flood down your cheeks
There's no one else for you
Then you can't ever hide from fate

You were wiping off some ketchup on a table that was done
I knew you didn't see me I was in a corner booth
Of course you weren't my waitress mine was missing her front tooth
So I flagged you down for coffee but I couldn't say a thing
But I'm in love with you baby and I don't even know your name.

I'm in love with you baby
I don't even know your name
I've never been too good at all those sexual games
So maybe it's just better if we leave it this way

So I ordered straight tequila a little courage in a shot
And I asked you for a date and then I asked to tie the knot
I got a little wasted
Yeah I went a little far
But I finally got to hug you when you helped me to my car

The next thing I remember I was hearing wedding bells
Standing by a women in a long white lacy veil
I raised the veil she smiled at me without her left front tooth
And I said where the Hell am I and just who the Hell are you?
She said I was your waitress
And our last name's now the same

On a hillside all alone

They were young and they were free
Like a mountain melody

But they just didn't know

Said ""God don't take my love from me""

And I'll dance with her till dawn

I was floating down that black water
Kick back on the Mississippi
On a raft with ol' Tom Sawyer
He got restless down around Memphis
That's where he left me
Said I'm one rambling man
I was gone before you met me

And there I was back in my hometown
That's just how dreams go
Thumb in the air wanted out of there
Heading my own road
Well I hitched a ride with this beatnik guy
Said looks like you read me

You fix that roof but your roots to the ground-boys

I had a bad nightmare
I was on some lost highway and you were nowhere near
Someone took your hand I wasn't that man
Girl, it sure did hit me
I was cussing fate but it was too late
You were gone before you met me

Yeah, I smelled that coffee
I heard you singing in the kitchen

Sick of what I'm supposed to be
I need a little time to vegetate my mind
Escape from my reality

I'm not entirely unhappy, 'cause sometime's life's crappy
Make me wanna stop and run
Take a three-day breather, sip a Margarita
Drift away beside the sea
Just Mexico, tequila and me, ah yeah

Well, my baby wants to hold me
Boss, he wants to scold me, momma won't quit calling me
The bank they want the payments
Sometimes they just can't take it
Got to find a place where I feel free
Just Mexico, tequila and me, ah-ha

Well, I'm out of Alabama, down to Louisiana
Halfway 'bout to New Orleans
Yeah, I'm leaning on my Chevy
Rolling through the levees trying to get to where I wanna be

Alan Jackson,"Is he tall, is he handsome
Does he make enough and then some
Does he miss you every minute that he's gone
Is he funny, is he witty
Does he tell you that you're pretty
Did he hang the moon, did he do no wrong
Is he Mr. Right, I wonder what he's like
The one you're waiting on

'Cause there's an empty seat beside you
And every guy here's trying to buy you
Something to drink
But you just keep brushing them off
You're watching whatever's on cable
Swirling your glass on the table
Wondering how long is too long
Is he working late, is he worth the wait
The one you're waiting on

How many glasses of Cabernet
How many minutes slip away
How many times were you gonna check your phone
I'm telling you if you were mine
You wouldn't be sitting here counting the time
You'd never spend a single moment alone
I bet he don't get how lucky he is
The one you're waiting on

How many glasses of Cabernet
How many boys can you turn away
How long 'til you turn off your phone
And look up at me, I'd be happy to be
The one you're waiting on
I'd be happy to be
The one you're waiting on",The One You're Waiting On,2015
Alan Jackson,"When God paints, birds sing
He colors every feather on a sparrow's wings
When God paints, the wind blows
With a stroke of love, he dips his brush in a rainbow

Sometimes I take for granted the simple things
I can be his biggest critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain

When God paints, the heart beats
Life begins, a season ends and lovers meet
And I've learned that sometimes
It's not always black and white or well-defined
When God paints

Sometimes I take for granted the simple things
I can be his biggest critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain

When God paints, we dance
And I reach across the canvas and I take your hand
And my world is so complete
When I look at you, a masterpiece is all I see
When God paints

Sometimes I take for granted the simple things
I can be his big as critic when it starts to rain
But there's always a bigger picture I can't explain

When God paints
I pray I always see the beauty inside the frame

Alan Jackson,"Spread your wings, don't be afraid to try
The world can be hard, you gotta live a little 'fore you die
So open that door, step out in the bright sunshine
Follow your heart, and remember any time

You can always come home
Wherever life's road leads, you can get back
To a love that's strong and free
You never be alone, in your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home

So pack your bags, smile and say goodbye
And chase those dreams, and when you lay down and die
You know that there's someone praying for you every day
Even if you never find your way

You can always come home
Wherever life's road leads, you can get back
To a love that's strong and free
You never be alone, in your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home

When I was young, my daddy said to me
The very same words and I took those words with me
When I was afraid, I'd pull them out and think
Just how much they mean to me

You can always come home
Wherever life's road leads, you can get back
To a love that's strong and free
You never be alone, in your heart there's still a place
No matter how right or wrong you've gone
You can always come home",You Can Always Come Home,2015
Alan Jackson,"You can let a gal with freckles on her face
String your blonde hair and a 20 inch waist
Caught my eye like a little red car
She shook my hand and she grabbed my heart

Lord, you never know, no, you never know
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door

Brunette hair and big brown eyes
Perfect little bottom like a rollercoaster ride
Waiting on her table with her lazy anchor on
Big tip, later, lord she let me drive her home

You never know, no, you never know
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door
You never know, you never know

I was down in Atlanta on a Sunday afternoon
Backed into a Honda with a woman dressed in blue
First she wasn't happy but the chemistry began
Two Daiquiri's later, lord, we're walking hand in hand

You never know, no, you never know
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door

So the moral to the story is you better be aware
Love might hit you 'fore you ever know it's there
So keep your motor running and keep it in gear
Listen real close she might just whisper in your ear

Hey, you never know, no, you never know
You never know when love's gonna walk right through that door
No, you never know, ah, you never know

His heard had no place to go,
I looked and I thought to myself with a sigh:
There but for you go I.
I saw a man walking by the sea
Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.
Lonely men around me trying not to cry;
Till the day you found me, there among them was I.
I saw a man who had never known a love that was all his own.
I thought as I thanked all the stars in the sky:

Moving on a stream of dreams
My little memories, those precious memories
Remind me of our crazy schemes

Alan Lomax,"Back in Nineteen Twenty-Seven,
I had a little farm and I called that heaven.
Well, the prices up and the rain come down,
And I hauled my crops all into town --
I got the money, bought clothes and groceries,
Fed the kids, and raised a family.

Rain quit and the wind got high,
And the black ol' dust storm filled the sky.
And I swapped my farm for a Ford machine,
And I poured it full of this gas-I-line --
And I started, rockin' an' a-rollin',
Over the mountains, out towards the old Peach Bowl.

Way up yonder on a mountain road,
I had a hot motor and a heavy load,
I's a-goin' pretty fast, there wasn't even stoppin',
A-bouncin' up and down, like popcorn poppin' --
Had a breakdown, sort of a nervous bustdown of some kind,
There was a feller there, a mechanic feller,
Said it was en-gine trouble.

Way up yonder on a mountain curve,
It's way up yonder in the piney wood,
An' I give that rollin' Ford a shove,
An' I's a-gonna coast as far as I could --
Commence coastin', pickin' up speed,
Was a hairpin turn, I didn't make it.

Man alive, I'm a-tellin' you,
The fiddles and the guitars really flew.
That Ford took off like a flying squirrel
An' it flew halfway around the world --
Scattered wives and children's
All over the side of that mountain.

We got out to the West Coast broke,
So dad-gum hungry I thought I'd croak,
An' I bummed up a spud or two,
An' my wife fixed up a tater stew --
We poured the kids full of it,
Mighty thin stew, though,
You could read a magazine right through it.
Always have figured
That if it'd been just a little bit thinner,
Some of these here politicians
Coulda seen through it.

In a manner rather rude,
Vulgar words of anger,
An' his wife she overheard.

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain,
And the deputy grabbed his gun;
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down.

Then he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame;
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name.

But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes.

That come to beg a meal,
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill.

It was on a Christmas Day,
There was a whole car load of groceries

Well, you say that I'm an outlaw,
You say that I'm a thief.
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief.

I've seen lots of funny men;

And some with a fountain pen.

Alan Lomax,"(The Great Dust Storm)

On the 14th day of April of 1935,
There struck the worst of dust storms that ever filled the sky.
You could see that dust storm comin', the cloud looked deathlike black,
And through our mighty nation, it left a dreadful track.

From Oklahoma City to the Arizona line,
Dakota and Nebraska to the lazy Rio Grande,
It fell across our city like a curtain of black rolled down,
We thought it was our judgement, we thought it was our doom.

The radio reported, we listened with alarm,
The wild and windy actions of this great mysterious storm;
From Albuquerque and Clovis, and all New Mexico,
They said it was the blackest that ever they had saw.

From old Dodge City, Kansas, the dust had rung their knell,
And a few more comrades sleeping on top of old Boot Hill.
From Denver, Colorado, they said it blew so strong,
They thought that they could hold out, but they didn't know how long.

Our relatives were huddled into their oil boom shacks,
And the children they was cryin' as it whistled through the cracks.
And the family it was crowded into their little room,
They thought the world had ended, and they thought it was their doom.

The storm took place at sundown, it lasted through the night,
When we looked out next morning, we saw a terrible sight.
We saw outside our window where wheat fields they had grown
Was now a rippling ocean of dust the wind had blown.

It covered up our fences, it covered up our barns,
It covered up our tractors in this wild and dusty storm.
We loaded our jalopies and piled our families in,
We rattled down that highway to never come back again.

And I just found out today
I'm living right next door to an angel
And she only lives a house away
She used to be a skinny little girl
But all of a sudden she's out of this world
I'm living right next door to an angel
And I'm gonna make that angel mine

Since I saw her this morning
I'm on cloud number nine
There's a garden of Eden
At the house next door to mine
I took a look and oh what a shock
To find a little bit of heaven
Right here on the block
I'm living right next door to an angel
And I'm gonna make that angel mine

I can't believe that this is the girl next door
Her funny little face isn't funny no more
Sixteen and oh what a dream
Ain't it strange how she changed
Into such a lovely angel

Saw her walkin' down main street
And I couldn't believe my eyes
It used to be such a plain street
But now it's paradise

I feel so happy I'm feelin' so good
I'm the luckiest devil in the neighbourhood
I'm living right next door to an angel
And I'm gonna make that angel mine

Alan Menken,"Once upon a time, in a faraway land,
A young Prince lived in a shining castle
Although he had everything his heart desired,
The Prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind

But then, one winter's night,
An old beggar woman came to the castle
And offered him a single Rose
In return for shelter from the bitter cold
Repulsed by her haggard appearance,
The Prince sneered at the gift,
And turned the old woman away

But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances,
For Beauty is found within

And when he dismissed her again,
The old woman's ugliness melted away
To reveal a beautiful Enchantress

The Prince tried to apologize, but it was too late,
For she had seen that there was no love in his heart
And as punishment,
She transformed him into a hideous beast,
And placed a powerful spell on the castle,
And all who lived there

Ashamed of his monstrous form,
The beast concealed himself inside his castle,
With a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world

The Rose she had offered,
Was truly an enchanted rose,
Which would bloom for many years
If he could learn to love another,
And earn her love in return
By the time the last petal fell,
Then the spell would be broken
If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast
For all time

As the years passed,
He fell into despair, and lost all hope,
For who could ever learn to love, a Beast?",Prologue: Beauty and the Beast,1991

You can't step in the same river twice
The water's always changing, always flowing

We all must pay a price

I look once more just around the river bend
Beyond the shore where the gulls fly free
Don't know what for what I dream the day might send
Just around the river bend for me, coming for me

I feel it there beyond those trees
Or right behind these waterfalls
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming?

For a handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls
And never dreams that something might be coming?

Swirling in a trance
Her eyes upon the water
Alone in her last dance

As she cries into the dawn

 Nowhere to Run to even if we could
 Too late to save us but try to understand
 The seas were empty there was hunger in the land

 Nothing to live for
 Nothing to die for

 Nowhere to run to even if we could

Alan Parsons,"There's a voice on the phone
Who just called in to say
""Mr Jones isn't home
He'll be gone for the day""

So he pulls down the blind
To adjust his disguise
But it's all in his mind
Which he proudly denies

I turn the boat back from the weir
Where to go from here
I can't hide from each face I see
Looking out from behind them is me

I'm attempting to guess
What they meant when they said
""Mr Jones and his guest
won't be using the bed""

So if I take the rap
While they stay out of sight
I can spring from the trap
When the timing is right

One minute I think I know what I mean
The next I hear voices inside disagree
Why are they laughing at me?

So I pick up the phone
Someone's asking to me
Is the real Mister Jones
Mister one, two or three?

So I say that they're not
But it's not as I say
'Cos they're all taht I've got
And I can't get away

And Alice wawes through the glass
Are we home at last
For tomorrow they'll be there you see
Locked away safe inside there with me

'Cos tomorrow they'll be here you'll see
Locked away safe inside they're with me

One minute I think I know what I mean
The next I hear voices inside disagree
Why are they laughing at me?

Remains in my room

No words can soothe him;
No prayer remove him.

Alan Parsons,"I find this Paradise and rest beside a river 
No need to walk another mile 
It seems like everyone has everything that wishes could provide 
But no one seems to smile 

You won't believe me when I tell you this is fantasy 
Don't ask how long all this can last 
The same old sun will rise and make tomorrow just like yesterday 
And so your time will pass 

A shelter from the storm 
A room without a view 
A place where you belong 
And like a mother's kiss 
That carries you to sleep 
The ignorance is bliss 

One day the wind may change and blow at your defenses 
And shake the ground on which you stand 
One day the tide may turn and wash away your castles in the sand 
And silence rule the land 

A shelter from the storm 
A room without a view 
A place where you belong 
And like a mother's kiss 
That carries you to sleep 
The ignorance is bliss

One day the tide will turn and wash away your castles in the sand 
And you'll find peace, at last",Ignorance Is Bliss,1999

They're looking back at you
The sun will rise tomorrow
There's nothing you can do

You know you can't hold back the rain

And there's no future in the past
So take it slow Â¨c you're getting nowhere fast
You could be saving the situation now
You'd better run like the devil if you still know how

You know the tide is turning
It's got you on the run
Your last bridge is burning
No time for having fun
Time will wait for no one
To get their day's work done
We're in this boat together
You know one and one and one ain't one

I'm the man from out of the blue

Would you change your mind, would you change a thing 
Would you make it easy, would you make it hard 
Would you play the game under another name 
Or ask the dealer for one more card 

[Chorus]
Bang your drum, sing your song 
Don't give up, keep the faith, it won't be long 
You've been high, you've been low 
Press rewind and let it go 

Have you had your say, seen all you wanted to see 
Or did your dream give way to reality 
Don't think it's all too late for you to even try 
Before you clip your wings, see what this life brings 
You've waited too long it's time to fly 

[Chorus]

Do you believe in fate and what is meant to be 
Could you imagine life without a guarantee 
Would you appreciate that time was on your side 
A flash of second sight, a chance to do it right 
Is something money just can't buy 

[Chorus]",Press Rewind,1999
Alan Parsons,"When you look into a night sky
You see the stars far away
You're seeing them because of the light
Which travels from them to you

Now it takes time for light to travel here
So what you're doing is seeing the stars as they were in the past
The amount of time it has taken for the light to reach us
And the further and further away those stars are
The further back in time you are looking

Now you are seeing a star that is say six thousand years ago
Imagine somebody on that star looking at us
They would be seeing us as we were six thousand years ago
Which of those two is now?

So space and time are linked together
As we are looking across space, we are looking back in time

Gotta reach you some how and make you forgive

Alan Price,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more

Alan Price,"Ramona come closer 
Shut softly your watery eyes
The pangs of your sadness
Shall pass as your senses will rise
The flowers of the city
Though breathlike get deathlike at times
And there's no use in tryin'
T' deal with the dyin' 
Though I cannot explain that in lines

Your cracked country lips 
I still wish to kiss 
As to be under the strength of your skin
Your magnetic movements
Still capture the minutes I'm in
But it grieves my heart love 
To see you tryin' to be a part of
A world that just don't exist
It's all just a dream babe 
A vacuum a scheme babe 
That sucks you into feelin' like this

I can see that your head
Has been twisted and fed
By worthless foam from the mouth
I can tell you are torn
Between stayin' and returnin'
On back to the South
You've been fooled into thinking

That the finishin' end is at hand
Yet there's no one to beat you 
No one t' defeat you 
'Cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad

I've heard you say many times
That you're better 'n no one
And no one is better 'n you
If you really believe that 
You know you got
Nothing to win and nothing to lose
From fixtures and forces and friends 
Your sorrow does stem 
That hype you and type you 
Making you feel
That you must be exactly like them

I'd forever talk to you 
But soon my words 
They would turn into a meaningless ring
For deep in my heart
I know there is no help I can bring
Everything passes 
Everything changes 
Just do what you think you should do
And someday maybe 
Who knows baby 
I'll come and be cryin' to you",To Ramona,1980
Alan Price,"Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine

Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time",Good Times/Bad Woman,
Alan Price,"I can feel your body
When I'm lying in bed
There's too much confusion
Going around through my head

And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame still burns
Why can't I get over?
When will I ever learn?

[Chorus:]
Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home

I can see your face
But I know that it's not real
It's just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel

And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame will always burn
I'll never get over
I know now that I'll never learn

I see those big bright eyes
And then I realize
That girl is gonna get her way

When my little girl is smiling
I can't stay mad at her for long
Why should I want to fight
When I can  hold her tight

And waited till the heat died down,

And made the graduation
Into the banking business.

They left him Iyin' in a pool of blood,
And laughed about it all the way home.

There's alot of things I want, a lot of things that I'd like to be.

Girl, don't let me down!  Just Once In My Life,
let me hold on to one good thing I found!
Don't let me down! Baby, say that you'll be stayin',
 
Cause I couldn't face a day if you weren't here by my side.
If you went away then I'd be left without any pride.
I've given up on schemes, 'Cause all of them fell through,
I've given up so many things, Don't ask me to give up on you.

That old pot of gold ain't so easy to find,
But if you stand by me, I'll keep my peace of mind.

He's Goin' some place, there's no turnin' back
The Highway Patrol chopper comin' up over the ridge
Man sleeps by a campfire under the bridge
The shelter line stretchin' around the corner
Welcome to the New World Order
Families sleepin' in their cars out in the Southwest
No job, no home, no peace, no rest, NO REST!

And The highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Searchin' for the Ghost of Tom Joad

He pulls his prayer book out of a sleepin' bag
The preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
He's waitin' for the time when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
With a one way ticket to the promised land
With a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Lookin' for a pillow of solid rock
Bathin' in the cities' aqueducts

And The highway is alive tonight
Nobody's foolin' nobody is to where it goes
I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light
With the Ghost of old Tom Joad

Now Tom Said; ""Ma, whenever ya see a cop beatin' a guy
Wherever a hungry new born baby cries
Whereever there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me ma'
I'll be there
Wherever somebodies stuglin' for a place to stand
For a decent job or a helpin' hand
Wherever somebody is strugglin' to be free
Look in their eyes ma,
You'll see me! [repeat 8 times]

Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart

They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood
I've never known

Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Alan Spenner,"Dear landlord
Please don't put a price on my soul
My burden is heavy
My dreams are beyond control
When that steamboat whistle blows
I'm going to give you all I got to give
And I do hope you receive it well
Depending on the way you feel that you live

Dear landlord
Please heed these words that I speak
I know you've suffered much
But in this you are not so unique
All of us, at times we might work too hard
To have it too fast and too much
And anyone can fill his life up
With things he can see but he just cannot touch

Dear landlord
Please don't dismiss my case
I'm not about to argue
I'm not about to move to no other place
Now, each of us has his own special gift
And you know this was meant to be true
And if you don't underestimate me
I won't underestimate you",Dear Landlord,1976

On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

Alan Stepansky,"Did you ever hear the theory of the universe?
Where every time you make a choice,
A brand new planet gets created?

Did you ever hear that theory?
Does it carry any sense?
That a choice can split the world in two,
Or is it all just too immense for you?

That they all exist in parallel,
Each one separate from the other,
And every subsequent decision,
Makes a new world then another,
And they all stretch out towards infinity,
Getting further and further away.

Now, were a man to reconsider his position,
And try to spin the world back to its original state?

It's not a scientific proposition,
And relatively speaking… you're late.

It's not the same moon in the sky,
And these are different stars,
And these are different constellations,
From the ones that you've described.

Different rules of navigation,
Strange coordinates and lines,
A completely different zodiac,
Of unfamiliar signs.

It's not the same moon in the sky,
And those planets are misleading,
I wouldn't even try to take a bearing or a reading,
Just accept that things are different,
You've no choice but to comply,
When smarter men have failed to see,
The logic as to why.

(eightball we doin this shit once again
For you fake ass niggaz lay it the fuck down BEYITCH)

Intro/Chorus:

lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down
Lay it down, lay it down
You hoes lay it down

Verse One: Thorough

He's got his head tilted back on his face is a frown
Who's that nigga there it's Thorough bitch
So don't you clown, the sound and style, of Swisher after Swisher
Oh how I wish ya would step so I could hit ya
With wicked shit slick and swift
As I slaughter quick, oughta flip with fluents
To show you how we be doin in the Suave House federation; that is cat
You don't know how it's comin cause you don't where it's at
A mack of all trades, low cut, tight fade
We all get paid, so gets sprayed, so buster behave
My flavor's deep, please peep, I ain't soft
I represent at all cost and always got my niner out
So eeease back cause you marks can't hang with me
I got to much game in me, killin ain't no thang to me
Give a nut check, and I see you outta place
And I say that to say you're a BITCH, and you ain't got what it takes
To stop the funk mutha from freelance jackin
Brushes up on yo skills, cause fool I ain't lackin
With my hands on my dick, my click is thick so don't clown
Bitches we ain't playin you hoes lay it down

Chorus: repeat 2X

Verse Two: Eightball

It's Sunday morning, I'm stil yawnin from the night before
So much sess in my chest from the Swishers I smoke
OH NO!!!! Who is this hoe in the bed with me?
I remember the pussy but I don't remember her name G
Grab me Swisher cut it up and fill it with weed, hit that hoe
In the head, and tell her get out of my bed you damn freak
Hopped into the shower for an hour, it was hot as hell
Got dressed and ran a gold comb through my curls
Walkin out of the house slow, tellin that hoe come on let's go
First I crack up the music then, hit the switch on my six-four
Candy coated paint, got the bitches at the bus stop sick
But at the same time on my dick, thick
Beat a bitch quick I'm sick, full of Swishers and malt liquor
I'm a killa on them sticks, aggivated hallucinatin
Tryin to let go of my frustration
But some my luck, nigga gonna be a med patient
I gotta nine uzi AK, but that shit don't really matter
Cause if I gotta I will rat-a-tat-a
To splatter the guts of nigga with no nuts
And if you step to Suave you will have to lay it down

Chorus: repeat 2X

Verse Three: Crime Boss

Here comes the spy, that fry, get high, and get head rushed
The number one gangsta you can't touch or bust
So steppin is the wrong that you gots to come against me
You best to do a driveby and be prayin that you hit me
Cause nigga if you miss me I'ma have to draw my gat
And take yo ass way back, cause way back way back in the days
I used to beat dope fiends down just get paid
Live my life as a hustler, sellin drugs was my only J
My moms was a trick hoe I had nowhere to stay
And nigga that's fucked all my homies are loners
I've been on this for ten years so I'm known on corners
With bitches and prostitutes, pimps and killa thugs
Five-oh harrassin me, so Crime Boss is feelin slugs
A good guy gone bad, devious fuckin kid
Victim of ?, shit that my momma did
These dope beats comin up, I'm servin those clucker bitches
My beeper still goin off, I'm thinkin of addin riches
For dollars and sense, see I gotta have it goin on,
Or be trapped in this hole for too motherfuckin long
IT'S ON!!!!

Verse Four: MJG

Thirty buster in yard talkin shit bout a bitch
Claimin to be that bitch's family but they look like dirty tricks
Talkin about why did I meet that hoe, fuck the hoe
Charge the hoe, break the hoe, bust her inside her shit and go
Suckers how the fuck you think that MJG was gonna slip
On the only reason you mad cause you sister couldn't pussy whip
A back breakin, check takin, pimp nigga constantly makin
Money off you and your lady, nigga I ain't tradin
Why don't you niggaz understand I'm the pimp she's the hoe
Now that Itold you now you know, break that chain and let her go
Back on the track shake that ass, make my money
Make it fast, get yo head swoll bringin me checks bitch bring me cash
Drop yo panties, to let you start
To open your mouth, slurp and slob
On this dick you, he's the trick you's a bitch, do ya job
When you through, get up and go, get the cheese, hit the door
Catch a cab, back to the lab, bring my motherfuckin money hoe
Don't you ever front me with a lame lie about my bank
Oh shit, look out bitch, dump a bitch catch a plane

Alan Vega,"She smelled like two am
Took him back to her place
Where all the saints adorned the walls.
To never ending from grace
He knew he should leave
And this could only turn cold
She was a bad bad girl
So he told her so

Under the shadows engulfed
He had the whisper of lust
He said 'no touching tonight'
She closed her eyes in his trust
She said 'tuck me in'
He knew his judgment was sound
Still he pulled back the sheets
And said 

[Chorus]
You better lie down 'cause the angels are watching
She closed her eyes and said with the talking
You can hurt me do whatever you like'

Her every word was in italics
As it would fall from her lips
The walls were made of broken promises
He hoped this wouldn't be his.
She said 'tell me what to do'
He knew right then he was done
Felling lonely and confused
He said 

[Chorus]
You better lie down the angels are watching'
She closed her eyes and said with the talking
You can hurt me do whatever you like'
So he said 'shut your mouth girl the angels are listening'
She crossed herself now the moments are missing
You can hurt me do whatever you like'

Glancing through the curtain
Questions unheard of
She spoke in third person
And he had seen everyone
Awkward and embittered
Said 'shut the door when you go' 
Perhaps he should've reconsidered (oh no)
When he said 

[Chorus] 
You better lie down the angels are watching
She closed her eyes and said with the talking
You can hurt me do whatever you like'
So he said 'shut your mouth girl the angels are listening'
She crossed herself now the moments are missing

Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river

Just look over your shoulder
You won't recognise yourself
You won't have to ask
Is everyone here looking much older
Are communications feeling much colder

Sudden like the wind transversed
The gulf of friendships passed
Stillness mounts in this high place
Silence stays the same
I am I will I can are aims
But can we tell which are the games
Everytime we pass the blame

The sting is of elusive hands
That reared him from his tooth

Ah!
But you may feel a little sick.

Can you stand up?
I do believe its working. good.
That'll keep you going for the show.
Come on its time to go.

Thought ya
Might like to
Go to the show.
To feel that warm thrill of confusion,
That space cadet glow.
I've got some bad news for you sunshine,
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you folks really stand.

Are there any queers in the theater tonight?
Get them up against the wall!
There's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me,
Get him up against the wall!

Alana,"It was the first day of July
No wind breathed in the sky
When a pin-striped suit
Saw that the Institute of Mental Health was burning.
He stood upon the corner
Where the sun was warmer
Looking across the street
He moved the shackles on his feet
As the Institute was burning
Flames were roaring, singing like a thunderstorm
Smoke was pouring straight up to the sky
Windows smashing, Gothic doors and lintels fall
Timbers crashing and we both know why

Nobody else came by to stare
You see, they didn't really care
Can't call the fire brigade 
None of them had been paid
And so the Institute was burning
Throughout the city, people say it isn't pretty
Everyone agrees, and everyone feels glad
Doctored brains celebrate and everyone waves their chains
It's a pity they're all mad
The Institute of Mental Health
Spontaneously killed itself
Ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
My chains began to rust
As the Institute was burning, burning, burning",Burning,1993

Without notes in tune with the time that surrounds.
I think that's something that you said,
Back a while, when you first started coming around.
You and I are from different worlds,
But that just gave us more to share.
You'd ask me where I wanted to be,
And I was happy with you just being there.
Now I feel we've got some serious talking ahead,
And I don't want you to get me wrong.
It's just we've become kind of a habit to each other,
And this can't keep going on.
Blame it on me.
Over the past few months, through no fault of your own,
I've grown disenchanted and I've got to go it alone.
Seems the natural thing to do,
'Cause you can't cling to me
If I'm not gonna stick with you.
Now take a look at what it's all coming down to.
You act like I'm leaving you on the shelf.
I don't know how else to say it;
Life's a game and we all got to play it.
So I've got to look out for myself.
Blame it on me.
All these changes coming on,
And I'm feeling it so strong.
You know they've got to be real.
It's hard to explain it, baby.
I don't know if I can make it, baby,
If I can't tell you how I feel.

But I can't sacrifice my pride any longer.
I thought it would subside,
Something I could hide,
But it's only getting stronger.
Blame it on me.",Blame It on Me,1997
Alana Davis,"You've got your home of the brave 
And I've got my land of the free.
You conform to what society says
And I conform to me.
Looking for light in the corners, 
Getting caught in the spider web.
You look at me as though I'm giving a performance
When I'm just feeding my head.

And you know that I'm doing alright
And I won't explain myself to you just to avoid a fight
How I'm living ain't correct, 
But for me, its just right

I'm not completely insane.
I'm maybe just a little bit crazy.
There's no one to blame, 
Got no shame 'bout my game,
Don't want nobody to save me.

I've got a pair of ruby slippers that 
I don't wear much anymore
And if I had the nerve, 
I'd click my heels and return
To the wonderland I knew before.
I'm waiting on a slow boat to China, 
Gonna sail away to the sun.
I've been searching for myself, 
And I know I'm gonna find her
If I break away from everyone.

So, the way that I act may not fit in.
Just because I have a mind of my own,
Doesn't mean its a sin.
I don't ask you to give up; 
Don't expect me to give in.

Some like to live for the moment, 
Taking life into their hands every day.
And if they don't get killed, 
They get so high off the thrill,
They could float to heaven anyway.
And others want to save for tomorrow,
Thinking money is security.
Well, I understand the need, 
But I don't get the greed.
Y'know, they all seem pretty crazy to me.

You can tell by the expression I wear.
Though I seem a little strange to you
I don't really care.  I've got the freedom to be;
There are others like me everywhere...

Alana Davis,"I remember the long warm December we shared.
I can still taste the air.
You were open and I was hoping you cared,
Hoping that you would be there for me.
That's the way it was meant to be,
But I guess your heart was free;
Free to take the best part of me,
And leave a hole where my heart should be;
Where it used to be.
Days are lonely, and nights are only a veil,
And the air is so stale.
I'm still open but I guess you were hoping we'd fail,
So you could sail away from me,
And return to your open sea;
Where I guess you need to be,
Where you can wander endlessly.
Still you know that your heart was free,
And you took the best part of me,
And left a hole where my heart should be;
Where you know it should be.
You're for me.
I'd have sworn it was destiny,
But I know you were always free;
Free to be the best part of me.
I'd have loved you endlessly,
With my heart and soul eternally.
A love the way love should be, ain't that the way a love should be?
You are free;
Free to give back the heart of me,
And replace all this misery.

And left a hole where my heart should be;
Where my heart should be.",Free,1997
Alana Davis,"I'm having a notion.
It's a strange, the strangest emotion.
I'm all wrapped up with my head in the clouds.
The sweet child thinks he doesn't deserve me, but I'm not that proud.
I'd walk for miles to see that handsome face;
To be with you baby I'd go anyplace.
So you say that you ain't got money, well I don't care.
'Cause I'm so in love with you, honey.
What I got, I'll share.
Take me by the hand, help me move my mountains aside.
Help me understand that love is stronger than...
It'll serve you longer than pride.
Now father, lend me your strength.
I know you think I'm weak, but I'm not ashamed.
'Cause I'm in love, and I'll tell you it's real.
I may be young but I know what I feel.

It'll serve you longer than pride.

And I'll stand by him 'cause he's all that I need.

I wonder what you'll show me
I think of you

is broken in two
Everything that I am
revolves around you
And you just don't understand
What a girl goes through

Though we give it different names
You can search the world for that one thing
But it's all the same

Come and let me bring your
body down
Listen to my voice
the only sound
As I lullaby you,
lullaby you down

As the moon rides away from the sun
She takes all his light and reflects it
I relate them to us just for fun
There's a parallel that's unexpected
Every star in the sky,
reminds me of you
Twinkling in my eyes,
The way that you do
And I don't know why
I get so blue

Everyday is filled with changes
No matter where you go
Living in a world of strangers
So we go for what we know

Lay your body down
Come and let me bring your
body down
Listen to my voice
the only sound
As I lullaby you,
lullaby you down

Everyone believes in something
But it's all the same
Attitude will keep me going
So I guess I can't complain

Alana Davis,"There's a bleeder in my kitchen,
And he's pouring on my floor.
There's a killer in my hallway,
And he's scratching at my door.
I think I might have heard some screaming;
I might have heard somebody cry.
Now I wonder am I dreaming,
Or is my mind telling me a lie?
Well I can't run any further,
And I can't hide anymore.
And I think there's been a murder,
Up on the ground floor.
There's a boa in my bathroom,
And he's coiling in my sink;
He wants my cats I think.
Paranoia in my house now, and I'm balanced on the brink.
Well I can't run any further,
And I can't hide anymore.
And I think there's been a murder,
Up on the ground floor.
I'm living in a basement flat, in a quiet part of town.
I bet you wonder where my head is at, when I'm imagining all these sounds.
I'd check it out but I'm glued to my chair;
I can't make it to the door.
I could be bugging, but I'd gladly swear:
I just heard a body hit the floor,
And I can't run any further.

Alana Davis,"Looking to the sky, wishing for a sun.
Lowering the high, before the trip's begun.
Passing time, acting blind, taking the easy way out.
Every day you spend wasting away.
You don't care what life's about,
But you will one day.
You will one day, you'll be hurting some day, you will one day.
Said you'd be the one,
Said you'd always be there.
But you're caring for none,
And your promises they drift into the air.
Every night you want to start a fight;
Trouble's what you're made of.
You can't be tied, you can't look inside.
Don't want anyone to love.
But you will one day,
You will one day, you'll be hurting some day, you will one day.
Passing time and acting blind,
Taking the easy way out.
Everyday you're wasting away and don't care what life's about,
But you will one day.
You will one day...",One Day,1997
Alana Davis,"The laws of reason tend to leave me cold
Ignore every season every season still I grow old and cold
I've contained my future by holding on to the past
And I blame my teachers for letting me too fast
And I wonder now can I survive between wired awake and half alive
When I can't succeed I can only try to validate each day
And I'm losing though I'm using my best
And I'm choosing to destroy all the rest of yesterday
They'll suck you in with I believe in yous
And let you think it's your gifts that make them choose you
Now I discover the catch about being real
It can make liars out of lovers who can't handle what you feel
And I work so hard just to keep it clean
I do unto others you know what I mean
I got a backstage pass to my next dream that says I'm not alone
And I'm losing though I'm using my best
And I'm choosing to destroy all the rest of yesterday, 
All the rest of my yesterday",Rest of Yesterday,1997
Alana Davis,"Another Sunday, another one way road away from home 
I keep thinking one day I'm going to wake up far from what I've known 
There's a man, he's going to cheat me if he can 
He's looking for someone to scam 

Here I am with my guts out in my hand, looking for some place to stand 
It's hard to hold on to what you're found when what comes around always goes around 
Here we go round and around on the outside 
Do we know how to hold on with our hands tied? 

Another Sunday ,ain't no change in how we're living now 
I keep hoping one day maybe Monday will be, will be different somehow 
In the end there are lovers, there are friends, there are liars who pretend 
They'll cheat you if they can- seems to be their master plan 

To leave you with an empty hand 
And it's hard to hold on to what you're found when what comes around always goes around 
Here we go round and around on the outside 
Do we know how to hold on with our hands tied? 

Here we go turning around one the inside 
Do we know how to hold ..can we survive? 
Work for so long and we try to be strong 
Time just keeps moving us along 

It's hard to be right when everything's wrong 
But we've got to keep on...",Round & Around,1997
Alana Davis,"Little boy wishes he wasn't small.
He'd give is turtle, to be six feet tall.
He's got photos of Shaq and Ewing, up on his wall.
And he'd try a jump shot but he's afraid he'll fall down.
Little girl wants to fall in love.
Dressed up like her mother, in white evening gloves.
She pretends, tells her friends she's got somewhere to go.
They don't ask her where, so they'll never know how she feels.
With a shorter past, there's a greater hurry.
Let the moment last, there's no need to worry.
We should be living for today, or tomorrow anyway,
And don't ask for the world on a plate,
'Cause you just might get it.
Don't ever say it's too late, you know you'll regret it, because
Just when you're sure, your life can change right before your eyes.
A mother's thinking of her little boy,
Left home at sixteen back in eighty-four.
He's got a dog named Lucy, says she's all he needs.
Lucy knows better, she hears all his dreams.
When you search yourself, when you get down to it.
If you know yourself, you know you'll get through it.
So start living for today, or tomorrow anyway,
And don't ask for the world on a plate,
'Cause you just might get it.
Don't ever say it's too late, you know you'll regret it, because
Just when you're sure, your life can change right before your eyes.

Alana Davis,"Each day, I say that today won?t be like yesterday
But it stays this way
Today and everyday
I pray
That today will feel a different way
But it stays this way

The weight of the world has fallen
And the rubble is at my feet
The voice of a girl is calling
I can hear her
But she?s buried so deep
All of my truths are broken
They?re fragments of love and hate
The words that remain are a token
Of honesty that came too late

Here
In the midst of madness
Washed up by the tides of war
Try to resist this sadness
But the pressure is hard to endure

Yet we begin again
Still playing our games
And everyone?s innocent
Just victims of change

Wearing a mask of freedom
And hiding behind a smile
Playing the role of a leader
Pretending for just a while
Everything seems an illusion
Echoing around my brain
Trapped in a vast seclusion
Where the images fall like rain

And we begin again
Still playing our games
And everyone?s innocent
Just victims of change
Living in sin again
With no one to blame
And everyone?s innocent
Just victims of change

Each day, I say that today won?t be like yesterday
But it stays this way
Today and everyday

That today will feel a different way

Somebody must change

Looking for a reason to go home again 
But you make me feel like I don't belong 
Like my heart's too weak and my head's too strong 
Opposites attract sometimes but not the way 
you're attracting mine 
And I can't change the way you are 
Even though you think you're some kind of rock star 

I want you out of my life 
'cause your heart is as cold as ice 
It's time that you hit the door 
I don't want to see you no more 

You want me to walk like this and talk like that 
Dye my hair and don't wear hats 
And dress too sleazy and go too far 
But all I want to do is play my guitar 
And I don't think that it's fair 
And I don't think that you care about me 
Yeah but I see the way it's got to be 
I want you out of my life 

Why am I in this alone 
Is my love too much for you 
What's wrong with home

But we still have places left to go 
But my life, heart and soul 
Is yours for the sharing, let me know

You still keep your heart set on your dreams 
You're so strong you should rest assured 
Anything in this world you want is yours 

I don't have a chance with you 
But I'm gonna let you find that all your love is better in my mind 
You don't have the heart to let me go 
I'm gonna let you fly and all the rest 
I'll find on my own

Takes everything you've got and lets you bleed

As I stand here in your shadow
Waiting for you to move so I can see out the window
I want to watch the children play

And I'll never understand

Yeah
You are almost heaven
Angel from above
Tonight I've got a lot of love
You are almost heavenly

Alana Davis,"I don't think I ever wanted to take your time 

I don't think it ever crossed my mind 
That you would be more to me than just a lover 
'Cause I was doing fine on my own 
Wasn't really lonely, just alone 
But at least I knew where I was and what 
I wanted, but now 
I don't know how you got me, babe 

So open wide 
And I don't know how to tell you, babe 
The way it feels inside 
I know I have a feeling that you 
You could hold me longer 
We get stronger every day 
And I don't know what you've done to me 

I'm so turned around I can barely see 
The way that I'm supposed to be 
I'm so wrapped up in what I think you think of me 
I don't know how you got this far 

How am I supposed to live a life?
Burdened by the thought of you, my love
How will I ever be all right?
La la la
Every time I look into your eyes

I can feel the pressure start to rise 
Pulling me into you and what you'll show me 
Well, I believe that love can conquer all 
But is it really love that makes you fall 
Or just the fantasy of understanding?
I don't know how you're gonna save the rest of my heart 

I don't know how I'd stop you, baby, or how I'd even start 
I know I have a feeling that you 
Are something to discover 
The lover that you are 
And I don't know how you got through 

I'm not the kind of girl you're supposed to get to 
I've been hurt before; I don't want it anymore 
I'm safer in my solitude 
I don't know how you got this far 

How am I supposed to live a life
Burdened by the thought of you, my love?
How will I ever be all right?

Alana Davis,"Friends is a word we use every day
But most of the time we use it in the wrong way
Some people say that they got your back
But you can tell a true friend by the way they act

And if you ask me now I can't be much help
'Cause a friend's somebody you judge for yourself
Doesn't matter what I think, I see
Because a friend to you might not be a friend to me

Some are mellow and they act cool
Others treat you like you're a fool
Some are always on your side
And others just want to take you for a ride

And this list goes on again and again
But these are the people that we call friends

Friends, how many of us have them?
Friends, ones we can depend on
Friends, how many of us have them?
Friends, before we go any further let's be friends

When we first hooked up, we barely knew each other
I never thought you would be my lover
Talking on the phone for hours at a time
Or I was at your house or you were at mine

And then came all the fights and all the problems
Turned out that was all we had in common
And even though we started out strong
I guess, we went about the whole thing wrong

And I should've known it would come to an end
'Cause we became lovers before we were friends

The list goes on and on, again and again and again and again
True friends show you more than you can see
But some people leave you on your knees
With friends like that you don't need enemies
