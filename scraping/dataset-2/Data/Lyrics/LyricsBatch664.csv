Mark Shane,"I don't care what the weatherman says
When the weatherman says it's raining
You'll never hear me complaining
I'm certain the sun will shine

I don't care how the weather vane points
When the weather vane points to gloomy
It's gotta be sunny to me
When your eyes look into mine

Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those peepers?
Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those eyes?
Gosh all, git up, how'd they get so lit up?
Gosh all, git up, how'd they get that size?

Golly gee, when you turn those heaters on
Woe is me, got to put my cheaters on

Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those peepers?
Oh, those weepers, how they hypnotize!
Where'd ya get those eyes?",Jeepers Creepers,2002
Mark Shane,"I'm up in the world,
but I'd give the world to be where I used to be,
A heavenly nest,
where I rest the best,
means more than the world to me.

It's only a shanty
in old Shanty Town
the roof is so slanty it touches the ground.
But my tumbled down shack by an old railroad track,
like a millionaire's mansion is calling me back.

I'd give up a palace if I were a king.
It's more than a palace, it's my everything.
There's a queen waiting there with a silvery crown
in a shanty in old Shanty Town.",A Shanty in Old Shanty Town,2002
Mark Shane,"Now I'm flyin' high, but I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
Fallin' for nobody else but you
Mama, you caught my eye and I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
Show me the ring and I'll jump right through

I used to travel single-o; we chanced to mingle-o
Now I'm a-tingle over you
Hey, Mister Parson, stand by, but I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'
Fallin' for nobody else but you",I've Got a Feeling I'm Falling [#],2004
Mark Shane,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,2004
Mark Shane,"Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do to you
You in love
Your heart's fluttering all day long
You only stutter cause you for sure
Just throw that out of the way
I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
What a little moonlight can do
Wait a while
Till a little moonbeam comes peepin' through
He'll get bored
You can't resist him
All you'll say
When you have kissed him is
Ooh, ooh, ooh

What a little moonlight can do
Ooh, ooh, ooh",What a Little Moonlight Can Do,2004
Mark Shane,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years, 
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
But baby, think what you're doin'
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so
It's gonna drive you to ruin
After you've gone, after you've gone away.",After You've Gone,2005
Mark Shane,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know,2005
Mark Shane,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,2005
Mark Shane,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands,2005
Mark Shane's Xmas All-Stars,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Mark Shaw,"I was taken by surprise
I was shattered by your eyes

Living far beyond my means
Do you know how that feels?
I was waiting for so long
I was praying to belong

Only holding out to see and believing there's only one
Strong enough and hard enough to give you away.

In this big area of mine
Sometimes you break me up inside

Saying I
I want to let you go
Got that feeling
If anyone who comes to know you long enough will give you away.

There was never one as I who could stand the reasons why

Who would even take the time
Did you care
Was I right?
Only once did you try
Even then it was hard enough
Just for you to realize or believe there was only one
Strong enough and hard enough to give you away.

In this big area of mine
Sometimes you break me up inside

In this big area of mine. sometimes you break me up inside

Sometimes you break me up inside
In this big area of life

Saying I
I want to let you go
Go that feeling
If anyone who comes to know you long enough will give you away.

I was taken by surprise
I was shattered by your eyes

Breaking down something so right and so fine.",Big Area,2001
Mark Sherman,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day
The day they take the Old Folks away",Old Folks,2004
Mark Sherman,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,2005
Mark Shilansky,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,1997
Mark Shilansky,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?

Mark Shilansky,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty,2007

Could have bought this land for damn near a dime
(Right over there past that gas station over there, see it)
So I headed on over, leaned against his truck
And ya better hear me out or you're shit outta luck
I've been through times that you wouldn't believe
It makes a man feel about a hundred and three
Again he asked, what do ya do
I can't imagine by lookin' at you
Boy, things have changed since way back when
I wish that I was back in my teens again
I said hey, I said hey, to what the old man said
So we hopped in his truck, went for a ride
He talked about things before I was alive
Ya know, that used to be a big mining town
My brother and I brought that mountain down
My oh my, look how they built over there
Have ya ever thought about cutting that hair
Ya never told me what do ya do
Tell me kid, are ya just passing through
You say hey, you say hey, from what the old man said
So I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
Yeah, I tried to speak my piece
So, low and behold when all was told the only listening one was me
So I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
Yeah, I tried to break on through
So, low and behold when all was told the stubburn one was he
So the moral of the story is ya gotta learn a lesson
Especially from a man who got a Smith and Wesson
Ya better learn with your ears and not with your eyes
Or you'll be dealt a big surprise
I said hey, I said hey
To what the old man said

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

It's four in the morning, so closing my eyes
I rolled over on my other side
Ten o'clock came fast
Heard a noise down the hall
Sounds just like broken glass
And for no reason at all
A picture had fallen from the wall
Oh, it's just another day

Guess I'll spend it in the garden
Why, I can make this day mine
And later at the market
Where I know I can find
A place to spend more than just time

They're grabbing only what they need
Their faces poured with worry
Please sir, go ahead of me
I really have no place I need to be
No, it's just another day

Three o'clock came slow
I heard a knock at the door
So I opened it real slow
He said say no more
I must not be who you're hoping for
Why, could it be you're expecting company
Ma'am if I may
Have you sign right here please
And as he walked away
He said, Oh have a lovely day
Yes have a lovely day

Six o'clock rolled around
I hear the traffic building up
It's all around the town
Driving like there is no giving up
Arriving home to the ones they love
Table set, please sit down everyone
Won't come to bed until the dishes are done
And turning out lights all but one
I like to read some
Won't fall to sleep until my day is done

I can make it all on my own

And I'll be married in the spring

With a baby on the way 
I know I heard one say, guess she never learned a thing

Some thing's better if never known

It will make up the tears that she cries

I forgot how to be your wife
Everybody's settlin' for settlin' down
Hear the jingle of the chains rattling around

I never really gave much thought
I'm sure it's my own fault
I just figured after years gone by
All them tears would have run dry

I go out night after night
And I wonder if I'm treating myself right
And I think about the ones I left behind
When I cry night after night

Here's to the ones who worked all along
Living in fear of being alone
Well I started out early in life
I made mine and I knew I

Could never really go back home
That's the same as being alone
Sure, I could always turn it around
That'd be the same as shooting me down

Mark T. Jordon,"This old house is falling down around my ears
I'm drowning in a river of my tears
When all my will is gone you hold me sway
And I need you at the dimming of the day

You pulled me like the moon pulls on the tide
You know just where I keep my better side

What days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise or a broken heart
Now all the bonny birds have wheeled away
And I need you at the dimming of the day

Come the night you're only what I want
Come the night you could be my confidant

I see you on the street and in company
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me

Inside my hope is fading
I'm just a clown since you put me down

His weight outweighs the world

To raise His hands in victory for all of you and me

The Father then will lead us through the holy land of splendor

Mark Tremonti,"I woke today
To the strangest thing
I have to say
Reminded me of just the the other day
Not today
You herd me say the same thing
Again I say
No excuses for the other day
Sorry always seems so hard to say
I twist the words
But still they mean
The same ole thing but

I don't know how to face today
No matter how much you think you gave to me
I don't know how to face the day
Will you ever forgive me for all that I've put you through

I came to see
Whats the reason for you hating me
I try and find another way to make you see
I'm not the same
You hear me say
It's killing me

Inside it kills me

Mark Trichka,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin The Beguine,
Mark Turner,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1997
Mark Turner,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,2000

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Mark Wagner,"""We'd like to sing a children's song for you now, that's unique. 
It's the only children's song that we've ever encountered 
That contains all three of the basic elements of every single children's song. 
The first element is simplicity, so that the child can understand the song. 
The second element is pathos, to prepare the child for later traumatic experiences. 
And the third element is repetition, to give the child a false sense of security"".

Mark Warnow,"Verse 
This day and age we're living in 
Gives cause for apprehension, 
With speed and new invention 
And things like fourth dimension. 
Yet we get a trifle weary 
With mr. einstein's theory, 
So we must get down to earth at times: 
Relax, relieve the tension. 
And no matter what the progress 
Or what may yet be proved, 
The simple facts of life are such 
They cannot be removed. 
Refrain 
You must remember this, 
A kiss is still a kiss, 
A sigh is just a sigh; 
The fundamental things apply, 
As time goes by. 

And when two lovers woo, 
They still say, ""I love you,"" 
On that you can rely; 
No matter what the future brings, 
As time goes by. 

Moonlight and love songs never out of date, 
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate; 
Woman needs man and man must have his mate,

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1998

And two finger bowls of glass
The couch is gold with a floral design
And the wine is Germany's best

Frankfurt is covered with snow
And numbly they ride on an icy wind
To places they're longing to go

I remember the tall dark Irish rose
Who held me in my limousine
And slept with me under a burgundy quilt
With sheets of silk in between
Well, anyway, that's how it seemed

I thought I wanted to marry him
His face was sculpted by God
His words were gentle and ever so true
And soft as the Irish fog
And lost in the Irish fog

I remember the boy from the monastery
Who wanted to be a monk
But he brought flowers and wine to my room
And we both got happily drunk
And we both got perfectly drunk

He laughed like the chimes of a silver bell
His eyes were alexandrite blue
He danced the t'ai chi with the grace of a deer
And I wanted to marry him too
Yes I wanted to marry him too

There was that son of a dog from the Tennessee hills
Kept telling me I was still young
He spoke in pure southern and smoothed out the lines
Round my eyes saying I was the one
Forever that I'd be the one

He drank and he cussed and he wrote his own songs
He was very much on the go
We followed each other for over a year
I couldn't have married him though
So we just lived in sin on the road

There was that black eyed beauty from Boston town
Two days were never too long
He stood by the mirror and picked out a rose
But I already wrote him a song
Yes, I already wrote him a song

So here I sit with my basket of fruit
And two finger bowls of glass
I finished my bottle of Germany's best
And concluded my thoughts on the past
That love is a pain in the ass",Love Song to a Stranger,2005

From desert plains I bring you love

Wild mountain thunder
Echoes my quest
My body aches but I'll not rest
Quartz light to guide me
Till sunrise leads
My passion screams, my heart it bleeds

From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love

Then in the distance
I see you stand
On the horizon you raise your hand
In burning rubber
I end my quest
You fall into my arms at last

Mark Whitfield,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1997

Raised at the fork in the road in a clapboard house
And Rachael was a land baron's daughter
Born with a silver spoon in her mouth
Her daddy said he wouldn't stand
For Rachael to waste her life with a common man
He tried hard to keep them apart
But you can't draw lines in a young girl's heart

So late one night by the harvest moon
Jacob climbed a ladder up to Rachael's room
He knew his place, it was right beside her
Step by step up to her world
Head over heels for a brown-eyed girl
And gettin' caught didn't seem to matter
'Cause heaven was waitin' at the top of Jacob's ladder

It'll be five years September
Since her daddy found a ladder and a note on her windowsill
He swore he'd never forgive them
But nothin' melts a heart like a grandchild will
Now she climbs up on his knee
Says, ""Grandpa, tell a story, the one about me""
He thinks back and his eyes shine
Says, ""Listen Child, once upon a time""

Five days a week in the same bus seat
For a girl she was pretty cool
She wore an old ball cap, hated lace
Played a mean shortstop and second base
Never missed a day of Sunday school
And I never told a soul back then
But Emily Harper was my best friend

We carved our names on an old oak limb
On the bank of the creek where we used to swim
A farmer's son and a preacher's only daughter
We ran barefoot through the garden gate
All afternoon we'd laugh and play
'Til the sun went down on me
And Emily Harper

About the time I turned sixteen
I noticed Emily's eyes were green
And how they shined when I made her laugh
I liked it when her hair was down
I hated other guys around
I played it cool but I had it bad
Lord, her Daddy had a fit
When he caught me stealing my first kiss

We carved a heart on that old oak limb
On the bank of the creek where we used to swim

We used to sneak off in my daddy's car
Sit on the hood and count the stars
'Til the sun came up on me

Is in your eyes, shining at me

Your hand brushes mine
And a thousand sensations seduce me 'cause I

I do, cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will, love you still, from the depths of my soul

It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much, I do

In my world before you
I lived outside my emotions
Didn't know where I was going
Until that day I found you
How you opened my life to a new paradise

In a world torn by change
Still with all of my heart, until my dying day

I do, cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will, love you still, from the depths of my soul

Told everyone I'm doing fine
Learned to get on with my life
I just want what's best for her
So I lied
Found a note on my door last night
Said, I'll be your friend until I die
But you should know I found someone

With a picture of the ocean and the beach
And the simple words he wrote her
Said he loved her and they told her
How he'd hold her if his arms would reach

Mark Wills,"They didn't own a house, no crib no toys were waiting
Still they had their love for the child they were anticipating
He was born one winter night on a road between two towns
They wrapped him up so warm and tight and said
It looks like heaven's come down

There was a new star shining in the sky up above
By its light that winter night
They found peace and perfect love
If we want to find it, I know we always will
For that new star is shining for us still

He worried how to feed him on the trade that was all he knew
It was hard enough to make ends meet when they were only two
But the cold, the dark and hunger couldn't take away their joy
And she knew that they would find a way
For their precious baby boy

Back on Earth
There's a woman who's wishing
An ordinary man was sitting in the kitchen
Drinking her coffee after loving her all night long
Back on Earth
There's a brown-eyed baby
Who's old enough now to tell me all the ways
She's needing her daddy

Now I'm out in space here wondering if it's worth
Everything I'm missing

Shared my heart and the good Lord smiled
And I thanked them all for being kind to me

With a hotel room where we touch down
Where I'll face the situation's gravity

Could there be another way, God, I love to sing and play

And I told him I'd watch his boy for the day
And we had a ball playin' games, eatin' dogs
Riding rides at the county fair
I thought he was just being a kid
When we got back to my place
And he did what he did
On a balloon that he won
He wrote mama I had fun
I missed you and I wished you were there
I wasn't sure what he had in mind
'Till he jumped up and ran outside and

He let it go, he waved goodbye, or was it hello?
I don't know but I died inside
I can still see his excitement
Him pointing and smilin'
When it was gone as it could get
He turned and asked me
You think it's in Heaven yet?

Well I struggled for something to say
I was too choked up and
Lackin' the kind of faith he had in his heart
Before I could start
He walked me back inside
He gave me his Crayola pen
Said, I bet there's a message that you'd like to send
And no doubt he was right it's been locked
Up inside since Grandpa said goodbye
I took that yellow balloon and I wrote
'Til I ran out of room then

I let it go and we waved goodbye

Her wide eyed boy, six years old reachin' for her hand to hold

It's a love strong enough to forgive the rest
If only I could always be what she sees in me

This ain't the paradise I promised her it's just a slice of life
With an average man honest work with calloused hands
And it bothers me I can't deliver all the things I swore I'd give her
But she looks into my eyes like life with me is some kind of prize

What she sees in me is nothing but the best
In her eyes I'll never be anything less
It's a love strong enough to forgive the rest
If only I could always be what she sees in me

She runs to me and holds me tight and in her eyes there shines a light
That reaches to the deepest part of all that's good inside my heart
The places that are kind and true and I know I must live up to

Had a shoe box full of baseball cards
And a couple of Evel Knievel scars
On my right arm
I was a kid when Elvis died

It was nineteen seventy somethin'

And oh man did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'

It was the dawning of a new decade
When we got our first microwave
And Dad broke down and finally shaved
Them old sideburns off
I took the stickers off of my Rubik's Cube
Watched MTV all afternoon
And my first love was Daisy Duke
In them cut off jeans
A space shuttle fell out of the sky
And the whole world cried

Just ordinary people sharing life and telling jokes

I found a little amazing grace in the most unusual place
Somewhere between the bar stools and pool tables
I was entertaining angels

As Tommy talked about losing his wife
And Joe just shared the bad news, he's got a little time but it ain't good
And it made me take a good look at my life

A dime story nobody wants
Is that baby how I made you feel

Please tell me
Where did I lose, where did I lose
Where did I lose you?

Are you folded at the top of a laundry basket
Sweepin' the floors of a three bedroom house that
Keeps you crying all day long

Have you done everything but come undone

Mark Winchester,"She was aware of her insecurities
As she took the stage
But she was convinced if she got up there
That she'd be discovered some day
So she belted it
She hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh, she melted them
She brought them to their feet

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place
And she signed autographs
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath
That small time town was hers

She was a big star
At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

Hey, she doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends cut her down
The only thought she entertains is where they aren't
And where she is now

A few old neighbors swear they are certain
She slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you're goin'
Unless you got something they ain't got
So she sings tonight
To twenty thousand plus
And the young girls scream out loud
Man that could be us

She's a big star
She eats caviar
Just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She's a big star",Big Star,2006

The Loaded Desperado, I'm cooler than Rollo 
(Aiyyo, what you hittin' Doc?) I'm hittin' hoes up in the Tahoe 
Gettin' chickens fightin' in the back of the Apollo 
Say, ""Fuck dat!"" if I'm a tough act to follow 
(""Fuck dat!!!"") Disagree I bring the beef gyro 
Only right I spiral the hot shit that I know 

Then buy a six shot Eclipse with plastic grips 

And get a gangsta bitch who love robbin' shit! 

[Chorus] 

It don't stop y'all, it don't stop nigga 
You don't stop y'all, it don't stop nigga 
I turn an independent woman back into a hoochie 
Make a Jew rock a Dashiki and a Kufi 

I be the, Nutty Professor, style aggressor 
Put rappers under pressure, with no cooker 
 
Rock it to a T. like Booker, you're straight shook up 
I can't hang with pussy niggaz who be scared as hell to push up 
Too much money and, not enough time 
It be, too many thugs and not enough nines 
Hey hoe, here come five-oh, stash the blow 
Stop suckin' on my dick and slide on your Kenneth Coles 

And every time we look around them niggaz on my block 

Aiyyo them Def Squad motherfuckers keeps it hot

Markita,"Somebody made me an offer and I accepted
Forever in debted to weapon
Love, honor, and respected
But his image was different than what his character reflected
Word is he's seven - thirty his hands never dirty
All I know this so called psycho never hurt me
Touch me down to tips, shopping sprees on Fifth
With enough dough that could be carry out on forklifts
Earnt his trust, together till we turn to dust
Until his theory disintegrated and burnt to crust
What? What?

Death to a soft heart
That's what I vow to you
The vows I vow to you
Amazing how it's true
Talk goes on our phone
Just to remind you
That I'm behind you
The FEDS won't find you

Relax my love
The love I have for you is like the Mafia
For you I'd testify
I'd lie for you of course
Since my love is like the Mafia
And for you I will fight

Mister and Misses, but I wonder where the bliss is
Sealed in blood and Cordion kisses
The shit I witnessed
Would give a bitch morning sickness
Decomposed bodies thrown in the ditches
As for snitches ain't nothing lower than that
Intentions to squeal on your fam make you low as a rat
Got cappos for flaming at those
Lame ass hoes, so you know next time keep your trap close

What would you doubt for?
I'd never lie to you
Of course I'd die for you
I'd be your eye for you
My love won't stop short
I'll raise our sons for you
I'll save our ones for you
Load up your guns for you

Relax my love
The love I have for you is like the Mafia
For you I'd testify
I'd lie for you of course
Since my love is like the Mafia
And for you I will fight

Relax my love
The love I have for you is like the Mafia
For you I'd testify
I'd lie for you of course
Since my love is like the Mafia
And for you I will fight

Riches, tradition niggas once held dear
Let it be known that your name alone spell fear
Gun for gun, hundred to one forget about it
Petty shit, rise above and get up out it
Could give a shit about it
Time to focus a foe
Many lives bought and sold
Fortunes favor the bold
Connected like phone lines
To racketeering to known crimes
Winners turning long shots to gold mines

The high speed chases
I'll do them just like you
I'll give them dust like you
Turn around and bust like you
Then I'll deserve it
Every time I get high

Relax my love
The love I have for you is like the Mafia
For you I'd testify
I'd lie for you of course
Since my love is like the Mafia
And for you I will fight

You I testify, oh, oh",Mafia,1999
Marko Penn,"So put it on, turn the whole party to a riot
Bad habits, don't knock it 'til you try it
Look up for ourselves from a mirror
You know me, I'm down for whatever
And I'm so far gone, feels so right
Seems wrong? Sure, but you want what you want
Rooms full of empty bottles and rolled notes
I'ma do this 'til I'm gone, I'm gone broke, now
Liquor in the system (woo) let's get it
Hotel room like a typhoon hit it
I'm living this life whether highs or religious
And goodbyes are love letters, written in her lipstick
Sitting on the fence won't get you both sides
Heaven ain't far, it's a hell of a night
It's whatever you like, we can go or go in
Burn a candle both ends until you say when

Tell me all your secrets no one knows
And we don't chill until you tell me so
And we up right now, we don't have to come back down

No, we never at the end, just say when
Just say when
Just say when

Ain't no emoji for the feeling
Let 'em autocorrect that
I didn't mean to throw you in the deep end
But look at you already doing laps
Shit, I don't have fortune or a fast car
But I got an escape plan and a map
The Clyde to your Bonnie, wake up smell the coffee
Not exactly Vodka and Cottees, but obviously
Fucking with the fly shit, you're meant to indulge
In my element, right, making memories roll
Y'all know, make the kind, either never gets told
I tell 'em all the time and they never get old
You my sidekick, my highness, yeah what's good?
Fuck the fine print, write this in the books
And I'm down to tear the city up with you tonight

Markus Pesonen Hendectet,"I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.
I'd love to turn you on",A  Day In The Life,2012

Annie was a high school cheerleader
Pom poms and bobby socks, no girl was sweeter
Come Prom time everybody was on the line
All the fellas swinging nickel and dime
Tales about love and lust and trust
But Annie took it all in stride
Cause deep inside Annie had aspirations
Wanted to be a chemical engineer
Making fifty to fifty-five thousand a year
Her first year of college was a success
But along came Billy possessed and obsessed
He took Annie on a fatal date
And showed her things that make heartbeats accelerate
Annie took a hit breathed two short breaths
One for life..the last for death
Now she's gone, a former Valedictorian
Ended up becoming a topic for historians
Washed up dreams and shattered pride
All because Annie took a hit - on the Wildside

Ron had enough of being broke everyday
Saying to himself, there's gotta be a better way
Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So Ron figured out a faster way to make - money

Gold on every finger of his hand

His pregnant wife lay slumped over

Interrogated 'cause their skin was brown
Then there was Bennett, guilty until proven so

The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill Carol, collect a big check

And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling that his cover was blown
So he jumped off a bridge

Then out of the blue, a Mercedes at top speed
Gang bangers chasin' the robbers on the stampede

One hit Tiffany, and instantly she died

Marky Mark,"Marky Mark intro:
Ha, yeah. I know what you're all thinking
That this is some old Janet Jackson type of @#!
But it ain't about that
This if the real, the street life trauma

Yo, I grew up rough in the streets of Boston, Massachusetts
Lived real ruthless, a wild kid, out to get a bid
Did some #@! that he never shoulda did
Had to learn the hard way
That some day you gotta pay
So what the hey, I say

Prince Ital Joe:
Life in the streets ain't easy
All I see is pain and misery
I kneel and pray for the betrayed
Strength and protection to survive in the society

This is the life in the streets
And that's how we live it

Marky Mark:
Hard and mean at sixteen, livin' like a beam, theme
Out scheming for the green
Quick to kill, I gets ill, I make ya blood spill
I cut ya throat for your goose-down coat
'cause statistic show that kids with no dough
Ain't got no chance, got nowhere to go
That's why life on the streets is like a trifular beat
It'll echo in ya head till you're dead on the concrete

Prince Ital Joe:
Life in the streets is a mystery
Don't know my friends from my enemies
Up to lot, could be trouble
But I'll hold tight and I will never give up the fight

(Chorus)

This one is dedicated to all the homeless people
To every youth that's growin' up on the streets
You know, we're living for a dream one day
That there'll be no more homeless people in the world
Life in the streets is not easy

Charles was the culprit
The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill Carol, collect a big check
Blame it on a black man, what the heck?
And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling that his cover was blown
So he jumped off a bridge
Committed suicide
This is how it is - on the Wildside

Little Tiffany, only thirteen
Came to the city, place of big dreams
Visiting family and friends for the summertime
Sittin' on a mailbox, watchin' the boys climb trees
And the girls play hopscotch
So far, her vacation was top notch
Then out of the blue, a Mercedes at top speed
Gang bangers chasin' the robbers on the stampede
Quick as a blink shots rang out loud
And a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd
One hit Tiffany, and instantly she died
Innocently - on the Wildside",Wild Side,1992

Her legs crossed left over the right one
She said, ""You know my girl that you're a private creeper
What you need to say you're gonna say alone""

I carried that with me through speeches
And hardly scratched the surface
Ashamed to think that they don't feel as much as I do
She said, ""When I pray for him, I'll pray alone""

Of all the things I never told you
This is the lump in my throat
No matter who had come a-callin'
I would have stayed with you

I forced myself to sit
My hands folded left over the right one
And when it's done my friends
We all walk out together into the waiting cold
I am hollow and bold

We all go out to eat
Because it's what he would have wanted
And I'm so grateful for the ones he brought together
And the stories they tell that we all know so well

But later in my room
I turn the lights out and cover up the mirror
I light a candle for my dear departed teacher
And what I needed to say, now, I can say alone

Of all the things I never told you
This is the lump in my throat

Any rime I can find a riddle
Any season I can find a reason
For once just enjoy the ride

All the eyes
I can find inviting
All the boys
I can find attractive
You look fine
There's nothing to worry
Take your time
'Cause baby there's no hurry
For once just enjoy the ride
For once just enjoy the ride

I'll pretend
I don't know you're looking,
I'll invent
Everything we shouldn't say.
But baby, hush
'Cause all the city is sleeping
And baby, rush
This is time we're stealing

And I'll never close my door

I'm sure I drown in the void
Of the days you left behind
Of the games you left without rules
Of all of the nights that now pile up
In the space you left behind

And in your absence, my senses
Turn fearful, turn quick
They see everything, anything
Too much, not enough, not enough

And in your absence, my senses
Turn fearful, turn quick

Bring a flower and sweep all the ashes

I have no route no point I daydream
My mind wonders with no map
And real life colours seem washed out
My eyes see things of a secret nature
I resist from trying to understand
I tear the pages of my past

To recall what you think you thought you wanted
Every yesterday is empty
And no tomorrow will hold
What you carry with yourself today
I carry with myself today
No route, no point, no map

My eyes see things of a secret nature
And I think if I find a word
I will unlock the past
As if a morning
Could wake up some side of me
That's plain and rich full and lovely and hidden
Plain and full of colours
'Cause I have all the words in me
Words I've never heard before
I try to pick up what sleeps
I try to pick up what slips through your mouth
And find that my own words are so dull and empty
I desist, I quit, I don't know
Answers to questions you
You make, you wait

But there's no use 'cause I can't find you
But there's no use at all

Doctor says it's all right, feeling shit when it's all light
When luck hits you like a truck, I keep on walking in the street with luck
And climb over your arms and step onto your charms
And tread over the dreams I had one night.

In a castle built with dreams we had each night
All the walls were water where the moon would dance
And the floor moved every time we touched

There's no sun now
Stars don't come out
I can't hear anyone near

There's no sun now
Stars don't come out
I can't hear anyone near, anyone's near

When you left I tried
To drown that moon each night
And the water turned to ice
That locked me up inside

But there's no sun now
Stars don't come out
I can't hear anyone near

There's no sun now
Stars don't come out
I can't hear anyone near, anyone's near

Now, I found a planet for myself
Where an ocean cares for me
We beat like wounds

And there is sun now
Stars do come out
I can hear everyone near

There is sun now
Stars do come out
I can hear everyone near, everyone near

And there is sun now
Stars do come out
I can hear everyone near

There is sun now
Stars do come out
I can hear everyone near, everyone's near

Marlango,"I used to think one day I'd learn the truth about life
Nailed everything I saw to the wall of certainties
Then life came along and casually pulled down
My house

Used to think I would understand things
Now I learned there´s nothing to be understood
Then I believed everything I touched
Was a lie impossible to live up to
Pull down brick by brick
The fence around my life
Burnt the flowers ´cos I thought
I thought they were alibis

Used to think I would understand things
Now I learned there´s nothing to be understood

Now I observe constructions around me
The architecture of sophisticated lives
Warehouses to pile up mistakes
Woodsheds to hide the dreams we give up on

Used to think I would understand things
Now I learned there´s nothing to be understood
I used to think one day I'd get to be something

I still catch myself

In me I can invent a new landscape
I've got trains advancing through my veins
I build stations and playgrounds for my mind to wander out
The nicotine and games I can invent all over again

They're easy to give when you're in love
I'm happy to do, whatever I do for you

For you, maybe I'm a fool, but it's fun
People will say you rule me with one wave of your hand
Darling, it's grand, they just don't understand

Living for you is easy living
It's easy to live when you're in love
And I'm so in love

Marlena Shaw,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2004

Comes up every morning

On the high tide
Whistle a melody

And that's how the

You wanna pat your feet
And you've gotta move cause

Will it move you

Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

Or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

I've locked my heart.
I keep my feelings there.
I have stopped my heart
Like an icy frigidaire.
For I need to care for no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.

Why did you leave me
To think that you cared.
You didn't need me.
You have your share
of slaves around you
To hound you and swear
Their deep devotion.
Emotion.

Did you good by the spring 
And all it meant to me
a good neighbor 
The things that used to be.
For I must have you or no one.
That's why I'm thru with love.
That's why I'm thru with love.",I'm Through With Love,1996
Marlene Danielle,"In the middle of a forest 
There's a clearing by a stream 
Where a mother holds her newborn 
And the child begins to dream 

And he dreams of hopes unspoken 
When the tears of man will cease 
And his mother holds him closer 
For he is the Prince of peace 

And the moon is looking downward 
Casting shadows through the trees 
And the stars are shining brighter 
As they whisper what they see 

How the emperor and the pauper 
With the lion and the lamb 
Kneel down before the infant 
For his peace they understand 

Hark, the herald angels sing 
Glory to the newborn king 
Peace on earth and mercy mild 
God and sinners reconciled 
Glory all ye nations rise 
Join the triumph of the skies 

With the heavenly host proclaim 
Christ is born in Bethlehem 
Hark, the herald angels sing 
Glory to the newborn king 

Let the bells ring out these tidings 
Let it echo across the land 
That a king is born in Bethlehem 
And his kingdom is at hand 

Let the world rejoice together 
As it looks upon the stars 
Knowing every man's our brother 
And that every child is ours 

As he flew o'er Sarajevo 
There were scars upon the land 
There were scars upon the people 
It was hard to understand 

And the deepest scars of all 
Which to humans are unseen 
But the angel could see clearly 
Were the scars upon the dreams 

Like Belfast and Burundi 
Rwanda, Palestine 
The only decorations here 
Had been awarded for their crimes 

And in gardens where the children played 
Now soldiers only trod 
And stranger still, he heard some say 
That they were killing for their god 

Now the angel heard god speak many times 
And he had always paid attention 
But this killing of ones neighbor 
Was something the Lord had never mentioned 

But as he neared the earth 
Of a recent battleground 
From among the ruins 
He once more heard the sound 

It was a single cello playing 
A forgotten Christmas song 
And even on that battlefield 
The song somehow belonged 

And as he flew away 
The angel did take note 
That where he found this music played 
One always could find hope",The Prince of Peace,2000

Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters.
Nosey pokes'll peek thru' their shutters and their eyes will pop!

The dashboard's genuine leather,
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,

Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'
You c'n keep your rig if you're thinkin' 'at I'd keer to swap
Fer that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top! Did you say 
the fringe was made of silk
Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Does it really have a team of snow white horses
One's like snow, the other's more like milk
All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
When we hit that road, hell fer leather,
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!
I can see the stars gettin' blurry,
When we drive back home in the surrey,
Drivin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!
I can feel the day gettin' older,
Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!
The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill;
The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,
A lark'll wake up in the medder.
Hush, you bird, my baby's a-sleepin'!
Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin'
Whoa! you team, and jist keep a-creepin' at a slow clip clop.
Don't you hurry with the surrey with the fringe on the top!",The Surrey with the Fringe on Top,1993
Marlene Dietrich,"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1993
Marlene Dietrich,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands,1993
