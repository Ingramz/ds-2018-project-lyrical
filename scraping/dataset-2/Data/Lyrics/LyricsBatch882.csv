Cuando te miro al pasar
Entre la gente al andar
Mi mente empieza a maquinar
Y no paro de pensar
Cuando me doy cuenta
Que sigues estando con él
Que nadie te obliga a querer
Solo tú y yo, solo tú

Y si esta noche nos juntamo'
Y nos vamo' de jaleo
Poco a poco terminamo'
Bailando bien pegao'
Y tú vera'
Y es que este ritmo está pegao'
Y por tu booty se pasea
Y es que tú y yo nos calentamos
Cuando nos vamos de jaleo
Y tú veras

Será el veneno de tu piel
Que me está matando
Será que niña a ti también
Te está gustando
Métele jaleo (ea, ea, ea)
Métele jaleo (jaleo, leo, leo)

Tú conmigo entre las sábanas la pasas chillin'
Tú conmigo entre las sábanas la pasas chillin'
Y muéveme ese booty de fantasía
Quiero verlo por la noche y por el día
Yo se que conmigo tú estás encendia'
Y desde hace tiempo yo sé que querías

Yo no me puedo controlar
Tú me vas a matar
Cuando te pone' a bailar
No lo puedo evitar (wow)
Baby, tú me tiene muy mal
Mueve ese booty, mami, ran-pa-pa-pam
Yo no me puedo controlar
Tú me vas a matar
Cuando te pone' a bailar
No lo puedo evitar (wow)

Rashaan,"Groovy groovy jazzy funky pounce bounce dance
As we dip in the melodic sea
Rhythm keeps flowin', an' Drip's the M.C.
Sweet sugar pop sugar pop rocks
Pop you don't stop til the sweet beat drops
I show an' prove as I stick an' move
Every poem's recited on top of the groove
Smooth, my, floatin' like a butterfly
Notes that I float sung like a lullaby
Brace yourself as the beat hits ya
Dip trip flip fantasia
 
Feel the beat drop jazz and hip-hop
Drippin' in your dome makes you zone and bop 
Funk and fusion a fly illusion
Keeps ya coastin' on the rhythm ya cruisin' 
Up down round and round, rhymes profound
But nevertheless you've got to get down 
Fantasy freak through the beat so unique
You move your feet and sweat from the beat
Back to the fact I'm the mack and I know that
The way I kick the rhyme some will call me a poet
Poem steady flowin', growin' showin' sights and sounds
Caught in the groove in the tale I found
Many tripped the tour upon the rhymes they saw
To an infinite height to the realm of the hardcore
Here we go off I take ya
Dip trip flip fantasia
 
Jump to the jam boogie woogie jam slam
Bust the dialect I'm the man in command
Come flow with the sound of th mighty mic master
Rhymin' on the mic I'll bring the suckers to disaster
Bookout ducks but I still rock Nike
With the razzle dazzle, a star I might be
Scribble drabble scrabble on the microphone I babble
As I fix the funky words into a puzzle
Yes yes yes on and on I flex
Get with the flow verbs manifest
Feel the vibe from here to Asia

Rashad,"Uh  uh  uh  uh  what 
Let's talk about it 
Yeah  yeah  yeah 
Ma  I told you  I'm not here to fuss or fight 
But I see it  all you want to do is cuss all night 
In front of the kids  you tryin' to crush my life 
'Cause you know I ain't the type that punch my wife 
But I see now  who you wanted to be 
While knee deep in the pee now  tryin' to freestyle 
But I see now  people could see  that ain't me 
When I bought you the E3, the crib in D.C. 
On GP, bought the Mazda Z3 
Bought your little brother the 52 inch TV 
With a PlayStation to stay patient 
'Cause right now it's all about the kid's situation 
Rashad-Chorus: 
Please baby girl 
Let's not fight 
If you're really gonna be in my life 
Let's work it out til we get it right

Please don't cry 
If you're really gonna be in my life 
Let's work it out til we get it right 
Huddy: 
All Out, yo, yo, yo 
Once mistake in my life, this chicken head claimin' she wife 
Jammin' my phone, like damn, she won't leave me alone 
Knew she was trife, the way she kept watchin' my ice 
Watchin' my step, hittin' it on top of the steps 
Knowin' she wild, the condoms, she havin' my child 
Now that I'm stuck, she can't keep scratchin' my truck 
Actin' all young, doing it in front of our son 
Peeped it before, but didn't want to think she's a whore 
Thinkin' it's good, fuckin' up her rep in the 'Hood 
Fuckin' up mine, fuckin' niggas two at a time 
But look at her now, Harlem World quicker to town 
But look at my rhyme, better it didn't turn into crumb 
And I'm Little Huddy must have made me calm 
So I bowed down prayin' for my baby's mom 
I'ma take a raise now that my baby's born 
And I'ma love you anyway til the day you're gone, what

Baby $ta$e: 
Yo, yo, yo 
Yo, it's a holiday, sippin' on Sharanade 
I'm wonderin' why these cats never celebrate Father's Day 
y'all tellin' in fear, y'all ain't really takin' y'all cares 
And y'all motherfuckin' lie and say that y'all did 
Now when days, the phrases, the tired old lines 
She was messin' around and the baby ain't mine 
But all y'all, knowin' y'all was sayin' it raw-daw 
y'all want to claim that? How y'all gonna explain that? 
I'm bothered, y'all shouldn't have got me started 
Where was you when shorty turned two? 
Tell me what whould you do if the baby caught the flu 
You ain't even got a clue, if you do, tell me how to pursue 
But you quick to get hyper, come mess up my cypher 
No dough for no diapers, so why should I like ya? 
And you never cared before, so why should we care that you now see 74? 
Chorus: 
Please baby girl 
Let's not fight 
If you want to be in my life 
Let's work it nice so we get it right 
Please baby girl 
Let's not fight 
If you want to be in my life 
Let's work it nice so we get it right

Gave you my hancock, it wasn't legible
And, the love we had, it was incredible
But, you know I had to move on I guess
Somethin was goin on, people was in my lawn
Talkin on the phone tellin me I did you wrong
And that was just not the norm
I see now everything you said, did you really mean?
Cause everything I said I still mean now
You can make a frown and all the cryin sounds

You're the one, yeahhhh (that's what it feels like)
You're my favorite drug (you're my favorite drug)

You're my favorite drug, amazin love
Cause you never, tell your friends where David was
Got a blunt blaze it up, we can get a room in the Trump
That's the one with our favorite tub
Damn you fly, why lie when I get high
All I do is think about how I'ma ride them thighs
I ain't never been one to make no girly songs
But I'll be up in this chick 'til the early morn'
Mighta came with some Temples but those Shirleys gone
She laughin makin a joke she gon' sell out porns
Got me head over heels, puffin on a dutch
Thinkin to myself, might spread some bread for some wheels
I might be wrong, but honey is right
Got to have my back strong when I come for the night
Her ""Milkshake"" bring my ass to the yard and we don't care
If we do it in the telly or the back of the car, what?

[Chorus: Rashad]
You're my favorite drug, get me high
Like the skies above, yeah
Feels like I'm in love, I'm so high
You're my favorite drug

[Styles P:]
Stoned as usual; pickin up my chick
We gon' bone as usual; she been talkin shit
On the phone as usual - pull up on the block
In somethin real nice on chrome as usual
Either one of us don't care where we headed
Park the truck, get a dutch, watch ""American Wedding""
I like her cause she cool, graduated school
Got a mean stick in pool
Cut a nigga quicker than me she a fool
When everybody flip she was still playin rules
She the shit like some stools
I'm open like the windows is
Everytime we have sex I'm in limbo kid
And she make me stop quicker than my brimbles did
So no longer do I care where the fuck them other bimbos is
She's my favorite drug, the shit so serious
Me, her and purple, point black period

[Chorus: w/ ad libs]

[Styles P:]
Me and her been doin it far too much
'Til the 55 box of cigars is up
Right before checkout time is the hardest nut
The valet call the room and say the cars is up
A dutch and a shot, that's what P thing is
Then I be all up in that ass like them G strings is
She is my favorite drug, so is the purple
So I get 'em both together then I blaze 'em up

Her name, Mary Jane

Saggin' my dickies, smoke like a hippy
Smell so good when she get wet and sticky
You lift me, girl you the bomb
Got a nigga blowin' like Cheech and Chong
A bong, a blunt, or a paper square
It really don't matter she'll take you there
You been my gal since the age of thirteen
And it's funny to me, you still make me fiend
You put a spell on me with the green voodoo
You love when my boys come and run us a choo choo
Mary-Jane deep in the game
The way I feel words can't explain
You been true to me, stood by my side
I wake up and get my mornings first high
Other hoes wonder why they get no love
'Cause Mary got a big ol' but, huh

I ask him ""what's in the bag"" he says ""two acres of plants

We be hustlin on blocks moving in and out the alley
We call it medicine that's what you need when you get sick
Sometimes it's hard rock sometimes it's white pearl brick
Across, across the state line just me and my girlfriend
From powder to pine I got money on my mind
Stop wasting all my time and get me over to the spot
Unload all the cargo and meet me at the docks

Meeting up wit my bitches snow white and mary jane
Only thing that ever mattered to me 
Stacking dollars shit we making a week
Who the cowards who the killas who's the niggas wit scrilla
Felt all up in they pockets rocking fo' niggas that try to kill us
Then maybe later you bitches bother me 
You wanted to pay you too late don't bother calling me
  
[6] - Going to the valley fo' soldiers in a caddy 
And in the back of the caddy got fifty pound of smally
Tryed to jack but can't catch me
I just keep that paper stacking
Always packin never slacking 
leaving you hoe ass niggas unhappy
Chopping burs when able, fucking hoes on the table

Pull up to a trailor wit about 800

Trying hard as hell to make it back to H-Town
Flippin but only make one stop
Then I'm buring out moving shit to a dope house

Make thirty calls so I can wire free samples
Get me a plane so I can make my drops
Flying real low to avoid the cops
Weighing my weed on a digital beam
Wrapping it in a plastic quick so I can make my green

[Verse 1}
I want to be like you Sheed getting' respect on the block
Packin' a teq and a glock
Fat pockets you got your game on lock
But yet I still see you bowin' your head 
Askin' for forgiveness under the street light
Yeah right Shorty 
My life style still wrong 
It ain't easy standin' strong
Won't be long 'till I'm gone
Every cop in the city got me in they picture frame
Plus different gangs with bullets that got my name
So what then if they come I got something for them
I got your back 
We can go to war right now with 'em
And I'll floor 'em
Pour them bloodclots
Dead soldiers for O.G.
If these bullets come flyin'
I'm in front of you dyin'
You got heart huh?
What's this on your chest?
You for real ain't you Shorty
Where you get this bulletproof vest?
You a mess but I like you a lot
Let's split them from this spot
Them bullets is hot when the enemy came for the shot

[Chorus repeat 2x]

Say Shorty you ever fell a bullet up in your chest?
Or seen what a hallowpoint bullet can do
It's a damn mess
It's messed up when you have to resort to violence
That's why real bad boys gotta move in silence
Comprenda I understand you tellin' me avoid any trouble whenever I can
That a make me a better man
Be quick to listen and slow to speak
Watch everything and my game will be at peak
And don't trust a freak
You catch on fast you got the heart of a G
And as much as I hate to tell you
You kind of reminder of me
Look out Shorty
What one time commin' up the block
I can't let them see my face 
Put away the rocks and the glocks
Say no more
""What's the problem officer?""
""Now none of ya move come here sir let me talk to ya""
Yeah right 
Say Shorty I gotta break
I ain't stayin' here either
Well yo lets shake this crooked jake

[Chorus repeat 2x]

[Verse 3]

Damn O.G. you sure run fast for your age
That came from doin' push ups and workin' out when I was in the cage
Say Shorty let's chill for a while 
I got a little something in my pockets that will make you smile
I hope it's hydro 
If not I got some formaldehyde
What  Shorty?
They put it in people after they died
I'm already fried still pass me that dro
And let me taste this stuff and see what you be trippin' fo'
Smooth with great taste
Shhhh say O.G. you here some bass
Damn that's them busters from the otherside
Watch out Shorty
They pullin' gats out they ride
BOOM BOOM oh man I think I'm hit
Me too Shorty
Better get out of here quick
I can't everything is goin' black O.G.
I think I'm dyin too Shorty you wanted to be like me?

Put the body in the back of a automobile, 
Collect my collateral bill, shatter your fuckin' grill, 
Humidity heated when I step in the arena, 
Better come cleaner with felonies, what you're tellin' me's misdemeanor, 
Bombs go off like firecrackers, stackin' my foes like bricks, 
Hoes on the mic like tricks, 
Get 'em up hit 'em up, lit 'em up, I move too quick

Too sick to see with these suicidal symphonies, 
To get with me handle business efficiently, 
Officially certified platinum with these lyrical murders, 
Servin' a Hell of punch crunch time,
Blowin' like landmines, 
Brainless bodies droppin' in no particular order, 
Prepare for slaughter ammunition is gettin' shorter, 
Teleport the blood sport to ghetto block, put the game on lock,

Watch his muthafuckin' head drift down the Nile, 
Graphic murders three dimensional witch doctors,
Killin' like Shaka, from Port Lovaca to Morocco.

And we can go out in war on a sinkin' Titanic,

Bring sun to you on rainy days
Ways of the wise don't kill the messenger before the message
You know me Rasheed from Philly to the Houston, Texas

Still buildin our circle sendin soldiers
Out in full dispersal
Hot hot meet the eye of the storm in human form
Ring the alarm swarmin with this wicked storm
Bede bede bing yiiiii that's how I bust em
No discussion or repercussion rush little mudafuckin crushin

Make the average female listen to close and have a orgasm

Find a pen thoughts in a poetic perspective
Effective word defective
Know every line is dissected
Rhyme and respected
Stay connected
The matrix is my guide
Immortalized by words on Earth
I keep my faith in God
Crazy inferno flame so much affection
Mental erection
Melodies take me like a demon hat's under possession
Hot we heated like them boys in the prison institution
With a appetite for freedom who gonna light them fuses
Abusin everything

But on the contrary
Countin my blessings with the skills to give these verbal lessons
Keep my focus never sell out make maneuvers with discretion

And we try to abide by the rules of the game
And we hide when we ride fuck the bitches and the fame
All about my cash flow you betta move over we in the fast
Ain't gonna stop till we get the thousand plaques maan
So many fallen off cause they wasn't real to the heart
Gotta keep it as true as I can from the movie screen to the rappin art
Apart of the chosen few showin you how it really is
Really don't matta how you do it just go pursue kid

My forty ounce bottle, is spillin' on my pants
Ridin' too deep, in the four-door '77

'Cause my backyard looks like an exotic island
Creepin Harrisburg, the party broke left

Why'all want to keep us underground, they pass us up on purpose
But it ain't gone work, why'all can't converse with us

I've been ahead of my time, before I started rhyming
Media, got us under the encyclopedia
It's tedious, the best only is dedious
Believe in us, no reason to be greediest
They anxious to put us in ankles and cuffs
Think it's pimping the hell, like a witch it is selling none of your hands 
and your feet
Come bring your face to sorcerer cause she's
Bitch, watch what you say 
Before you end up a fool and say your little jones for me

Rasheed,"Sometimes I want to get away from all the confusion 
Causin' pollution 
I know you wish you could run away from this institution 
'Cause there's no solution, to survive 

Another day when I'm waking up 
I turn my TV on CNN 
Another homie done bit the dust, my best friend's back up in the pen 
Somebody hit the twin towers,and the buildings came tumbling down 
All we could do was watch in tears 
While the people of America wondered how we let it go down 
Then, I heard a sound when I turned around 
This old man said pray for me 
Said I've been in the world for 88 long years and go now can you stay for me? 
I looked him in the eyes, and gave him a smile and said mister I don't mean no harm 
But you ain't going nowhere, so just pull up a chair 
I got greens fresh off the farm 
And with that he pulled a bottle from his pocket and said youngin' ima give it a try 
I said hold up pops, I ain't forget about the nana you promised so pass it by 
And then he said

Sometimes I want to get away from all the confusion 
Causin' pollution 
I know you wish you could run away from this institution 
'Cause there's no solution, to survive 

From dusk to dawn, mom's always tellin' me you must move on 
Let the past be the last thing to dust you son 
And I trust you mom 
But the doesn't mean my lust for fun, want to bust my gun 
Wasn't much to some, then you measured up to most started walking down the road 
To the treasure up the post 
You just never fucking know what you gonna see, where ya gonna be, who you gonna meet 
It's true you gonna sleepin', slip into silence 
Shot guns fired, choppers and sirens 
Spotlight shinin', flashin' on the glance 
At a boy without a chance and the Devil on his ass 

I be sayin' though, livin' my life, wishin' and hopin'
I be sayin' though, chasin' the dreams
I be sayin' though same thing that will make you laugh will make you cry 
That's how we know man, why that's why 

I be sayin though taken away from the frustration 
I be sayin though teach me to use my imagination 
I be sayin though same thing that will make you laugh will make you cry 
That's how we know man, why that's why 

Sometimes I want to get away from all the confusion

Rasheed,"[Chorus]
She's in love with a hustla 
She don't be messing with them suckas 
Looking so good, little tight jeans on and G-string on 
And I know that she be feeling me 

She in love with a hustla', someone she could trust uh 
Someone she could get down with, cause she don't mess with suckas 
Sleep all day, and grind all night 
Living in the fast lane, the game's nothing polite 
So I'm laced up tight, cause I ain't into lagging 
She love to watch me in the mirror when I'm doing my stabbing 
And she ain't into punks, giving em bruises and bumps 
And she know I blow big, so she be twisting my blunts 
That's real talk, coming from a real hog on the block 
She love the playboy lifestyle, the knots and the rocks 
And even though sometime, it might seem strange 
She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she thangs 

[Chorus] 

Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice 
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice 
Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance 
And end up with a over jealous sucka' romance 
Love to see me get the lap dance every now and then huh 
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh 
Now that's living like, who's the boss 
Yeah she liking the money, but she loving my sauce 
Even though she approached by them big time ballas 
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa 
And her parents just don't understand
What kind of man she in love with, 
But she don't give a damn

One day we gone get it together 
One day we gone keep it together
One day we gone keep it together
One day we gone keep it together
One day we gone keep it together

Plus she had a pocket full of colorful pills
Puttin' heat through yo whole crew flannel
Cookin' them chickens put me on tha Food Channel
Roll with tha pimps, oh nah I'm not a balla
Sell up on those cities like a blue night crawler

No esta buena but it hits a penas
Makin money in prison why afuera
That's my business, my drawings what eva
Slangin hierba diez bolas al toke
Slangin ink con placazos al sobres
Slang my cornbread, dessert and a juice
Saw my homeboy get shot on the news
Now you know what this Mexican doos
Come and cruise, take a walk in my shoes
On the cool esta vida no es linda
That's your boy hittin licks in the pinta

Be cool when you see the ghost

Envelope with the money order, 50 should get me a mountain
Biness to handle when the bossman finish countin
Homie kinda broke and them folks call him indigent
Hustle out there, Hustle here, there's no sentiment
Sendin so many kites, call me Benjamin Frank
Service to everybody, 50 men in a tank
Meet my sister in the free, she gon send you a bank
While I make me a shank contraband drank
Food, snacks, basic commissary
Pay me for my picture of the what? naked Halle Berry
Home on a furlough, OG told me
Where he buried the dough, let it burn slow
6 months and I'll be free
But right now I got whatever you need, two for three
Broke and alone doin time comatose
I'mma shoot at the Bitch and see if she a Ghost

Cell block be, seven-be-two
Pass the grass but don't let'em see you
My heavenly jewel riskin it all
The finest boss lady in these prison brick walls
Hit the lick ma, kiss the dick soft
Lemme see your phone for a business call
If it gets long pick it up before three
But put it on silent so it don't ring
I'm the digital king, this is no dream
Is it real love or just a physical thing
Like a typical fling while I'm sippin on lean
Bring back some chicken cause a nigga Hung-ry
Connections, while I lay up in this Texas corrections
So the judges can win their elections
They locking up the muthafuckin Mexicans
Back with my best friends and we go

Timed ya walk from there to the time I parked

Disturbin' the peace, baby be easy
Rockin the bed so hard we done kicked off
All tha sheets, don't worry we don't need em
A couple hours in the session we done been
Through bout four CDs (about four CDs)

Round here we gangstered out, this ain't no titty bar 
We let it all hang out
Break bread till the song played out, show that nigga what a real bitch bout

I can fuck, any bitch in here, lay her on the pillow
Crawl up behind her and cram all of it in her
Ride her ass like a bicycle, hold right there
When I move you move, just like that
Just as show as yo ass is fat, there's some 26 inch rims on a Cadillac
Like spinners, sittin on a sixty-seven
At the car show bumpin Funk Master Flex
I ain't met a bitch yet (and yeah) that I couldn't have
All I gotta do is tell a hoe who I am
Pull up to the side and get away from them

And to the niggas whose LP's I kinda liked
I'm fresher than that, and that new shit you tryin to write
Like mita, mita, name not Rashita
Battle on the streets so when I'm playin senorita
Spend a few peso on some chili con queso
Thinkin how I used to wax rappers back that eso
Be in San Juan, on the carriage like I'm Cam'Ron
Wit a nigga tryin to chew my tampon with my pants on
I'm gettin money off the books like I'm Beatnuts
Make em sign pre-nups, word to my see-cups
Fuck with they heads like Kahlua, milk and vodka
Then tell they punk ass to move on like Silkk the Shocker
Word to my godfather, who bombs harder
Be out to get the paper like Inga and Shawn Carter

or in my travels, grabbin slices from S'Barro's
Eyein fake niggas like they intimate apparel

Even biggin me for shit I did for Lyricist Lounge

Playin me close so I can hook you up with Busta
Fuck an entourage, I'm the bitch that roll dolo
More still than mo-mo's and a 4-4 on my polo
With the toaster, make ya run like Sammy Sosa
Could take about 50 MC's like Tony Tocca
Why you take it there? 'cause I'm fruitier than kiwi
And when I freestyle you ain't gon hear it on my CD
Money management, 'cause I'm grown up and older now
Drinkin mad low and brow, tell em how it's goin down
Bricks, Bricks, 'cause I was born in the Bricks
Bricks, Bricks, and shit is on in the Bricks
Come at me twisted if ya think you got the heart to
But you better be careful what you say like Sparkle

Your whole verse whack and bare no facts or logic
Smash your clique in, y'all niggas only heard tidbits

The song say It Ain't My Fault like Mystikal

Do the ladies run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah)
Do the ladies run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah)
Put it down for the bitches all across the map
All the real live bitches all across the map
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead

Do the ladies run this motherfucker?

(Hell yeah)

The Harriet Tubman of hip hop has returned baby
c'mon!

[Verse 1]
I be that bitch niggas wantin in the lab
Rhymes comin, rhymes goin like I was a dollar cab
Fingerin the man tryin to tap into his feelings
A misguided soul so ain't checkin for the lyrics
Many different players, only one hold the ball
Ghetto fabulous chick, go against the protocol
With the grittiest lingo, still such a little sweetheart
Book educated with a whole lotta street smarts
Follow me now, as I build my fanbases
Makin rappers worry like they got open cases
Harriet Thugman, y'all can see shit through
Like a whole world of people wait for Episode Two
I be the rap purist, the walking hip hop thesaurus
The innovator, spawned from Libra and Taurus
Do away cats with the same ol' whack
Lead a nation up north where the real party at
A place where we spray when our asses get older
No shots in the choke, no gettin pulled over
A place where graffiti ain't considered a crime
And your favorirte underrated MC's is primetime
A land good and fruitful, where lyrics free people
Black presidents, and all the weed legal
No rich or poor, we break bread and drink merry
Smoke a little Mary for the real visionaries",Harriet Thugman,1999
Rashia Fisher,"All my niggas y'all, Flipmode y'all
Flipmode y'all, hardcore y'all, raw shit y'all
Hardcore y'all, Flipmode y'all

All my bitches y'all, all my bitches y'all
Flipmode y'all, Flipmode y'all
Hardcore y'all, raw shit y'all
Hardcore y'all, Flipmode y'all

Never judge a nigga like the cover of a book
Fuck around and get shot back of the foot
Nigga, fall, stumble and look, nervous and shook
Dragged in the alley and book and beat down to a pulp

Shot up my cops, Dirty Harry
You stickin' me is like niggas fuckin' the Virgin Mary
Shit we carry will have you found layin' down
Somewhere damp and muddy, split your tummy
Puncture your kidney and make you piss bloody

So now I leave your body to rot
Where bitches sell they pussy for rock
Cook they coke in steamin' water, boil in a pot
Do you know niggas like us that clutter they watch
Invest in yo' block, like it or not, involvin' your pops?

You messin' wit a rhyme surgeon
Trade the GS for the excursion, heads is turnin'
Flipmode we still mergin'
Now we splurgin' in suburbans
Dirty Harriet rock the camouflage turbans

Said one for the money and two for mic check
And spit a million rhymin' words in 240 seconds
Get three to get your bitch neck and four to even the score
Graveyard shifter mister, y'all believe in the law

Flipmode like Mary Lou Retton
Suede ballet shoes steppin', do the best that I can can
Like Pointer sisters, who could join the wizard?
Talkin' outta place, I pick the knife up and cut the tongue
Right outta your mouth and fuck your life up

This for my niggas, y'all come get wit us
More raw hardcore shit just for you, you, you, you
This for my sistas, we know y'all miss us
Flipmode got raw shit just for you, you, you, you

Before all the plaques and the Source Aawards
Y'all niggas wanna dick ride, so jump aboard
It's a first class ass whippin', rampage, I ain't trippin'
Check all the magazine clippin's

Yo, I pluck pigeons, get brains in expeditions
Cause friction, every chick I stick my dick in
I'm not trustworthy, like midnight, I'm pickin'
Spliff keep it warm like wool caps to mittens

Watch for me in a new milli, kick up dust with my shoe shitty
New Jack City, wicked ways move wit me
Holla mine, in these violent times crooks bear malice
White collar crime, Columbine, we clear classes

Burn a nigga into ashes, how I mash his ass like Cassius
Finger jabs, I got it mastered, fantastic
Writin’ half ass shit, splash kids
Poke ‘em with the bassinet in the neck, graphic

Can't tell I'm from QB the way that I talk
Speakin' in tongue with six blocks callin' my dun
Bogie collapsed lung, big and small gats we brung
Bangin' your drums with hot shit and more to come

But then we manifest the truth
The niggas fight predictions from The Bible
Betrayal for niggas is suicidal
Kick swift shit niggas rock harder than Limp Bizkit
Dirty Harriet floodin' all through your district

This for my niggas, y'all come get wit us
More raw hardcore shit just for you, you, you, you
This for my sistas, we know y'all miss us
Flipmode got raw shit just for you, you, you, you

This for my niggas, y'all come get wit us

Where's my sisters?

This one's for the brothers
The brothers, the brothers
Said I be rappin' for da ladies
What's up ladies?
But this one's for da brothers
The brothers, the brothers
Yeah check it out now

Now I'm the baby in the family
And I got three siblings
Three older brothers and we trying to make a living
So we hustle and we bubble
And we coming up fast
Ain't gon' never be the same
Since mom and pops past
The oldest one, child prodigy no doubt
Every since he was a kid used to ride a bitch out
All grown up now
Nice job, nice clout
Nice wife, nice house, try-na take the right route
Treat sis like a queen brother gave me everything
Any time I got in trouble he could probably pull some strings
Walk daddy's footsteps and career same speed
Made the greatest big brother and a father to his own seed
(Uh-oh) But something happened on the job, he started snappin'
Problems with the wifee, winging out and started cappin'
Tried to turn himself in just to make things right
Ended up taking flight cause he's not the jail type

Now I got a second brother me and this one was closer
Made me a little tom boy like he was supposed to
Tearing up the place blowing weed in my face
Irresponsible to death parents stayed on his case
Probably cause he wanted to be the baby in the family
Drinking with his friends, macking up
Mommy carried me, look half way crook getting crazy on the mic
Wasn't really into rap but the shit sound tight
He used to tell me all the time
Don't wet none sis
By this time next year we gon' be dumb rich
That's when I heard the ill
My physical got killed
Just a couple of weeks after signing a record deal
Now somebody gots to bust and have to get a little tough
And on the block round the clock
Niggas ain't seen nothing
Yeah right
Never seen a brother more determined or eager
Moms and pops couldn't see it
Now we not gonna see it either

Now my last and final brother, kinda something out the norm
Some say part depressed some say part deformed
Record unclean since his early teens
In and out the youth house
Playing all the crime scenes
Early hangin' with fiends smoking all types of things
He used to chase a basketball now he chasing pipe dreams
From the door, shit was wrong undetected too long
Bugged out when he was little
Now he big that was wrong
Little too early had to kick him out the house
He just wanted some attention that's what dad was all about
He used to bust down the door
Moms cry, pops fight
Even family counseling couldn't make this shit right
Word on the street every body want to do him
>From his so-called boys to all the chickens he was screwin'
Anybody get the chance, who will probably unload?
How much longer sis got before the last brother gone
OH NO!

Try-na sound like some extra hard core, whatever, whatever
Fuck all y'all alright cause

Cheers to another thousand years

Make sure y'all stay tune to check out
These next couple of bonus tracks I left y'all with",Lessons of Today,1999
Rashia Fisher,"[Verse 1]
Knock, knock, who dat, sister from the hilltop
Wicked, wicked flows, make a nigga grill drop
Caramel complexion, Feldsburg section
Ready for whatever 'case I'm dealin with some next shit
Rhymin type scenario, niggas only fell
Stay dipped with Nike Airs, Oakleys, and pony tails
Fuckin up some pizza, overcharge my Visa
Million dollar videos, crushin with my tiza
Tell them motherfuckers, I'm tight like Ebeneezer
Scrooge, still look good without ruge
My lipstick, lil misfit, quick to dish shit
Little bit conceited, whole lot consistent
Money, money, money, how we blaze
Splittin shit three ways with me, Zee and Pace
Got bitchasses that think I sound like a dude
Flip rhymes so quick you might think I'm test tube

HOOK:
In the showdown, how it go down
Get the flow down, watch it go down
How it go down, in the showdown
Gettin closed down, watch em go down
In the showdown, how it go down
Put your dough down, watch it go down

[Verse 2]
I'm representin bitches 'round the way
We runnin up his box and we ain't gon have to pay
I'm runnin with my mens, I rock a pair of Timbs
With rhymin on the brain like scarves and hairpins
I'm tryin to see a black Benz with my back end
House on the hill with my publishin deal
Shows pay the bills, make it all connect
And do some corporate type shit, with my royalty check
Now what comes next, grab myself a Bex
After sex, I tune in to Funkmaster Flex
Then I pop up at Stretch, freestyle to death
And give a shout out to my mens like I was D-M-X
Spit rock type, hot like, jazz or funk now
Throw a spoken word or we turn into a hoedown
Tell me now 'cause that's how I ball
'Bout a hundred rhymin niggas up in the you-Haul

HOOK

[Verse 3]
Peace to all my peoples in mission
Peace to peoples with they license suspended
Peace goes out to all my hoodrat chicks
Who ain't tryin to hear shit but nicks and fat dicks
What, I rock hoods and I be good like Foxy
Then hit the sushi bars eatin akros with Saki
I'm smokin damn good and chokey black
Niggas know the pokey fat, now all my ex-boyfriends want me back
I rip shows, and sip Tequila Rose
And always be around like I was afros
y'all motherfuckers crazy, can never outblaze me
Risin to the top 'cause that's how momma raised me
Now that the message is embedded
The are-A, D-I, G-G, A gon set it
Hold up baby 'cause that's when you lost
Whole prop is our respect don't get caught up in the cross

HOOK",Showdown,1999
Rashia Fisher,"(That cool shit)
Call me conductor, I lead the way for ya
Underground vibe, status self-employed
R-A-H aka Harriet Thugman
Carry out the legacy with seed and husband
Now off with the head thingy
Watch flip to a genie
And I be a Mac like Beanie
Out the bottle, I turn thug super model
With rhymes that'll make ya have to settle for Movado
The dirtiest getting all the way live
Steady tappin' my shit, tryin' to eat while I drive
Speeding to a function to play the little actress
Three hours late and don't even know the address
Madness with the ill sexy flow
And the label spendin' g's not tryin' to let me go
Rockin' on the stage after me, you fool!
Cause I am so cool

[Carl Thomas(Rah Digga)]
Cause she's so cool, yeah oh
Money baby can't you see

I aim high beat date in December
A million motherfuckers whose face I don't remember
Next to fall with the be	-girl ball
Tight gear little cousins
The store from the mall
Rockin' hardcore to some R&B shit
Kickin' rhymes for the round-the-way heads
That I'm at peace with
Love the ice rock silver as a preference
Taking writer's credit so offer a suggestion
So bust them heads who ain't real wit it
Who don't want shit in life and can't deal with it
I see you
Frontin' like you on my side
Switch sides thanks for the ride bitch
See me on the cover, (Say what?) strike a pose
Just know after that I'm making off with the clothes
Underground rule for real, so what's the haps?
Take it back like kids who fight in playing caps
Or Jacks ?N' Ball, freestyle off the wall
Tell em don't forget the stones when they make the Digga dome
Do away with styling you ain't even found yet
Blow the mic out and ain't nothing but a sound check
Writing rhymes like you wish you could
Tight breaking em down on behalf of sisterhood
Spittin' every time use my looks as a tool
Cause I am so cool

Shit tight, down to the coochie
Yeah, check it

[And I] And I say what's tight 
cause a sista write rhymes all day and all night
Dwellin South of the Hudson, New Jerusalem
in seclusion, using fake pseudonyms [I'm true bad]
Mind travels like a skitzo on two tabs 
with doo rags hangin from my pockets
[Me] Me, the rap bitch that goes back to pediatrics
Early left rappers like you were straight vexin [So]
So recognize, I make a nigga eyes come alive 
off of five two fives; disguise the camouflage
I shoot a virus out of my spirals with mad priors
for takin mad niggaz titles!
Wetter than a resevoir; lurking in the bushes 
striking blows like Chesamar(?) code-name Hasana
Warmer than a bomber, hotter than the region of Ghana
Get loot like that Trump bitch, Ivana

[Chorus]
Now, who be writin rhymes all night
Rah Digga in tha house and plans is tight
[Tight] Peace to the ones that don't bite
Rah Digga in the house and my plans is tight

A black QUEEN, ya best believe my black jeans won't say Paco
I swing to the Vill' for some waffles and some beef falafel
Rap very tight liquor got me DIFFERENT
Dirtier than an overseas shipment of ki's
I write these TIGHT BUTTAS, creme de la GUTTAS
Call me Sheik Digga
Plotting over loops like the eight figures
Baby I'm hard, represent the feminist God 
[What?] that gets blunted - watch rhymers runneth, over
See me in the camel Range Rover 
[Chop] And I won't stop for Jake 
And keep heat by the waist for those that playa hate
[NOW] Show you the way to blow, better than I tell you
Word to my beeper and my cellu-lar [What?] Polo curls
Diggin all the rapper's shit like they go-go girls

[Chorus]

WHO THE TIGHTEST?  I rock with laryngitis
Gold's good for Midas, but I want the highest
So don't try me cause I be the bitch [I swear]
I'll leave you twisted like a thug with blonde hair
[Yeah] I blow up the spot like Dennis Scott
Go forward, your chance of defeatin me is morbid
'cause I get you open like the comin of the Pope 
when I group shit tighter than a 3 piece suit
[Peace, peace] Peace to niggaz I rhyme wit
My Outsidaz correspondents be more fluid than embalmin
[We pros] I decompose, any rapper to the bone
Down to they X and why chromosome
So SEE MY NAME tagged in bold or italics [Bow, bitch]
'cause I'll be the only one salvaged
Number one imported like Beck's
Tighter than three or more heads in a CRX

[Chorus 2X]

Tight, tight, aight?
And the plans is tight
Tight, tight.. TIGHT!
Tight, tight aight?
And the plans is tight

I battle you on yo' shit and then waste your label
Hit you wit heat sweeter than vanilla candy
Flip it type wicked like Cinderella family
(For what) For tryin to step to a Rah situation
Less rhymin years, less formal education
Gettin less spins than a BBS
Less hype in the streets and you writin even less
(Now you ain't fresh) MC's goin crazy
(Nah, you ain't a fresh) Ya'll could never out-blaze me
Less knowhow, more hoe now
Stay up out of grown folks biz 'fore I show you what broke is

Bitches on the threeway chit-chattin in pig Latin
Heads is vexed now, all the 'dro gone
Waitin and debatin for some niggas to roll on
(Come on) The kind of heads take the ghetto approach
Hard foul the opposition or strangle the coach
I be stashin marijuanna in my Dolce & Gabana
Dead em like gamma, if they don't have no manners
Call the dopest MC my little junior
Playin the game and be a coach like Tuna
Mad, what I say go, be	-girl original
Boy Wonder, Chocolate latte (Hooo!)
What the chicks say, hoes might oppose 
But most chicks happy I can rock without takin off my clothes

First and only female representin', yeah
Rah Digga comin' through you know what I'm sayin'
Uh, uh, uh, yeah like what, what

Now I'ma tell it like it ain't never been told
With the rhyme mechanism that boost me ten fold
Spend dough in pubs, sayin' no to scrubs
With the crisp deep voice I lace with overdubs

Now wassup, if by some haphazard
You see me in Rolling Stone or down the rap master
Up in the slot where you used to rock
Your shit suddenly drop and like Wall Street stop

Now, the part that thrill me, what's up with that
Cats that didn't wanna feel me, yo, what's up with that
Ha, ha, ha, ha that's fine, that's funny
Now they ass catching bricks like the fuckin', crash dummies

I'm makin', hits like the oldies, what's up wit' that
Cats be frontin', like they know me, yo, what's up wit' that
You gone say what's up and I'ma say nothin', strangers
My interest strictly record sales and tunnel bangers

'Cuz that's how shit be, what's up wit' that
The Rah D I G, yo what's up wit' that
I'm writin' rhymes lovely, what's up wit' that
And how I rep Jersey, yo what's up wit' that

I wreck shop crazy, what's up wit' that
And radio plays me, yo
You gone say what's up and I'ma say nothin' strangers
My interest strictly record sales and tunnel bangers

Verse dentin, worse than Armageddon
Worse than them kids runnin' around bomb settin'
Mind threatenin', like a couple hits of mescaline
Comin' up with documents to cover the embezzlin'

Educated, rhymes pre-meditated
Over niggas heads while they out percolatin'
Spot datin', block money I could take in
Drops on the box like I was ovulatin'

Now, for all the cats wildin', what's up wit' that
You best better throw your towel in, yo, what's up wit' that
'Cuz the real rap bitch that step foot on the scene
Will put a rapper on his ass like warm milk and Oval tine

Yeah, yeah, now what you done lately, what's up wit' that
And now you wanna hate me, yo what's up wit' that
Sweetest person, and I'm still the grimy queen
Wit' a half ounce of goodies stashed in my Tommy Jeans

'Cuz that's how shit be, what's up wit' that
The Rah D I G, yo what's up wit' that

I wreck shop crazy, what's up wit' that
And radio plays me, yo what's up wit' that
Sweetest person and I'm still the grimy queen
Wit a half ounce of goodies stashed in my Tommy Jeans

In '99 baby hold your stuff
I be that seventh sign wit' no more souls in the guff
Focus your attention as I make my mark
'Cuz I get the party jumpin' like your hoopty won't start

Got a bad attitude and a worse disposition
Corny niggas get the boot, for endangerin' the mission
Believe all you rap specimens, need to proofread my rap reference
'Fore you're left hangin' from your vest

Definitely, gettin' severance pay
While my joint moves 20,000 units every day
Official, ever since an itty bitty youngun
Before the first kiss when I didn't put my tongue in

Now, I'm kickin' all type of lingo, what's up wit' that
I make the shit into a single, ha, what's up wit' that
You gone say what's up and I'ma say nothin' papi
Go cop my shit, because you can't get a copy

'Cuz that's how shit be, what's up wit' that

Odeio vocês
De tanto que eu amo Vocês
Por isso que eu canto pro'cês
Por isso que eu choro as vez
Por isso que eu oro, reflito e eu volto outra vez

Desde os desesseis amo cantar, canto pro'cês
Se eu já pensei em parar?
Parei e voltei várias vez
A última foi esse mês

Porra, os moleque da área tão preso
E eu sinto saudade de casa
Passei pela vida ileso
Isso era o que eu pensava

Foi quando eu me vi obeso
Trancado no quarto, sozinho, depressivo
Transando com 15 mina por semana
Pra ver se assim me sentia mais vivo

Gozava e morria
Vivia de novo
Morria de novo
Tudo de novo

Pra não me jogar da sacada
Enxergar lá do além a reação desse povo

No décimo quarto andar (é)
Onde me isolei pra pensar (lá)
Onde me calei pra escutar (é)
Onde me implorei pra eu me amar

Vocês tão preocupado com o flow
Ou com quem ganhou mais dinheiro? (Não sei)
Vocês querem mais rima pro show (aham)
Eu só quero ter um filho primeiro

Cada um por si, já 'to ligeiro
Só sobrevivi porque fui guerreiro
'Cês diz que me ama mas eu 'to cabreiro
Eu quase morri, vocês nem perceberam

Vagabundo esse mundo já foi bem melhor
Lá no fundo todo mundo quer ser o maior
Me alimento com meu sangue, bebo meu suor
O mundo é louco, foda é que eu sou muito pior

Minha família em casa mexia nas minhas gaveta
Procurando droga

Valeu pela fé que 'Cê nunca botou
Quer caô, tem caô
Sou cria da minha cor
Porque eu sou dono do meu contrato

Que meu rap gera mais emprego que o site da Catho

Uns esquecem que nós é humano (vai vendo)
Temo plano pra ser feliz
Era pra eu ter sido pai há dois anos
E o Destino não quis

Deus sabe de tudo minha avó me diz
É, e eu não vou duvidar
Mas seria mentira dizer que não dói
Tipo quando meu pai também morreu e eu nem 'tava lá

Meus irmão cresceram e eu nem 'tava lá
Meu vô faleceu e eu nem 'tava lá
Deixei minha família esperar
Porque tinha esperança de ver a quebrada virar o jogo

Ferro e fogo
Sacrifício

Rashida Jones,"Starry night, an unknown creation
Written by, and from the archives of Tupac Shakur
Dedicated to the memory of Vincent Van Gogh

A creative heart obsessed with satisfying
This dorment and uncaring society
You have given them the stars at night
And you have given them bountiful bouquets of sunflowers
But for you there's only contempt
Though you pour yourself into that frame and present it so proudly
This world could not accept your masterpieces, from the heart
So on that starry night, you gave to us and you took away from us
The one thing we never acknowledged, your life

Yeah, game laid down by Q, why'knawmsayin?
Vocals by Rasheeda, fly beat by QDIII
And flows by the M-A-see why'all, Mr. M-A-see Mall

Starry night, your life
You gave to us, and took away from us
Starry night, your life
You gave to us, and took away from us

Uh, uh, watch me live my art; writing words from my soul in blood
I speak the truth on every thang I love
I'll probably sacrifice my life, to send my message through mics
It's like a war drum calling soldiers at night
It's bigger than music I spit it straight from the heart
So it's cold n dark and deep like a universe, but nah don't start
It's for ya entertainment but it's my life why all
And I can't rewind, fast forward, or press pause
But when you give your all, it's like the fans demand more
And after the tour I sit alone like before
When ya name is hot it's all love, the world is yours
But when you fall off, you get ignored

You on the cover of da magazine, flossing on the TV screen
Toastin' wit yo' champagne, playin' life like a game
Loaded in the limousine, love to hear the fans scream
Swimmin' wit the sharks now, ain't no love money king
People got they hands out but ain't nobody lendin' hands
Can you really blame dem for tryin' to get what they can?
Late night, bright lights, lust n lies
And anythang goes under the Hollywood sign
Well you might lose ya soul and who knows what you find
But go ahead main we all want to shine
But go ahead main we all want to shine

There you have it
Why'know, when I was younger I prayed, to get in this game
Why'know to hold dis microphone in my hand
I asked the man upstairs, to let me rock a crowd one day
Why'know let people out there feel the way I feel through my music
Like my homeboy Tupac did fo' sho'
And he gave that to me
But he didn't he didn't he didn't let me know
About all the shady shit that's in, in between
You and yo' dream, why'know?
See it's more than the music, I spit it from the heart
So sometime it's cold n it's dark, but it's raw
And that's how I'ma bring it to you every time, why'know?",Starry Night,2000

Everyday, everyday I have the blues
When you see me worried, baby
Because it's you I hate to lose

Oh, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Yes, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care
Speaking of bad luck and trouble
Well, you know I had my share

I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on down the line

Where there ain't nobody worried
And there ain't nobody crying",Everyday,2000
Rashied Ali,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love,2008

Rasmus Seebach,"For præcis et år siden,
Sad vi alle sammen samlet om det samme bord,
De samme samtaler startede med de samme ord.
Det er længe siden,
Godt at se dig, har du haft det godt?
Og hvad med karrieren, sig mig er der penge nok?
Vi kan det uden ad, og lytter til de samme toner,
Prøver at undgå at starte alle de samme
Diskussioner. Det' egentlig fjollet vi' skal spille alle
De roller, men sådan er det altid og der
Er noget vi lige skal komme igennem ,
Men det blir' mørkt og lygtepæle tændes over gaden,
Efter et par glas der får vi endelig brudt overfladen.
Ingen vil sige det først, men selvom
Alle kæmper er det svært at ignorere vores flok
Er blevet mindre. Der er tomme stole om bordet,
Stemmer der mangler,
En parfumeret duft der plejer at blande sig
Med de andre, året der er gået satte tydelige spor,
Og det kan ses når vi er samlet om et bord.

Og jeg vil elske dig om 1000 år, 1000 år.
Og intet aner selv om tiden går, tiden den går,
Ja jeg vil elske dig om 1000 år, 1000 år.
Du er væk fra mig, men stadig tæt på mig.

Der er gået et helt år siden du sad her sammen med os,
Svært at tro på, dit navn står jo stadig her
I min telefonbog, som om jeg bare kunne trykke på
Knappen nu og ringe op,dengang jeg havde chancen
Ved jeg godt jeg aldrig ringede nok,
Så jeg tænkte at jeg ku' skrive et brev I nat,
Som kun var dit. Fortælle dig om hvordan det er gået,
Både godt og skidt. Kan starte med at sige,
At dagen du tog afsked var smuk,
Og fuld af blomster og venner omkring dit gravsted,
Og morfar er stærk, vi ser ham knap fælde en
Tåre selvom han på mange måder ha' haft det længste år.
Camilla og min moster de har været ude af den,
Jeg tror det går lidt bedre nu, selvom de er udmattede.
Peter han forlod min mor,
Selvom det er hvad der sker så tacklede han det skidt
Og han bliver nok aldrig velkommen her,
Mette er her stadig, hende og jeg vi passer på min mor
Og igen I nat der er vi alle samlet
Om et bord.

Og jeg vil elske dig om 1000 år, 1000 år.
Og intet aner selv om tiden går, tiden den går,
Ja jeg vil elske dig om 1000 år, 1000 år.
Du er væk fra mig, men stadig tæt på mig.

Sidste gang at var samlet sådan her,
Det var I kirken da vi sagde farvel,
Og nu hvor lysene tændes og dagen går på had,
Byen sætter farten ned og roen sænker sig,
Så er det tydeligt at der er nogle ting der aldrig
Ændrer sig. På nogle måder er det som om der
Ingen tid er gået, kvinder I min familie piver stadig
Aldrig over noget, og selvom verden hviler tungt på
Deres skulderblade, sludrer de om vind og hver,
Bladrer lidt I ugeblade, sætter hinanden
Først og deres liv på standby, og noget siger mig det er
Noget de har lært af dig.
Året der er gået satte tydelige spor,
Men du skal vide vi stadig samles om et bord

Og jeg vil elske dig om 1000 år, 1000 år.
Og intet aner selv om tiden går, tiden den går,
Ja jeg vil elske dig om 1000 år, 1000.

Nej nej.

Det passede mig perfekt.
I byen med drengene, og vi snakker om de andre piger,
Men det er, som om det keder mig.
Du skulle jo bare være tidsfordriv,

Men pludselig kan jeg ikke engang føre en helt almindelig samtale,
Uden at snakke om dig.

Rasputina,"The similarities in situation between the Donner Party and the colonial Pilgrims is both appalling, frightening, and incomplete. 
In both cases, you'll find one: a fairly large group of ill-prepared greenhorns, pitting themselves against nature and each other, two: an insufficient willingness to endure the very real hardships of frontiering, and three: coincidental misfortune at every turn. Number three: coincidental misfortune at EVERY TURN. 
The disasters of both camps were initially brought about by departure delay-inducing inertia, which caused our heroes to begin their journeys at absolutely retarded times weather-wise. 
If fantasy is the refuge of the frightened man, and a castle in the air is safe harbor for a foolish few, just imagine: 
Living in a hut buried twelve feet below the snow, where the sight and smell of the scattered carcasses of loved ones at your feet, is...the lay of the land. Just another day.
I would like to propose that cannibalism was indeed rampant among America's earliest settlers: the Pilgrims.

The Pilgrims. For what does ""settler"" imply, if not the willingness to settle? The willingness to settle for a meal of human flesh if my thoughts on the subject are to believed.

Is absolutely huge and enormously dangerous
We who rescue others,
Lovers, sons and mothers
Now we feel like the orphans ourselves

On the other side a rushing creek
Laid in Flemish bond
Three stories high, a fortress of brick
This was a place of employ

But it still hurts
When I think of the privileged captivity
Of the mill girl like me
Kept sequestered
Only seen on a rope bridge
That hangs high over the stream

We are kept like galley slaves
While strangers decorate our father's graves
A dark secret of this river, this creek
This stream, oh what does it mean?

Her collection of two hundred and twenty-five smiles

Shall I be kind or cruel or fake?
Shall I now shed a tear?

You can see them up in the windows of the factory
Any night of the week
Like beautifully-gowned wax figures on display
with the loveliest eyes you've ever seen
Squinting to baste the flouts
Basting underskirts as big as wagon wheels
Stabbing feelings with a needle
Do you like how that feels?

Oh they all try,
To catch my eye and show me what they're made of,

I know that they're old,
I know that an old star has a soul,

When I die,
A laser beam sent back a box for you,
And tucked inside,

Look above you know where I reside,

That they had unearthed each other,
And the scars endured,
Because the stars alive in her,

On an eyelash,

It's still getting the best of me,

To communicate, this little girl, she chirps like a bird

When she's not understood she starts to get real angry
So she waves her hands around just like they were her wings

Was it wind in the trees or the Snow Hen's moans?

You cunt, I'm not a queer
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
And each and every highway
And yet, much more than this

I'll see it through with no devotion

Be careful along the highway

I´m sure you knew
When there was but but
Fucking else to do
But through it all,
When there was doubt
I shot it up or kicked it out
I faced the wall, and the wall
And did it my way.
Knocked out in bed last night
I´ve had my fill, my share of looting
And now, the tears subside
I find it all so amusing 
To think, I killed a cat
And may I say, oh no, not their way
But no, oh no, not me
I did it my way

What has he got
When he finds out that he cannot
Say the things he truly thinks
But only the words,
Not what he feels

Y con su odio atacó, hasta que el hada cayó

Las noches el mago buscando el poder
Que devolviera a su hada
Su amor, su mirada tan dulce de ayer

Buscando la forma de recuperar
A la mujer que aquel día
En medio del bosque por fin pudo amar

Ratcat,"Me and my girl were thinking on what to do,
She said ""lets go swimming.""
So we walked down the shore,
And watched the waves come in.
I didn't know then, now what I'm telling you.
Don't go in the water, because I am so afraid.
She took all her clothes off, and she went swimming
In the water up to her pretty neck.
I stood on the shore,
And watched her swim around.
The next thing I knew she was going down.
I wish she'd listened to me.
Don't go in the water, because I am so afraid.

A coughing and a sputtering,
Right in front of my face.

Oh when it rains it really pours.

I am drowning in such sweet surrender,
and you sing me a lulaby.

I used to shit on NYU kids, soused after dark
To the point they be like ""again this little fart had to start""
Seems random, like Stanford transplanted to the fountain and the arch
Infecting the apple, a cancer in its heart
Why'd you make a campus out the park?
If it keeps spreading, It'll be deaded
Panting and parched
How you supposed to be handsome and harsh?
How you supposed to be standing for New York?
Dismantling New York?
The apple is rot, The grapple is caught
Had to free that
So instead we would rap at West 4th
For weed dealers, who could see clearer, that we realer
Offer to hustle for 'em, rather just bust it for em
Is selling swell? Do you earn well?
Are you in the Pelle Pel? Or the Marm shell?
Same place you hear the devil yell
With the churchs bell
Everyone's a medic, well like to burn L's
Everyone give credit, hell Let these words sell
Wanna hear and epic tale
Its Wiki Virgil
Not the trojan in my pocket
Or in my wallet Or on my cock, its
The trojan in my heart, its
The lost souls that start Rome
Let's start home

Summer summer decayed away

Tourists came, try to escape, admire the place, visit the Empire State
I prefer a roof, stoop, fire escape
348 where I would have stayed
If I was too high for the train, walk blocks
Some where killers have been slain
Others where killing have been made
Buildings have been raised
There ain't no block the same that's chilling in the maze
Thinking back on second grade, thinking that second plane
More telling, over heard my uncle telling his day
Rememberin' what came
People melting, swelling my brain
Yet remain, compelling to maintain
But got these grimey cats selling their cane
To shorty like a twelfth of their age
I ain't tyring to, threaten your ways
Judge you or get in debates
But i'm spitting so i get to explain
I don't veto votes, I veto coke
I don't really fucks with it
Seen too many bitches stuck with it
If i'm bout to get sucked with it
Duck quicker than Quidditch
Land on a blunt and i'm with it
Y'all just different digits, nah
We whole numbers ideas is holistic
Whole numbers tend to come from cold tundras
But its no wonder, a sweat box when arose summer

The beast, the trees, the spore, the man, the rest
Rotten buffaloes on the prairie, no not the pain

If all beasts were gone, life as one
Man would die from a great longing to sing
Cling to calls and fallen wings
Up to me, I'd spring to spring and fling this bling

Mixed with the gritty and gross, I pity the

Wrists carved up, from center street souls
Whose scars won’t shut, no scars won’t shut!

Type to lick ya tears off, poke ya gut and such
Now who’s stuck? And where’s my luck?
Barged baxter in bayard boom, where’s my buck?
You wouldn't last long on Lennox, you scared to come up
But you need to be as scared of the come up
When you need to be shootin' shoats and saving the young pups
Torrid heat, Time Square post let it erupt
We’re bashing and barking like, dogs in the fog
Down the South, slow draws, haggard hogs
I can feel ya hunger baby, scribble and make ya starve
Taught you 'bout tatted walls, scratched and scattered scrawls
Night you like to breathe but you talk timid towards tamed with awe
And tongues rip through holes with pockets to draws

Take it as a simple world, world, world
Guess I’m spatting off like hell, now what the hell

Sittin' in ya cell thinkin' to yourself, ""how'd I fail""
Well, why’d I wail?

I see the global orbits of time warps and forests of darkness before us
Orchids turnin' grey from what I bring out of my medical tray
Perpetuate Prevail Wonder and the alphabet is the predator and the prey
Don't let 'em walk away, broken in the bone yard, smokin' in the boys room
Spoken in the pattern that consumes you like a vacuum
The war ship I dock is the property of His Worship,
It's awkward when we talk about morbid conditions,
Vividly described from this side of the lie detector
Siphon nectar from the blossom, natural toxin, approach with caution
Blow flames in blue light they dance on the oxygen
Lost again in space? Allow us to demonstrate how it all generates
From motors to engines, machine guns to hand grenades, renegades of vengeance

I have the omnipotent gift to lift the crowd, without havin' to speak too loud
I'm confident my crew can keep them out when I'm...

On a corner in the cold all night

Even your soul ain't got a dime
You're doin' hard time, hard time

Outta luck, can't make a buck
Try to run but you're stuck
In the muck of your shattered life
Like a knife through your heart tears you apart
You got no one to hold but
Your memories through the night
And you can't see the light

You're doin' hard time

Even your soul ain't got a dime

Nos vamos poniendo viejos
Yo el amor
No lo reflejo como ayer

En cada conversación
Cada beso cada abrazo
Se impone siempre un pedazo
De razón

Vamos viviendo
Viendo las horas
Que van pasando
Las viejas discusiones

Se van perdiendo
Entre las razones
Porque años atrás
Tomar tú mano

Robarte un beso
Sin forzar el momento
Hacía parte de una verdad

Porque el tiempo pasa
Nos vamos poniendo viejos
Yo el amor
No lo reflejo como ayer

En cada conversación
Cada beso cada abrazo
Se impone siempre un pedazo
De razón

A todo dices que sí
A nada digo que no
Para poder construir
Esta tremenda armonía
Que pone viejo los corazones

Porque el tiempo pasa
Nos vamos poniendo viejos

No lo reflejo como ayer

Cada beso cada abrazo
Se impone siempre un pedazo

Why is no-

See him Monday, but by Monday I'll be floating in the Hudson with

Verás que nada es amor

De todos los timbres que vos apretás
Buscando un pecho fraterno
Para morir abrazao

Cuando te dejen tirao
Después de cinchar
Lo mismo que a mí

Cuando manyés que a tu lado
Se prueban la ropa
Que vas a dejar

Te acordarás de este otario
Que un día, cansado
Se puso a ladrar

I found it at Amoeba it's the Green CD
Bill: No doubt kid, what's your name?
Lars: It's MC Lars
Bill: Word, Howie Abrams is a mutual friend of ours
He played me your joint Lars: What'd you think of it?
Bill: I think it's bugged out, it's hot
Lars: Thanks, I like your last record a lot. Your lyrics are
Graphic, much like your brother Necro, is he psycho?
Bill: I don't know, it really depends though
He's Psychological, half psycho, half logical,
Half businessman, half put-them-in-the-hospital
Lars: Business and art, there's a very fine line
There's the person that you are
And the person when you rhyme
But the best MC's bring both intertwined
Bill: I agree, that's when the best of both worlds collide
When the realness pops off one time for your mind,
And your words cause the people in the crowd to riot

CHORUS
As many places I've been. As many people I've met
As many haters I've dissed. There's people that I respect
As many times as I've failed. As many times as I've won
As many lives as I touch. The dialogue has begun

Bill: I grew up on heavy metal and hip-hop
The energy was the same to me, it was insane to me
It made me want to rage against the machine
Pick up a guitar and scream into the mic like Run-DMC
Lars: Nine Inch Nails, Primus, “Weird Al,” and King Missile
Influenced me like a postmodern epistle
Geeked out on my Performa looping digital drums
Playing rock guitar in punk bands just for fun
Who's your favorite rapper? Bill: Rakim, G Rap and Kane
KRS, EPMD, NWA, Public Enemy, Shante and LL Cool J
I could keep naming MC's all day,
What type of metal stuff you listen to?
Lars: Old school Slayer CD's, Biohazard and
Bile were the bands for me
The first time that I ever heard Chuck D
Was the Anthrax CD, “Attack of the Killer B's”… chorus!

REPEAT CHORUS
Lars: So Bill, what's your take on censorship?
Politicians on a church/state fusion tip?
Bill: I speaks my mind while kids I went to high school with
Bleed on the sands of Kabul hit, it's bullshit,
Lars what you think of it?
Lars: Out in Iraq, a lack of dialogue
Between the people is whack!
Bill: In fact I speak militant like Black Panthers
These gas prices got my people
With seeds having to gank pampers
Lars: The answer is not plutocracy.
The answers is not hypocrisy,
The answers is true democracy
Bill: The answer is the dialogue constantly

Raul Malo,"Carlos Saragosa left his home in Casas Grandes
When the moon was full
He had no money in his pocket 
Just a locket of his sister framed in Gold
He headed for el Sueco 
Stole a rooster named Gallo Del Cielo
Then he crossed the Rio Grande
With that roosted nestled deep within his arm

Gallo Del Cielo was a warrior born in heaven
So the legends say
His wings they had been broken 
He had one eye rollin crazy in his head
He'd fought a hundred fights
And the legends say that one night near El Sueco 
He fought Cielo seven times 
Seven times he left brave roosters dead

Hola my Teresa 
I'm thinkin of you now in San Antonio
I have 27 dollars 
And the good luck of your picture framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all 
On the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
Then I'll return to buy the land 
Pancho Villa stole from father long ago

Outside of San Diego 
In the Onion fields of Paco Monte Verde
The Pride of San Diego 
Lay sleeping on a fancy bed of silk
And they laughed when Saragosa
Pulled the one-eyed Del Cielo from beneath his coat
But they cried when Saragosa  
Walked away with a thousand dollar bill

Hola my Teresa 
I'm thinkin of you now in Santa Barbara
I have 27 dollars 
And the good luck of your picture framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all 
On the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
Then I'll return to buy the land 
Pancho Villa stole from father long ago

Now the moon has gone to hiding
And the lantern light spills shadows on the fighting sand
A wicked black named Zorro faces Del Cielo in the sand
And Carlos Saragosa fears the tiny crack 
That runs across his roosters beak
And he fears that he has lost 
The 50,000 dollars riding on the fight

Hola my Teresa 
I'm thinkin of you now in Santa Clara
The money's on the table 
I'm holding now your good luck framed in gold
Everything we dream of 
Is riding on the spurs of Del Cielo
Then I'll return to buy the land 
Villa stole from father long ago

The signal it was given
And the roosters rose together far above the sand
Gallo Del Cielo sunk a gaff into Zorro's shiny breast
They were separated quickly
But they rose and fought each other time and time again
And the legends all agreed
That Gallo Del Cielo fought the best

But then the screams of Saragosa
Filled the night outside the town of Santa Clara
As the beak of Del Cielo 
Lay broken like a shell within his hand
And they say that Saragosa 
Screamed a curse upon the bones of Pancho Villa
As Zorro rose up one more time
And drove Del Cielo in the sand

Hola my Teresa 
I'm thinkin of you now in San Francisco
I have no money in my pocket 
And no longer have your good luck framed in gold
I buried it last evening 
With the bones of my beloved Del Cielo
I will not return to buy the land
That Villa stole long ago

Do the rivers still run muddy
Outside of my beloved Casas Grandes
Does the scar upon my brother's face
Turn red when he hears mention of my name
And do the people of El Sueco
Still curse the theft of Gallo Del Cielo
Tell my family not to worry 
I will not return to cause them shame",Gallo del Cielo,1995

It's a yum-yummy world, made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late
In winter it's a marshmallow world

The world is your snowball, see how it grows
That's how it goes whenever it snows
The world is your snowball just for a song
Get out and roll it along

It's a marshmallow world in the winter
When the snow comes to cover the ground
It's the time for play, it's a whipped cream day
We wait for it all year 'round

Those marshmallow clouds being friendly
In the arms of the evergreen trees
And the sun is red like a pumpkin's head
It's shining, so your nose won't freeze

The world is your snowball, see how it grows
That's how it goes whenever it snows
The world is your snowball just for a song
Get out and roll it along

It's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late
In winter it's a marsh, in winter it's a marsh
In winter it's a marshmallow world

Raul Malo,"If I should live in the past would you think less of me
There's a chance those memories will last for an eternity
I just keep waiting, perhaps even hating to find you gone
How could something so right turn out so wrong?

I still remember the nights in the warm summer breeze
And the words of love we confessed that came out with ease
There was nary a lie, there were tears barely cried, maybe one or two
Now I spend all my time crying for you

This crying for you never ends if tomorrow it happens again
It's not that I'm helpless, I just can't help crying for you
It's sad that we've falling apart, tears pouring down in the dark
I know it's all over but I just keep crying for you

I just keep waiting perhaps even hating to find you gone

It simply has no rules
I never took the time or paid it any mind
It didn't matter who win or lose

Ever since I met you things have changed
Cloudy skies have brighter days
Even fate has turned my way
I know that I would be a fool not to bet it all on you
And let the chips fall where they may

Since I have you close to me

Lovers take their vows, many times I've wondered how
Say those words so easily
Did that happiness hide their loneliness
With the things I couldn't see

Think he found the one he needs
But I don't question why, I just believe
That I found a love that's meant to be

Raul Midón,"Whenever I am near to you,
I don't know quite what to do.
My body starts shaking.
Baby I'm not faking.

If you would turn your eyes to me,
It would be so clear to see,
That I'm not mistaken.
And I'm hoping that you'll see

What we'll say upon that special day
With our hearts is more than words can say
You'll be in these arms of mine eternally

And I have waited all my life for you
But I didn't know it.
I have waited all my life for you,
But I didn't know it.

It's not the way you look at me,
Or your personality.
It's deeper than these things
And it's been going on so long.
You give your love so naturally
You go to my heart you see
You're all I'm dreaming
Baby we were meant to be.

What we'll say upon this special day
With our hearts is more than words can say
Now you're in these arms of mine eternally

And I have waited all my life for you
But I didn't know it.
I have waited all my life for you,
But I didn't know it.

I'll get along without the moon
I'll get along without the stars
I'll get along without the rainbows in the sky
I'll get along without the joy
That will surely fill my heart
When I can look in to your eyes
Without love I can't survive

And I have waited all my life for you
But I didn't know it.

Por isso a nostalgia eu tô curtindo sem querer
Porque está faltando alguma coisa acontecer
Mamãe já ouve Beatles
Papai já deslumbrou
Com meu cabelo grande
Eu fiquei contra o que eu já sou

Eu vou fazer o que eu gosto
É mãe com os Beatles e o pai falô
Logo então eu fiquei contra o que eu já sou
O rock hoje em dia já mudou, virou outra coisa
É por isso que eu corto o cabelo

Na curva do futuro muito carro capotou
Talvez por causa disso é que a estrada ali parou
Porém, atrás da curva
Perigosa eu sei que existe
Alguma coisa nova
Mais vibrante e menos triste

Eu vou fazer o que eu gosto
Atrás da curva do perigo existe
Alguma coisa bem mais nova e menos triste",A Verdade Sobre a Nostalgia,1975
Raul Seixas,"No lixo dos quintais
Na mesa do café
No amor dos carnavais
Na mão, no pé, oh
Tu estás, tu estás
No tapa e no perdão
No ódio e na oração

Teu nome é Yemanjah (Yemanjah)
E é Virgem Maria
É Glória e é Cecília
Na noite fria
Oh, minha mãe
Minha filha tu és qualquer mulher
Mulher em qualquer dia

Bastou o teu olhar (Teu olhar)
Pra me calar a voz
De onde está você
Rogai por nós
Ooh, ooh!
Minha mãe, minha mãe
Me ensina a segurar
A barra de te amar

Não estou cantando só
Cantamos todos nós
Mas cada um nasceu
Com a sua voz,
Ooooh, Ooooh!
Pra dizer, pra falar
De forma diferente
O que todo mundo sente

Segure a minha mão
Quando ela fraquejar
E não deixe a solidão
Me assustar
Ooooh, Ooooh!

Minha mãe, nossa mãe
E mata minha fome
Nas letras do teu nome
Ooooh, Ooooh!

Minha mãe, nossa mãe

Raul Seixas,"Nada tão belo como uma criança dormindo
Nem tão profundo como dormir sem sonhar
Nem tão antigo como o sonho dos teus olhos
Nem tão distante como a hora de acordar

Dorme enquanto teu pai faz músicas
Que é a forma dele rezar
Todos os sonhos na realidade
São verdades, se eu puder cantar

Você chora quando tem fome
Mas vem logo uma mamadeira
Amanhã se você chorar
Vai chorar tua vida inteira

Fiz meu rumo por essa terra
Entre o fogo que o amor consome
Eu lutei mas perdi a guerra
Eu só posso te dar meu nome",Cantiga de Ninar,1976
Raul Seixas,"Eu sei que determinada rua que eu já passei
Não tornará a ouvir o som dos meus passos
Tem uma revista que eu guardo há muitos anos
E que nunca mais eu vou abrir.
Cada vez que eu me despeço de uma pessoa
Pode ser que essa pessoa esteja me vendo pela última vez
A morte, surda, caminha ao meu lado
E eu não sei em que esquina ela vai me beijar

Com que rosto ela virá?
Será que ela vai deixar eu acabar o que eu tenho que fazer?
Ou será que ela vai me pegar no meio do copo de uísque?
Na música que eu deixei para compor amanhã?
Será que ela vai esperar eu apagar o cigarro no cinzeiro?
Virá antes de eu encontrar a mulher, a mulher que me foi destinada,
E que está em algum lugar me esperando
Embora eu ainda não a conheça?

Vou te encontrar vestida de cetim
Pois em qualquer lugar esperas só por mim
E no teu beijo provar o gosto estranho
Que eu quero e não desejo, mas tenho que encontrar
Vem, mas demore a chegar
Eu te detesto e amo morte, morte, morte
Que talvez seja o segredo desta vida
Morte, morte, morte que talvez seja o segredo desta vida

Qual será a forma da minha morte?
Uma das tantas coisas que eu não escolhi na vida
Existem tantas
Um acidente de carro
O coração que se recusa abater no próximo minuto
A anestesia mal aplicada
A vida mal vivida, a ferida mal curada, a dor já envelhecida
O câncer já espalhado e ainda escondido, ou até, quem sabe
Um escorregão idiota, num dia de sol, a cabeça no meio-fio

Oh morte, tu que és tão forte
Que matas o gato, o rato e o homem
Vista-se com a tua mais bela roupa quando vieres me buscar
Que meu corpo seja cremado e que minhas cinzas alimentem a erva
E que a erva alimente outro homem como eu
Porque eu continuarei neste homem
Nos meus filhos, na palavra rude
Que eu disse para alguém que não gostava
E até no uísque que eu não terminei de beber aquela noite

Vou te encontrar vestida de cetim,
Pois em qualquer lugar esperas só por mim
E no teu beijo provar o gosto estranho que eu quero e não desejo
Mas tenho que encontrar
Vem, mas demore a chegar
Eu te detesto e amo morte, morte, morte
Que talvez seja o segredo desta vida
Morte, morte, morte que talvez seja o segredo desta vida",Canto Para Minha Morte,1976
Raul Seixas,"Hoje é o dia da saudade
Hoje é feriado

Hoje eu vou beber para celebrar
O aniversário do seu Gaspar
Deve ter festa em algum lugar

Hoje não tem aula pra garotada
Velhas de varizes na calçada

Raul Seixas,"O que que você quer ser quando você crescer?
Aguma coisa importante
Um cara muito brilhante
Quando você crescer
Não adianta, perguntas não valem nada
É sempre a mesma jogada
Um emprego e uma namorada
Quando você crescer
E cada vez é mais difícil de vencer
Pra quem nasceu pra perder
Pra quem não é importante
É bem melhor
Sonhar, do que conseguir
Ficar em vez de partir
Melhor uma esposa ao invés de uma amante
Uma casinha, um carro à prestação
Saber de cor a lição, que no
Que no bar não se cospe no chão, nego
Quando você crescer
Alguns amigos da mesma repartição
Durante o fim-de-semana
Se vai mais tarde pra cama
Quando você crescer
E no subúrbio, com flores na sua janela
Você sorri para ela
E dando um beijo lhe diz
Felicidade
É uma casa pequenina
E amar uma menina
E não ligar pro que se diz
Belo casal que paga as contas direito
Bem comportado no leito
Mesmo que doa no peito
Sim
Quando você crescer
E o futebol te faz pensar que no jogo
Você é muito importante
Pois o gol é o seu grande instante
Quando você crescer
Um cafézinho mostrando o filho pra vó
Sentindo o apoio dos pais
Achando que não está, só
Quando você crescer
Quando você crescer
Quando você crescer",Quando Boce Crescer,1976

Raul Seixas,"Quando eu morri em Dezembro
De mil novecentos e setenta e dois
Esperava ressuscitar e juntar os pedaços

Da minha cabeça
Um tempo depois um psiquiatra disse
Que eu forçasse a barra
E me esforçasse pra voltar à vida
E eu parei de tomar ácido lisérgico
E fiquei quieto lambendo minha própria ferida
Sem saber se era crime ou castigo

E se havia outro cordão no meu umbigo
Pra de novo arrebentar
Pois eu fui puxado à ferro
Arrancado do útero materno
E apanhei pra poder chorar
Quando eu morri suando frio
Vi Jimi Hendrix tocando nuvens distorcidas
Eu nem consegui falar
E depois por um momento
O céu virou fragmento do inferno
Em que eu tive que entrar
Eu sentia tanto medo, só queria dormir cedo

Pra noite passar depressa
E não poder me agarrar
Noites de garras de aço
Me cortavam em mil pedaços
E no outro dia eu tinha que me remendar
E se a vida pede a morte
Talvez seja muita sorte eu ainda estar aqui
E a cada beijo do desejo
Eu me entorpeço e me esqueço
De tudo que eu ainda não entendi",Qundo Eu Morri,1989

Eu só queria dizer
Que não importa o sotaque

Já não lembra de onde foi que partiu
Tantos desejos soprados pelo vento

E em troca recebeu os pedaços
Cacos de vida de uma vida inteira

E não chegou a lugar nenhum

Pra fazer sucesso
Pra vender disco

Que reclamar

E já passou tanto janeiro
Mas se todos gostam
Eu vou voltar

De pijama porque tem
Visita estranha na sala
Aí eu pego e passo
A vista no jornal

Um piloto rouba um ""mig""
Gelo em Marte, diz a Viking
Mas no entanto
Não há galinha em meu quintal
Compro móveis estofados
Me aposento com saúde
Pela assistência social

Dois problemas se misturam
A verdade do Universo
A prestação que vai vencer
Entro com a garrafa
De bebida enrustida
Porque minha mulher
Não pode ver

Ligo o rádio
E ouço um chato
Que me grita nos ouvidos
Pare o mundo
Que eu quero descer

Olhos os livros
Na minha estante
Que nada dizem
De importante
Servem só prá quem
Não sabe ler

E a empregada
Me bate à porta
Me explicando
Que tá toda torta
E já que não sabe
O que vai dá prá mim comer

Falam em nuvens passageiras
Mandam ver qualquer besteira
E eu não tenho nada
Prá escolher

E renitente
Eu não tô aqui
Prá me queixar
E nem sou apenas o cantor

Que eu já passei
Por Elvis Presley
Imitei Mr. Bob Dylan, you know
Eu já cansei de ver
O Sol se pôr

Agora eu sou apenas
Um latino-americano
Que não tem cheiro
Nem sabor

E as perguntas continuam
Sempre as mesmas
Quem eu sou?
Da onde venho?
E aonde vou, dá?

E todo mundo explica tudo
Como a luz acende
Como um avião pode voar
Ao meu lado um dicionário
Cheio de palavras
Que eu sei que nunca vou usar

Mas agora eu também resolvi
Dar uma queixadinha
Porque eu sou um rapaz
Latino-americano
Que também sabe
Se lamentar

Mas hoje eu vou lhe mostrar

Que eu sou a a luz das estrelas

Eu sou o medo do fraco
A força da imaginação
O blefe do jogador

Eu sou a beira do abismo
Eu sou o tudo e o nada

Perguntas não vão lhe mostrar
Que eu sou feito da terra
Do fogo, da água e do ar

Mas não sabe se é bom ou ruim
Mas saiba que eu estou em você
Mas você não está em mim

Raul Seixas,"Reformulation, rearrange the game you're in
Let us start from the begin

With confidence you'll win

'Cause Jesus Christ, man
Won't be coming back no more
He set up his proper laws
And you know well that he did
Just what he should have done

As I was growing
And my hair was getting longer
I was feeling so much stronger
I could carry my guitar, and I knew
That I could sing

But hey, how could I know?
The wind would blow with the rain
Hey, how could I see
What would they make out of me?

When I was little
Used to dream I was a king
Now they taught me how to sing
Think I've got most everything
I could ever ask for

You've got your pencil, your guitar
Your amplifier
Searching for the lousy liars
You will set this world on fire
Like Nero did to Rome, yeah!

But hey, how could I know
My eyes could see in the dark?
Hey, don't press on me
I'm not to blame can't you see?

Raul Seixas,"Se esse amor
Ficar entre nós dois
Vai ser tão pobre amor
Vai se gastar

Se eu te amo e tu me amas
Um amor a dois profana
O amor de todos os mortais
Porque quem gosta de maçã
Irá gostar de todas
Porque todas são iguais

Se eu te amo e tu me amas
E outro vem quando tu chamas
Como poderei te condenar?
Infinita tua beleza
Como podes ficar presa
Que nem santa num altar?

Quando eu te escolhi
Para morar junto de mim
Eu quis ser tua alma
Ter seu corpo, tudo enfim
Mas compreendi
Que além de dois existem mais

Amor só dura em liberdade
O ciúme é só vaidade
Sofro, mas eu vou te libertar
O que é que eu quero
Se eu te privo
Do que eu mais venero?
Que é a beleza de deitar

Que você pensa que eu sou escravo
Dizendo que eu sou seu marido

Dos amores que a vida me trouxe
E eu não pude viver

Eu perdi o meu medo
Meu medo, meu medo da chuva
Pois a chuva voltando pra terra
Traz coisas do ar
Aprendi o segredo
O segredo, o segredo da vida
Vendo as pedras que choram sozinhas
No mesmo lugar

Eu não posso entender
Tanta gente aceitando a mentira
De que os sonhos desfazem
Aquilo que o padre falou
Porque quando eu jurei
Meu amor eu traí a mim mesmo
Hoje eu sei que ninguém nesse mundo
É feliz tendo amado uma vez
Uma vez

Eu perdi o meu medo
Meu medo, meu medo da chuva

Raul Seixas,"There comes the train
From beyond the blue hills, comes the train
Huff and puff over rails

Here comes the train
Burning coal of the ages and also the words
Of their sages

Look! It's the train
It comes huffing and puffing and coughing
And calling, ""Hey man!""

See, it's the train
You just leave back your luggage
You need but your courage, amen

Who's gonna cry?
Who's gonna stay?
Who's gonna laugh
Going my way?

For the magic train's a comin'
Look, it's drawin' into the station
All the livin' are within
The chosen ones in this nation, oh, in this nation

Look, look, the sky
It is not the one sky that you knew
Can't you fathom the why?

Look, see the sky
See the clouds that are blowing
A glowing, can't you hear the sign?

Listen! Here's the sign
As it grows into trumpets
Beasts and strumpets, come, try

God in the sky
Skimming clouds of the atoms
Of dangers and Adam, oh my

Look at the evil
Kissing good and both bowing
And sewing their way for the train

Pois você é minha querida
E por você eu sinto calor
Aquele seu chaveiro escrito ""love""
Ainda hoje me comove
Me causando imensa dor, dor!

Do dia em que você entrou num bode
Quebrou minha vitrola e minha coleção
De Pink Floyd

Eu sei que eu não vou ficar aqui sozinho
Pois eu sei que existe um careta
Um careta em meu caminho, ah

Nada me interessa nesse instante
Nem o Flávio Cavalcanti
Que ao teu lado eu curtia na TV, na TV

Nessa sala hoje eu peço arrego
Não tenho paz, nem tenho sossego
Hoje eu vivo somente a sofrer! A sofrer!

E até! Até o filme que eu vejo em cartaz
Conta nossa história e por isso
E por isso eu sofro muito mais

Eu sei que dia a dia aumenta o meu desejo
E não tem Pepsi-Cola que sacie
A delícia dos teus beijos, ah

Quando eu me declarava você ria
E no auge da minha agonia
Eu citava Shakespeare

Não posso sentir cheiro de lasanha
Me lembro logo das casas da banha
Onde íamos nos divertir, divertir!

Mas hoje o meu Samsui Garrard Gradiente
Só toca mesmo embalo quente
Pra lembrar do teu calor
Então eu vou ter com a moçada lá do Pier
Mas pra eles é careta se alguém
Se alguém fala de amor, ah!

Numa aula de energia

Raul Seixas,"Eu devia estar contente porque eu tenho um emprego
Sou o dito cidadão respeitável e ganho quatro mil cruzeiros por mês
Eu devia agradecer ao Senhor
Por ter tido sucesso na vida como artista
Eu devia estar feliz porque consegui comprar um Corcel 73
Eu devia estar alegre e satisfeito por morar em Ipanema
Depois de ter passado fome por dois anos
Aqui na cidade maravilhosa
Eu devia estar sorrindo e orgulhoso por ter finalmente vencido na vida
Mas eu acho isso uma grande piada e um tanto quanto perigosa

Eu devia estar contente por ter conseguido tudo o que eu quis
Mas confesso, abestalhado, que eu estou decepcionado
Por que foi tão fácil conseguir e agora eu me pergunto: e daí?
Eu tenho uma porção de coisas grandes pra conquistar
E eu não posso ficar aí parado

Eu devia estar feliz pelo Senhor ter me concedido o domingo
Pra ir com a família no jardim zoológico dar pipocas aos macacos
Ah, mas que sujeito chato sou eu que não acha nada engraçado
Macaco, praia, carro, jornal, tobogã, eu acho tudo isso um saco

É você olhar no espelho, se sentir um grandesíssimo idiota
Saber que é humano, ridículo, limitado
E que só usa 10% de sua cabeça animal
E você ainda acredita que é um doutor, padre ou policial
Que está contribuindo com sua parte
Para nosso belo quadro social

Eu é que não me sento no trono de um apartamento
Com a boca escancarada, cheia de dentes, esperando a morte chegar

Vai subir
O preço do horror",Dentadura Postiça,2004
Raul Seixas,"É fim de mês, é fim de mês, é fim de mês
É fim de mês, é fim de mês!

Eu já paguei a conta do meu telefone
Eu já paguei por eu falar e já paguei por eu ouvir
Eu já paguei a luz, o gás, o apartamento
Kitnet de um quarto que eu comprei a prestação
Pela caixa federal, au, au, au
Eu não sou cachorro não (não, não, não)!
Eu liquidei a prestação do paletó, do meu sapato, da camisa
Que eu comprei pra domingar com o meu amor
Lá no cristo redentor, ela gostou (oh!) e mergulhou (oh!)
E o fim de mês vem outra vez!

Eu já paguei o peg-pag, meu pecado
Mais a conta do rosário que eu comprei pra mim rezar Ave Maria
Eu também sou filho de Deus
Se eu não rezar eu não vou pro céu
Céu, céu, céu
Já fui pantera, já fui hippie, beatnik
Tinha o símbolo da paz pendurado no pescoço
Porque nego disse a mim que era o caminho da salvação
Já fui católico, budista, protestante
Tenho livros na estante, todos tem explicação
Mas não achei! Eu procurei!
Pra você ver que procurei
Eu procurei fumar cigarro Hollywood
Que a televisão me diz que é o cigarro do sucesso
Eu sou sucesso! Eu sou sucesso!
No posto esso encho o tanque do meu carrinho
Bebo em troca meu cafezinho, cortesia da matriz
""There's a tiger no chassis""

Do fim do mês, do fim de mês
Do fim de mês eu já sou freguês!
Eu já paguei o meu pecado na capela
Sob a luz de sete velas que eu comprei pro meu Senhor do Bonfim, olhai por mim!

Tô terminando a prestação do meu buraco, do
Meu lugar no cemitério pra não me preocupar
De não mais ter onde morrer
Ainda bem que no mês que vem
Posso morrer, já tenho o meu tumbão, o meu tumbão!

Eu consultei e acreditei no velho papo do tal psiquiatra
Que te ensina como é que você vive alegremente
Acomodado e conformado de pagar tudo calado
Ser bancário ou empregado sem jamais se aborrecer
Ele só quer, só pensa em adaptar
Na profissão seu dever é adaptar
Ele só quer, só pensa em adaptar
Na profissão seu dever é adaptar

Eu já paguei a prestação da geladeira
Do açougue fedorento que me vende carne podre
Que eu tenho que comer
Que engolir sem vomitar
Quando às vezes desconfio
Se é gato, jegue ou mula
Aquele talho de acém que eu comprei pra minha patroa
Pra ela não me apoquentar

E o fim de mês vem outra vez",É Fim de Mês,2004
Raul Seixas,"Você tão calada e eu com medo de falar
Já não sei se é hora de partir ou de chegar
Onde eu passo agora não consigo te encontrar
Ou você já esteve aqui ou nunca vai estar

Tudo já passou, o trem passou, o barco vai
Isso é tão estranho que eu nem sei como explicar

Diga, meu amor, pois eu preciso escolher
Apagar as luzes, ficar perto de você
Ou aproveitar a solidão do amanhecer
Pra ver tudo aquilo que eu tenho que saber",A Hora do Trem Passar,2004
Raul Seixas,"O sol da noite agora está nascendo
Alguma coisa está acontecendo
Não dá no rádio nem está
Nas bancas de jornais
Em cada dia ou qualquer lugar
Um larga a fábrica, outro sai do lar
E até as mulheres, ditas escravas
Já não querem servir mais
Ao som da flauta
Da mãe serpente
No para-inferno
De Adão na gente
Dança o bebê

Uma dança bem diferente
O vento voa e varre as velhas ruas
Capim silvestre racha as pedras nuas
Encobre asfaltos que guardavam
Hitórias terríveis
Já não há mais culpado
Nem inocente
Cada pessoa ou coisa é diferente
Já que assim, baseado em que

Você pune quem não é você?
Ao som da flauta
Da mão serpente
No para-inferno
De Adão na gente

Dança o bebê
Uma dança bem diferente
Querer o meu
Não é roubar o seu
Pois o que eu quero
É só função de eu
Sociedade alternativa
Sociedade novo aeon
É um sapato em cada pé
É direito de ser ateu
Ou de ter fé
Ter prato entupido de comida
Que você mais gosta
É ser carregado, ou carregar
Gente nas costas
Direito de ter riso e de prazer
E até direito de deixar",Novo Aeon,2004
Raul Seixas,"""No momento em que eu ia partir, eu resolvi voltar""

(Vou voltar)
Sei que não chegou a hora de se ir embora, é melhor ficar

(Vou ficar)
Sei que tem gente cantando, tem gente esperando a hora de chegar

(Vou chegar)
Chego com as águas turvas, eu fiz tantas curvas pra poder cantar

Esse meu canto que não presta
Que tanta gente então detesta
Mas isso é tudo o que me resta
Nessa festa, nessa festa

Eu
(Vou ferver)
Como que um vulcão em chamas, como a tua cama que me faz tremer

(Vou tremer)
Como um chão de terremotos, como amor remoto que eu não sei viver

(Vou viver)
Vou poder contar meus filhos, caminhar nos trilhos, isso é pra valer

Pois se uma estrela há de brilhar
Outra então tem que se apagar
Quero estar vivo para ver
O sol nascer, o sol nascer, o sol nascer

Eu
(Vou subir)
Pelo elevador dos fundos, que carrega o mundo sem sequer sentir

(Vou sentir)
Que a minha dor no peito, que eu escondi direito agora vai surgir

(Vou surgir)
Numa tempestade doida pra varrer as ruas em que eu vou seguir
Em que eu vou seguir, em que eu vou seguir",O Homem,2004
Raul Seixas,"Ói, ói o trem, vem surgindo de trás das montanhas azuis, olha o trem
Ói, ói o trem, vem trazendo de longe as cinzas do velho éon

Ói, já é vem, fumegando, apitando, chamando os que sabem do trem
Ói, é o trem, não precisa passagem nem mesmo bagagem no trem

Quem vai chorar, quem vai sorrir?
Quem vai ficar, quem vai partir?
Pois o trem está chegando, 'tá chegando na estação
É o trem das sete horas, é o último do sertão, do sertão

Ói, olhe o céu, já não é o mesmo céu que você conheceu, não é mais
Vê, ói que céu, é um céu carregado e rajado, suspenso no ar

Vê, é o sinal, é o sinal das trombetas, dos anjos e dos guardiões
Ói, lá vem Deus, deslizando no céu entre brumas de mil megatons

Ói, olhe o mal, vem de braços e abraços com o bem num romance astral

Amém",O Trem das 7,2004
Raul Seixas,"Meus amigos essa noite eu tive uma alucinação
Sonhei com um bando de número invadindo o meu sertão
E de tanta coincidência que eu fiz essa canção

Falar do número um
Falar do número um não é preciso muito estudo
Só se casa uma vez e foi um Deus que criou tudo
Uma vida só se vive, só se usa um sobretudo

Agora o doze
E só de pensar no doze eu então quase desisto
São doze meses do ano, doze apóstolos de Cristo
Doze hora é meio-dia, haja dito e haja visto

Agora o sete
Sete dias da semana, sete notas musicais
Sete cores do arco-íris nas regiões divinais
E se pintar tanto sete, eu já não agüento mais

Dois
E no dois o homem luta entre coisas diferente,
Bem e mal, amor e guerra, preto e branco, bicho e gente
Rico e pobre, claro e escuro, noite e dia, corpo e mente

Agora o quatro
E o quatro é importante, quatro ponto cardeal
Quatro estação do ano, quatro pé tem um animal
Quatro perna tem a mesa, quatro dia o carnaval

Pra encerrar
Eu falei de tanto número, talvez esqueci algum
Mas as coisas que eu disse não são lá muito comum
Quem souber que conte outra, ou que fique sem nenhum",Os Números,2004
Raul Seixas,"Quando esqueço a hora de dormir
E de repente chega o amanhecer
Sinto a culpa que eu não sei de que
Pergunto o que que eu fiz?
Meu coração não diz e eu
Eu sinto medo!
Eu sinto medo!

Se eu vejo um papel qualquer no chão
Tremo, corro e apanho pra esconder
Com medo de ter sido uma anotação que eu fiz
Que não se possa ler
E eu gosto de escrever, mas
Mas eu sinto medo!
Eu sinto medo!

Tinha tanto medo de sair da cama à noite pro banheiro
Medo de saber que não estava ali sozinho porque sempre
Sempre, sempre
Eu estava com Deus!
Eu estava com Deus!
Eu estava com Deus!
Eu tava sempre com Deus!

Minha mãe me disse há tempo atrás
Onde você for Deus vai atrás
Deus vê sempre tudo que cê faz
Mas eu não via Deus
Achava assombração, mas
Mas eu tinha medo!
Eu tinha medo!

Vacilava sempre a ficar nu lá no chuveiro, com vergonha
Com vergonha de saber que tinha alguém ali comigo
Vendo fazer tudo que se faz dentro dum banheiro
Vendo fazer tudo que se faz dentro dum banheiro

Paranóia

Dedico esta canção
Paranóia!
Com amor e com medo (com amor e com medo)
Com amor e com medo (com amor e com medo)
Com amor e com medo (com amor e com medo)
Com amor e com medo (com amor e com medo)

Com amor e com medo",Paranóia,2004

Raul Seixas,"Ao chegar do interior
Inocente, puro e besta
Fui morar em Ipanema
Ver teatro e ver cinema era a minha distração

Foi numa sessão das dez
Que você me apareceu, me ofereceu pipoca
Eu aceitei e logo em troca
Eu contigo me casei

Curtiu com meu corpo
Por mais de dez anos
E depois de tal engano
Foi você quem me deixou

Curtiu com meu corpo
Por mais de dez anos
E depois de tal engano
Foi você quem me deixou

E foi tamanho o desengano
Que o cinema incendiou",Sessão das 10,2004
Raul Seixas,"Hoje é segunda-feira e decretamos feriado
Chamei Dom Paulo Coelho e saímos lado e lado
Lá na esquina da Augusta quando cruza com a Ouvidor
Não é que eu vi o Sílvio Santos
Não é que eu vi o Sílvio Santos
Sorrindo aquele riso franco e puro
Para um filme de terror
Como é que eu posso ler
Se eu não consigo concentrar minha atenção
Se o que me preocupa no banheiro ou no trabalho
É a seleção
(Vê se tem Kung Fu aí em outra estação)

Já na outra esquina
Dei três vivas ao rei Faiçal
O povo confundiu pensando que era o carnaval
Então eu disse a Dom Paulete, eu conheço aquele ali
Não é possível, Dom Raulzito
Não é possível, Dom Raulzito
Quem que no Brasil não reconhece o grande trunfo do xadrez
Saí pela tangente disfarçando uma possível estupidez
Corri para um cantinho pra dali sacar o lance de mansinho
(Adivinha quem era? Mequinho!)

Lá em Nova York todo mundo é feliz
Vi o Marlon dançando o último tango de Paris
Pedi cerveja e convenci ao garçom do botequim
A não pagar o tal do casco
Ele aceitou, pois sou um astro!
E duma cobertura no Leblon
Quelé acena dando aquela
Enquanto o povo embaixo grita
É o Rei Quelé despenca da janela
É quando, a 120, o Fittipaldi passa e quem ele atropela

Raul Seixas,"Muitas vezes, Pedro, você fala
Sempre a se queixar da solidão
Quem te fez com ferro, fez com fogo, Pedro
É pena que você não sabe não

Vai pro seu trabalho todo dia
Sem saber se é bom ou se é ruim
Quando quer chorar vai ao banheiro
Pedro, as coisas não são bem assim

Toda vez que eu sinto o paraíso
Ou me queimo torto no inferno
Eu penso em você, meu pobre amigo
Que só usa sempre o mesmo terno

Pedro, onde 'cê vai eu também vou
Pedro, onde 'cê vai eu também vou
Mas tudo acaba onde começou
Tente me ensinar das tuas coisas
Que a vida é séria e a guerra é dura
Mas se não puder, cale essa boca, Pedro
E deixa eu viver minha loucura

Lembro, Pedro, aqueles velhos dias
Quando os dois pensavam sobre o mundo
Hoje eu te chamo de careta, Pedro
Que você me chama vagabundo

Pedro, onde 'cê vai eu também vou
Pedro, onde 'cê vai eu também vou
Mas tudo acaba onde começou

Todos os caminhos são iguais
O que leva à glória ou à perdição
Há tantos caminhos, tantas portas
Mas somente um tem coração

E eu não tenho nada a te dizer
Mas não me critique como eu sou
Cada um de nós é um universo, Pedro
Onde você vai eu também vou

Pedro, onde 'cê vai eu também vou
Pedro, onde 'cê vai eu também vou
Mas tudo acaba onde começou
É que tudo acaba onde começou",Meu Amigo Pedro,2006

Y enhebrando vivencias la canción trasnochada 
Que nace en la bohemia de amigos y guitarras 
Para que me acompañe dondequiera que vaya 
Me llevaré conmigo en los pliegues del alma 
La sonrisa de un niño, es decir la esperanza,  
Esa brisa constante que sostiene mis alas 
Y que va por delante remolcando mis ansias 

Me llevaré conmigo los zapatos gastados  
En todos los caminos por los que he caminado 
Por los muchos amigos volverí­a descalzo  
A pesar de las piedras si fuera necesario 

Me llevaré conmigo la presencia de tantos  
A los que no he podido estrecharles la mano  
La próxima nos vemos y cualquier escenario  
Será el sitio adecuado para darles mi canto 

Me llevaré conmigo, de las cosas mas bellas,  
Un sarape tejido con tejido de estrellas  
Y un sombrero de luna, del cielo de esta tierra  
Para que me cobijen el frí­o de la ausencia, 

Me llevaré conmigo, Gustavo, que te pasa  
Si el tiempo es un instante y un instante es mañana  
Mañana nos veremos, mañana es cualquier dí­a,  
Tiene leña la llama y seguirá encendida 

Me llevaré conmigo la emoción florecida  
De saber que sonaron por mi las golondrinas 
Esta canción que acaso no es canción sino alma  
Que se entrega al hermano cuando extiende sus alas 

Y me iré lentamente, con el último aplauso,  
Con el último vuelve y con el último abrazo

Que tengo un alboroto que me pica poco a poco todo el día

Quizás tan solo es de decirlo
O el llamar a algún amigo
Y confesarle mi secreto
Quizás sea mejor guardarlo
Alimentarlo y no entregarlo
Hasta que no pueda aguantarlo ni un segundo no mi amor

Que si te digo la verdad
Tan solo quiero de tu boca
Que me digas que tu amor es como el sol que me ilumina
Que ya no quiero aparentar
Tan solo quiero contemplarte
Como luna que se cuelga en tu balcón muriendo el día

Y si te digo la verdad
Voy a escribir todos mis versos
Que te tengo por decir para entregarte vida mía
Que ya no me quiero aguantar
Te vas a tener que enterar
Que mis latidos tienen dueño para siempre en tu guarida*

Cayo la luz que alumbra el día
Y empieza mi delirio por querer que ya amanezca para verte
La noche es larga sin tenerte
Y paso en mi desvelo suspirando una caricia pa' quererte

Quizás no tengo que esperar
Te lo repito sin cesar
Entenderás lo que yo siento
No tengo más con que abreviar
Mi corazón se va a estallar
Por retenerte todo el tiempo aquí en mi mente si mi amor

Que si te digo la verdad
Tan solo quiero de tu boca
Que me digas que tu amor es como el sol que me ilumina
Que ya no quiero aparentar
Tan solo quiero contemplarte
Como luna que se cuelga en tu balcón muriendo el día

Guárdame siempre donde no haya frío
Arropa este amor que te tengo
Mírame a los ojos para hacerme mía
Y deja asi que yo te quiera, yo te quiera, si mi amor

Dame, dame cariño
Tiempo pa' estar contigo
Dame de tu boca, boca que provoca cada parte de mis sentidos

Dame, dame cariño
Tiempo pa' estar contigo
Dame tu respiro, quédate conmigo para amarte con mis latidos",Y Si Te Digo,2008

Raury,"Forbidden knowledge can destroy mankind

I spend large hours of my days alone
I don't believe we share this universal space alone
I think we got a lot from them, they gave us phones
Internet and now we all know what is forbidden knowledge
Forbidden knowledge is too great for a man
Think if man could read your mind, you think that man understands
How to use it with integrity, not conquering land
Would it be good if we increased the lifespan, well that's forbidden knowledge
Forbidden knowledge can destroy mankind
We can grow out of control like cancer under the skin of Mother Nature
Busy cities much alike to a tumor
Too many cells, the residents, the body's pollutor
I say woosah and alley-oop the chubby doobie to Judah
Child of Jacob, I know my history, I know we are moors
There's a universe in her afro, hold us back though
Power in the black folk, well that's forbidden knowledge
At first they want to keep us separate but equal
But it's not so we fight against the hatred and evil
Now they let us think we got it and they killin' our people
Why does history repeat like a sequel? Well that's forbidden knowledge
Is God a man watching TV like people?
Rewinding his favorite parts to play it back like it's TiVo
Have I wrote this shit before? It all feels like a redo
Deja vu is left to die like our dreams do, but that's forbidden knowledge
I had some shocking memories as a kid
Waking up onto a table, a lab, some typa bizz
Too vivid to be a nightmare, mom would tell me that shit
Can't remember anything that they did, guess that's forbidden knowledge

Forbidden knowledge

Are dreams another kind of preview to Heaven?
We manifest our reality based on our personality
Karma from shit we did since the day we were seven
You share toys? Or did you masturbate at eleven
Just a 90s baby, a millennial kid
Indigos are on the rise to make perennial shift
Hope this music stands long as Redwood Sequoias
Pyramids and stones, like stones from Stonehenge
Come on, let the future tell the truth
Cause you a shell of you
You played your cards wrong, now you got hell in you
Be glad I still retain respect for you
Cause I got bullets that'll kill yah if your vest is hell and heaven-proof
I'll never understand your corporate greed
Just a group of people, all they want is more than they need
Signing off on papers, blinded to the pain overseas
Blood resulting from the ink that they bleed, that's forbidden knowledge

Forbidden knowledge

So who put the liquor store on the street across from the gun shop?
The park a hop skip in the dark 'way from the gunshots
That rang out in the neighborhood where the youth's misunderstood
Fighting over concrete squares but the laws just ain't no good
I think their agenda's meant to kill us all
How good is education long as you can ball?
Standin' on the couch inside the club and hit the mall
Barely feed a bum, but you buy it all
Think they laughin' at us, cause while we're watchin' some cable
They was talkin' 'bout the economy, sharecroppers and stables
How to keep the horse runnin' his course, give him some blinders
So he lack remorse for whoever's right beside him
His own kind, I pray you dig deeper
If you don't find, what you're lookin' for on the surface
The knowledge that you need can't be Nextel chirpin'
You're every bit of worth it, not worthless
You're kings and queens, were meant for better things
Than flexin' on the scene, or burstin' out the seams
Of your blouse you told yourself you'd never wear outside your mama's house
Cause the energy it lends puts strong women down, down
Brother, look, you don't need to go to jail to read you a book

No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no

Raven-Symoné,"It's the way you're nervous when you speak
The way I know just what you mean
It's the kind of thing that's bitter sweet
It's the funny feeling deep inside
So many different sides but still so easy to define
Cause you know it every time and not just in your mind
But you can feel the butterflies
Sendin' chills down your spine
What is love?
But a kiss on a rainy day
A smile that won't go away
A safe place to run
What is love?
But a complicated simple truth
A bond between me and you
The number one
Uh that's love
And the things that never cross your mind
You're doin' all of the time
It's with someone special, it's alright
It's like dancing when you walk
And singing when you talk
Your happy just to be alive
But in the mornin',
Don't pretend,
Let it go and take it in
You don't have to understand
The how, why, and when's
What is love?
But a kiss on a rainy day
A smile that won't go away
A safe place to run
What is love?
But a complicated simple truth
A bond between me and you
The number one
So take off your hat and stay for a minute
Love is a precious thing if you let it
In you'll never know what you'll find till you give it,
Sometime, sometime
What is love? (what is love? Yeah)
But a kiss on a rainy day (a kiss on a rainy day)
A smile that won't go away (a smile that won't go away)
A safe place to run
What is love? (what is love?)
But a complicated simple truth (a simple truth)
A bond between me and you (between me and you)
The number one
What is love? (what is love?)
But a kiss on a rainy day (a kiss on a raining day)
A smile that won't go away (a smile that won't go away)
A safe place to run (a safe place to run)
What is love? (what is love?)
But a complicated simple truth (a simple truth)
A bond between me and you (between me and you)
The number one (the number one)
All that's love (all that's love)
What is love
Wat is love?
It's a kiss on a rainy day
Oh that's love
Ohh oh ohhh",What Is Love?,2004
Raven-Symoné,"Baby, I knew at once
That you were meant for me
Deep in my soul I know
That you're my destiny

Though you're unsure
Why fight the tide?
Don't think so much
Let your heart decide

Baby, I see your future
And it's tied to mine
I look in your eyes
And see you searching for a sign

But you'll never fall
'Til you let go
Don't be so scared
Of what you don't know

True to your heart
You must be true to your heart
That's when the heavens will part
And baby, shower you with my love

Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies
And when you're true to your heart
I know it's gonna lead you straight to me

Someone you know is on your side
Can set you free
I can do that for you

You know it's true
It'll see you through, yeah, yeah
Clap your hands, stomp your feet

Boy, my heart is driving me to where you are
You can take both hands off the wheel and still get far
Be swept away and enjoy the ride
You won't get lost, yeah, with your heart to guide you

True to your heart
You must be true to your heart
That's when the heavens will part
And baby, shower you with my love

Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies

I know it's gonna lead you straight to me, yeah

Look inside and you know you are I saw a man dancing on the corner
Hat out, dancing for quarters Every time, see a smile on his face

Brother took one then she called for her mommy she started crying
said one thing I know Mama's flying down like a superhero
