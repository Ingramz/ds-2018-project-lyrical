Mark Lindsay,"I remember back a long time ago,
In the days of my childhood.
In the evening when the sun was sinking low,
Walking in the wildwood.
Skippin' and flippin' through the flowers,
We'd go hand in hand.
Looking back on all the happy hours,
Anyone could understand.

[Chorus]
You and me, babe.
Sure 'nuff got to be, babe,
Birds of a feather.
We should be together
Like birds of a feather.
Got to be together
Like birds of a feather.

You and I didn't have a lot of friends,
Didn't have too much to say.
So they never would let us join in,
All the games they used to play.
Seems like it was only yesterday,
Down at Lincoln Junior High.
I remember what the kids used to say,
As we'd go strolling by.

[Chorus]

Time goes rolling by.
They say that you and I must go our separate ways.
But birds of a feather will always be together.

Your folks didn't want me hanging 'round.
Said that I was bad for you.
So we'd meet on the other side of town,
Down a long dark avenue.
But they can't keep the two of us apart,
As long as you really love me,
I got a feeling way down in my heart,
That's the way it's gonna be.

[Chorus]",2 Birds of a Feather,2003
Mark Lindsay,"I was down in L.A. town, when our manager said ""Jump""
I through my close and my saxophone in a two by four bit trunk
I pushed it to the airport and run to the ticket line
Man said ""Son, you could have saves the run, those airplanes just quit flyin'""

If I can't leave here, I just might stay
And that L.A. flyway is goin' to be my home, umm, hum

I ran to the terminal building, to fly by my airline
The man said I could ride the wing and I said that was fine
He said ""I'll confirm your reservation, and put the plane on hold""
He came back and said ""Sorry but that wing space just been sold""

If I can't leave here, I just might stay
And that L.A. flyway is goin' to be my home, umm, hum, baby

I walked into the washroom and I built myself a fire
Throw on lots of paper and the flames kept gettin' higher
The janitor come runnin' in, so scare his face was white
So, I explained my situation, he said ""That's all right""

If I can't leave here, I just might stay
And that L.A. flyway is goin' to be my home

Next day I thought that I would leave, so I packed my thing again
Waited 14 hours for a taxi to come in
Spotted one that wasn't full and I threw myself in fast
The driver said ""I'm sorry but this taxi's out of gas""

If I can't leave here, I just might stay
And that L.A. flyway is goin' to be my home",The Great Airplane Strike,2003
Mark Lindsay,"Well, I had to leave town because of Uncle Sam's deal, ha ha ha yeah 
Well, I guess my good lovin' done lost its appeal 
Because when I called back I heard a-bad bad news 
They say our big romance has been gettin' abuse 
Now tell the truth, don't lie to me 
Have you been step, step, step, step, step, step, steppin' out on me? 
I've got ways of findin' out if you've been steppin' out on me 
It's my turn, let me give you a piece of my mind 

I told you once, I told you twice 
You're kind of rowdy after walkin' on ice 
Turn your loop in, do what I want you to do 
Stop your messin' now or I'm gonna step out on you 
Hey! Hey! Hey hey hey hey! 

If I can't be your one & only man 
I'm gonna call your daddy to give him back your hand 
I'm gonna call the preacher, tell the choir stay home 
I guess you're the kind of woman that's just 'bout to roam 
Now tell me true, don't lie to me 
Have you been step, step, step, step, step, step, steppin' out on me? 
Tell the truth, child; you've been steppin' out on me 
I gotta know in my heart if you've been steppin' out on me 
I'll be checkin' with all your friends if you've been steppin' out on me 
Better tell me the truth honey; have you been steppin' out on me? 
Yeah I'm gonna check; no more stuff or I'll be steppin' out on you 
(more talk, fading out)",Steppin' Out,2003
Mark Lindsay,"Its very clear our love is here to stay
Not for a year, forever and a day
The radio and the telephone
And the movies that we know
They're all just passing fancies
That in time may go

Oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together were going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
Oh, our love is here to stay",(Our) Love Is Here to Stay,2003
Mark Lindsay,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You,2003
Mark Lindsay,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,2003
Mark Lindsay,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2003
Mark Lindsay,"Now have you got yourself a brand new baby
Don't tell me maybe, is it so? I got to know
What's it gonna be, him or me?
Him or me, him or me, him or me?

I can still recall when you told me I was all
Everything you looked for in a man
But I know that it's not true, I've seen the way he looks at you
And I think you're gonna hang me up again

Now have you got yourself a brand new baby
Don't tell me maybe, is it so? I got to know
What's it gonna be, him or me?
Him or me, him or me, him or me?

So, if you'd be so kind, would you please make up your mind?
I won't share your lovin' with another man
And if you see things my way, could you let me know today?
But if you decide, it's him, I'll change my mind

So have you got yourself a brand new baby
Don't tell me maybe, is it so? I got to know
What's it gonna be, him or me?
Him or me, him or me, him or me?

Him or me, him or me, him or me
What's it gonna be?

Him or me, him or me, him or me
What's it gonna be?

Him or me, him or me, him or me
What's it gonna be?

Him or me, him or me, him or me
What's it gonna be?

Him or me?

Mark Lindsay,"They took the whole Cherokee nation
Put us on this reservation
Took away our ways of life
The tomahawk and the bow and knife
Took away our native tongue
And taught their English to our young
And all the beads we made by hand
Are nowadays made in Japan

Cherokee people
Cherokee tribe
So proud to live
So proud to die

They took the whole Indian nation
Locked us on this reservation
Though I wear a shirt and tie
I'm still part redman deep inside

So proud to live
So proud to die

But maybe someday when they learn
Cherokee nation will return, will return
Will return, will return, will return",Indian Reservation,2008

Come on baby, won't you let me

Can't you see what I'm trying to do
Doing my best to try to get to you
Don't you hear what I'm trying to say 
All the right words but still you run away 
Come on, come on baby don't you get me
Alright, don't it seem that when you love somebody
Ain't it right that somebody loves you too 
But I know my love is going somewhere
But I'm sure it ain't being got by you

She must have lost her way

And colours of green and grey

Mark Linkous,"It was love at first sight 
When I talked to her 
It was the beginning of a real good time 
All I knew was her 
And when I came around 
Love had lingered on my mind 

She said on the telephone 
She wished me well. 
So alive with a spell 
Until I hung up early 
I've realized 
I've been dead for so long 

All my memories of her 
Like a fading light I suffer 
Thinking of our love for so long 
Back in the early days 
I saw a lot of her 
She was the coolest girl in town 

And when I saw her standing there 
Everything was all right 
I took a journey in my mind 
And as I saw her beauty 
She was so kind 
That was a good time 

Everyday we met it was wild 
I felt like a child 
I loved to see her smile 
And as I played piano 
I was so inspired 
I always had a real good time 

And when last we met 
I just can't forget 
I took for sure I love her bad 
I just can't ignore 
Her loving response 
I always knew she'd be all right

She made me think I was okay 
And the love seemed so real 
I still got feelings for her 
And when I'm on tour 
Singing about her forever 
I'll remember blessings
And the good times we had

I really tried to play the game of love 
And I hate to loose 
Maybe I can win somehow 
And so I'll dream of her 
For a thousand years 
Until I see another girl 

That's the way it always was 
That's the way it always was
That's the way it always was",Love Not Dead,2003
Mark Linkous,"If you think your thoughts so rationally
Then you might just see it's not so funny

Prey tell
The wishing well will get you eventually
Beware
What you are is what you're doing there

Love is lingering with you on it's mind
And it's giving you a moment so kind

Believe
Your broken heart could heal so dramatically
And with a little luck
You could see a better way again real soon

As we stare into each other's eyes
And each year just goes so fast and goodbye

Look around
What your friends are telling you so free
Be gone
It's all over as the sun does set once more

If you think that love has a chance with you
Maybe hope can shine a light so true

Just smile
You can win the victory so sweet
And know
It's just another day for you and me

And tomorrow ? no more sorrow
You can all her - if you want to

There's a new way ? why won't you try it
Heaven sent it and you'll believe it now

Love can save you now
Love can save you now
Love can save you now

",Now,2003
Mark Linkous,"Tears fall left and right 
No hope in sight 
Why can't we syrup 
For sorrow pancakes so flat 
Keep it light forever 
Not realizing my own fate 
It's great, the weight upon me now 

Nothing for me nowhere 
But the emptiness I feel 
Depression has got me down 
Drilling for the kill 
It's too late to suffer through 
God, I'll make you a deal: 
Just let me smile a while, for real. 

And when the evening comes 
I'll be on the run 
You were the only one 
That sure was fun 

To me it's never been any better 
And no kind of love has been any greater than you
For me, I can tell 

You shone like a sacred goddess in love 
Like a psycho hot as the sun 
Until we meet again, I won't give up 
It's such a wonder for us – our inner quest 

And so it starts 
The alligator when you appeared 
From never forever 
And you smiled on my poor suffering soul 
Blessed child, you are my treasure 
Can't you see, it's all an illusion 
I love you more than myself 

I love you more than myself 
I love you more than myself 
I love you more than myself 
I love you more than myself

And I wish to see you again 
And I wish to see you again 
And I wish to see you again 
And I wish to see you again",Syrup of Tears,2003

Yes, further on down the road 
You will accompany me

Goin' farther on down the road

Then a happy fool is what I wanna be 
So I'll be glad to learn about you, baby 
You can learn a thing or two about me 
But then if we ever should get down 
And things really got sad 
You know we could cheer each other up 
And things wouldn't be that bad, baby 
If I'm gonna be a fool in this life 
Just want to be a fool for you, darlin' 

Day by day, just one step at a time 
Girl, you've been so sweet 
Restore my peace of mind 
And I don't care what anybody knows 
And I don't care what anybody might say 
With lovin' in my corner each and every day 
And I wanna thank you for that, baby 
Just want you to go with me thru time

Than to live in this world in a house of gold
Deny my god and doom my soul

The list is by the door
I can't remember everything
That's what the list is for

But there's more to life
Than bills I've gotta pay
I wanna make the most
Of every day

To live what I believe
Pray for those in need
Always give more than enough

To gently walk in grace
Boldly stand in faith
Most of all to share the Father's love

Lord, there are so many ways for me
To show a glimpse of You
On my list of things to do

There's something extraordinary
In this ordinary life
When I recognize eternal things
Are right before my eyes

So I've taken time
To write this little list
To remind me of
What I might miss

To live what I believe
Pray for those in need
Always give more than enough

To gently walk in grace
Boldly stand in faith
Most of all to share the Father's love

Lord, there are so many ways for me
To show a glimpse of You
On my list of things to do

So I'll write it down on paper
'Til it's written on my heart

Pay for those in need
Always give more than enough

To gently walk in grace
Boldly stand in faith
Most of all to share the Father's love

Mark Lowry,"Deep within the heart has always known that there was freedom
Somehow breathed into the very soul of life
The prisoner, the powerless, the slave have always known it
There's something that keeps reaching for the sky

And even life begins because a baby fights for freedom
And songs we love to sing have freedom's theme
Some have walked through fire and flood to find a place of freedom
And some faced hell itself for freedom's dream

Let freedom ring wherever minds know what it means to be in chains
Let freedom ring wherever hearts know pain
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets where prisons have no key
We can be free and we can sing, let freedom ring

God built freedom into every fiber of creation
And He meant for us to all be free and whole
When my Lord bought freedom with the blood of His redemption
His cross stamped pardon on my very soul

I'll sing it out with every breath, I'll let the whole world hear it
This hallelujah anthem of the free
That iron bars and heavy chains can never hold us captive
The Son has made us free and free indeed

Let freedom ring down through the ages from a hill called Calvary
Let freedom ring wherever hearts know pain
Let freedom echo through the lonely streets where prisons have no key

If I have sweet peace within

Well, I'm satisfied with my Jesus
And when He knocks I'm gonna let Him in
And He'll go with me through the valley

And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool 
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost, you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

An emblem of sufferin' and shame

Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

To the old rugged cross, I will ever be true
It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share

All the demons, all the devils of hell
On the other, the angels of glory
And they meet on Golgotha's hill

And the sun refuses to shine
For there hangs God's son, in the balance
And then through the darkness he cries

It is finished, the battle is over
It is finished, there'll be no more war
It is finished, the end of the conflict
It is finished and Jesus is Lord

Yet in my heart, the battle was still raging
Not all prisoners of war had come home
These were battlefields of my own making
I didn't know that the war had been won

Mark Marino,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Man made electric light to take us out of the dark
Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark

Man makes then happy 'cause man makes them toys
And after man has made everything, everything he can

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2006

Then I would not have found you 
Angel flying too close to the ground 
I patched up your broken wing and hung around for a while 
Trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down 
I knew someday that you would fly away 

For love's the greatest healer to be found 
So leave me if you need to, I will still remember 
Angel flying too close to the ground

You showed me what, we should all be fighting for
Can you tell me
Why I always see your face
You are kinda like a super natural kinda place
Reaching out
You are the one
Consciousness your killing me
I understand the clarity
Now I can see how you touched so many lives
Your on your way to another space and time
I can't tell you everytime I see your face
You are kinda like a super natural place

You are the one
Consciousness your killing me

I'm no stranger to shame
I've got little to blame
You sent for me and so I came
I'll come runnin' when you call my name
'cause I'm no stranger, I'm no stranger to shame
I said I'm no stranger, I'm no stranger to shame

I might stagger and I might sway
I might stutter just a bit but that's OK
I'm not walkin' too good that's true
I got a broke ass limp that'll pull me though
I might appear to be a pile of rags
But I'm a stack of hundreds in a paper bag
I've been around this world and back
I made a million bucks and put it all on black

So if you see me stumble you don't have to look away
It's not the first time, not the last
You can leave me where I lay, because
So if you see me stumble you don't have to look away
It's not the first time, not the last
You can leave me where I lay, because

[Chorus]

I've been known to wake up in some dirty places
The sun only shines on deserving faces
The mind erases, forgets the stars
See each and every city has corner bar
That's where I am in a world so grim
The lights are as bright as the day is dim
See I'm priceless in a class of my own
I used to stay out late but now I don't go home
So if you see me stumble you don't have to look away

It's not the first time, not the last
You can leave me where I lay, because
How do you feel when the birds are chirpin'
When your in bed and everybody is workin'
Are you down with the non believers
Make the slackers look like over achievers
The dogs scratchin' on the door again
The cat's out but he don't want to come in
You got a bed and you got a floor
But the couch is closer to your front door
So if you see me stumble you don't have to look away
It's not the first time, not the last
You can leave me where I lay, because

I thought God I hate that woman
But I love the one at home

She doesn't dance
And she hates dark smokey places
She doesn't own any fancy high heel shoes
Or short sexy dresses
Her hair would be up
The way that I love
Never so down and crazy
Believe me I know my baby
And she doesn't dance

It's like a bad movie
That's lasted too long
It's all about her
But it has to be wrong

She doesn't dance
And she hates dark smokey places
She doesn't own any fancy high heel shoes
Or short sexy dresses
Her hair would be up
The way that I love
Never so down and crazy
Believe me I know my baby
And she doesn't dance

Believe me she doesn't dance",She Doesn't Dance,2001
Mark McGuinn,"Everybody wants to make it up to Heaven
But they don't want to die
Everybody wants seven or eleven
Without rollin' the dice
Just want somethin' for nothin'
Buy one, just to get one free
Or be the first to take someone's lovin'
And not back anything

[Chorus: ]
It don't work that way
There's a price you have to pay
It don't work that way
You gotta step up to the plate
Can't hit a home run
Without being the batter
You won't find your gold
On a silver platter

Everybody wants to win the blue ribbon
Without running the race
Everybody wants to have a perfect body
Without lifting a weight
Rather make a million dollars
Not the old fashioned way
Spend a buck the pick six numbers
Now all I have to say

Is in your eyes

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go

And what a night to go dreaming

Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,2005
Mark McIntyre,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much

Night now they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready
For a fight gonna see what them racket boys can do

Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state
And the D.A. can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade and
The gamblin' commission's hangin' on by the skin of its teeth

But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty and
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City

Well I got a job and tried to put my money away
But I got in too deep and I could not pay
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
And I bough us two tickets on that Coast City bus

Now our luck may have died and out love may
Be cold but with you forever I'll stay
We're goin' out where the sand's turnin' to gold
So put on your stockin's 'cause the night's getting' cold and maybe everything dies
That's a fact but maybe everything that dies
Someday comes back

Now I been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find
Down here it's just winners and losers and
Don't get caught on the wrong side of that line
Well I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end
So honey last night I met this guy and I'm
Gonna do a little favor for him

Mark McKay,"You wait in the car
On the side of the road
Let me go and stand awhile
I want to know you're there, but I want to be alone
If only for a minute or two
I want to see what it feels like to be without you
I want to know the touch of my own skin
Against the sun, against the wind

I walked out in a field:
The grass was high, it brushed against my legs
I just stood and looked out at the open space
And a farmhouse out a-ways
And I wondered about the people who live there
And I wondered if they were happy and content
Were there children and a man and a wife?
Did she love him and take her hair down at night?

If I stray away too far from you
Don't go and try to find me
It don't mean I don't love you
It don't mean I won't come back and stay beside you
It only means I need a little time
To follow that unbroken line
To a place where the wild things grow
To a place where I used to always go

La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

It rains pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven
You'll find your fortune
Fallin' all over town
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven
For you and me

Mark Miller,"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair
All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

Mark Miller,"In the evening when the cattle's [Incomprehensible]
An old familiar feeling settles over me
And it's your face I see and I believe that you are there

In the garden when I stop to touch a rose
And feel the petal soft and sweet against my nose
I smile and I suppose that somehow maybe you are there

When I'm dreaming and I find myself awake
Without a warning and I rub my eyes and fantasize
And all at once I realize it's morning

And my fantasy is fading like a distant star of dawn
My dearest dream is gone
I often think there's just one thing to do
Pretend the dream is true and tell myself that you are there",You Are There,2004
Mark Mollica,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around

You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet
The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine
Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about

I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?

Mark Moore,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1998
Mark Moore,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1998

And at the end of the night, no doubt, I'm gonna get mine

Doin the wild thing 'cause the soul is true

Mark Morganelli,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1990

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye

And we were the players

Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

Wigglin' under my skin
I've been lost in the lost and found
Feeling like a helpless pin

U got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged
Girl, I don't know what to do
U got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged
You fluttered on down

As graceful as can be
Then you stuck in the needle
And sucked my blood
It was the love age that came over me

U got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged
I don't know what to do
U got me bug, bug, bug, bug, bugged
I'm always bugged over you

Now I'm hopelessly entangled

Helpless like a worm watch me twist and squirm
Your love has left me strangled

That they stole from her mother
Drunk on the Summer
And drunk on each other

And a left over at the ghetto
Climb up to where it’s dark
And gonna take all of our clothes off

Braiding her hair so she could not see,
That William had his eyes closed,
Headin’ straight for a tree,

We’re goin’ straight into a skid
Shut off the motor, and gone straight off of the ridge

And Lucinda she was dead

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

But things are not the same it seems as in such tender dreams
Slowly passing sailing ships and Sunday afternoon
Like people on the moon I see are things not meant to be

Where do those golden rainbows end?
Why is this song so sad?
Dreaming the dreams I've dreamed my friend
Loving the love I love 

To love is just a word I've heard when things are being said
Stories my poor head has told me cannot stand the cold
And in between what might have been and what has come to pass
A misbegotten guess alas and bits of broken glass

Loving the love I love to love to love to love

Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this: a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

She showed me her room, isn't it good, Norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere.
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.
I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two, and then she said, ""It's time for bed"".

And leave their footprints in the sand
Was the sound of distant drumming
Just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway
Or the fragment of a song
Half-remembered names and faces
but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over
Were you suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning
To the color of her hair?

Doting on the cards I'm dealing
Gloating, because I'm feeling so hap, happy
I'm slap, happy

Ring bells, sing songs
Blow horns, beat gongs
Our love never will die
How am I ridin'? How am I ridin'?
How am I ridin'? I'm ridin' high

All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.

I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Takin' a Chance on Love,1999

For they both give the very same sensation,
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss.

Beware my foolish heart, 
But should our eager lips combine, 
Then let the fire start,

Mark Nadler,"I am dejected, I am depressed
Yet resurrected and sailing the crest
Why this elation mixed with deflation
What explanation 
I am in love

Should I order cyanide or order champagne
Oh, what is this sudden jolt
I feel like a frightened colt
Just hit by a thunderbolt
I am in love

I knew the hours were against me before
I have no flare for flaming desire
But since the gods gave me you to adore
I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire

For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Mark O'Connor,"It's been ten long years since the devil laid his fiddle at Johnny's feet

And it burned inside his mind the way he suffered that defeat
In the darkest pits of hell the devil hatched an evil plan
To tempt the fiddle player for he's just a mortal man
""The sin of pride,"" the devil cried is what will do you in
""I thought we had this settled, I'm the best there's ever been.""

Johnny did you ever know that time keeps marching on
The coldest hour is the one comes just before the dawn
The devil's back in Georgia will you stand up to the test
Or will you let the devil be the best?

""In truth I haven't played much since the baby came in June
But give me half a minute an' I'll get this fiddle back in tune""

The devil grabbed the golden fiddle out of Johnny's hand and said
""Though I'm the fiddle player underground and I walk upon the land""

""Y'all just better be just turnin' back if you want this boy to win
'Cos practice is the only cure for the predicament he's in""

""Now devil it would be a sin for you to get my bow
You go on back to hell and to the wood shed I will go""

Johnny are you practising or will your hands grow cold?
The devil walks the land and plays a fiddle made of gold
Can you hear the babe a crying, will he ever know
The devil wants his daddy's very soul?

""Before we play I want to thank you for letting God's own Word ring true
He said you can't be trusted"" ""Yes but what you gonna do?""
""Well you get your fiddle devil if you think that you can win
'Cos I beat you once you old dog and I can whip your butt again""

Mark O'Connor,"I started drinking and actin' crazy
Way back in sixty five
Mama would pray and say, he's my baby
Lord, please keep him alive

Sister came home with two little children
Her man had left her alone
Mama knew too well the hurt she was feelin'
'Cause daddy had been gone so long

We all did our part to add to her pain
We all broke her heart but she never complained

She loved a lot in her time
She watched love grow and die on the vine
She stood in the shadows
So others could shine
She loved a lot in her time

Mama's prayers were answered a long time ago
I ain't touched a drink in ten years
Sister remarried to a good ol' boy
They don't live far from here

Mama's work is done
Now, she's gone on home
The words in our hearts
Are engraved on her stone

She loved a lot in her time
She watched love grow and die on the vine
She stood in the shadows
So others could shine
She loved a lot in her time

Turned the light on in the hall And then I saw the post-it notes 
That she had stuck up on the wall. 
The first one said, ""I love you, but I can't live on love alone."" 

The yellow post-it-notes were stuck up everywhere 
One was on the microwave and one on the Frigidaire

It tastes like turpentine

Ben Johnson's now public domain

We tried to pay him off but all he wanted was to stay

Through the valley of a roadside.
Taking a walk through the valley of a roadside,
On a sunny afternoon.
Smoking a smoke.
Through the streets of a poppy field.
Smoking a smoke, through the streets of a poppy field,
On a sunny afternoon.
I'm travelling down a man made avenue;
There's a stop sign this time, I'm going through.
Are you with me,
On my journey?
Are you with me, in the search for the sunshine,
On a sunny afternoon?
Now I'm driving in my car,
Down the path of a hillside,
On a sunny afternoon.
Holding your hand,
Down a lane made for lovers,
On a sunny afternoon.
I'm travelling down a man made avenue;
There's a stop sign, this time I'm going through.

Mark Owen,"Last night in my dreams I saw you with another,
And when I turned around, you were gone.
It all came back to me,
Through a postman and this letter.
That brought the words: I fell in love with another.
How does it feel when you wake up in the morning?
Do you ever think of me lying here?
'Cause when I go to sleep, you become my pillow,
And I hold you tight and whisper in your ear.

[Chorus]
Does he hold you the way I used to?  Does he smile at you from the centre of his heart?
Does he live for you, would he die for you?
If you told him that you want him to,
Could he love you the way I always will?  Well could you ask him to?

I ventured out today, I really wished I hadn't.
'Cause everything I seen and heard made me think of you.
I know I have to get over you, but at the present I'm finding it hard to do.
So I beg you please to take a moment to ask:

[Chorus]

Now I'm a speck on your horizon,
A fading light inside your eye.
I've come to understand that you were far beyond me,
But I'll never understand exactly the reason why
You never explained to me.

In this picture,

In this picture,
The lines are blurred but my colors are shining through.
I start with a canvas,
And think about what I want to achieve.
From another angle,
The paintings gonna make a print of me.
Choose the texture.

Carot gold, the kind fit for a king.
But that ain't what I'm about,
So I'll take this earth and I'll mix it in.
Now my paintings ready to begin.
But how big should it be?
Big enough for the mantlepiece of every home,
Or small enough for my back pocket and me?

[REPEAT CHORUS]
I start with the heart now,
The rest will develop from its beat
As it takes shape.
The picture no longer resembles me;
It resembles every living thing I've ever seen or heard,
From the heart of me to a flying bird.
So, now how big should this picture be?
Should it fill the world, or my back pocket and me?

I'm going to try and get an overview.

Some stay the same
Someone came into today
Somewhere someone passed away
And under a stone
Just skin and bone

When all we have is all we own
What are all the voices saying?
Where are all you people going?
And if there's a God
Then why won't he talk to me?
We cry, we learn
We think about the things we're crying for
We try, we burn
And then we try and try again
When the troubles come
When we're not so strong
We need to breathe to carry on
Still looking for pieces of heaven
Cat in a box
Watching the clocks
Chase my heart around the block
Pictures of an astronaut
And all the above
Creatures in love
Making plans then getting off
Waiting for the rain to stop
Where do words go when they're spoken?
Why do some minds never open?
And if there's a God
Then why won't he talk to me?

Destroy the walls like a one man army

I want to spend all of my time
The way that it should be spent

Road maps here of 20 towns
Flights a faithless place

Yawn and wash my face

You know you're nervous when you see me sway
Too much time by yourself
You know you always seem to back away
Don't hide within yourself

Like tar bubbles on the path
When they all pop up in summertime
Forever my climb will last

Yo!
Phone's ringin', where's the action, time to get on blaze
Half-next I got your message I'm about to go page
Grand Central, time to blow some mentals, cashing the essentials
Build enough credentials, that's essentials
I make timbo's shine like the face on a dime
Make you freak, electric boogie, whap, Boogaloo-one
Jump back kiss myself and still keep myself in time
Check the brotha the you're seein' just stays on your mind
We got the fundamental usage 
To make you feel the looseness
You recognize the jungle and you're screaming ""Oh my goodness!""
The remedy to keep the party lively
It's no trouble or mystery who you call, yo
The JB's - like cool breeze on a coast
Ain't gotta say no more we let the vibe be your host
And let the rude boy roast, and like the fat rump roast
Won't you take a taste of this, you're on-off wagging your boast
Iit's the can't-go-wrong, it's the funky-and-strong
It's tha tack, you tell the DJ let the record play on

I comin' back at ya with more juice than Dracula attackin' ya
Lyrical acrobatics is a habit
Makin' the track bounce like a Bugs Bunny rabbit [Make 'em bounce baby!]
Take you behind my bush, spill it on your belly
Keepin' on the down-low just like R. Kelly
Unload my clip with the JB classics
Tou know that baby damn like they drop their funky shit [No doubt!]
Like you, you got the flava, know you caught the vapours
Want that koochy lick in the only sky-pager
You know me from the native time, eighteen years young
But it was the trade that made your money give me some
Yeah, play on & play on & play on & play on Grand Central [Word up!]

[Mike G]
Yo, yo, it's Mike G, the grand boogie, we make 'em bounce and such
I was just a young boy when I learned the jungle touch
Made a platina from rust, made a build-up in trust
And when the sound boy came, we came around and we crushed
We set the scoops up nice and that we through want to miss
And then we tapped them with the horns they never came off their crib
The rhyme reck'ning grows as the roof gets phrased
It's just another scene the Brothers had to put bun cleans
Orchestrated by the Brothers that groove in Grand Central
I learned to make you bounce as a part of fundamentals
Every record must be sold 'cause in this job there are no rentals
Let my soul die when only Vai-Chi's suck my mentals
When I rock upon the mic i'm pushing hard for my mental

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Mark Randall,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum. 
You're the top! 
You're the Louver Museum. 
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 
You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse. 
You're the Nile, 
You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add; 

You're the top! 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top! 
You're Napoleon Brandy. 
You're the purple light 
Of a summer night in Spain, 
You're the National Gallery 
You're Garbo's salary, 
You're cellophane. 
You're sublime, 
You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner 
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar 
You're the top! 
You're a Coolidge dollar, 
You're the nimble tread 
Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama, 

You're Whistler's mama! 

You're camembert. 

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante, 

You're the nose 
On the great Durante. 
I'm just in a way, 
As the French would say, ""de trop"". 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a dance in Bali. 
You're the top! 
You're a hot tamale. 
You're an angel, you, 
Simply too, too, too diveen, 
You're a Boticcelli, 
You're Keats, 
You're Shelly! 

You're Ovaltine! 
You're a boom, 
You're the dam at Boulder, 
You're the moon,

I'm the nominee of the G.O.P. 

Or GOP! 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom,

On the sleepy Zuider Zee, 
You're an old Dutch master, 

You're Lady Astor, 
You're broccoli! 
You're romance, 
You're the steppes of Russia,

New worlds waiting in the sky
To escape the feasting and the hunger
Not the monsters in our minds

We got our hands on this ship
And stowed away into the night
The four of us and Pasha dear
She to steer and we to fight

Federal rules and regulations
No more laughter left on earth
Outer space our one salvation
May god help us in our search

We went so fast that we grew younger
Put this ship on cruise control!
We all did our best with Pasha
But not as good as good ol' Joe

Love never should have entered
It was never in the plan
We were finally going to have her
And let Joe be damned

Monsters, monsters, monsters in the night
Monsters, monsters, monsters in black and white
Monsters, monsters, monsters out of control
Monsters, monsters, monsters when you're alone
Monsters, monsters, monsters feeding on themselves
Monsters, monsters on the road to hell

Joe awoke from a stupor
It was clear something was wrong
He rushed in and found us with her
And in his rage he aimed his gun

One shot and it was over
Pasha smiled and then was gone",Monsters,2012

Mark Roberston,"In Your hands, I know he 
Could be a man of peace 
So take him now, and lead him on 
And though the world would try to tear him down, 
Only You can make him strong. 

Chains of doubt, 
And chains of hate 
Never stop a man whose love is free 
To sow the seeds of faith. 
All the despair of the darkest night 
Can't keep his hope from turning this world 
Toward the morning light. 
I know this world will never understand 
Or return the love that he's been born to give. 
It's in the giving he receives. 
His pardon is in the pardoning. 
And in dying he's born again to live. 

In the sound of Your voice 
He has finally found his joy. 
So shine through him, and let him shine 
With the light you lit within him 
That shadows cannot bind. 

Chains of doubt, 
Chains of hate 
Never stop a man whose love is free 
To sow the seeds of faith.

Mark Roberston,"I stood on that Cherokee Plain, 
And the Cameron broke free and jumped its banks 
All in a rush of life. 
The thunderhead roared out its song, 
And it gave what was too much for it to hold. 
And so must I. 

[Chorus]
And You light the sun to lead me. 
Send the wind to be my guide. 
Just the wonder of this prairie, 
So lonely and so alive. 
And the song the moon is singing 
With the rain and with the fire. 

Says there You are. 
(There You are) 
There You are 
In front of me. 

The antelopes' white flashing flanks 
Sparked in the heart of the Cheyenne breaks, 
Only to disappear. 
Just like this memory of what once was my home. 
And as I move beyond everything I've known, 
You pull me near. 

[Chorus]

Says there You are. 
(There You are) 
There You are 

And Your kingdom sings of a glory. 
Of a power that is Yours alone. 
And You're the one breathed into the many. 
You're faith, You're love, and the hope. 
As we lay our hearts before You 
Our hands are free to let go. 

And there You are.

In front of me.",There You Are,1997
Mark Robertson,"It was said this man was of no reputation 
Yet He could stop the rising storm 
With a gesture of His hand 
But He chose to use His hands to heal 
Hearts of darkness, hearts of stone 
Just like mine would be revealed 

[CHORUS:]
He was a man of no reputation 
And by the wise, considered a fool 
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness 
In a time when the strongest arms ruled 
But this man of no reputation 
Loved the weak with relentless affection 
And He loved all those poor in spirit just as they were 
He was a man of no reputation 
It was said this man brought only confusion 
That He'd achieve his ends by any means 
And the truth that it brings revolution 
And for once they were right 
The truth set us free 
The hearts of the captive were his only concern 
And the powerful knew their days were ending 

[CHORUS:]

One day soon the gates of heaven will open wide 
And the Prince of Peace will come back for His bride 
But for now we live on these streets 
Forbidding and tough 
Where push always comes to shove 
And it's said love's never enough 
Where a prophet in rags gives hope to a fearful world 
No injustice, no heart of darkness 
Will keep this voice from being heard 
He was a man of no reputation 
And by the wise, considered a fool 
When He spoke about faith and forgiveness 
In a time when the strongest arms ruled 
But this man of no reputation 
Loves us all with relentless affection 
And He loves all those poor in spirit, come as you are 
To the man of no reputation",Man of No Reputation,1998

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Drifting apart like a plate tectonic

Settling down in your early twenties
Sucked more blood than a backstreet dentist

Dice, symbolize my life, roll 'em on the flo'

I let you build around me above me it seems profound
But much to my surprise it receives a little hit and it crumbles
I'm leaning at the core, no support, all I can do is stumble

A streak of light exposes all the glass
For stone this mountain can no longer pass
The confidence we shared has been a facade
I'm breaking out and leaving only the shards

Formidable destruction surrounding me only looks
I bust right through the glass, one attempt and that's all it took
I wanted to remain feeling safe, but it just can't sustain me
It feels more like a trap, gotta break out won't let it contain me

And call at respected hours
This is larger than what large is
The true definition
Of what being in charge is

This the type of business
That you could put your nose in
Pack a big enough bag
That you could fit some clothes in
Long hours, dozin'
Gotta get them figures straight
Young lamont dozier
I'm working on some real estate
Or chris blackwell
Gotta get them stacks well
United states postal service lame
We stack mail

Save some instruments
Cause we'll give you the blues hater
On your front porch in the morning
Like the newspaper
And the headline is that
We runnin' shit
And we the exact crew
That you don't wanna hate

How I can let you go
How will I let you go

Yo, yo
I keep my guards up
When it comes to the women
Told you that
Ever since the beginning
That's why I stand close
Down to white women
'Cause young girls are crazy
These are my limits

I can't let you go
And you know that
I can't see another man
Trying to blow that

That's critical
Love starts hurting me
Doctor Winslow said I need therapy

Torment, Misery
It's killing me physically
Why murder me legally
A love you can first leave

So I'ma close my eyes
And just pretend
'Cause word on the street's
I'ma lose it in the end

Yeah, I cared too much again
You stand to hard to care
And this must be a sin

I know what way to go when it
Comes to the ladies
'Cause things ain't changed

A few things first
I'm still picking them crazies
You wanna battle a court
Like Kim and Slim Shady

I ain't having that
No, I ain't having that
You just trying to get rich
Like Miramax
Forced my hand
Girl, to let you know

Mark Ronson,"I take too long
To answer telephones
I take too long to type my name
And record messages
But my handwriting is excellent
In fact it's second to none, none

I just got in
From somewhere really good
They offered me the part of Bono
And a speaking role
With all the merchandise
And sunglasses
I could ever need, need

I drive round cities in a chariot
I get preferential treatment
At the Marriott but if the truth be told
I'm naked under all those clothes

[Chorus]
I tell you what is on my mind
I only want to be
In your record collection
I only want to be
In your record collection
And I'll do anything it takes
Just to get there

My brain is buzzing
And the room is strange
Like the scene in trading places
At the stock exchange
I made a million overnight in '87
Now I'm living in my
Parking space, parking space

My teeth are bright
And my hair is clean
I wear Paco Rabanne
Like I was Charlie Sheen
But in the rain we all look wet
And in the snow we all look cold

[Chorus]

Disgusted by all the flashness
I think I'm a don
They think I'm an actor
But I catch this
My two needs
Are pillow and a mattress
Once I can fill up the space
With a famous actress
Give me a mil, I'll do a DJ set
I pull spikey with the green
Like a cactus
Show off, ego's high
You can't match this
Chauvinistic pig
Money man tactics

I'm not as clever
As I thought I was
It got pointed out to me
As I was tying the knot
And all I want to know is
How I got so far down, down

I'm not as lucky
As I thought I was
My luck ran out the other day
As I was crossing the road
Who would have thought
A truck like that

Could have caused so much

That's why I stand close
Down to white women
'Cause young girls are crazy
These are my limits

I can't let you go
And you know that
I can't see another man
Trying to blow that

That's critical
Love starts hurting me
Doctor Winslow said I need therapy

Torment, Misery
It's killing me physically
Why murder me legally
A love you can first leave

So I'ma close my eyes
And just pretend
'Cause word on the street's
I'ma lose it in the end

Yeah, I cared too much again
You stand to hard to care
And this must be a sin
Always lose it in the end

""Just chill out"" is what you said
""Take a pill and go to bed""
No matter, how or when
I always lose it in the end

I don't know
How I can let you go
How will I let you go

I know what way to go when it
Comes to the ladies
'Cause things ain't changed
Since the early eighties
A few things first
I'm still picking them crazies
You wanna battle a court
Like Kim and Slim Shady

I ain't having that
No, I ain't having that
You just trying to get rich
Like Miramax
Forced my hand
Girl, to let you know
Because you know what starts
It's real unnatural

Yeah, I said too much again
Yeah, I pushed too hard again
And I wanna start, but when
Always lose it in the end

Stupid once again
You wanna be my friend
And I'll push too hard again
Always lose it in the end

Mark Ronson and the Business Intl,"I take too long
To answer telephones
I take too long to type my name
And record messages
But my handwriting is excellent
In fact it's second to none, none

I just got in
From somewhere really good
They offered me the part of Bono
And a speaking role
With all the merchandise
And sunglasses
I could ever need, need

I drive round cities in a chariot
I get preferential treatment
At the Marriott but if the truth be told
I'm naked under all those clothes

I tell you what is on my mind
I only want to be
In your record collection
I only want to be
In your record collection
And I'll do anything it takes
Just to get there

My brain is buzzing
And the room is strange
Like the scene in trading places
At the stock exchange
I made a million overnight in '87
Now I'm living in my
Parking space, parking space

My teeth are bright
And my hair is clean
I wear Paco Rabanne
Like I was Charlie Sheen
But in the rain we all look wet
And in the snow we all look cold

[Chorus]

Disgusted by all the flashness
I think I'm a don
They think I'm an actor
But I catch this
My two needs
Are pillow and a mattress
Once I can fill up the space
With a famous actress
Give me a mil, I'll do a DJ set
I pull spikey with the green
Like a cactus
Show off, ego's high
You can't match this
Chauvinistic pig
Money man tactics

I'm not as clever
As I thought I was
It got pointed out to me
As I was tying the knot
And all I want to know is
How I got so far down, down

I'm not as lucky
As I thought I was
My luck ran out the other day
As I was crossing the road
Who would have thought
A truck like that

Could have caused so much

Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose

Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with a loser and the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat

Someone keeps saying, I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve

So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps
And burning' down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

Banned all the music with a phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag

With the re-run shows and the cocaine nose job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slop
He hung himself with a guitar string
I slap the turkey neck and it's hanging' from a pigeon wing

You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax, falling on a termite

Down the side of a hill at the bottom 
Where you will lose your mind?
So many contributing factors to hide
Never will find what's hidden inside
All your friends surround you 
They're made out of air
They act like they do 
But they don't really care
That just leaves the sickness
The music in me
Take my medicine and then you'll see

The sun go down 
And so are we
I'm screaming at you 
But you don't hear me
Am I alone or am I crazy
The ghost will come around for you inevitably

Have you ever encountered a skeleton
Just a pile of bones I remove from my phone 
So how've you been
Let me sing the song that reminds me again
Of the black in your soul
It's natural
I could take these problems 
And blame them on you
I know what you did
And you know what I do
That just leaves a guitar, a pipe and a crow
You're my melody
And then you'll know

And so are we

But you don't hear me
Am I alone or am I crazy

What was it like to go through a life
And end up here

Did you catch the one you're wanting
Just to let them get away

Seems the world becomes 
Disinterested in everything you do
And if your dream is to be lonely 
Then I guess it's coming true
Are you alive
Are you even alive

Love is unimpossible
I have seen her
Broken and beautiful
Rising up above my remaining ashes

Now, nothing's left to do but wait
With no distraction from yourself 
It's time to re-evaluate
You should make your peace with God
Or maybe focus on career
But one thing is for certain
There is nothing for you here

So go
There's so many things to see
Just beyond the song of darkness 
That is permeating me
Just because I'm a prisoner don't mean
That you're not free
When we met you were blind
Now I'm praying that you see

Send a shudder 
Down the gutter
To the avenues

Right down to the level
Of the children of the devil

No it won't be long
So what's going on 

So come on back track slack
As I whack super natural
Defending the facts as
They try to act causal

Many feel superior
To go for the soul
Clamp them down in a hurry
Like a grace choke hold

To you face the joke plays
Out once more
1,2,3 for all have sinned
And fell short of the glory of God

Their hit harder than a PLO car bomb
I long for the days
When hearts were a blaze
The spirit moved mighty 

As the people where amazed 
I want it back like the cluck want crack 
I want to fight back I want to attack 
My spirit is for war

Mark Schultz,"I'm down on my knees again tonight
I'm hoping this prayer will turn out right
See there's a boy that needs your help
I've done all that I can do myself

His mother is tired
I'm sure You can understand
Each night as he sleeps
She goes in and holds his hand
And she tries not to cry
As the tears fill her eyes

Can You hear me?
Am I getting through tonight?
Can You see him?
Can You make him feel alright?
If You can hear me
Let me take his place somehow
You see he's not just anyone
He's My Son.

Sometimes late at night
I watch him sleep
I dream of the boy he'd like to be
I try to be strong and see him through
But God who he needs right now is You.

Let him grow old
Live life without this fear
What would I be
Living without him here
He's so tired and he's so scared
Let me know that you're there

Can You hear me?
Can You see him?
He's My Son.",He's My Son,2000

Locked away where no one goes
Deep inside your heart,
It's tearin' you apart.
You hide the pain in all you do,
Still the shackles binding you are heavier than stone,

When you're down
Look around
And you'll see I am with you.
Look to Me and you'll see I will be there to guide you.
Take My hand and I can lead you on for you know:

I am the answer,
And I am the way.
I am the promise,
And I have called your name.

So you want a brand new start
Askin' Me into your heart,
Down on bended knee
For the world to see.
And the chains around your heart
Fall away and break apart
Suddenly you see
The truth has set you free.

When you're down
Look around
And you'll see I am with you
Look to Me and you'll see I will be there to guide you
Take My hand and I can lead you on for you know:

I am the answer,
And I am the way.
I am the promise, and
I have called your name.

Surrounded by darkness
You stumbled along
Knowing the road that you traveled was long
But I'm here beside you,
Yes here all along,
The one that will carry you on.

When you're down
Look around
And you'll see I am with you.
Look to Me and you'll see I will be there to guide you.
Take My hand and I can lead you on for you know.

I am the answer,
And I am the way,
I am the promise and
I have called.

Oh when you are down
You think no one's around,
But I'll be with you both night and day.
I know the good times,
I'll see you through bad times,
Oh you know that I'm here to stay.

From the recording: Song Cinema, Track #1.

You stand on the edge
You followed the call
No turning back you are risking it all
He whispers your name
In a moment of truth
The rocks fall around you
The ground starts to move
You step out on faith
It's all that you know
You jump into darkness and hold onto hope

When the mountains fall
When the rivers rise
Security crumbles before your eyes
The one thing you know
In faith you'll find
Something to stand on or you will be taught to fly

So dream your dreams
And live your life
Knowing there's more than to merely survive
Don't give up, don't give in
Fight through the rain and lean into the wind
'Til you come to the edge of all that you know
Run right through the dark knowing you're not alone

When you walk through the fire
It will not consume you
Though the water will rise
It won't overtake you
Though the mountains will fall
Oh, still I am with you
I've called you by name
And I will not leave you
I'm learning to trust you
I'm learning to fly
I'm learning to trust you
I'm learning to fly

On that bright summer's day
Found a letter from her son
In a war far away

He spoke of the weather
And good friends that he'd made
Said I've been thinkin' bout dad
And the life that he had
That's why I'm here today

And the at the end he said
You are what I'm fighting for

And you're brave
What a father that
You'll be someday

A day she'll not forget
Oh her tears stained the paper
With every word that she read

I was out there alone
When the shots all rang out
And bombs were exploding
And that's when I saw him
He came back for me
And though he was captured 
A man set me free

And that man was your son
He asked me to write to you
I told him I would
Oh I swore
It was the last of the letters from war

And wrote every night just so say

And you're brave

And she fell to the ground

Where her boy used to stand
He said mom I'm following orders
From all of your letters
And I've come home again

Waiting by the door to run into his arms
Each time that he came home

And every night he tucked her in and read to her in bed
When she'd fall asleep he'd close his eyes and gently bow his head

But she was watching
Her daddy praying
And thought someday I wanna be like that
She was watchin what he was saying
And the way he bowed his head
And though she can't recall the prayer
She was watching

Late one evening he was coming home from work
He called to say he'd lost his job
And after dinner they excused their baby girl
She knew they had to talk

But from inside her bedroom
She could hear them down the hall
They were dancing in the kitchen as momma sang his favorite
Song

[Chorus]
She was watching
As they were dancing
And thought someday I wanna be like that
She was watching
Her momma singing
As they were dancing hand in hand
And though she can't recall the song
She was watching

Faith can't be taught
It's just something that is caught along the way
No faith is never taught
It's just something that they catch from watching you along the way

He always called her daddy's little girl
But now she's twenty-three
He walks her down the aisle to give away his world
Oh but he can hardly speak
And when he kisses her goodbye he tries to hold it in
But as he turns away she pulls him close and whispers in his ear

I was watching
And I've been waiting
And finally found someone just like you
I was watching
My whole life praying
For God to see it through

And as he kissed her one last time
He said a prayer and closed his eyes
And she was watching

Across the sea into my soul

Der Mond versteckt sich, denn ihm graut vor mir
Kein Licht im Weltenmeer
Kein falscher Hoffnungsstrahl, nur die Stille
Und in mir die Schattenbilder meiner Qual

Das Korn war golden und der Himmel klar
1617, als es Sommer war
Wir lagen im flüsternden Gras
Ihre Hand auf meiner Haut war zärtlich und warm
Sie ahnten nicht, dass ich verloren bin
Ich glaubte ja noch selbst daran, dass ich gewinn
Doch an diesem Tag geschah's zum erstenmal
Sie starb in meinem Arm

Wie immer wenn ich nach dem Leben griff, blieb nichts in meiner Hand
Ich möchte Flamme sein und Asche werden und hab noch nie gebrannt
Ich will hoch und höher steigen
Und sinke immer tiefer ins Nichts
Ich will ein Engel oder ein Teufel sein
Und bin doch nichts als eine Kreatur
Die immer das will, was sie nicht kriegt
Gäb's nur einen Augenblick des Glücks für mich, nähm ich ewiges Leid in Kauf
Doch alle Hoffnung ist vergebens, denn der Hunger hört nie auf

Des Pastors Tochter ließ mich ein bei Nacht
1730 nach der Maiandacht
Mit ihrem Herzblut schrieb ich ein Gedicht auf ihre weiße Haut
Und des Kaisers Page aus Napoleons Tross
1813 stand er vor dem Schloss
Dass seine Trauer mir das Herz nicht brach, kann ich mir nicht verzeihen

Doch immer wenn ich nach dem Leben greif, spür ich, wie es zerbricht
Ich will die Welt verstehen und alles wissen und kenn mich selber nicht
Ich will frei und freier werden, und werde meine Ketten nicht los
Ich will ein Heiliger oder ein Verbrecher sein
Und bin doch nichts als eine Kreatur, die will was sie nicht kriegt
Die zerreißen muss, was immer sie liebt
Jeder glaubt, dass alles einmal besser wird
Drum nimmt er das Leid in Kauf
Ich will endlich einmal satt sein, doch der Hunger hört nie auf 

Manche glauben an die Menschheit, und manche an Geld und Ruhm
Andere glauben an Kunst und Wissenschaft, an Liebe und an Heldentum
Viele glauben an Götter verschiedenster Art
An Wunder und Zeichen, an Himmel und Hölle
An Sünde und Tugend und an Bibel und Brevier
Doch die wahre Macht, die uns regiert
Ist die schändliche, unendliche, verzehrende, zerstörende
Und ewig unstillbare Gier

Euch Sterblichen von morgen, prophezeih' ich heut und hier
Noch bevor euer nächste Jahrtausend beginnt
Ist der einzige Gott, dem jeder dient
Die unstillbare Gier",Die unstillbare Gier,2018

Hab vor mir keine Angst

Ich denke mir, das wär dir nicht genug
Willst du lieber beten
Bis du grau und bitter bist?

Dass ihre Sicherheit ein großer Schwindel war

I gotta story, about money, women, and power
and who truly has it

Her name, seems to slip my mind
but her face is stuck in my brain
Can vaguely remember the day we met, see it had rained
the road over, on Soppovada was wet
And my car wasn't, huggin the terrain
So there I came into her lane
I was to blame but stopped my headlight in the front
'cause I ran into her back
But she didn't, over-react, 'cause her cruiser wasn't even scratched
In fact, now that I think, back, I was gettin macked
by a tender, oh yeah now I remember
Vanessa from Maryland, aggressive and tanned
It was December, of '94 and she was finding O attractive
Lookin like an actress, skilled in the art of macktress
She asked if I was cool, I said ""Sure
but damn I fell like manure because baby I ain't insured""

8-50i, no more sess highs, strictly chronic and thai
Rolled in place in a gold cigarette case
Liquorice papers for sweeter taste, my pockets was laced
with big head Benjamins, crushed in cinnamon, linen and black Gators
Platinum, chains, rings and bracelets
Found out she was a mule for the Mob
Had plans to rob, and wanted me in on the job
Bust this, disgusted, one night in the middle of sex
She asked O-Press - ""Are you down for this?""
And I said ""YES! Baby yes!"", ugh
I must confess it was a bit risky this way
But when she hugged and kissed me, uhh, I didn't care
Got to the point I didn't even wear underwear

To continue livin lavish she had a plan - hit her ex-man
for three hundred grand, I just put him to sleep
and keep it movin to a spot where, we used to creep
Agreed, greed, bubbled up inside me indeed
So on Friday when he received loot, I walked in and proceeded to shoot
nigga's in they knees, fuck 'freeze', yeah yeah
there's the money, oh shit and seventeen keys
Stashed up and shit, shot to the designated spot
at the designated time, she was late I had to wait
Escalated my mind to stop the shakes
I had just shot niggas up, like a scene out of Carlito's Way
She walked in around ten
I was in the corner with my 9 sayin ""I thought eight was the time
we had agreed upon"" but I noticed she was nervous
I said ""What's goin on?"", that's when she blurted
""??? heard about the Mob, how we did it, the money - give it
Trust me baby, I'll be back in a minute""
Then she kissed me on my face, grabbed me up under my waist
and left, I sat for three hours and still not a trace
Soft nigga, I got the seventeen, I'ma just dip
That's when the cops showed up, talkin bout an anonymous tip
They got the dirty cookers and the pure uncooked
Took me and my attorneys hell just to get me one L
With no possibilities of parole I was lost
Vanessa made me made loot and made off
Uh, what?

You don't even have a clue
All you did was make me blue
You didn't even make me, come on!

You're so self-involved
You're in some kind of fog
You're hung up on your hog
You didn't even make me, come on!

You think you're in hot demand
But you don't know where to put your hand
Let me tell you where you stand
You didn't even make me, come on!

Dude you're so fire
Shut up, I'm not inspired
All I'm feeling now is tired
You didn't even make me, come on!

You weren't even worth it
I'm sorry I ever flirted
The effort wasn't even concerted
You didn't even make me, come on!

All you do is talk the talk
You can't back it up with your walk
You can't light my fire, so fuck off
You didn't even make me, come on!",Come On,2013
Mark Sganga,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you",There Is No Greater Love,2006
Mark Shane,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love","In a Mist, Candlelight [Bonus Track]",1993
Mark Shane,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul,1996
Mark Shane,"Give me a kiss to build on and my imagination will thrive upon that kiss
Sweetheart I ask no more than this, a kiss to build a dream on
 
Give me a kiss before you leave me and my 
Imagination will feed my hungry heart
Leave me one thing before we part, a kiss to build a dream on
When I'm alone with my fancies, I'll be with you 
Weaving romances, making believe they're true
 
Give me your lips for just a moment and my 
Imagination will make that moment live
Give me what you alone can give, a kiss to build a dream on",A Kiss to Build a Dream On,1996
Mark Shane,"Where's that tiger! Where's that tiger!
Where's that tiger! Where's that tiger!
Hold that tiger! Hold that tiger ! Hold that tiger! 
Choke him, poke him, kick him and soak him!
Where's that tiger? Where's that tiger?
Where oh where can he be?
Low or highbrow, they all cry now
""Please play that Tiger Rag for me""

Mark Shane,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]

Mark Shane,"Someone told someone and someone told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much
Since everyone spread the story 
With his own little personal touch
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me

Mark Shane,"Life is such a great adventure
Learn to live it as you go
No one in the world can censure 
What we do here below
 
Don't save your kisses, just pass them around
You'll find my reason is logic'lly sound
Who's going to know that you passed them around
A hundred years from today!
Why crave a penthouse that's fit for a queen
You're nearer Heaven on Mother Earth's green
If you had millions what would they all mean
A hundred years from today
So laugh and sing, make love the thing
Be happy while you may
There's always one, beneath the sun
Who's bound to make you feel that way
The moon is shining, and that's a good sign
Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine
Remember, darling, we won't see it shine
A hundred years from today
