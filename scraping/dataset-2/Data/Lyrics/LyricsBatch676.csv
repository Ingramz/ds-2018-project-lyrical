Aselin Debison,"Everything is open
Nothing's set in stone
Rivers turn to oceans
Oceans tide you home
Home is where the heart is
But your heart had to roam
Drifting over bridges
Never to return
Watching bridges burn
You're driftwood floating underwater
Breaking into pieces, pieces, pieces
Just driftwood, hollow and of no use
Waterfalls will find you, bind you, grind you
Nobody's an island
Everyone had to go
Pillars turn to butter
Butterflying low
Low is where your heart is
But your heart has to grow
Drifting under bridges
Never with the flow
And you really didn't think it would happen
But it really is the end of the line
So I'm sorry that you've turned to driftwood
But you've been drifting for a long, long time
Everywhere there's trouble
Nowhere's safe to go
Pushes turn to shovels
Shovelling the snow
Frozen you have chosen
The path you wish to go
Drifting now forever
And forever more
Until you reach your shore
You're driftwood floating underwater
Breaking into pieces, pieces, pieces
Just driftwood, hollow and of no use
Waterfalls will find you, bind you, grind you
And you really didn't think it would happen
But it really is the end of the line
So I'm sorry that you've turned to driftwood
But you've been drifting for a long, long time
You've been drifting, for a long, long time
Drifting for a long, long time",Driftwood,2002
Aselin Debison,"The first time ever she saw him,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
He passed on worried and warning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night,
Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through.
The trees that whisper in the evening,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun,
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.
Four a.m. in the morning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
I watched your vision forming,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Stars roll slowly in a silvery night,
Far away on the other side.
Will you come to terms with me this night,
But she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.
Far away on the other side.
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five.
The night was heavy and the air was alive,
But she couldn't find how to push through.
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Far away on the other side.
But she couldn't find how to push through.",Moonlight Shadow,2002
Aselin Debison,"Once in every life
Love should leave you without a choice
Where the only thing right
Is to follow that still small voice
Once in every day
It should take your breath away
Once upon a time
Should happen once in every life
Once you give it your heart
Without holding back your soul
You can dance in the dark
Cause you're never there alone
Once in every hour
You should feel that healing power
Once upon a time
Should happen once in every life
Once it's stronger than you
There's nothin' else you can do
You stop asking why, just let yourself fly
Once in every life
Love should feel so good you cry
And your only release
Is releasing three small words
Once you hear them out loud
You feel heaven coming down
Once upon a time
Should happen once in every life
Once upon a time
Should happen once in every life",Once in Every Life,2002
Aselin Debison,"Some days I feel sad and lonely
Some days I feel fine!
Some days the clock just ticks too slowly
And I wish away my time.
I wish away my time

When you come to me
I realize how wonderful my life can be.
With you...You and me.
Some days bounce like a basketball
Some days make me blue.
Some days I stare out through my window
And wonder what the world will do.
I wonder what the world will do!

And when I wake at night
The darkness closes in.
My heart takes fright.
You remind me that I'm alright.

Some days I think I just fell from the sky.
Some days I have to ask the question 'why?'
But everyday I try!

Some days I am virtuous,
But some days I'm just bad.
Some days I just can't get enough
Of the sweetest things I ever had.
The sweetest things I ever had.

But when you telephone,
I realize that I am never really all alone
And dream that I am home, I am home,
I am home!

",Some Days,2002
Aselin Debison,"Wish I could whistle down the Northern Lights
And send them dancing all across the night
Maybe then when all the sky was blazing
Maybe then I'd feel you somewhere
Gazing at a star,
And you could feel me too
As I say goodbye to you

It breaks my heart in two, to say goodbye to you
Wish time could turn us back to yesterday
The gods above would look the other way
Maybe then we still could laugh together
Maybe then it could be spring forever and a day
But I must face the truth and say goodbye to you
It breaks my heart in two, to say goodbye to you

Wish I could whistle down the Northern Lights
And send them dancing all across the night
Maybe then in my memories for saving
One last time you're on the hill waving from afar
One last glance or two and I'll say goodbye to you
It breaks my heart in two, to say goodbye to you

",To Say Goodbye to You,2002
Aselin Debison,"When I look around me
Everything's so blurry
In a world that's bigger than me 
When there's no one to talk to
I can lay mine on you
You will always comfort me 
For every step that's held me back
For every second chance I've had 
You always seem to, to find a way
To tell me 
That you love me
That you need me
That you'll find me whenever I get lost inside my head 
That you'll save me
Completely
From a world that's bigger than me 
In the blink of an eye
You make everything right
No more dark cloud following 
When I've got empty pockets
And when I'm stuck in traffic
I can tell it's you just by the ring 
For every corner cut too fast
For every time that I came last 
You always seem to, to find a way
To tell me 
That you love me
That you need me
That you'll find me whenever I get lost inside my head 
That you'll save me
Completely
From a world that's bigger than me 
When I look around me
Everything's so blurry
In a world that's bigger than me 
But you love me
But you need me
But you'll find me whenever I get lost inside my head 
But you'll save me
Completely
From a world that's bigger than me
But you need me
But you'll find me whenever I get lost inside my head 
But you'll save me

Aselin Debison,"Love is taking some sweet time
I get a little impatient sometimes
But the blue skies up above
White clouds sail away

I'm in no hurry

A single mom just trying to make ends meet
Go to work, be on time, get out of the grocery line
Before the kids get home

Totally stressed out and worried

Learned to drive on all the side streets
Bent the rules like they meant nothing
Stayed out late till the early morning
But he had to grow up, yeah we gotta grow up
Sometime x4
Maybe I am only 14
Maybe someday I'll be prom queen
Drive myself to where I should be
But that's when I grow up, yeah that's when I grow up

Aselin Debison,"A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking the market one day
She stopped for to rest by the road side
Where a bird with a broken wing laid
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
And soon clean and rapped it was traveling

In the warmth of Maria's small hand
She happily gave her last paso
Of a cage made of freshes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
Watched it grow stronger with time
Now the gift giving service was coming
And the chruch arm with tinsel and light
An' all of the town folk brought presents

To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds, incents and perfumes
And packages fit for a king
But for one raged bird in his small cage
Maria had nothing to bring
She waited till just before midnight
So no one would see her go in
And crying she knelt be the manger

For her gift was unworthy of him
Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door let me see
So she trembled she did as he asked her
An' out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring up into the rafters

On a wing that would feel good just new
An' just as the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
For its beauty was fit for a king
Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To the cascade a note sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first night in Gales song",The Gift,2007

There were dead people all over the street man
Within two minutes I had all my stuff together
I jumped in the car and was speeding down the highway past all the deserted cars
In five minutes I was at the airport but there at the gates I saw what I suppose was one of them Alien life forms
I pulled my bazooka out of it's bag in the back of the car and blew it to hell

Two hours later landing in Zaire
Where we met up with Fu Manchu, Hannibal Lector, the hooded claw and all the rest of the gang

I knew a girl from mars? 
I don't know if you knew that 
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards 
Henri winterman cigars 
Though she never told me her name 
I still love you girl from mars 
Sitting in a dreamy daze by the water's edge 
On a cool summer's night 
Fireflies and stars in the sky 
Gentle glowing light 
From your cigarette 
The breeze blowing softly on my face 
Reminds me of something else 
Something that in my memory has been replaced 
Suddenly all comes back 
And as I look to the stars.
I remember the time 
I knew a girl from mars 
I don't know if you knew that 
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards 
Henri winterman cigars 
Though she never told me her name 
I still love you girl from mars 
Searching through the darkness 
And over the moonlit stand 
Electricity in the air 
Twisting all through the night on the terrace 
Now that the summer is here 
I know that you are almost in love with me 
I can see it in your eyes 
Strange lights shimmering 
Over the sea tonight 
And it almost blows my mind 
And as I look to the stars 
I remember the time 
I knew a girl from mars 
I don't know if you knew that 
Oh we'd stay up late playing cards

Though she never told me her name

It felt as if you'd returned 
I thought that you were standing over me 
When I woke there was no-one there 
I still love you the girl from mars 
Do you remember the time 
I knew a girl from mars? 
I don't know if you knew that

That all that you ever looked for
Is sitting there in your hand

When the stars are aglow and burning

I'd wear a ring

I can't run this time

am I under a spell?

fighting for my life?

so far gone

can't turn it round

I feel buried alive

I am screaming out


Terror in your eyes, your heart is racing

for the innocence we lost will not return

we know we can't go on

but we're still holding on

don't let me be the one to drag you down


In the silence

in the lonely night

when you're frozen with fear

when you're paralyzed

too delicate

your fragile mind

it's so hard to stay

in love with life


Terror in your eyes, your heart is racing

for the innocence we lost will not return

we know we can't go on

but we're still holding on

don't let me be the one to drag you down


I was fighting at your side

a knowing partner in this crime

a beating heart, a distant star

we lost all we were fighting for

all the hurt I kept within

I blamed myself for everything

for all the regret that remains

for all the pain


Terror in your eyes, your heart is breaking

for the innocence we lost will not return

we know we can't go on

but we're still holding on

don't let me be the one to drag you down

Fire and brimstone raining down

It's all ahead of you
You can't hold me responsible
You have to break the rules
You can be so predictable

Now is fading

Don't be afraid

I held on to your hand
It made me feel much better

You are my guilty pleasure
All the mistakes I've made
I got so self-destructive
You have to have some faith
Everyone gets corrupted

Now is fading

How'd you fade out
Out of contact
When you disapear on impact
When you break down
Playing too bad
If you leave now you can go back

Don't - be - afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Hold your faith

No, you can't surrender
You can no longer
At the end of certified standards
What doesn't kill you
Will make you stronger
When it gets you, you'll discover

So take courage
Take your chances
And one day you will find your answers

The world is spinning
On its axis
And your galaxy collapsing
Just can't defy it
Or at least deny it

It's crazy but it's true
I only want to be with you

You stopped and smiled at me
Asked if I cared to dance
I fell into your open arms
And I didn't stand a chance
Now listen honey

I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together honey I don't care
You started something
Won't you see
But ever since we met you've had a hold on me
No matter what you do
I only want to be with you

You stopped and smiled at me
Asked if I cared to dance
I fell into your open arms
And I didn't stand a chance
Now hear it honey

I just want to be beside you everywhere

You started something

Ash,"I smoke myself into a haze in the afternoon
Enveloped heart and the air is cool
Put on your dress, white Goddess
And settle in, as the weather folds
In the slow haze of the afternoon
Swaying hips, made like a gun
Blackest sails, the most beautiful, star

In the world, in the air, on my tongue
Before my eyes, beyond the stars, beneath the sun

So, take me in your arms again
Lead me in my dreams again
So, what is it worth?
I'll sell my soul, what is it worth?
Only you know

You were conceived in my heart, came like a dream
To save me from my mortality
Put on your dress, white Goddess
And settle in, as the weather folds
Our lives will be entwined, even when I die
You'll see me through 'til the end of time
No earthly bride, the most beautiful, star

In the world, in the air, on my tongue
Before my eyes, beyond the stars, beneath the sun

So, take me in your arms again
Lead me in my dreams again

Asha Bhosle,"One night, backstage at Irving Plaza at a Madball show

Lars: Hey yo Ill Bill – will you sign this for me?
I found it at Amoeba it's the Green CD
Bill: No doubt kid, what's your name?
Lars: It's MC Lars
Bill: Word, Howie Abrams is a mutual friend of ours
He played me your joint Lars: What'd you think of it?
Bill: I think it's bugged out, it's hot
Lars: Thanks, I like your last record a lot. Your lyrics are
Graphic, much like your brother Necro, is he psycho?
Bill: I don't know, it really depends though
He's Psychological, half psycho, half logical,
Half businessman, half put-them-in-the-hospital
Lars: Business and art, there's a very fine line
There's the person that you are
And the person when you rhyme
But the best MC's bring both intertwined
Bill: I agree, that's when the best of both worlds collide
When the realness pops off one time for your mind,
And your words cause the people in the crowd to riot

CHORUS
As many places I've been. As many people I've met
As many haters I've dissed. There's people that I respect
As many times as I've failed. As many times as I've won
As many lives as I touch. The dialogue has begun

Bill: I grew up on heavy metal and hip-hop
The energy was the same to me, it was insane to me
It made me want to rage against the machine
Pick up a guitar and scream into the mic like Run-DMC
Lars: Nine Inch Nails, Primus, “Weird Al,” and King Missile
Influenced me like a postmodern epistle
Geeked out on my Performa looping digital drums
Playing rock guitar in punk bands just for fun
Who's your favorite rapper? Bill: Rakim, G Rap and Kane
KRS, EPMD, NWA, Public Enemy, Shante and LL Cool J
I could keep naming MC's all day,
What type of metal stuff you listen to?
Lars: Old school Slayer CD's, Biohazard and
Bile were the bands for me
The first time that I ever heard Chuck D
Was the Anthrax CD, “Attack of the Killer B's”… chorus!

REPEAT CHORUS
Lars: So Bill, what's your take on censorship?
Politicians on a church/state fusion tip?
Bill: I speaks my mind while kids I went to high school with
Bleed on the sands of Kabul hit, it's bullshit,
Lars what you think of it?
Lars: Out in Iraq, a lack of dialogue
Between the people is whack!
Bill: In fact I speak militant like Black Panthers
These gas prices got my people
With seeds having to gank pampers
Lars: The answer is not plutocracy.
The answers is not hypocrisy,
The answers is true democracy
Bill: The answer is the dialogue constantly

REPEAT CHORUS

Lars: Hey yo Bill, we should do a track together
Bill: Word, word, let's do that
Lars: Wait, we just did",Ib Tum Paas Mat Aana(Dialogue)Meri Takdir [Raaste Ka Patthar],2006

The way that you walking, the way that you talking
You're the one I want to spend this night with
Trying to get in them drawers and bang it out til the morning
I can already tell you want it
Cause you shaking it all for me, giving it all to me
Rubbing that body on me
Keep on shaking it all for me, giving it all to me
Rubbing that body on me

Hey boy
I think I just might wanna come see you tonight
And you can have your way boy
I know its been a while since you made my body right
Now I've been waiting patiently, anticipating you and me
And it ain't no question cause boy I love you when you put that body on me

Hey how you doing mama
I need to know your name
You giving me the eye eye
I'm giving you the same
It just hit me right now
What we should do today
Go tell you friends bye bye
And lets go hop a plane
Its no mistaken the attractions ironic
I wanna make you someone more then just a a bone in my closet
I wanna win that type of relationship
Where you gon' wanna come hang when your man done trip
You say your short this month and you're late on your rent
He took your car, what you mean? Hold this
Hey hey you see oh
You see lil mama outta control

[Chorus]

Now I see you lookin' at my body baby
Now you wanna come and put it on me
If I gave it to you, could you promise me
That you could make it feel like it never did
'Cause I see (I see), and you see (you see)
Now if I please you (I please you), you please me (you please me)

And I ain't tryna be the other chick (I know you want it)

Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects
And that's how we roll, roll

You know I'm well known like Al Capone, fully blown like Ton' Montana
In a zone, sittin' on chrome, stoned sippin' on cham-pagna
Rollin' ganja up in Bible papers, see how high the lye can take us
Through the eyes of Christ, John, Elijah, Jacob

I make the kind of green a hustler dream
bustin' out the custard cream Viper
Custom piped up with the mustard seams
Clustered green Fort Knox and hard medallions

Mockin' God even Italians see my batallion pull out the broad
I got the Squad over-qualified, pullin' over Karl Kani
Range Rover tilted, three-wheeled hydraulic slide
Sparkin' lye in the clouds and reppin' my housin'

I got it sewn Twinz, I can't begin to tell you the story
That soared me from livin' poorly to a modern day Cinderfella
I've been a killer and a drug dealer, a bugged nigga
But now I'm like Puffy, 'cause money's thicker than blood player

I'm still a threat but now I think before I flip
Call my connects together
And figure which cleaner's the best for the hit
I get the job done, Pun's handlin' business

Candlelight dinners, havin' a toast with the most glamorous bitches
My road to riches was no Christmas
Now we blessed with gold Lazaruses
So expensive my whole family's religious

Aye yo, I want it all you can call me greedy and superficial
Long as my crew's official and pulls they pistols soon as I whistle
I'm tryin' to triple a million and split it three ways
Joe the God, Full Eclipse and myself, that'll be the day

I need a way to get it already got the ambition
Start the ignition, watch for the NARCs in the marked Expedition
I'm on a mission which requires a higher position
Desire and vision keeps the fire inside of me glistenin'

I'm infinite like math, so I'm gonna last
But you wanna laugh all day, bullshit and sittin' on your ass
I'm all about cash and the power
A stash with the power that lasts like hittin' ass for an hour

Let's get it locked, I want a watch with baguetted rocks
So I can clock hoes with the glow that never stops
Forget the cops, we got Deserts and glocks too
Ready to rock whoever tryin' to stop our cheddar from stockin' forever

Only got love for gangsta niggas, get doe

That's for all the hatin' niggas waitin' to see me go
Down to the bottom

Playin' the blocks and

Still wouldn't matter, push the rock well like Stockton
Paper chasin', chasin' acres
Operation get rich, take money over a bitch
You see me move low in the six and magazines a flicks

Playin' hard in the porch, plush
Young thuggin' and bossed up
Touch niggas clutchin' what they know they bustin'
We can do whatever nigga, whenever nigga

Really is nothing

Murder INC.'s the underdog
It's a blessin' to ball
We learn a lesson from why'all
How not to fall

Black Child will body a beat, this is airway robbery
When Murder INC. drop albums, that's when gangstas party
What chu know about Ferrari or Cadillac Escalade
Or bitches on Ecstasy, sexy

Eat, sleep, eat and watch freaks eat freaks
Throw it up, put it down for the streets
Who wouldn't fall in love, with a life like this
Hittin' hoes that's priceless

In tight icebergs shit
You can blame the drugs
It ain't gon' change to slugs
A famous thug
Pain is love, mother fuckers!

Who would've thought, we get away with manslaughter
Numerous cars, cribs off the water
A playa no longer, life's gettin' shorter
Tired of hoes takin' offers, instead of orders

The Rule don't condone this
Cause in the late '60's this game was flawless
Until blow got on the rise
Them ol' Jacks was slingin' pies in bell bottoms and buttonflies

But now, pop yo collars, blow set for sag
And we still fly birds L-A-X to Lag
They roll caddies with white walls, we ride Benz with mags
Still the goal remains the same, guard from feds

Why-D to O-G, the game chose me
Are-you-L-E the INC. and I-G
We never gon' break free from this life we live as thugs
Pain is love, it's murda

Thought I could take it for a while maybe.
You'll make it back around baby I just got to live my life.
And now can't see me changing for a while hope I could make it back around.

Anything that I want I can get it boy.
You know you turn me on and on that's why I switch my
Frame of mind of being there when you call always on time.
I'm looking to spread my wings and party,
From everything and for everybody,
Need my space my time alone its like our hearts don't match no more,
Still everything that you want you could get it boy.
You know I still got love for
You in court I plea the fifth my baby.

When you was cheating you was probably thinking I won't sense a thing
But love got funny way of catching up
To lies and your lies can't look me straight in the eyes I'm not surprised that you
Would hurt me baby but why me baby just let me breathe
And I'll fly free babe.

Something I did that you feel is better then whats here at home
And I know a bitch could do bad on her own you're not alone
The way you hurt me baby shit why me baby
I be in pain a little but I know that love is real and as
Long as it lets you go you feel the need to come back to me baby

But I'm hurting while I'm with you (And another one)
And though my heart can't take no more
I won't keep running back to you
(And another one, what? what?)

I think I found my strength to finally get up and leave
No more broken heart for me
No more tellin' your lies to me (And another one)
I'm lookin' like I got my head on right so now I see
No more givin' you everything
There's no more takin' my love from me (what)

Glad to wake up every day without you on my brain
No more waiting late up at night
No more havin' to fuzz and fight
I'm proud to say that I will never make the same mistake
No more thinkin' about what you do
There's no more of me runnin' back to you

See my days are cold without you (Here's Another one)

Some say the x make the sex spec-tacular
Let me lick you from yo neck to yo back
Then ya, shiverin', tongue deliverin'
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If its alright wit' you, we fuckin' (that's cool)
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin' in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between yo legs
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bed
At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot next to yo sister
Damn I really miss the way she used to rub my back when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when yo ass would wiggle
Now I know you used to sweets at the Parker Meridian
Trips to the Caribbean
But tonight, no ends

You must be used to me cryin' (And another one)
While you're out bumpin' and grindin
But I'm leaving you tonight

See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to you
You must be used to me cryin' (And another one)

Ashanti,"What's up you've reached Ashanti leave me a numeric message or a
Voice message and I'll get back to you lata [beep]
Hey girl what's up it's me, yo man remember
Your friend and I've been calling you for the past three weeks
You've never returned any of my
Calls, what happened I thought I was going to see you
At the spot last night yo everybody's
Askin' for you, and you know who be looking for you like crazy,
Man what's going on, what's come
Over you?

I don't know what's come over me I don't know,
I don't know what's come over me, I don't know
What's come over me, I don't know I don't know what's come over me

Because I never felt like this, (I don't want to be wrong cause I like it)
Thinking about the way you kiss,
(I don't want to be wrong but I like it)
I think you stole my heart from me, (See I don't want to be wrong cause I like it)
Cause I belong to somebody (even though it seems wrong I
Can't fight it)it almost feels as if I'm not myself,
I'm nervous bound from someone else I think
I'm falling for somebody else and I can't control myself
It's like some kind of hex is on me
Controlling who I love and how I speak
And when it's gone my heart won't beat tell me what's come
Over me. 

[Chorus]

Because I never felt like this, (I don't want to be wrong cause I like it)
Thinking about the way you kiss,
(I don't want to be wrong but I like it)
You got me thinking I should leave, (see I don't want to be wrong cause I like it).
But I belong to somebody (even though it seems wrong I can't fight it)
I know that I already have a love, he's all I know and all I trust but lately
I've been falling out of love I find myself so deep in lust
And every time he's here with me I
Look into his eyes so desperately but now it's not his face I see,
Tell me what comes over me

[Chorus]

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
(I just don't know) I don't know (what's come over me),
I don't know, I don't know , I don't know, I don't know, I don't
Know, (it's like something is taking complete control over me)
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,
(I can't function I'm not me) I don't know, I don't
Know, I don't know what's come over me, I don't know, I don't know
What's come over me, I don't

What's come over me, I don't know, I don't
Know what's come over me.",Voodoo,2002

Get on my knees till they bloody red, (baby please)

See, I could never feel alone with you (in my life),
I gave up everything I own for you (won't
Think twice), almost a shame how I'm mesmerized (such a shame),
I loose my thought looking in your eyes (I know why)
Because your kisses make my lips quiver and (that's real) and when you
Touch me my whole body shivers. (I can feel) now,
I can see how another life(nother life)could
Have the power to take over mine cause your my.

Of sick how I'm stuck on you(stuck on you)
But I don't care cause I'm needing you (I'm needing you)
And how I feel will remain the same (remains the same)
'Cause you're my baby, (cause your my baby)
Listen and when the world starts to stress me out,
(Where I run) it's to you boy without
A doubt (you're the one) who keeps me sane and I can't complain
(Can't complain) you're like a
Drug you relieve my pain (may seem strange)
You're like the blood flowing through my vain, (oooo)
Keeps me alive and feeding my brain,

It's like we had some kind
Of power over each
Other 
I remember this one time
He called me 
It had to be like, four in the mornin'
Pourin' rain outside
And I was ""knocked out""
But it was like when I heard his voice
Somethin' got me out of bed
And I had to come to him
And it was like
""Whenever you call, I came runnin' """,Narrative Call (Skit),2002
Ashanti,"[Chorus]
Can't believe that it's over baby
But every bruse on my heart you gave me
See we tried but we fight then we cried now it's over babe, it's over babe.

When I met you I knew you would be the one,
'Cause looking at you made me feel kind of crazy,
Now what you asked I almost did it automatically
But it was nothing compared to the joy you gave me.

Although I know that what we had it wasn't perfect babe,
You fooled around, but see back then it didn't phase me
I thought by staying, trying to change you would be worth it babe,
But now I see that trying to change you only changed me.
All these tears,and all of your lies
All these years and now we're saying goodbye, it's over babe.

[Chorus: x2]

Now I'm thinking that I never should have dealt with you,
All this screaming and this yelling
That we go through raining late at night I'm sitting waiting up for you
Just to tell you how I hate who you turned into,
See ain't no way I'm gonna sit and take this shit from you,
I'm never playing another day of being your fool,
I wasted all my time on something that just wasn't true,
I should have known I could never ever change you.
All these tears, and all of your lies,
All these years and now we're saying goodbye it's over babe.

[Chorus: x2]

I'll never forget what you did to me so I'm gone I'm leaving leaving baby,
I'll never forget
What you did to me so I'm gone I'm leaving leaving baby.
Whenever you see me don't even speak,
I'll never forget what you did to me.
Whenever you see me don't even speak, I'll never forget what you did to me.

[Chorus: x4]

I'll never forget what you did to me so I'm gone I'm leaving, leaving baby.
I'll never forget

All alone and I'm feeling wanted
Try to wait but my body's calling, you're the one so why don't
You come and rescue me,
I'll be here while you on your way, counting down till I see your face,
Hurry up cause I love the way you rescue me.
Now you're here, come on out, the rain soaking wet
Body glistening, finally we could do something so rescue me,
Can't believe how it's going down,
I'm so obsessed with this love I found it got my head spinning
Round and round just rescue me.

All night long Take me away to another place,
Rescue me save me, save me save me all night long
Take me away to another place rescue me
Save me, save me, save me

I come alive when I feel your touch 
And I can drown In this pool of love, you could get what I'm thinking of
Come rescue me, what you think couldn't be replaced
If you were gone I would find a way to get you back,
'Cause I love the way you rescue me, laying here with you in the dark
I always knew you could shift my heart,
When I'm with you I don't want to stop so rescue me,
Only you can fulfill my need take me away from this agony,
I want to live out my fantasy just rescue me.

Something inside me held me back,

Are the people who look and think like you

You'll learn things you never knew, you never knew

Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains?
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colours of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun sweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends

How high will the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountains
We need to paint with all the colours of the wind

And I can't help it if he wants to buy a drink

And I can't help it if he's lookin' up my skirt
And I'm not mad 'cause I'm only having fun
Ya see I can't bring my man to the club

See me and her was going to the club that night
I seen him and I knew that he was just my type
Rolling through the club and then he winked his eye
Licked his lips real slow then he said hello
He made his way to say how ya doin', what's yo' name
I told him I'm Ashanti and he said I'm glad ya came
He asked about my man and when's the next time I'd be free
I slyly shook my head then I said thank you for the drink

And I'm not mad 'cause I'm only having fun
Ya see I can't bring my man to the club

I was dancing on the floor 'cause my song was on
The people looked behind me, said his name was Sean
He told me that he liked the way I moved my hips
Snapped my fingertips, then I licked my lips
He was going on free and we decided to leave
He walked me to the car and said he'd pay my parking fee
As we rolling out the lot he said he wanted to chill
I slyly shook my head then I said thanks for paying the bill

And I can't, deny I (love it when I'm wit'chu baby)

I, got a fetish for fuckin' you wit'cha skirt on
On the backstreet in the back seat of the Yukon
What's takin' so long? I'm gettin' anxious
But patiently waitin' for you to tell a nigga to move on
Between me and you, we can find each other
Flyin' abroad in my private G-2
I ain't tryin' to G you, ma I'm tryin' to see you
Bend over, you know how we do it, feet to shoulders
Bring heat to coldest night, so ferocious
Now you street promotin' the dick game is potent
Cause in the bed a nigga go hard like Jordan
Sweat pourin', lovin' the way you be moanin'
Grippin' the sheets, lookin' at me lickin' at me
Cause every woman just wanna be happy
And it's crazy, but baby, I (love it when I'm wit'chu baby)

I wanna get away, cause you know like I know
And there's a better day, a-comin', I'm hooked on your lovin'
Believe me, and when you hold my body
I know you need me, wait for me bay-bay
I've been goin' half crazy for your love
And I was told that the sex, better than drugs
Then get addicted, boy listen
I'm the only piece of the puzzle you're missin'
Like when we kissin' bye bye bye
You got a girl that'll ride ride ride
So take me, tonight
And do what you do to me baby

Shorty, are you really gettin' bored with me, or him?
Cause though I play a lot of games, I play 'em to win
(But then again I'm still young and I'm livin' my life)
You know you're right and I'm the type
To pull up to your bumper, get your number
(BABY, I can only help but wonder)
What life would be without (my sweet baby)
And you're my baby (holla if you hear me)

You can understand that my love is pain
And how I feel in vain, it's just a woman thing
(It's a man's world, but I understand)
But there's still nothin' different boy, stick to the plan
(You be my down ass, wit'cha round ass)
I know I'm feelin' you (like you feelin' me)
The way you're holdin' my body, the way you touch me

And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy

I never knew what I went through
But hoped everything'd turn out right
I'm rememberin' the days that I was holdin' my head down
When people came around I always pretended to smile
But I knew
Deep in my heart
That I was slowly
Fallin apart
Some days
All I wanted
Was to hold my mother's hand
And hear her say

You're gonna make it""

Don't want nobody to think
It was easy for me
It took a while just to get down
Too many people just didn't believe
I'm remembering the sacrifices that I had to make
I would cry myself to sleep and say that it would be ok
But I knew
That if I prayed
That I would be on my way someday
Some times
All I wanted
Was to hear my father say
He would say
""Baby...
You're gonna make it
And I don't care what people say""

I can't really explain it
I'm so into you now
I wanna be more than a friend to you now
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the 90s in the two thou
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
'Cause the kids ready to tell you how he feel and a few vows
Maybe I speak in general now
But girl, I'mma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikinis in the winter too now
What you think about tan lines on the skin of you now?
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou
On Fifth Ave, shopping sprees and them dinners to Chow's
I ain't concerned what other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now
And I ain't jealous, it's the principle now
I'm so into you

I really like what you've done to me

I woulda traded it all, in orderly fashion

Just off the shore, so you can hear when the water be splashin'
The drop top three and a quarter we dashin'
The flawless diamonds, and the border we flashin'
The money, we oughta be stashin'
I make sure every quarter be cashed in, I can't really explain it
My friend be thinkin' I'm slippin', these girls be thinkin' I'm trippin'
What kinda weed he be smokin', what type of drinks you be sippin'
Sweet thing, just to think of you dippin'
Would have me with the blue's so hard, you would think I was Crippin'
Now, you relaxin' in the Benz, credit cards with no limits
So you don't worry about maxin' when you spend

How'd you like it if, both our name's had Jackson on the ends, uh

I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it

I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you, it ain't because my whips is roofless
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary envy es dipped Jesus'
Other ballers look dumb when they press you, five and sixes
You don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Bein' a player was becomin' too stressful
But every since, the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Barts, while the villa be painted
Just so we can get really acquainted
The love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted

So don't make a fool of me, just love me 

Say that you want me 
Say that you'll never leave me 
You gotta tell me you need me 
Don't let them take your love away 

Say that you want me 
Say that you'll never leave me 
You gotta tell me you need me 
Don't let them take your love away 

Now they say that me loving you will hurt me 
And they say its a matter of time before you break my heart 
But even when we're far apart I always feel that you are with me 
I hope and pray almost everyday that our love never goes away 
'Cause I can't see where I would be without your love all over me 
So don't make a fool of me just love me and say 

Say that you want me 
Say that you'll never leave me 
You gotta tell me you need me 
Don't let them take your love away 

Say that you want me 
Say that you'll never leave me 
You gotta tell me you need me 
Don't let them take your love away  

Baby your all, all that I need, need in my life, right here with me 
Baby your all, all that I need, need in my life, right here with me 

Say that you want me 
Say that you'll never leave me 
You gotta tell me you need me 
Don't let them take your love away",Don't Let Them,2004

And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share, somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop

I've been on TV straight for five years

Let's keep it real, I cant lie to y'all
My eyes are now something like binoculars
You put a Dollar on my hand, I'ma part of any plan
I'm focus, y'all niggas need to holla at me, man

He use to touch me, love me
Hug me, kiss me, hold me everyday
I never thought that I'd be finding out
That you gave your love away

Now how do you expect for me to stay
Wake up everyday with this on the brain
So I'ma say thanks and I'ma be on my way

Now I've got my head right
I can finally say good bye
To all the lies and the lonely nights
So focused

Now I've made up my mind
You were just a waste of time
But now I'm fine
'Cuz I'm focused you out of my life

I'm focus now

I never thought that you would treat me
Like I'm just another girl
Thought, I was something to you
Something new

It's me and you against the world
But now I see this wasn't real
Just another game tryna play the field
So I'ma let go and Imma move on my own

That I'm focus and that's an under statement
And I don't know what someone was thinking

If I'm not mistaken, I heard his little heart was akin
He ain't sleeping the same the people done changed

But we can have a bed fight, get the head right every night

Don't advise much more 
Only when you're apart if feels like living life is hard 
Your entire world just seems so dark 
Then it lights up 'cause you are my shining star 
And I don't know what I'd do without you

[Paul Wall] 
(Paul Wall, What It Do?)
It's the Houston Hard Hitter out the 713, it's ""The People's Champ,"" Paul Wall, yeah that's me.
Come take a ride with a playa out the 'Lone Star State'.
I'm just a hustler on the grind known for gettin' that cake.
I came up from the bottom, now I reside at the top.
I used to run away from cops, but now it's benzes I cop.
I used to post up on the block like Yao Ming in the paint, 
But now I pimp the parkin' lot, drivin' slow n sippin' drank.
With Ashanti on my side as I glide like Clyde, 
and nothin' less than 24 inches of chrome on my ride.
It's just somethin' bout the way I tip 4s and grip grain 
And got these boppers on the sidelines goin insane.
I got 'em moanin', my mackin' game is outta
Control, but I don't know if it's my looks or my big bank roll.
I'm 24 years old with my mouth all gold, my games cold and now the stories been told.
It's Paul Wall, baby (baby).

[Ashanti]
See I don't know why (why)
I'm feelin' just the way I do (do)
It's been a long time (time)
I thought that I was over you, but now you're coming around again
I'll be remembering what you said
I just can't take it, and I don't wanna go back, oh no.

[Chorus:]
What is a girl to do, if she's still on it, yes
If she done been there before with you, and now she don't want it, yeah
We've spent time and time again.
I just wish this thing would end.
Tell me, what is a girl to do, if she's still on it.

Whenever we talk (talk)
It feels like we had somethin' strong (strong)
And knowin' it's wrong, we tried to do this thing before, but when you coming real close to me
Bringing back all of them memories
I just can't fake it, but I don't wanna go back, oh no.

[Chorus]

[Method Man] 
(uhn, yeah)
Auntie Ashanti's a problem, this track here's a problem.
The best thing rockin' since that cotton came to Harlem.
Meth darlin', I'm like that Hershey with the almonds, and I don't pay for nothin', but your pardon.
They start and I finish.
My animals is starvin' for dinners
Straight up menace, y'all don't get involved in my business. 
Look, I witness, spotted like a blemish, off gimmicks.
I'm 59/50 authentic.
Tilted with that NY on it.
There's money to be made, and I want it.
See, my palm been itchin' for the longest, so scratch that, paper like NASDAQ.
We laughed that life, roll the dice, get the cash back, I'm nice.
Plus, I got the juice, so I goes well with ice.
Been drug tested 3 times failed it twice.
Ashanti, you doin' it big, don't hurt 'em auntie.
Matter fact, you killin 'em girl, you're murder mami.

Closed the blinds like the -- was rhyming and we hit the malls spending G's all the
Time and you was on the side through out I was grindin and you was surprised wit minks
And showered wit diamonds but you will always be a part for life even if another get
To call tou a wife, just rememba who put the bread into the crib in the same crib
That you want you're kids living in now no matter how eva you may feel now even if you
Wanted to consider yourself his now, I'm still down for you

You came into my world and taught me thangs 
And I can't lie cause boy you did yo' thangs 
Feel like I'm floatin when I hear yo' name 
I think you made me fall in love again 

[Z-Ro - over Chorus] 
Okay 
Screwed Up Click 
Yeah 

[Z-Ro] 
Whenever you need a nigga call me up I'm on my way 
Sex or serious conversation, I'll listen to what you have to say 
This ain't gotta see about a wham bam thank you ma'am 
I'm not like these other fellas although I know you think I am 
Even though I kick it with a lot of - females 
I can honestly tell you that I ain't gotta - female 
But since I'm fresh out of jail you probably thank that I just wanna bone 
Hit it, quit it, then delete your # from my mobile phone 
Can't you see the tattoo reads one deep 
So I need only one lil' momma, one cup of codeine and one Swisher sweet 
Weight of the world is on my shoulders because I'm thuggin 
But sometimes even the hardest of us need some lovin 
And the first time with you is like my first time again 
Like rediscoverin rap music, writin my first rhyme again 
You say you feel like you're floatin, well I'm floatin too 
Everybody's leavin, now you know it's time for you and Z-Ro to do 

[Chorus] 

[Z-Ro] 
Now tell the truth; I'm like a mechanic when I work my tool 
So brace yourself baby so I can hit you with the mule 
Everytime I touch ya I'ma find a new hot spot, it's guaranteed 
I'm a thug nigga but still a romantic so pass the weed 
Now you ain't no dimepiece, you a whole dollar 
And I'd rather be givin you ""Fuck Faces"" 
Ain't tryin to pay these hoes no bother 
You see I consider myself as a king 
But I can't reach a comfort zone 'til I find myself a queen 
So we can rule together, it's picture perfect me and you together 
Go through our good and bad moods together 
Plus I'm concerned if you don't come home 
Long as you call me and let me know you alright I'ma stay offa ya phone 
Ain't none of that drivin by ya mama house or callin private 
The way you hug me when you see me let me know you my chick 
And I ain't scared to put that icing on your finger either 
You're my sunny day when it be rainin 
It's a blessin momma sing for the future 

[Chorus] 

[Z-Ro] 
Me and you is like a feelin that I get when I roll on 22's 
And I'ma keep you stylin when I'm shoppin for you 
Plenty ice, plenty clothes, plenty shoes 
But don't get it confused, I ain't trickin cause I'm pimpin 
But without you in my life I would be barely livin, mayne 
What we do in my arms is like doja to the brain 
I promise you like a drug you're much better than everythang 
Now if I was to try to hold in this love, I would choke 
Cause it's some potent shit like from Humboldt County on the West coast 
Yeah I think I fell in love again, it's on 
It's so real I feel I won't have to make another ""I Hate You Bitch"" song

Rollin' a double R

Way out, so when trouble tried to find me can't
Never visioned living longer than my twenty first
Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out or in the dirt

It comes with the fame

Talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me
And so I pull it out my pocket let it rain you see

See we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle
Power to the real niggas death to the sucker's
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em

Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places
Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried
Bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried

Never thought you'd be like that, be like that 
What you do in life comes right back, comes right back 
Baby I'm still here, I'm still here, I'm still here
Baby I'm still here, I'm still here 
Never thought you'd be like that, be like that 
What you do in life comes right back, comes right back

I used to look into your eyes and think
That you were the one that was meant for me
Everything that you would say I believed it
You manipulated me did it so creatively

Slowly took away from me, most of my integrity
Used to say that I could be
Everything and all you need
Started doing little things back then I couldn't see
But now that the rain is gone, yes I'm still here

[Chorus playing in the background]
And I see you for who you are
And you're not far from the devil babe
So I pack my heart and run away
So far away
Yes I'm still here

They use to tell me I was nothing and couldn't make it there
And so I made and they hated, 'cause I'm staying here
I put my trust into my faith everyday
With all the blood and sweat and tears
All the passion all the years

Now its crowds and love and cheers
No more crying no more fear
Used to cry myself to sleep thinking it could never be
Then I pick myself up and stood on my two feet
And now that the rain is gone yes I'm still here

[Chorus in playing in the background]
And I see you for who you are
And you're not far from the devil babe
So I pack my heart and run away

But everything that I think
And all the love that we make
It never should took place

I should have let you go

I've been, I've stressed you out
And really get you fed up
I will never ever gonna let up
Unless it makes you happy for me to shut up
But I ain't shutting up, because I really wanna give it to you
I can't replace a feeling when we get up with each other
And I ain't trying to lose you
Now what you expect me to do, let's take a of trip with you to Honolulu
Come on, maybe we can spend some time together
Tried to make a better girl, I choose you

I could have you floating higher than what you got in that cup
I could tear that thing up, I could tear that thing up

Baby, I'm helpless, yeah
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm
Helpless, baby
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in 'em

I ain't never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at the revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart sang
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody dancin' and the bass top volume
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
Saying to myself, baby
""This one's mine""

Shorty made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking ""What's she gonna do?""
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' ""I'm through""
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm

Helpless, yeah
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit I'm

Helpless, baby
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in 'em

One week later, I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at this girl, 'cause she wants to form a harem
No, I ain't sharin'

Two weeks later, in the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced while you're asking for his blessin'
I'm dying inside, as you wine and dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry
'Cause there's nothing that your mind can't do

My father makes his way across the room to you
I panic for a second, thinking ""we're through""
But then he shakes your hand and says ""be true""
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm

Helpless, yeah

Ashanti, I ain't got a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Queens and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father died, my mama cried, I grew up buck wild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
As long as I'm alive, Ashanti, swear to God
You'll never feel so (Baby I'm)

Ashanti,"Oh yeah she was taking me over 
Oh yeah it was the start of the summer 
On warm June evenings 
She would come to my house 
Still in her school skirt 
And her summer blouse 
Talking too long as the night came on 
It was the best time of my life 
Her bee stung lips 
Kisses sweeter than wine 
The things she whispered 
With breathless sighs 
The summer air was soft and warm 
Her eyes were making silent demands 
And as her hair came undone in my hands 
Oh Yeah she was taking me over 
Oh Yeah it was the start of the summer 
Driving her home after midnight 
I felt so good everything was alright 
Her thoughts seemed lost in the night sky 
I remember everything 
I don't know why these things ever end 
I sometimes wish it was that summer again 
I still see her in my sleep 
And hear the sighing of the summer wind 
Still I don't regret one thing

Todo, todo se olvida

El día que me quieras

Se vestirá de fiesta
Con su mejor color
Y al viento las campanas
Dirán que ya eres mía
Y locas las fontanas

Hará nido en tu pelo

We all, we all got our own thing, 
And here's mine.

Now my things was cool
I swore id never break the rules
Straight with you cause I could relate to you
Stay with you
Special in my book
In my point of view he couldn't sex you like I could
You got with you wanted
And flaunted what you wanted 
And I went a little further even when you didn't want it
'Cause right in time, right what I had in mind 
Plus your heads been right in mine (my mind)
So I took the time, my choice was to love you.
And I didn't listen when they said never should I trust you.
So why must you take me for granted
I swore you loved me too, damn ill never understand it. 
I'm a man with feeling to and I'm a fool for the way I still feel for you.
But here's to you, I'm a better man then that 
You took my heart then and now I want it back 
So come on

[Chorus]
Told me you and I might live together someday (someday)
Now I see it in a whole new other way
And ain't gonna lie girl you need to realize
I'm staying home tonight (so come on)
Said I wanna be alone (said I wanna be alone)
All by myself
Said I'm staying home, I don't need no one else (wanna be alone)

I was cool, gave you one more chance
You gave the same old song, same old dance,
So hell with it, I had to face that shit.
You was to immature for relationships,
So I moved on for the time being, 
Then I heard a lie, there's a guy that you were caught seeing,
I flipped shits, but you flipped shits right back,
You cried you knew I wouldn't do you like that,
Still my heart was lonely, nobody to hold me.
You was my only, damn girl you was my homie,
You know me, you said you were stuck back there, 
So when I tried you leave you sucked me right back in. 
Why would I taste what I already ate? 
So I took time to get my priorities straight.
So listen you know me well I hate to doubt you,
But girl truth is I'm better off with out you and

[Chorus]

Damn girl I thought it never would end.
But this is it that's all, never again.
I couldn't deal with it then and I sure can't now.
So what makes you think I'ma let you hold me down, no.
I told you before never to roam but this is real when I say leave me alone.
I gotta be on my own, and you do too.
Through and through just please let me do what I do.
Maybe sometime soon we can both be friends,
But for now this is where its suppose to end.
My brain is sick, my heart is torn, my arms are empty,
But baby girl I just need to be alone,
My heart will beat alone, and I keep my head up.
But truth is now I'm a little bit fed up. 
I don't hate you though, you still close to me. 
So lets just go back to how we used to be, cool..

I don't wanna be here in this chair, 
Waiting on you aw baby, to see things my way
Why don't you see things my way

Asher D,"Ha, ha, ha, whatcha laughin at?

Megaman up first and he won't second no shit

Yo G, roll by in a blacked out TT, Megaman carry two gats easy
Seeing stars, and a mister wanna jack me
Jack me say come step to me, the last
Thing that you saw was icy, bitch
Say nigga wanna see Mega get rich
But niggas don't really want Mega to be rich

Addicted to this life that we're tastin'
You blame me for the life you been wasting
Your hating, but there's money to be making

Thug of the family, who could I be?
M with the A to the C that's me
Thug of the family, who could I be?

Player haters they are

Watching and they're plottin and they're watchin my stops
Watching and they're plottin and they're watchin my crops

Yo run it up, give up flow,
Ha give me the cash, give me the doe,
Yo I've been the bad guy and the hero,
As long as the police make ma statements grow.

I'm making money from Jim to the Joe,

Want to live life, bringing the family,
Want to kick back and watch them spend money,
So niggas want to feel when I'm hypie like say the words,
Want to see do you recite me (what?)

Wait what would you do if you were me?
Would you scrape now away from the big heat?
Niggas want to see niggas get rich,
But niggas don't want to see me to live pricey, 

Nicely, everywhere you like to live, you'd settle with me, 
Come into ma crib g,
Oh I see niggas want to bite the dust thinking mega?s 
Gonna to do his own thing g,

Back in the day, I had no luxury,
That never stopped because of ma bravery,
You get shook when you're ne-are me

Spin keys make money for centuries,
Had doe and enough when I spend ma g?s,
People on ma back always wanting freebies,
Get out of ma face, 

Watch me on T.V.
Listen you don't really want to see me, 
When it's dark outside and I'm angry,
I grow up wishes for girls like a genie,

I press in the car with my CD's,
I'm stack in my car in my TT,
I'm bus big up show you want to see me,
Danger when you're ne-are me, 
You can't hear me, but you feel me.

Why d'you really want to imitate me?

Why is that you just want to be me,
But you can't see that you're the only one to the scene.

Yeah, we're both strong
At least we can pretend
But I- I still feel the same
Yeah I- would fall for you again

When time slows down we can work it out
Sometimes I've found life?s too loud
We?ll find somehow a world without a doubt
If we hold on for now

Slow down
And look what we've done
Torn to pieces on the floor
Now that you're gone
You found yourself
But I ? I lost it all
But that's just the way that we fall

If you are mine where do I belong

Shit believe the thought we're all equal
Ain't a man on God's green be underneath any other
I don't wanna play preacher
But but I swear they turn their ear when we talk about peace and love
Sometimes might need a hug yea we all wanna come on up above
But this ain't about Jesus, no way, no Abe, no Ike, Moses or Mohammed
Yea it's all about believing, full steam ahead
Because I know the worst times are behind me
I don't wanna sound cheesy but but but I just a really mean it eh eh yea
I'm tellin' I can feel it eh eh it's the reason I don't sleep
I be way too geek tonight

I, I've been on my grind

'Bout time to change a few things
We enslaved to the bank and we only wanna buy new shoes
The way that we think
We can do anything that we really wanna put our minds too
The American dream, the dream is a pyramid scheme, scheme
And it feels outta reach when it's hard and times are tough
But change starts with us yep, yep
We all want freedom yea to be who we be
I don't wanna be afraid when I speak to say what I'm feeling
Yea together we're strong but divided never been so weak
It's time we get even, yea yea, and really what I mean is, is, is
This change I can feel it, yea yea, Mr. President I think it's all gonna be O.K.

So it's not about fame, and fortune
It's about believing and believing in yourself
And understanding that this life is life
It's liberty and the pursuit of happiness
And happiness isn't about getting what you want all the time
It's about loving what you have

Had to walk around the block, couldn’t take no more!
Like escaper from the rock, couldn’t wait no more
Sean Con cocked penis mightier than the sword
So I’m sleeping with the whores while I file for divorce
Plain and simple and in short, when it rains, man, it pours
Stepping in manure, second sippin in the moor
Quickest leopard gets the boar, secret weapons win the war
Guessed, but I’m pretty sure that I’m destined to endure
Flesh into the core, Pauly D to Pauly Shore
World of cyborgs and tours of cyberspace
What’s behind the door the allure something strange?
Of course, this is why I came, the forces are untamed
No corporate or dumb fame, I'll record for chump change
Course is unphased, contorted or concave
I'm sort of a poor sport, nothing short of Liu Kang
Got me feeling like

I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes
My scars and my stripes, You know I will survive
The strength that I find when I dig down deep inside
Got me still in this fight, and I’ll be the last man standing!

I be throwing up a lot but I ain't here for my health
When I'm feeling like blah, I had to loosen my belt
Ate the corn right off the cob, didn't need no help
So, now I've come to realize I'm on my own for real
So most of em I approach em with a Slomin's Shield
Keep my enemies close cause they prone to steal
When friends become foes know you're doing it well
Just keep it going
I'm a red pill taker, who's my real maker?
Group homes and tombstones to feel safer
Loopholes for new souls, lets keep praying
Too grown to complain, I create the lane I stay in
Forever underrated, so now I'm Nicholas Cage-ing it
Doing all about anything as long as you put my face in it
Face it, I didn't want to be famous, but that's the way it is
Way I play the game, no wonder the brother made it like

I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes
My scars and my stripes, You know I will survive

Got me still in this fight, and I’ll be the last man standing!

Handsome bachelor, awesome rapper
Got a knack for, vernacular
When I perform, spectacular
I'll have any girl that I want
I'm a take the girl in the front
Boobs bounce when I tell the crowd jump
Honey come backstage I just wanna have fun, but
I'm too young to be locked down, not now
Need a new car, drive around with the top down
New broad with a bra the top down
Chilling in the backseat screaming out loud

She wants to be my lady
But I don't see her
She wants to be my lady
But I'm a free bird

I gotta fly by myself, go get high myself this time

And yeah I like you but not enough to wife you
You say I'm nice, true, and you think I'm the right dude
But there's another girl just like you (like who?)

And on the road, 'nother night, 'nother show
New e-vent in a new time zone
And the live show is so mind-blowin
And it's my show so you know I'm blown (you know)

Jacuzzi's and groupies, boobies and booze
And no rules, I'm only 22
I need to watch football and hang with a crew
But if you don't get mad when I get fat
Cause all I do is eat drink smoke weed and rap
And play Madden, then dag
You're pretty rad and I take it all back, come on

Asher Roth,"Take me as I em my friends, ain't gon' change,
Wont be no Em, rock these songs,
Rock these shows, only good life I know

I was in seventh grade when I heard the Slim Shady LP,
Ya my mom brought it down when I was ironing, irony,
Getting out the wrinkles, just a little kid in middle school,
Sink my teeth in anything just to think I'm cool, riding the bus,
I feel the rush but I still don't give a fuck,
Ya I wish I could agree but I've already had enough,
I've already given up from playing the same game,
Every interview I feel like I'm saying the same thing, like,
Em was great, yea he paved the way for me,
He was inspiration for everybody from A to Z,
But they keep relating me, I cant get away,
Chasing me, (all day long), I hear it, (all day long),
And now the masters thinks that Asher wants to be a Marshall Mathers,
They say ""Ashers not a rapper, na hes actually just a actor"",
Cause we have the same complexion and similar voice inflection,
Its easy to see the pieces and reach for that connection,
Every minute, each hour of everyday,
Im constantly on the fence defending my own name,
Explaining we are not the same,
Not much that I can say, except that im sick of it,
Critics arrogantly sparked up a flame, its on

[Chorus: x2]
Take me as I em my friends, ain't goin' change,
Wont be no Em, rock these songs,
Rock these shows, only good life I know

Now don't get it twisted, I've definitely benefited,
Its like suddenly everyone wants to hear what I've been spitting,
Its so different, the image they don't get it,
Its simple I'm just a kid who wants to rap to make a living,
But Em was in it way before I committed ,
And his lyrics were the shit so I really gotta come with it,
But each critics been picking apart my writings,
And if its not up to par then Ashers par is just a gimmick,
Is it my fault must I be more convincing?,
Y'all talk all you want, never halt me from my mission,
Using his ammunition, would you please keep dissing me,
(all day long), I hear it, (all day long),
And yea the haters wanna hate because I made it and I'm famous,
But until you take my place, 
Y'all never know what it takes to make a record for respect, 
Take a second before you inspect,
When you look like someone else then what the fuck do you expect,
I just want to be accepted as the illest in the game,
But its harder for an artist creating his own lane,
That's anonymous with his rhyming and combine with perfect timing,
All the time all that's declining and about to explode

[Chorus: x2]

So fuck it that's all I got, there's nothing else for me to say,
If I don't confront the problem it will never go away,
Unless it is addressed there is nothing left for me to do,
Its impossible rejecting an elephant in the room,
Say goodbye to all the bullshit, notions preconceived
Sworn to all the wrongs, could of swore they knew me,
If you have no further questions and cant think of other thoughts,
Then let me introduce you to Asher Paul Roth.

[Chorus: x2]",As I Em,2009
Asher Roth,"Uh, and it just keeps goin' (yeah)
And it just keeps

So I'm in the airport getting ready to leave
Heading to a friend's wedding in the N.Y.C
But my head has been spinning, I'm forgetting to eat
All this jet setting has been really getting to me
It's already 11:20, I'm ready to sleep
But instead I end up sitting in a 27-C
An aisle seat, fine by me
But the guy that's inside's always tryin' to pee
With a wild child behind me, he's cryin' and keeps
Flippin out and kickin' at me while he violently screams
So I silently plea, oh God, please
Let there be a honey sitting 27-B
But of course some morbidly obese
Beast is in the seat that wheezes when he breathes
Dude sitting D is at least three deep
And he keeps telling me what is wrong with his knees: (I got bad knees)
'Osgood Schlatters,' just need water
But for a bottle they charge two dollars (what?)
And when I thought that it couldn't get worse
I forgot my iPod

I'm havin' a bad day
Nothin' ever seems to go my way
Everybody needs to go away
Why? Because I'm havin'' a bad day, yeah (oh no no no)
And it just keeps goin' (keep goin')
And it just keeps (goin' on!)
And it just keeps goin' (keep goin')
And it just keeps (goin' on)

So four hours and turbulence
We land when I'm about to turd in my pants
But the captain has ""Seatbelt fastened""
So my ass is just passin gas and
Then at last I escaped from the plane
When I'm minutes away from clinically insane
I make my way towards baggage claim
When I hear a high-pitched voice scream my name (Asher!)
Some dumb bitch I went to high school with
While I'm sweating she's telling me she likes my shit
I just smile and think, 'bout how great it would be
If I could just hit this chick with a quick leg sweep (leg sweep)
So I pick up my L.L. Bean
And beeline for the next taxi (taxi)
In need of weed, and boxer briefs
But my bag's only got Maxi's

I'm havin' a bad day
Nothin' ever seems to go my way
Everybody needs to go away
Why? Because I'm havin' a bad day, yeah
(And it keep goin')' and it just keeps goin' (keep goin')
And it just keeps (goin' on!)
And it just keeps goin' (keep goin')
And it just keeps (goin' on)

I check in to my hotel room
And I pick up my cell phone to dial the groom
Tell him my mood and I'm ordering food
And I'm probably gonna stay in and watch a movie
But the tube has no HBO (what?)
So anything I want, yo I'm paying fo'
But I'm lame and broke, so I'm laying in a robe
Watching that ""Little People, Big World"" show
Right then there's a knock at the door
It's my last hope for a Spanish whore
Who will change my sheets in exchange for penis
""Hi, I've lost my cat, have you seen it?""
Jesus, this day is the worst
At least I can give Little Me a jerk
And then go to sleep, healthy and disease-less
I guess it could be worse, but I'm just

I'm havin' a bad day
Nothin ever seems to go my way
Everybody needs to go away
Why? Because I'm havin' a bad day, yeah
Oh oh oh
And it just keeps goin' (keep goin')
And it just keeps (goin' on!)
And it just keeps goin' (keep goin')
And it just keeps (goin' on)

Hey, and it keep goin' on

Asher Roth,"I remember Way Back I mean way back ages. 
Eighth grade I think, feels like yesterday. 
Bowl cuts was the craze I was crazy 
Long blond hair all over the place. 
And I'm pale as I ever was baby face, 
With a frame like a skeleton. Skinny kid, 
No friends still love by everyone. 
No shit I was cool, I had plenty fun. 
World wish I would grow up big, no not built, 
But they said, drink my milk. 
Didn't get no where switched up diet. 
Started having hip hop. 
Pop's didn't like it. 

Wanted more Springsteen, Earth, Wind, Fire. 
Felt that was fine but to rhyme had to try it. 
Couldn't hide the fact that I wanted to rap. 
Bought Jay Z CD wit my own pension. 
And that was back in 98 wit the Langley sniffling, money ain't a thing. 
And even though I couldn't relate, 
I kept studying, and listening and stuffing my face.

[Chorus: x2]
I don't, feel like I'm falling (cause I'm so high)
I don't, feel like I'm falling (cause I'm so fly)

And then came High School started picking up a mic thought I was cool. 
My friend said yo homie, you know that your white dude? 
I said what for real? Yo its all good. 
Cause like this, when I tried it, liked it, flipped it, hyped it. 
Insisted the mic be positioned just right. 
Just like that 9th grade footy heard, straight from the Philly burbs. 
Feel me? Pretty sure. 
Suburban threat was the name, we would really work, 
Steady spending the day spitting silly versus. 
No curses, righting bout our girlfriends. 
Ball point pen, head spinning like a whirlwind. 
Getting on the mic, I'm a wizard like Merlin. 
Breaking barriers, tearing walls like its Berlin.

[Chorus: x2]

And I think it was the summer of 12th grade? 
When Uncle C passed away leaving us empty. 
And it hurt, real bad, disturbed, real sad. 
But we had to move on so in fact real fast, 
We wrote this song about falling ones, miscues, 
And the misuse of words used to dis due. 
So true. 
In a serious face I'm convinced god works in mysterious ways, 
Like everything happens for a reason. 
I had to believe it, cause that explains why the leave us. 
As in people that mean everything. 
I got love for them all, they'll be their if I fall But.

Asher Roth,"He leans back from his deck
Rubs the back of his neck
The stress takes effect
Grips the bridge of his nose
Squints while showing emotions he normally won't at fifty six, 
He re-evaluates possible regretting some decisions that he's made.
Black is turning Grey patches of his age
Reflecting from the glasses that pass of every page
Passionately day reads
Reading on occasion
Dreaming of the day when he could do the same thing
He's always wanted to write
That's all hes wanted in life
With two daughters,a son,and a remarkable wife
Hes in a bond
Hes has to provide
A family is relying on a Milli to survive
His father died at fifty six 
So hes well aware of how vital a father figure is
How big of a responsibility it is
To be a good husband and care for your kids
Never miss an evening, help them with their homework, 
Discipline to prevent things when their older
His only son is only twenty one and focus as a poet has only just begun
Papa isn't dumb, he understands what this means
His dream is my dream and my dream is his dream

[Chorus]
I close my eyes and I can see(history)
The sacrifices he made for me(history)
Put is aside for his family(history)
So I'ma keep it alive(yeah)

And so he targeted to be the dream guardian
Guarding it from anything and anyone whose harming it
But in his heart he knows the hardest thing is 
Giving up his dream and being all about his kids
As he kisses the lips of his misses 
For twenty four years going on the twenty fifth
He thinks to himself this alone is a wealth
Better than anything that's bought and then sold on a shelf
Sometimes a dream is all that we have
We have to continue to dream
Once it is lost amongst our thoughts
What really are we?

[Chorus]

So he sits back at his desk
Cracking his knuckles and back his neck
Faxing a paper displaying his name 
On another application explaining the name
Things that they should know but the things they don't
All the things that distinguish him as an adult
Over the phone he can never expose
The roll that he choose
The roll in his home
And at home he is a leader, a father
He'll prove it by using his son and his daughters
In their life he'll be playing the part of the one who inspires
The one we admire
His only son is only twenty one and focus as a poet has only just begun
Papa isn't dumb, he understands what this means
My dream is his dream and his dream is my dream

How about I take you to my spot, spot, spot, spot?
We can take off all our clothes, he won't call anymo'
You hear my lion roar, head high, eyes closed

You begin to describe all things we do
In a big, big bed in an empty room
Look at you on me, then me on you
With a warm washcloth and a few ice cubes

Did it get so wet? No, I'm not my best
When I make you sweat
Ready now get set 'cause you get no rest
I'ma smack that butt, I'ma grab them breasts

Yeah, tell me what you like, can I scratch and bite?
We can scratch that fight, make it last all night
Slidin' on your side and curves, satisfy the primal urge
Ridin' on you back and forth, that's how you make my lion roar

Head high, I'm low
Hear my lion roar, lion roar
Head high, I'm low
Hear my lion roar, lion roar

On the mic I'm a beast, I'm a big bad beast
I could speak that heat, I don't need no reason
Jeepers, them big teeth you be feedin'
Better leave now, I'm 'bout to be eatin'

Even you stick around and we beatin'
Bleedin', have him laid out on the cement
Breathin', I had him back in your team and
Leave in peace and have a safe evenin'

Beef is not what I like to do
Speakin' just to enlighten you
Teach him a rhyme and preach in the mind
And a beautiful thing keep fightin' through

Just how big's the fight in you?
Tight and high and mighty or a lighty
Hide your heiny when a giant hasn't frightened you
Look in my eyes, you see my pride?

You see the fire burnin' down the side
Will and drive'll make a man, doin' what you say I can
Oh, you think I'm playin'?
Well, let's see just what you made of then

Head high, I'm low
Hear my lion roar, lion roar
Head high, I'm low
Hear my lion roar, lion roar

Busta Bust and I'm back on my bullshit now
C'mon, got to make you wanna jump, jump, jump
And I come with another banger and I know you wanna bump
Cap and gown when I smack you down
And I graduated homie bangin' in the trunk

Put yo' hands where my eyes could see
Let me take this thing to where it really need to be
One, two, three, let me take time
To remind y'all that you can't fuck with me

Shake yo' ass on the way to the flo'
In the dungeon drinkin' and the lions roar
All my little mamis come to the crib
Let me pound on the coochie until it gets sore

Then I laugh and cough when I flash and floss
Moment when I get cash as a boss
Asher Roth, I'm comin' too
'Cause I heard that you got a lot of ass in the loft

See I ain't playin' mister
I'm 'bout to twist your sister
That's how we do it killer, yeah
Lion roar, yeah, lion roar

Lion roar

Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need

Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house till the booze gone
And don't have sex if shes too gone
When it comes to condoms put two on
Then tomorrow night find a new joint
Hold the beer bong
Nothing wrong with some fun

Had to walk around the block, couldn't take no more!
Like escaper from the rock, couldn't wait no more
Sean Con cocked penis mightier than the sword
So I'm sleeping with the whores while I file for divorce
Plain and simple and I'm short, when it rains, man, it pours
Stepping in manure, second sippin' in the moor
Quickest leopard gets the boar, secret weapons win the war
Desprate, but I'm pretty sure that I'm destined to endure
Flesh into the core, Pauly D to Pauly Shore
World of cyborgs and tours of cyberspace
What's behind the door, the allure of something strange?
Of course, this is why I came, the forces are untamed
No corporate or dumb fame, I'll record for chump change
Course is unphased, contorted or concave
I'm sort of a poor sport, nothing short of Liu Kang
Got me feeling like

I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes
My scars and my strife, you know I will survive
The strength that I find when I dig down deep inside
Got me still in this fight, and I'll be the last man standing!

I tried conversing with God, but only hearing myself
I be throwing up a lot but I ain't here for my health
When I'm feeling like blah, I had to loosen my belt
Ate the corn right off the cob, didn't need no help
So, now I've come to realize I'm on my own for real
So most of em I approach em with a Slomin's Shield
Keep my enemies close cause they prone to steal
When friends become foes know you're doing it well
Just keep it going
I'm a red pill taker, who's my real maker
Drew poems on tombstones to feel safer
Loopholes for new souls, let's keep praying
Too grown to complain, I create the lane I stay in
Forever underrated, so now I'm Nicholas Cage-ing it
Doing all about anything as long as you put my face in it
Face it, I didn't want to be famous, but that's the way it is
Way I play the game, it's no wonder the brother made it like

I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes
My scars and my strife, you know I will survive
The strength that I find when I dig down deep inside
Got me still in this fight, and I'll be the last man standing!

I'm smoking weed, that tastes like, kinda cake-like
Bud is getting better, but the price is starting
To skyrocket, so I said fuck it, bought an Aerogarden
So I can get high, smoke big, and break even
No longer have to wait for harvest season
For strictly smoking, why do I have to push
Sitting back with a fat sack of pineapple kush
I wish a motherfucker would try to take my weed
So I take it and I stash the shit, so no one can see
Then I make it safe grab a brew to equalize it
Every day I'm smoking weed, I'm hoping soon they'll legalize it

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me

Haze got her dazed, she's stuck, she don't know what to say
I have the best week ever every seven days
In the magazine pictures, so high I might fly off the page
Rap, smoke, fly, drive, do it all with grace
For the Kush, I got a Jones like Grace
I call my house first, cause first is my place, yeah

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe",Marley & Me [Remix],2012
Asher Roth,"When I wake up in the morning happy
I got a lot of people talking at me
As if in my shoes, they'd walk every mile, yeah

So I deal with negativity all day
But I ain't gon' let it rub me the wrong way
To each his own, and I walk away with a smile

'Cause until I share my life with someone else
Imma find my good times by myself
And you'll never see me sad about it, no

Singin'
Na na na Imma be
Na na na Imma be
Na na na Imma be cool
Oh Imma be alright
Na na na Imma be

Don't worry 'bout me

Ooh ooh oh

As you can see I ain't a stressed out person
I don't really think the time is worth it
I'd rather spend it with a girl and my guitar
(And it sounds something like)

But I ain't really found a girl that gets me
But that don't mean I walk around feelin' empty
It only means I gotta be patient for a while

Nah brotha it's nothing, I'm not buggin'
I wake up in the morning and enjoy an English muffin
Little fried egg with a side of turkey bake
And I'm dancing round the kitchen listenin' to T-Pain
I understand things won't always go my way
Instead of tryin' to force it I just try and ride the wave
Go in, around, and up, and down, and never look away
Stay focused on that level ground and things will turn out straight
Yeah my intuition's fabulous, instincts are simply great
And my homies keep me grounded, never worried bout the hate
If you hear them talkin' bad, then this is what you do
Look 'em in the face and say I'll be cool
Tell em Cody, bruh

Someone's always caught up in the fast life

Fast life, someone's always caught up in the fast life

Far too delicate, it's hard when a father is yelling and
Takes it out on her or the dog for the hell of it
Only thirteen when she started developing
By fifteen, attractin' the older gentlemen
She let them in, mom wasn't looking, she might have been
Turned a blind eye found it better than fighting with
Her little girl caught in a sinister world
No sibling or a sister that could show her the pearls
So she turns to the night sky
Drinking to get by, pills above the sink that be helping her get high
All the while she's forgetting to ask why
Feeling like the only way of living is let die
Why goodbye is the hardest of speech
Go along for the ride at a startling speed
Through the rise and the fall and the valleys and peaks
While the heart tries to find what it needs
Don't get caught up in the

Fast life, someone's always caught up in the fast life

Ain't it hard, to get up out of your momma's basement
If I could buy my way to Heaven or a diamond bracelet
Can't help, but wonder if my time is wasted
If I'm waiting on a train instead of trying to race it
Too fast, my lady told me ""Slow down baby
By the way I work for seven"", she said she know I'm crazy, ay
How you gotta walk before you run
Gotta look before you leap but lose faith before you preach
And just think before you reaching for the handle of your gun
And you running from what you done to become what you never wanted to
Hunted you want to run, running from the sound of the sirens
Chicago no violence, nobody could tell me
Come find me, I need an island, to hold my family
Take up ten rows of the Grammy seats
Granted we've known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

The way we vibing it reminded me of ice tea
Want to drink it up so baby come and let's leave

Look real close, I should've known
Heels and the toes to be matching her coat
And the jewels and the rose just to add to the show
Hm mm fine, Clementine, what I gotta do to make you mine?
Girl you set my heart on fire
Open fire, I could die from
Sweet tea, and I need refreshment
The best in sheets, better keep me guessing
Must aim to please, teach me a lesson

All stop, bombaclot

If you wanna fly better come inside

[beat comes on]
[softly] Ill Will, Earthquake
Goes a little somethin like this...

Aiyyo my man got me wide, I'm listenin to beats inside the ride
I put my love in so when you drivin down the street
And you got this beat on, it's hot 'cause the heat on
And if you got that fat shit, then put repeat on
I pop your ass like a clutch, to get you started
My man farted and the whole crowd parted
You know my shit is so together, I carry clever across the cleft
Like soundwaves and ravage in his chest
It's not a matter of bein wack or not
It's about - who got your back when shit gets hot
In the crowds, I'm cultivatin props, I grow rocks
And stock breaks, manipulate the art and create
See, when I first started my heart was in the right place
Then they changed the game and I still kept pace
So now I'm in the place, and I'm in the house, and I'm comin back
You know this nigga's name--Blue Black

Walk in, at the party, see who's spinnin, was some nigga
Are you high or wide, I'm just dolo lookin fly
Ghetto-pretty in the city of lights
And the ass out, finger-poppin hips and lips
Lookin way past, sweat her, 'cause I can't let her know I want her
So I lounge a look lost, cost effective?
When it's time to ante up, panties up her ass
So tight, I need a rinse to work a nut off
see?? freezin?, while I'm seizin silhouettes
Let's wallow in the wetness--Check this
 
I been a be	-boy before I been away, but the be	 in me'll never go away
I'll stow away on a ship, I'll seal my lips ? and escape
You know- I create funk flow
'Cause I'm not caught up, I thought of a way to speak and spoke:
The Unspoken Heard is no joke

[everyone talking]
Yo, I glaze from purple haze to daze and amazin phrases
I'm thinkin bout money 'cause it pays
So is you is, or is you ain't an entertainer?
I'm a writer, or retainer?, I make art like a painter
I represent the remnant, the remainder
I don't know how to make this point plainer
But brothas who supposed to be, I was hostin a show
I wasn't s'posed to be, lookin at this brotha close to me
And even he wasn't who he was supposed to be
So I'm trapped in the circle (just trapped in the circle)
I'm very present in the room I'm in
Presentin ill rhythms when the track begin
It gets me open and my rhyme falls in, but even ?? times
See I'm not complainin but the shit is dreamin
The game face kid - entertainin - the world is a show
You d'know? See you got to show and tell to get to go
So I create this energy, this synergy.
[simultaneuous rhyming] It's above and beyond me, it's on me
I make it since it's so divine, more sublime
Surrounded by mendacity, but yo, that's the time
And every time I present, the present tense is tension
But that wasn't even mind's intention.. DC!!

Should've known better, but no need for apology
There's a science to this, it's called Cosmology 
This how we relate...from the music we make
To the actions we take...let ya side of fate

Trying my best to be...a better MCee, the best MCee I can be
But after you the way Smiley go...from a little while ago
I'm sure the rest of you can agree...that
Everyday's a Jamboree, where we jam for free

Every record brings you closer to our family
And our greatest common factor...besides the MUSIC!!!
Is our outlook on life and how we use it
The used get unexpectedly dropped

It's on you to choose...you can catch 'em or not
See this is hip-hop...which means we don't stop
Hold the live track runners, by weight...my planet rock
 
Whether dream or experience to drop a cd
That burns to the touch on all point like TV
See we...Think About...what we know
And transfer...that energy to every show

So, if there ever come a time...when Ashe run out of lines
Yo, I hand in my Dear You letter (Dear You) and resign
But don't hold ya breath 'cause man...we can't done

You think its easy being put in this position
I freak speech, but still don't want to preach
This peak thought in stimulate movement at at Emcees
Grab your gat hit the streets, that the rally cry the war horn
The activist, those cats is spiritually war torn environment
So I leading a community movement
And I don't need money for me to make a community improvement
Tell me what you stand for
Would you settle for less or do you have the strength to demand more
Only time will tell, what this new world brings
Revolutions at order, check the mood swing, swing
Swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing

Low like sweet chariot
What I say make my voice deep as berries get
Carry it like a torch
Give birth to rhymes to meet beats and then I'll marry 'em off
Have a divorce if the track is whack

Home is where the high hatters at, its on this song
(it on this song) Maybe one day it'll settle down

Move it's right wit the light just so I could see
Begin to set the pace for what we gon' get into
My fingers is lyrics its back is the instrumental...
Ancient secrets, Indian, and Oriental
Blackin' out doin' shit that I can't rap about
Passin' out, wakin' up, not awake awake enough to take it up and not stop
Love is a friends never know if we can love again
I said we gotta leave, she asked if she can come again (come again)
I had to meet Asheru at the studio
I'm runnin' late, you know I hate to make a nigga wait
But damn baby ""You look good in the summer time
Gimme some of yours, I'm a give you some of mine""

Yo Kweli I remember being in the same dilemma
Hip-hop was number one my girl was number one contender
The great pretender wit a whole different agenda
Until I make it big ""Life is one long gig""
Mood swing like Ella of cold train its classic
Like Soul Train its timeless just like this rhyme is
So all of why'all that wagging they campaign
Grab a hold of that mood swing and do the damn thing

A resource, I pivot your efforts on the right course
It seats ya, doin' whatever it takes ta reach ya

A good brother, lovin' son, a great lover
I'm a truth seeker, on a quest not a believer
I'm an emcee for all of the world to see
Yea ya got my word on it, I'll put the Herd on it
That we rep shit, its the least to be expected
Fuck that prep shit, jump on stage like we connected
From the same minds saying the same things at the same time
Back stage rappin' like gettin' ready for game time
We a family, and ain't nothing goin' to change that
For better or worse like somebody prearrange that
The way it is the way it always will be so I can still and still be
Soon come we will witness a shift in consciousness
And black music is one of our greatest accomplishments
(one now) our names will live on this monument
So that our kids can hold up they heads with confidence
That's when our nation will rise and realize that 

Life without knowledge is death in disguise

The answer to my comprehension is just too complex
One minute from the next, go from happy ta vexed

See change is good sometimes

It's time to mood swing

Too many single mothers raisin' our kids
Too many brothers caged in the Pen
Engagin' a bid, enslaved by the pigs

If it wasn't for crooked cops that pop shots grazin' our wig
That sends slugs reckless, plus these thugs with a death wish
That take your life for the ice that flood in your necklace
The blood of the helpless and innocent (and innocent)

Snakes in the grass and crabs in the lake
'Cause I'm black and its late, getting' harassed by the Jake
Blasted with eight times five, plus one

Playing rappers like a ho, manhandlin' the dough

Demandin' them to go on a track to bring the loot back
Now you playing for the team and the captain, that's cream
You got the dream to push a mean two-seater
With a diva riding shotgun, just to say you got one

You make the songs, but labels only want the hot ones
Send you back to the drawing board, until you got some
Now I guess we got problems
Even your all-creative mind ain't enough to try and solve 'em

The doors revolvin', younger cats are starvin'
They want it more than you, might go to war with you
To reap the heap of dough that's at the end of the rainbow

In the cold world where we bust off the black llamas
Every winter where we lose more son to black mommas

If hip-hop got seasons, right now its spring
Like when everybody selling death, ""kiss the ring"" (yeah!)
You know how it goes, people change color like autumn
Kids learn through experience, fuck what a teacher taught 'em

Puff a relief for boredom; rough will release a quarter
And the parents who paid enough attention to at least ignore 'em
Blowing up mics, throwin' up signs
To help niggaz you confusin' it with cryin'

The winners write the history books
Mystery looks past prisoners of war, that's what my listeners are for

I'm a writer, or retainer?, I make art like a painter
I represent the remnant, the remainder
I don't know how to make this point plainer
But brothas who supposed to be, I was hostin a show
I wasn't s'posed to be, lookin at this brotha close to me
And even he wasn't who he was supposed to be
So I'm trapped in the circle (just trapped in the circle)
I'm very present in the room I'm in
Presentin ill rhythms when the track begin
It gets me open and my rhyme falls in, but even ?? times
See I'm not complainin but the shit is dreamin
The game face kid - entertainin - the world is a show
You d'know? See you got to show and tell to get to go
So I create this energy, this synergy.
[simultaneuous rhyming] It's above and beyond me, it's on me
I make it since it's so divine, more sublime
Surrounded by mendacity, but yo, that's the time
And every time I present, the present tense is tension
But that wasn't even mind's intention.. DC!!

To the actions we take...let ya side of fate

But after you the way Smiley go...from a little while ago
I'm sure the rest of you can agree...that
Everyday's a Jamboree, where we jam for free

Every record brings you closer to our family
And our greatest common factor...besides the MUSIC!!!
Is our outlook on life and how we use it
The used get unexpectedly dropped

It's on you to choose...you can catch 'em or not
See this is hip-hop...which means we don't stop
Hold the live track runners, by weight...my planet rock

That burns to the touch on all point like TV
See we...Think About...what we know
And transfer...that energy to every show

And flame flows through the woods along the wall
We have nothing left to say

Because we use some terrible words
To get such subtle rewards

And I say, that all that we are
Is just dark matter anyway, so just pray...

We stare like strangers through each other in to the wall...

And you say, when your knives and your nails come unfurled
From the caged theoretical storms that mean nothing
But they go straight through me
Cause we use some terrible words
Which always sends me crippled in to flying

You say it's not too late, we can change.
And I say, hurry up, help me touch the ground tonight.

But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,

Doesn't mean that there's no pain
To forget is the worst

Make them the one you please

Come close to sayin' goodbye
Think how far you've come
The victories you've won

What's kept you through the years
Was to dry each other's tears
Memories you recall
Let's you know you have it all

I can't believe it's 4 am
Where did the time go?
I could sit here for days and days
Just hanging with you alone

We got an instant history
Some supernatural chemistry
Can't you feel it, can you feel it, oh?

But I'm giving you my number now
Before this goes too far
It's getting really hot in here

And soon it will be hard to say goodnight
The time's not right
So say goodnight before I die

I'm burning up for you
I'm burning up for you

I see diamonds in the sky
Touch my hand and I can fly
All this is a mystery
So come on, come on

Is this love or just desire?

Ashlee Simpson,"Is anybody out there
Does anybody see
That when the lights are off something's killing me
I know it seems like people care
Cause they're always around me
But when the day is done and everybody runs
Who will be the one to save me from myself
Who will be the one who's there
And not ashamed to see me crawl
Who's gonna catch me when I fall
When the show is over
And it's empty everywhere
It's hard to face going back alone
So I walk around the city
Anything, anything to clear my head
I've got nowhere to go nowhere but home
Who will be the one who's there
And not ashamed to see me crawl
Who's gonna catch me when I fall
It may seem I have everything
But everything means nothing

That you're coming off
Leaves you feeling lost

Does anybody see

With signs that say to give it up
Just tear me down or lift me up

I've got too much paper to fall off
Man you can take all kind of shots at me I'll bounce back

You only get one life my nigga
And they steady throwin stones but I'm alright my nigga
The same way they did Christ my nigga
But I ain't mad at 'em, they hurtin and I'm alright my nigga

See ""I'm a Hustla"" homey and you a customer homey
I ain't Cassidy or Jigga but you can't touch me homey
I get my money from the block nigga the Ghetto Bill Gates
I got niggaz on my team from the South to the Bay
I didn't change when I made it I kept stackin my bacon
I'm on the block hustlin hard like I'm black and Jamaican
First they love you then hate you, man these bitches'll break you
From the streets to the pen, man these niggaz'll fade you
Man yo' mother could take you, man yo' brother could hate you
I got cousins tryin to kill each other, catchin the vapors
Disown ya mayne, run up on ya mayne
Pops said what don't kill you make you stronger mayne

Niggaz rattin for cream, rappers switchin up teams
I'm like Michael Jordan nigga I'm tryin to follow my dream
Real niggaz gon' feel me, see these streets'll kill me
But I'm out here thuggin tryin to feed these children
Turn my family against me, man these cops'll flip me
Play my records if I die, like radio miss me
Ghetto niggaz made history, then the media hit me
I guess I ain't controversy enough like Game and 50
I'm from the streets my nigga, pack that heat my nigga
I'm a boss but suit and ties that ain't me my nigga
I'm from the hood my nigga, what's good my nigga
Uptown, Callope, I'm a bull my nigga
I'm on the block gettin paper nigga you can't hate me nigga
My son worth seven figures you can't break me nigga
I'm on the grind gettin cheddar and cheese
And I started in the ghetto back in New Orleans
I'm a hustler homey

Wondering if it's all that important to me
To get my records back out there on the streets
It ain't like I'm hurting or anything
I'm to the point right now where money ain't an issue
I can roll where I want to, do what I want to do
Tempted to leave it in my rear-view
Because this game ain't what I'm used to

Should I go?
Should I stay?
I'm in control either way
Should I go?
Should I stay?

Should I go?
Should I stay?

It used to be a few artists at a time
Now, even the veterans wait in line
Pre-mature release of these albums online
Making it hard for real entertainers to shine
If you manage to defeat all these odds against you
Keep doing your thing 'cause I'm not mad at you
Just trying to figure out where I fit into
All of this now, or if I do

This industry was more like a different world
When it was just me, Monica, and Babygirl
Aaliyah, I never got to tell you how much you meant
I wish you and me both was sitting here working with Tim
Just to be in the presence of people that you affected on a personal level
Just makes me stop for a second (pause & exhale) 
You were such a blessing
You only answered one of my questions

And I made up my mind
Move over, this is my time

Maybe, you and I can do our own thing,
All I want is for you and I to get down.
Baby I know just what your thinking,

I've got what you need but can you handle it,
All night long, all I want,
Is for you and I to go dance.

Baby we can do it,
Lets dance all night.
Come on make your move
Let's party all night
All night long,
All I want is for us to get down

Move on down to the dance floor,
The way you move you make me want you more,
All I want is for you and I to get down.
Just let the music take control of you,

Why don't we do what we came here to do,
All night long, all I want,
Is for us to get down, get down.

We're gonna dance til the early morn',
We're gonna do what we came here for.

And get down, get down.

Watching trains go by.

It's telling me it might be you

All of my life,
Wondering how they met and what makes it last.

If I found the place,
Would I recognize the face?
Something's telling me it might be you.
Yeah, it's telling me it might be you.

So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to wake
And we've so much love to make

I think we're gonna need some time
Maybe all we need is time
And it's telling me it might be you

Ashley Ballard,"You are the one that keeps your dream alive
And you are the one who feels the rhythm deep inside
Do you ever wonder if you can make you fly?
But you will never know, if you don't really try

There's so many fast frames
Quick cuts and a million stars

Can make you wonder
Can make you dream ahead from the start
When you know your heart and follow your own destiny

Don't get lost in the crowd
Be the one to be strong and turn heads around
Even from dark to light
You are the spark

You have the fire
You are the heart
Now be a believer
Don't get lost in the crowd

Look around you, you may not be
The latest fashion or in a magazine
Or under high profiles but you will be
A sweet inspiration if you got your own style

There's so many fast frames
Quick cuts and a million stars

Pulling you away from what you really love
If you sing your own song straight from your heart
You'll find yourself rising above

Don't get lost in the crowd
Be the one to be strong and turn heads around
Even from dark to light
You have the spark

You have the fire
You are the heart
Now be a believer
Don't get lost in the crowd

'Cause we live in a world of so many choices
It's hard to find our own voices
And keep going on from day to day
So get with the earth and get with the sky
Get with the inside

Don't get lost in the crowd
Be the one to be strong and turn heads around
Even from dark to light
You have the spark and the fire

You are the heart
Now be a believer
Don't get lost in the crowd

Be the one to be strong and turn heads around
Even from dark to light
You have the spark and the fire

Now be a believer

Even from dark to light

At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

Willing to sacrifice it all
To reflect amazing grace

And hope was so lost

In the circus of darkness

And waiting all the day

With all it's abilities

It walks away

God speed that moment when I can stand and cry

I see Him coming in the sky

I see Him coming in the sky

I see Him coming

I see Him coming

Splitting the heavens in the twinkling of an eye

I see Him coming

Hopeless illusions, where will it lead?

She waited in her bedroom, for the sight of his headlights.
Busted down the screen, and said goodbye, to her old life.

With a short blue dress an' a jewelry box.

Crossin' county lines, drivin' all night long.

Told of a life
When spring is sprung

You would seem so frail
In the cold of the night
When the armies of emotion
Go out to fight

But while the earth sinks
To it's grave
You sail to the sky
On the crest of a wave

So forget this cruel world

Should see me in the crowd

Out where there's a hillside of heather curtseyin' gently in the breeze
That's what I'd like to do; see the heather but with you.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.
There may be other days as rich and rare,
There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go
For this I know;
That when the mist is in gloamin'

If you're not there I won't go roamin' through the heather on the hill,

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

I viewed the morning, with much alarm

Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life
Le king de ma life

Celui qui se contente de peu ne manque de rien
Voilà comment je mène ma vie, je combats mes faux besoins au quotidien
Ici le clinquant t'empêche de voir le bon chemin
Pour mieux le voir, c'est le cœur qu'a besoin d'un opticien
Voilà pourquoi mes vers gardent un œil sur les miens
Et qu'il y a des larmes dans le regard de mes alexandrins
Je sais pas faire semblant, le monde va mal, wake up
L'amour est cardiaque donc je rappe comme un peacemaker
Toujours humble et discret
Un vrai n'expose pas ses actes à la lumière comme un trophée
Je boxe avec les mots #SopraBomayé
Mais le rap fait pas le poids face à l'urgence de mon foyer
Le din m'a appris le love
Il m'a appris que la liberté s'arrête là où commence celle des autres
Homme de parole, les miens me connaissent
Mon succès n'est pas un vœux mais plutôt une promesse car

Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)

Je suis le king de ma life, vu qu'il y a qu'une place sur le trône
Difficile de dicter et d'assumer ses choix
Mettre le king c'est tranchant comme dans Game Of Thrones
Et de surcroît, sans ta famille t'es rien faut me croire
Je traverse la vie en solitaire, #VendéeGlobe
Poséidon me mène la vie dure à chaque cap
Je navigue comme François Gabart, voilà l'époque
Dur de garder la place one quand t'es dans une barque
King de ma life, king de ma life
Gardez vos ceintures et vos rings la mienne est au doigt de ma wife
Chaque jour est un fight pour accroître ma foi
Je remercie le seigneur et lève mon verre chaque night (King!)
Comme T.I. à Atl
Maman soit heureuse, ton fils a pris le temps d'ouvrir ses ailes (King!)
Car à chacun sa bonne étoile
La mienne n'est pas sur Hollywood, mais dans le cœur, man

Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)

Je réanime ma joie quand elle se fait percuter pas les soucis
Je suis king de ma life et ça depuis mon premier cri
J’apprends à me connaître pour éviter le feu
Car je suis mort en 1982
Et tu peux dire aux non-croyants que Dieu existe
Ne pas le reconnaître c’est comme s’enquiller 10 litres
Et rester droit sur un pupitre
Je ferai partie de ceux qui se soumettent
Car je suis le king de mon être
J’ai toujours le choix, même les difficiles
Je suis maître de moi, l’avouer c’est pas facile
Quand je me comporte comme un ignorant perdu
Habillé je ne me suis jamais senti aussi nu
Tu te rappelleras que je parlai de mon environnement
Légal ou illégal, ils seront là à mon enterrement
Souvent j’ai tiré au canon pour écraser une punaise
J’ai envie de dire au diable que je le baise

Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)
Je suis le king de ma life, king de ma life (Ma life!)

Who you trying to impress
Think you better check your style
That might have worked before

Show me that you got the touch

You gotta learn this song

'Cause I wanna be played like a sweet guitar
Played like a slow jam in the dark
Gotta find the groove
You know what to do to get to me
I wanna be played like a violin
Make the strings talk with your finger tips
Never go to fast
Gotta understand
The way I need too be played

It's not about the way you roll
Your making it too obvious
Try to be original
You gotta learn me
Don't be in such a rush

I can be your symphony
Listen to me all night long
If you give me what I need
I could be your favorite song

You make it just like that
Come on do it again
We're going to get this right
Even if it takes all night

Take it nice and slow

But our hearts inside our chest will rocknroll
And all the bars along the waterfront will call us
Beautiful sirens will be singing in the ocean
All the leaves are dancing naked on the trees
The southern wind releasing our boundaries
All my dreams are waves that moves towards the shore
I need for less and you are asking me for more

Nobody told me, life is fair in joy and pain

Then comes around

Airplanes are flying
Lovers are lying
Memories burn like fire
And everything is full all life
Everywhere is full of life
Is full of life

When you'll be running on the treadmill in the gym
You'll feel like moving but the world is standing still
The music playing summer feelings in your ears
But winter's there out of the windows of your fears
Do you remember how we danced in the moonlight
You know that moment when your peace became my fight
When all the watches will be stuck upon the wall
But our hearts inside our chest will rocknroll
Nobody told me, life is fair in joy and pain
The sun will shine somewhere again across the rain

Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles

Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs

And the bells in the steeple too
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird
Is popping out to say, ""Cuckoo""
Regretfully they tell us but firmly they compel us
To say goodbye to you

So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, good night
I hate to go and leave this pretty sight
So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, adieu
Adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu

So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen
I'd like to stay and taste my first champagne
So long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodbye
I leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye, goodbye

I'm glad to go, I cannot tell a lie

The sun has gone to bed and so must I

Ashley Rose Orr,"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music

My heart wants to sing every song it hears
My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees

My heart wants to sigh like a chime
That flies from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips


And falls over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I'll sing once more

I was born at a quarter past, I was the color purple
Mom and Pop took me home in a Crown Royale bag
Now I'm the hottest nigga that you know with the coldest intentions
Uh, all I know is this flow and this pencil
The Lord as my shepard, the Devil's my Doberman Pinscher
The industry said I had to be an alcoholic
When we having threesomes we doing acid and having seizures
Wish I could go back to my old school and slap the teachers
All I had to do to blow up was an album packed with features
I don't relate to common folk, they focus on the comments so 
I'm gonna roll a Tesla Roadster down the coast of Monaco
Low and behold, your honorable niggas is sheep
Niggas is sleep, 'bout awoke as a dinosaur

Rihanna stalker, I'm parked in the DMs, shark in the deep end
Put the paws on you, I soften your defense
Hit your pause button, halt your critiquin'
Talk is cheap, the more you niggas talk and it cheapens
And all I see is prayer 'round the streets today
I'm about a freak away from having Issa Rea eating out Lisa Ray
Any artist out that you see is great, tell 'em I said bring his ass
Better bring his A, let his single play
We don't care what you sing, hit you in the face with the butt of the gun

She turn me into a family guy quicker than Peter Griffin
I told myself when I was 14 that she the one
Now a nigga probably got more seeds than Peter Gunz

Of morals and wisdom

Trauma from my childhood, constantly haunts me 'til I finally cry tears over
Sharp as a gauntlet, with thoughts of my side-chick in high heels

You think you Pac, I’m thinking of sinking your Demetrius Shipp
Only thing that I can’t fathom is why the preacher is rich

Over these groceries, I’m toe-to-toe with your whole battalion
I hit you with four from this .44 like Hova album
I take lives like banned contracepts
All the contraband I collect is Iran contra-esque
Respect the mantra or die at the hands of consciousness
Run up and get left ran down to death on your damn concert steps
The booze already made me lose, I can't go out like I’m Amy Winehouse
The Lord graciously still kept me here in a place to be
On the corner like baby Blue standing in timeout
Looking real spiritually aware, pair of Pumas on
Looking like I’m aboard a Lear, headed to uniform
I’m so lyrically rare, I spearheaded the unicorn

I was born a born to ball, won't sugar-coated, oh
The way I'm livin' put me in a great position now
Every time they hear me, they say, ""Ain't nobody did this, nah""
And if they don't, they shit been off
Just listen to the diction in this lyricism
I won't break a fool, they don't want me to blow

Yea yea

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you, and your soul of ice
I thought you were someone to rely on

A friend to discover with a fire in her heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

That you made to me

If I swallow all my pride

If I say but never do
If I weep a little while

Just tell me that you love me
Just tell me that you love me
Just tell me that you love me

Make love to loneliness
Accept that this is all I've got

Forget what's in the past

Just tell me that you love me
Just tell me that you love me
Just tell me that you love me
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh

Awakened from my slumber by the thunder, lightning clapping
Raining on my window pane and praying I make something happen
A preacher's prophecies never bothered me when I was younger
Sitting on my Grandma's lap, as she cried I often wondered
What was her tears for?
Could it be for my grandfather?
Or maybe she felt for me 'cause I'll see more of those cold tomorrows
Then she see the world will up and turn on me
'Cause the morals that she often spoke were meant for 1923
I fall asleep off in her arms, a Psalm was spoken
The Lord is surely my shepherd, he lead me to the water
Thought that often stuck with with me
Amongst the wolves that run the streets
Out here paying dues to lose
I pray your angels come for me
A non-believer I never have and never could be
Lord give me time to peep the signs I should see
Sipping got me feeling like a player riding clean
Bending corners hoping I might find my Savior on the curb
I rarely go to Church
False prophets rocking Prada so I rarely feel the word
Jezebels lurking in the pews on the first
Preacher's weaker than the deacon 'cause it's hard to fight the urge
It's hard to live and serve when you on the Devil's turf
Sell your soul for the low with no sense of what it's worth
Don't get it twisted, I ain't no saint, I ain't no pastor
But prayer ain't just for cloudy days and natural disasters
Aware of what comes after, I bet you ain't for sure
I was warned that Heaven ain't the only place to go
I'm doing what I can cause there really ain't much time
I leave this in the Lord hands
I'm tired of crying

Yeah, close it

Man down
Hope and pray and say I can’t turn (Man down)
He will find you, this world will grind you down
Don’t you be another (Man down)
Hope and pray and say you can turn (Man down)

Don’t be afraid to say
Mayday

Father forgive us for we know not what we do
Am I bias? I been pious put my nose up in the pews
Like Paul I bear good news
They think I'm pall-bearing
My message sounds like death to these hearers as they perish
Scaring to think we on the brink of death
But no one stops to look for answers on what happens next
Got a couple scriptures from my grandma
Sayings from a preacher
But can't live out these standards that we heard it takes to reach 'em
But when I look at Jesus
He live the life I couldn't
Suffered for my crime so I wouldn't
I used to have to sneak into movies 'cause I couldn't afford to pay
Explain to me how someone paved my way
When I hear K.R.I.T. Confessing I respect him
Cause most of us be lying like our lives don't need perfecting
Nothing that we can muster, nothing that we can change
Admitting that we're imperfect, offending God with our games
Look I'm just being honest so don't take me for no lame
I seen it for myself, I'm a product of this thing
Now I found true religion, and it's not inside a denim
And 'em overpriced shades are never giving us vision, let's go

Man down
Hope and pray and say I can’t turn (Man down)
He will find you, this world will grind you down
Don’t you be another (Man down)
Hope and pray and say you can turn (Man down)
I seen another to know, so urgent

And in the cages that bind the bitter heart it is release 
Hold it close to your chest, let it move and let it rest 
For it is here to set your mind at ease 
Where there is love there is a peace. 

Where there is hope there is a dream 
To rise above, to remit and to redeem 
To go back, to go where there's no hurt or anger there 
To find the song that you once could sing 
Where there is hope there is a dream. 

Where there is faith there is a chance 
To alter the course and fight the winds of circumstance 
Not to scar, but mend, not to break, but to bend 
And not to know but to understand

Where there is hope there is a dream.

Ashton Shepherd,"She's five foot three and Lord ain't she sweet
She's got everything a man believes he needs
But she ain't gonna stay, She don't work that way
And the man he is, you'd think it'd be something he could take

But the bigger the heart, the harder they fall
He can't help it, it ain't his fault.
Another man done been caught
The bigger the heart, the harder they fall.

He's always been rough I'm talking barroom tough
He always said he'd never fall in love
But now it's too late, he's in such a bad state
He's on his knees beggin' her everyday

'Cause the bigger the heart, the harder they fall
He can't help it, it ain't his fault.

Ashton Shepherd,"She sat in her hospital bed
Drawing pictures of the sky
And through all of the pain she felt
She had never asked why
But when the doctor walked in
And said, it's time for your meds
With tears in her eyes
She looked at the doctor and said

How big are angel wings?
Are they small enough for me?
Do they make them little 
In the size I might need?
They say where I'm going
I won't feel no more pain
So I really need to know
How big are angel wings?

I can't ask Mama
I know it'd make her sad
I don't like to see her cry
And it does the same thing to Dad
And at night when I sleep
I see heaven in my dreams
So please won't you answer 
This question for me

Ashton Shepherd,"I've got a baby at home 
A to do list a mile long
And husband who comes home each night
I do the laundry I cook and clean it's my responsibility
And I'm usually in the bed by nine

But I still like a cold beer and a long dirt road
And listenin' to some Keith Whitley on the radio
Don't mean I ain't a good mama
Don't mean I ain't a good wife
I'm just like anybody else 
Who needs a break from time to time
And I know my obligations
And believe me their met

My life is a lot different now
I'm proud of how it's turned out
And folks like me they understand
There's always somethin'' to be done
But I still like havin' fun
It's just part of who I am
