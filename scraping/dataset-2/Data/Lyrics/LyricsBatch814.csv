Paper Lace,"Daddy was a cop
On the east side of Chicago
Back in the you S A
Back in the bad old days

In the heat of a summer night
In the land of the dollar bill
When the town of Chicago died
And they talk about it still

When a man named Al Capone
Tried to make that town his own
And he called his gang to war
With the forces of the law

I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was, glory be

I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night the people saw
Brother what a fight the people saw, yes indeed

And the sound of the battle rang
Through the streets of the old east side
'Til the last of the hoodlum gang
Had surrendered up or died

There was shouting in the street
And the sound of running feet
And I asked someone who said
'Bout a hundred cops are dead

I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was, glory be

I heard my mama cry
I heard her pray the night Chicago died
Brother what a night the people saw
Brother what a fight the people saw, yes indeed

Then there was no sound at all
But the clock upon the wall

Then the door burst open wide
And my daddy stepped inside
And he kissed my mama's face
And he brushed her tears away

The night Chicago died
The night Chicago died
Brother what a night the people saw
Brother what a fight the people saw, yes indeed

The night Chicago died
The night Chicago died
Brother what a night it really was
Brother what a fight it really was, glory be",The Night Chicago Died [Rare on CD],2017
Paper Lions,"We walk through graveyards with our boots on
Leap the stranger stones
Pulled on our skies by our retriever
You lose your breath and hit the snow

And we run by the vault where they keep all the cold bodies 
To be buried
And I fall 'cause he's up on my back and he's so heavy 
To be carried

Watching our breath, it collects on the window pane
Words read backwards by you
Pushing through tunnels of snow pressing in on me
Pulling me out by my boots

Running away from the truth
The bodies in the winter are coming for you
Running away from the truth
The bodies in the winter are coming for you

There is a tower with a steeple if you wanna climb
If you're a coward we may be hurtful, trying your best not to cry

In the dark and the dust and what else, look around on our knees
The ladder's raised
And we jump to the top where we hold by the skin of our teeth
Out of the haze

Then at the top chatter stops and we take it in
Towering giants from here
Climbing back down while the darkness surrounds us
One by one we disappear

Running away from the truth
The bodies in the winter are coming for you
Running away from the truth
The bodies in the winter are coming for you",Bodies in the Winter,2012
Paper Lions,"When I first learned to ride
She said you will lose your life

I was completely mesmerized
White lies, a wooden fence

Always tell me
I'll be right beside
In my periphery
Never leave me

Women passing by like seasons in my life
Each dictating lines, ghostwriters

I smoked behind the wheel
She said, you don't drive too fast

I was completely hypnotized
Young love to keep me warm

Always tell me
I'll be right beside you
In my periphery
Never leave me

Women passing by like seasons in my life
Each dictating lines, ghostwriters

Two sides of a story told
From birth now to getting older
The wooden fence built up with the little lies
Ghostwriters came and took my hand to guide
Ghostwriters, the women in my life

Two sides of a story told
One part of the whole
The young love was enough to keep me warm at night
Ghostwriters came and took me like the tide
Ghostwriters the women that were in my life",Ghostwriters,2012
Paper Lions,"If I were to tell you
Put your hand inside a hornets nest
Jump from rooftops
Hold your breath

Watch until the lights go
With my father and his oldest friend
Turn off the power
I'm not sure what he meant

You better run you little liar
If I get you we're even
For the last time you were right
We're out the door, we're leaving

Racing to the trail's end
Playing in an abandoned car
Great grandfather
Left it in the forest parked

Balance on the rim ties
The brook run through the broken arch
Three times repaired
There is no money left

Closed off the entrance
The last time that we went

You better run you little liar
If I get you we're even
For the last time you were right
We're out the door, we're leaving

We're out the door

Paper Lions,"My Friend
We're pushing out the door
The winner isn't last
We rise up through the floor
You jump the hatch and then 
Come crashing down
The best show off of all
You call out and your arm is pulp
I know you are my friend, 
And if I never met you, 
I would be different
He makes the casting call
While we gain thirty pounds
We decorate the walls
Tell stories that we never tell again
The laughing camera shakes
It's funny how we never got the take
I know you are my friend, 
And if I never met you,
I would be different
I know you are my friend, 
And if I never met you, 
I would be different, 
And if I never met you

Paper Lions,"Philadelphia on my mind
We climbed in a van
My sister cried
Appalachians in my eyes
But we didn't care
My Walkman died

Seven strong; no wonder it took us so long to get to here
Sleepless, this tangle of arms and legs won't let me get no rest

Listen to the parents talk
It's getting hard to sit here while the parents talk
Running up and down the block
Sick of running up and down the block

They ask us, what's the rush?
We never did that much
We've been waiting for a long, long time

City streets
My uncle took the wheel and nearly killed us all
Court-side
My brothers laced up their pumps like they always do

Listen to the parents talk
It's getting hard to sit here while the parents talk
Running up and down the block
Sick of running up and down the block

They ask us, what's the rush?

Paper Lions,"She made a move on me after I lit her fire
I bought her magazines and kept her up all night
Keep her cool, go back to school, try not to lie

Throw away my genesis, my genesis, caught up with you
Siding with my sensitive, my sensitive, if I follow through

It’s a line between head and heart
Hold on to reason as it falls appart
Peel away my thickest skin
I hesitate and you pull me in

We burn our skin and whisper things about our friends
We jump the bridge and hold our breath and we descend
We dance around the room, around the elephant

Throw away my genesis, my genesis, caught up with you
Siding with my sensitive, my sensitive, if I follow through

Paper Lions,"July breeze is calling me
From fast asleep
I’m on my feet
Over the lands, under our wheels
From shifting nails, umbrella seas

The wooden walk we’d run
Mapping out the day
Following the sun

We’d build sandcastles
We’d build sandcastles
Knowing that they wash away
We’d build sandcastles
We’d build sandcastles
Knowing that they wash away

Panning for gold, in riverbeds
“Don’t feed the birds.” my mother said
And in the dunes, where lovers meet
We’d wake the dead, my cousin screams

We wouldn’t walk we’d run
Mapping out the day
Hiding from the sun

We’d build sandcastles
We’d build sandcastles
Knowing that they wash away
We’d build sandcastles

Paper Moon,"The leaves are turning
Shades of gold falling to the ground
It takes me back to
Better days when you were still around

but I cannot go on without your memory
Even though it hurts to be inside of me

I already know how you feel
I don't mean that much to you
Close my eyes pretend you are here
One side is black
Impossible to not look back

the moon is waxing
Then it's full waiting to extend
It never looks back
Moons ahead carries no regrets

but I am not so strong dwelling constantly
It's clear you have moved on much too easily

I already know how you feel
I don't mean that much to you
Close my eyes pretend you are here
One side is red
A glimmer of a ???

the summer sun has been lost
To winter chills of ice and snow
Can I create warmth in the cold?
Remember what I knew long ago

I already know how you feel
I don't mean that much to you
Close my eyes pretend you are here
When the sky is blue
I'll no longer think of
When the sky is blue
I'll no longer think of you
I'll no longer think of you
I'll no longer think of you
I'll no longer think of you

Paper Moon,"Under the island, middle of a mountain
There is a big bad boomin' system
Blowin' speaker, woofers and tweeters
Amplifiers, melted wires
The party exploded, the core is corroded
Under ground, the Paget Sound
Cause a shiftin' and a driftin'
Big black boom box stuck in the hot rock
It's in there flowin' in there growin'

Could be a cold blooded killer

It's gonna blow -- Volcano

Now the island is shiftin', the plates are liftin'
The core is creamy, docile and dreamy
Stopped up and steamy
Happy campers poop in their pampers 
When the mountain becomes a fountain
Of white hot lava molten magma
Super sonic plate tectonics
Stereo phonic lava and tonic
The boom is bionic
Sony shut down, magnavox meltdown
Ballistic breakdown 
Hi-fi heatwave, lo-fi lava cave
That sulfur smells, Mt. St. Helens
Pompeii was Yellin'

Paper Route,"Verified correct by Andy Smith, a past member of this band.
You and I are gonna get it right
Don't let me go
It takes two to make a leader but
One has to follow
Help me, help me understand
What we've become
We fell apart and then proceeded to
Both play the victim

On and on and on we go
Just like a carousel that's lost control
We don't know why, we don't know why
We go, we go, we go in circles

I want you more than anything
Just as you're leaving
For every wound that's an apology
That's lost its meaning
You and I, I think we're better off
Without each other
The last ride, the unavoidable
Keeps getting farther

On and on and on we go
Just like a carousel that's lost control
We don't know why, we don't know why

A better life is waiting

And what is done is done
Piece together what's been broken
Can you ever give up someone
A better life, a better life is waiting

All this fire in my veins
From a heart that's trapped in my ribcage
Burning through my fingertips
Burning everything I kiss

Are just another door that I'm closing
In a hall that's infinite
But at least I can admit it

So Rhythm D, pour the orange juice
And let's relax while sippin' on yak
Because it's like that
I'm clostraphobic, so Paperboy wears pruple lactive
I wear a jimmy for the skins
'cause it's a long trip
Front row seats, aiyo I know she's on the nine inch
Just to get a piece of the green
But she's an undertaker
Now you know the Paper is an around the world heart-breaker
Me be singin' first, but yo, had to have a breakdown
Playin' you fools, so now you know why my belly's round
Takin' the rap back up and scoopin' up crowds just like a steel shovel
Not from the ghetto, but yo, takin' it to another level
Let the beat ride, but hold on to your women, G
'cause now that I'm rich so many women want to do me
It make a man say ""damn""
I'm finally taxin' more play than homey Sam
But let me speak to the weak, I mean the rookies
My time is help up, extremely for cookies
Just let me clock this groove in ninety two
Hey, you don't bother me and I sure 'nuff won't bother you
And ah, you just watch a brother flowin' like Niagra
Think before you step, because these niggas just might stag ya
Although I'm labeled with the black fade
It's gold d's on my four and gold lex, 'cause I got it made
I broke the veto once again because I had to
And just like Jody Watley, baby girl, I can have you

Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the ditty-ditty if you want to

Second verse of the same song
With the conclusion, all should be happy with ding-dong
It's just a mad park a grip, G
It's like every nickel and dime nigga be like
""See, don't you remember me?""
A hustler, and it's on with more hoes to lego
Keep 'em chunky like Prego, so they can play with my eggo
I have a tendency to flow, start off with my own groove
Pick up the mic, and all of a sudden, I see high movin'
Guess it's like magic, and Paperboy is the magician
If I was a vacuum I'd be suckin' up competition
Let it ride again, and yo, belive I got my own thing
Straight Bahama hoes so miss me with the chick from Soul Train
And I'm a break my note, just to show up token
Tote on his ass when I scoop him, 'cause we bud smokin'
A black man tryin' to make it and that ain't no fair
But just like BeBe and CeCe, I'll take you there

Do the ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the ditty-ditty if you want to

Uh, let's take a trip to another land
Park a grip, come back and watch the hoes tan
Jump in the lex-o, and roll out to my cabin
Believe me, my brother, more hoes than you can imagine
All on the ding-a-ling, just because the gold rings
But I'm like a ???, you ain't heard a damn thing
Make sure you got the jim hats, strapped for protection
Because to me, my life is more than my erection
And give me a hand, if you a fan, it ain't over yet
'cause doin' the ditty with Paperboy makes the ocean sweat
Leave you kinda startled like the funk off of fritos
Make you man jealous, while hoes cheese like Doritos
It ain't my fault, I lay the piper with concern
And I ain't from Mount Vernon, but a brother's money-earnin'
And for those disagree, and then jack, that's a pitty
Just bob your head for Paperboy and the ditty

Do the ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the ditty-ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

Now here we go from the top
Second verse of the same song
With the conclusion, all should be happy with ding-dong
It's just a mad park a grip, G
It's like every nickel and dime nigga be like
""See, don't you remember me?""
A hustler, and it's on with more hoes to Lego
Keep 'em chunky like Prego, so they can play with my eggo
I have a tendency to flow, start off with my own groove
Pick up the mic, and all of a sudden, I see high movin'
Guess it's like magic, and Paperboy is the magician
If I was a vacuum I'd be suckin' up competition
Let it ride again, and yo, belive I got my own thing
Straight Bahama hoes so miss me with the chick from Soul Train
And I'm a break my note, just to show up token
Tote on his ass when I scoop him, 'cause we bud smokin'
A black man tryin' to make it and that ain't no fair
But just like BeBe and CeCe, I'll take you there
Huh

[Chorus]

Now here we go
Uh, let's take a trip to another land
Park a grip, come back and watch the hoes tan
Jump in the lex-o, and roll out to my cabin
Believe me, my brother, more hoes than you can imagine
All on the ding-a-ling, just because the gold rings
But I'm like a ???, you ain't heard a damn thing
Make sure you got the jim hats, strapped for protection
Because to me, my life is more than my erection
And give me a hand, if you a fan, it ain't over yet
'cause doin' the ditty with Paperboy makes the ocean sweat
Leave you kinda startled like the funk off of fritos
Make you man jealous, while hoes cheese like Doritos
It ain't my fault, I lay the piper with concern
And I ain't from Mount Vernon, but a brother's money-earnin'
And for those disagree, and then jack, that's a pitty
Just bob your head for Paperboy and the ditty
Yeah

[Chorus]",Ditty,2011

Rap.

Mi Corazon contigo se impacto
Testigo a sido el tiempo que nada nos separo
Se que lo que dentro siento si es amor
Por eso cuando te beso es como un choke de passion
Asi que las palabras estan de mas
Tu why yo hasta la muerte siempre vamos a estar
No tendra final lo nuestro es real
Imposible que se acabe lo que DIOS quizo crear
Yo soy el rey tu eres mi baby
Si yo fuera el presidente tu fueras my first lady
Eres para mi la mas sexy mami
Asi que en esto soy yo tambien tu papi
Por ti luchara hasta con un ejercito de mara
Con tal de amanecer contigo en cada madrugada
Ya nada nos separa somos uno no dos
Un sentimiento sin barrera asi es el amor.

Rap.

Inseparables somos tu why yo
Por mas que trataron nuestro amor cresio
Subio como la espuma libre sin pena why sin duda
Tu figura me enloquese como tu no existe una
Asi que todo eso que fue causa de tropiezo
A sido solo un ejemplo de que nuestro amore s ciego
Qeu nada ni nadie puede con los dos
Que todo lo pasado se fue al safacon
Enamorados atados juntos why fucionados
Como traje confecionado a la medida asi estamos
Por ti yo me derrito como vela ma 
Why mas cuando tan dulcet you me dices pa
Dejemos tras sin sabores ya 
Vamos mas alla luchemos como iack
Ya nada nos detiene somos uno no dos
Un sentimiento sin barrera asi es el amor.


Why nada pudo ocn este amor( este amor)
No pudieron separarnos
Why mientras mas difisil mas yo siento que yo te amo

Papo Lucca,"Te tengo que ser sincera
No me importa el qué dirán
Ni lo que estarán pensando
Ni lo que van a pensar

A la corta why a la larga
Lo que digan me da igual
No quiero vivir la vida
Al compás de los demás

Yo sigo mi propio rumbo
Rechazo conformidad
Viviendo muy bien la vida
Sin mirar jamás atrás

Sembrando mi andar de flores
Busco la felicidad
Haciendo lo que me gusta
Sin herir a nadie más

Si yo digo que algo es blanco
Dicen negro está mejor
De cada cosa que hago
Todos tienen su opinión

why no hay forma de aplacarlos
Es mi franca conclusión
Prefiero seguir el paso
Que me dicte el corazón

Conozco mejor que nadie
Lo que me va a hacer feliz
Que en cuestiones de la vida
Ya no soy una aprendiz

Bailar cada vez que pueda
Es lo que yo decidí
Disfrutando del momento
Desde el día en que nací

A bailar la vida es para gozar
Que bailando se van las penas
Que agobain el corazón, tú ves

A bailar la vida es para gozar
Si temprano te acuestas
No siempre va a amanecer
Por eso sigue rumbeando de buena fe

A bailar la vida es para gozar
Para bien o para mal
Lo que digan ya a mi me de igual

A bailar la vida es para gozar
El que vive siempre criticando
Hay que lástima me da
Yo le digo
A bailar la vida es para gozar

Aprende a bailar why disfrutarás
Yo sé que disfrutarás

Si tú no bailas, no gozas
Si tú no bailas, no gozos ná

Aprende a bailar why disfrutarás
Esos que viven del cuento
Mira de rumba no saben ná

Si tú no bailas, no gozas
Se goza más,
Tú versa

Aprende a bailar why disfrutarás
Que yo disfruto de la vida
Why a ti te pongo a gozar

Bailar cada vez que pueda
Es lo que yo decidí
Disfrutando del momento
Desde el día en que nací

Papo Sanchez,"Potente cual marajada fué su amor
La playa de mi cariño la arrazó
En mi fué tan dolorosa que es mi vida
Llorar por aquella triste despedida

Marejada feliz, vuelve y pasa por mi
Aun yo digo que si, que todavía pienso en ti

El vertigo que mi alma provocó
Lo intimo sacudió en mi corazón
Traté de evitar su rápida partida
Su amor que siguec lejano de mi vida

Marejada feliz, vuelve y pasa por mi
Aun yo digo que si, que todavia pienso en ti

Quisiera la marejada la playa de mi cariño
Sin ella no estoy en nada sollozando como un niño

Sin ella no estoy en nada
Soy como un árbol que espera
Que una lluvia pasajera
Le devuelva su belleza

Su pelo color del sol
Y sus ojos azul del mar
Son dos cosas que en la vida
Yo nunca podré olvidar

Ahora mi vida es el mar
Vivo contando las olas
Y así me pasan las horas
Y vuelve a llegar la aurora

Todas las noches me voy
Junto a la orilla del mar
A preguntarle a las olas
Si han visto mi amor pasar

Soy la arena que en la playa
Vive sola su tristeza
Tu eres ola misteriosa
Que en la bruma te me alejas",Marejada Feliz,1995

So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I continue to expose you niggas that's so superficial
I script you your obituary then blow like a missile
Once I blow the whistle, motherfuck may the forces be with you
Come with a style, I'm wildin', pile up my money so kosher,
Then call up the sofa fuckin' bitches in back of the rover
Then bounce with the coca, bag up bitches outside of the costa rica area level, 
My features and carry my posters

While helpin' you grow up, niggas know you for soundin' so tore up

I lock a strip and chop a brick like I'm Mr. Miyagi
But this ain't karate, I been sick since I pissed in a potty
I probably been proper since my papa put dick in my mommy
I'm a cannon man
Holdin' the hamma man
For the loot niggas shoot niggas like a camera man
Snappin' a picture, you get stuck like the back of a sticker
I got bars like the factory manufacturing snickers
And I do crimes for the bread like croutons
With two nines I be layin' clowns down like foutons
With the bullets in the rocket, my pockets is full of cream
I'm blowin' steam keep the steel in my hands like wolverine

Poppin' the metal, you niggas is not on my level
I'm locking the kettle man, I'm hot like the pot and the kettle
On the mic I spaz, who get it hype as cass
And my nigga busta, we some motherfuckin' psychopaths

I'm an iceberg trapped in a fire I won't melt
I'm a fetus that survived an abortion, I won't be kilt (killed)
I'm the heart of Brooklyn, New York, I'm bedstuy
I'm a christian woman's hand on the bible I won't lie
I'm the code of silence in the gotti crew
I'm an empty mag right after a shootout, I just bodied you
Got something sup? shotgun pump, shot at you
Like kamakize through, your baby mom's feel the wop cock back
Cause she was sittin' on my lap

Papoose,"A young wild beautiful love child
You like them thug style link rockin, then mink coppin
Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink poppin
The head'll make you take him shoppin, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel lookin real, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (so fine..)
To see a prophecy, your ebony tone is lockin me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishin I could be the one man; but you juggle
Way too many Willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, gettin rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear
Get your fuck on - followin week, you back there
But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars
Puffin with some lil nigga, husband not knowin she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let em hurt you and leave
What up mah, frontin like you naive
Push your man's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us
But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word!

Diamonds all shinin, lookin all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl stugglin, tryin to survive
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playin the same ol' games
Messin with my mind, emotional thangs
And there goes, a black girl, lost

Like Isis, she got you heartbroke and felt lifeless
Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest
To who'sever gettin down and trifless
To get his mind all you do is give him somethin priceless
Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed (deceit, yeah)
There you go again, startin' wars, makin me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keepin' me on all fours
Face glistenin, I'm addicted to you
Original, Wisdom Body got me picturin you
Igloos of ice trickin' on you, you never listen
To this nigga spendin' Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You gettin interviewed, but your boss is into gettin' screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Comin' home wantin' more from a college degree

Diamonds all shinin', lookin' all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl stugglin', tryin to survive
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playin' the same ol' games
Messin' with my mind, emotional thangs
And there goes, a black girl, lost

Where are you focused, on legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo you seem hopeless
Your value, too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amountin' to
More than the world, but not knowin' nothin' about you
You leavin' the crib, takin' all your kids out to
Drop them off, lettin' some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost (you should be ashamed)
Growin' up seein' it, it should remind you, you bein' lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancin' topless in your drawers
Damn look, there goes a black girl lost

You should be ashamed of yourself
The way you carry yourself
The way you hang out all night long
Doin' silly things that is wrong

They say you never know what you have until you lose it
You promise your girl somethin', you better do it
You can't tell a women you love her, are you stupid?
Words don't express your love; you gotta prove it
Back then our relationship was the truest
Romance, slow dance to Joe music
As the time went on, I became foolish
Now you're gone, everything ruined
But, girl, this is Papoose
I'm on your favorite track
I know your friend's in your ear, but, baby, come back
And I never let you down, so later for that
I told you I was gon' make it; I'm the savior of rap
And I work hard; you don't gotta cater for Pap
I tie my own doo rag, lay back and relax
You don't even gotta accept my apology
But I'm man enough to admit it; acknowledge me

Oh! Oh! Baby! If any one event, it was just like me
Oh! Oh! Babe! Treat her like this wasn't last week
Won't you call, babe? (Won't you call?) You know the song, babe
Girl, you know the song; are you hearing me?
Damn, I regret running all overseas!

Helicopter in the sky, airplane in the clouds
Boats in the ocean, cars travel the ground
I watch from the balcony, this is a busy town
I kinda like Miami, I might lock it down

My girl with me, she cook better than Mr. Chows
Told her I order somethin', baby just dial zero for room service
She looked up and smiled
I was just stuck in the hood

Look at me now
Opened up my safe and put the chain around my neck
Then I locked my watch, bling blaow, pinky ring and bracelet
Kinda loud, I got a lotta jewels, 'cause I got a lotta style

Before I got here, my homie was on trial
Walked in the court, the jurors was like, wow
Hollered at Shaq, they was playin' some clowns
Went to the game, can't blend in with the crowd

Won a couple grand when Shaquille got fouled
Bet you he make these an easy then thou
The best of both worlds is a kilo and a pound
In case I gotta bang I'm totin' the 40 cal

You got a system in your truck? Let it bang
I could see your butt from the front, let it bang
You gang bang then it's all the same thing
We can bang it on out, we can bang it out

I dare y'all to violate, we can bang it out
Ice grillin' in my face, we can bang it out
Tryna stick me for my papes, we can bang it out
We can bang it on out, we can bang it on out

What it is? What it was?
Who you wit? Is you wit us?
'Cause we love to bang and swing and live it up
I get low and roll a tree wit a foe

Break bread or fake dead, that's the slogan, li'l homie
Why you da boss? See I been chosin', li'l homie
And I been doin this the old fashioned way
Stickin', movin', on these suckas just like Cassius Clay

Make it rain? Naw boo, I'm tryna stash my cash away
Knockin' down trap doors and turnin' out rap whores
Sellin' out rap tours on your favorite television show
Goin' hard on 'em though

East coast let loose, my nephew, Papoose, he got the juice
So watch the Impala as it swing by and be on the lookout
For them boys with them gang signs, that's us and you can trust
We gon' bust Big Snoop and Papoose bang, bang in your truck

You got a system in your truck? Let it bang
I could see your butt from the front, let it bang
You gang bang then it's all the same thing
We can bang it on out, we can bang it out

I dare y'all to violate, we can bang it out
Ice grillin' in my face, we can bang it out
Tryna stick me for my papes, we can bang it out
We can bang it on out, we can bang it on out

My style similar to hell, hotter than high temperatures
World wide finisher, the US, I'm the lyrical president
The UK king, wild sinister
They love me in Canada, they call me the prime minister

Said I'd lose my life on the corner
But I'm in Miami on the balcony, overlookin' the water
Give my credit card to my daughter
Tell her to swipe it like Swiper from Dora The Explorer

And I just bought her the ice that don't melt
I give her what she want, she spoiled like old milk
They'll say the block slow if you ain't really smart chill
Cop from another connect, give you the raw deal

Flip your money twice then come for some more crills
Dudes will flip on you, the game ill
Since they like flippin' on me man, I cop that long steel
Hit him in his side and make him do a cartwheel

You got a system in your truck? Let it bang
I could see your butt from the front, let it bang
You gang bang then it's all the same thing
We can bang it on out, we can bang it out

I dare y'all to violate, we can bang it out

Tryna stick me for my papes, we can bang it out

Papoose,"Yeah, a lightning bolt strikes in the air, yeah, finally it's here
'Cause y'all are the judge, the day of judgment finally is near
In your eye I see a tear, and it's remindin' me of fear
Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin' what you feel

Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real
Grim reaper that we call revenge right beside ya in your ear
He's saying your time expired, time is finally due it's clear
Not sober mind is a weak mind and he's buyin' you a beer

Cheers, time for a toast
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
To the haters that hate you the most
(Your heart's beatin')
And the friends that pretend to be your folks
(Your heart's beatin')
This is what revenge sounds like
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
I hear your heart beatin', keep runnin' your mouth, yeah

Your mouth runnin' ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do
Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this

Somebody call the doctor
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
They ain't gonna be well after this one right here
You're not breathin'
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
Just make sure they learn the name
(You're not breathin')
That's about to be runnin' the game
(You're not breathin')
Tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you

y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin'
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Houston, Texas, I'm here now
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Anybody gotta problem?
(I'm not leavin')
Speak now or forever hold your peace
(I'm not leavin')
I ain't think so, yeah

The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?
(Yeah what's that?)
That's The Sound of Revenge

See, I told you
That's what happens when you get on his bad side

He just didn't give a damn anymore

Six in the morning, police at my door
Six in the morning, police at my door
Six in the morning, police at my door
Six in the morning, police at my door

They would say “bling-bling,” if my jewels could talk
So you can still see me shining when the room gets dark
I’m like Tony Danza, I’ll show you who’s the boss
Teach my worker who’s the fiends and who’s the narcs
It’s a lot of niggas out trying to prove they hard
‘Til you hit they cousin up, and make them move they aunt
Yo, I would wild out and let the Rug’ just spark
But you know how the hood be when someone screwed your start
All the basketball tournaments was cool to watch
Bet your money: lose a little, or lose a lot
They beat us by one point; yeah, them dudes was sharp
But I’m a sore loser, so I had to shoot up the park
I wouldn’t of robbed your man if the fool was smart
But a fool and his money will soon depart
Then I went to my crib, went to sleep 'bout four
When I woke up, police was at my door, damn

Six in the morning, police at my door
Six in the morning, police at my door
Six in the morning, police at my door
Six in the morning, police at my door

Just aired the dice game out, that’s the truth, babe
‘Bout to hit the crib, take a shower, watch a bootleg
Glad nothing popped off, got to get the bag out of the crib
Goose dropped off, so it can get knocked off
Then I got a sharp pain in my chest
About knowing I ain’t supposed to have it in the place I rest
Yes – but it’s a half a joint in there
Two .40 cals with the hollow points in there
Few bricks of diesel, couple pounds of purple
Gallon of the water, plus a thousand circles
A man hit me, saying that he’d be here in a minute
All I’ve got to do is wrap it, and bring it down to the rented
By now, it’s a little past five
And I’m still trying to roll, could barely open my eyes
Next thing I know, she giving me a massage
Instead of waking up rich, I woke up to a surprise

Six in the morning, police at my door
Six in the morning, police at my door
Six in the morning, police at my door
Six in the morning, police at my door

It goes: “six in the morning, police at my door”
At five in the morning, I was up in this broad
At four in the morning, we was out the club door
A few hours before that, I was getting fresh in the store
Now a week before that, I was at the car lot
Thinking convertible so I can make the broad drop
A half a mill in cash off a three-month run
Them rubber bands stacks in ten-G lump sums
Police is on our back ‘cause we dump guns
So when Bird Gang’s outside, motherfucker, just run
We just dumb, like the hyphy life
I told you life was a bitch, not the wifey type
Help you get the right bricks, if the price is right
Catch you standing on the strip in the icy whites
Season of heirs, we in the V switching gears
Dropping the top, blowing weed in the air
She’s showing her ass, and
Next think I know, I’ve got a detective all in my face
Asking me all kinds of questions
I don’t know shit but get my lawyer

Papoose,"I was born in a human body, I’m deadly and dangerous
The way I decrease life quality is outrageous
But you don’t gotta worry, I’m not contagious
I’m genetic, I travel through your family for ages
I could live in yo daughter, I could live in yo son
If you smoke cigarettes, I could live in yo lungs
I can develop in yo stomach and be that small
But I grow to the size of a basketball
Now you can ignore me and try to pass it on
You’ll be a statistic, in the casket gone
I could be a sharp pain that you feel in yo spine
I can be a brain tumor on the back of yo mind
I’ll even be in yo food if you eatin that swine
Don’t go to the doctor so you never catch me in time
I done cause some strong men to lose they strength
Even cause some pretty women to lose they breasts
Only God know the cure and to whom he bless
Is the chosen, he choose the best
I’m a physical enemy, here to bring miserable treachery
I can affect him, her, they, you or them and me
But one small woman gotta checkup randomly
They burn me out of her body with chemotherapy
If you come late I’ll deflate your energy
Take all of your hair and erase your memory
I can shorten your life if you livin it long
Even took a black queen named Vivian Strong
If you don’t go to the doctor that mean you support me
The only way to stop me is to catch me early
And gangstas who think I can’t get in y'all body
I even claimed the life of mobster John Gotti
Have you had a checkup? If no is your answer
Then let me introduce myself, my name is cancer

He rides to it
Don’t stress a lot
Put protection on
If he’s in your home

The prettiest woman out here blows long in the wind
Even sip when she wasn’t soft as her skin
Teeth look like ivory, pleasant as a beach
Breasts like 2 watermelons, ripe like a peach
On the outside, sexy as can be
But on the inside she’s infected with me
She be up in every neighborhood, dead on the street
Give you her phone number, give you head in the V
And she don’t like condom, she sex it for free
So if you ever met er get tested for me
Every single day I add names to my dying list
My epidemic is strong as an iron fist
You should check your body fluids, that’s where I exist
Can travel through saliva, I hope you like to kiss
You can’t get rid of me, you can cry and wish
It’s no denying this, science says
He says I was born in Africa, but he’s a lying bitch
I was born in the laboratory, my father’s a scientist
You can’t contact me if you walk in a bathroom
Or if you talk to your classmate in your classroom
You never see me coming, I’m smooth as a jazz tune
Not airborne, I pass moves
But you should make sure they clean the needle when you getting them tattoos
I’m the reason the word positive means bad news
Idiotic if you don’t believe in me
Even took a great rapper named Eazy-E
If you have a lot of sex you should have some condoms
Cause you could live with me, ask Magic Johnson
I enter your body with only one assumed mission
That’s only to break down your immune system
Become sick easy cuz you not immune
And I can pass over through every open wound
So make sure you put a Band-Aid on your cut
Before you shake another man’s hands sayin wussup
I’m physical and visible, you can’t feel me
Medicine, I’m invincible, you can’t kill me
AIDS is my name, don’t get it wrong
It stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome)

This drug addict named Raj is infected with my evil
Got some new dope he wanna try with his people
He said go ahead and try it, it’s some brand new diesel
That’s when I found myself travelling through a needle
Don’t even know what he getting into is a shame
Tied his arm up and pump me right in his vein
He had a lot of women, was living to play his life
But he was married, he took me home to his wife
Now she’s a carrier who carries on with me
His wife had a baby, the baby was born with me
And I hope that you wouldn’t take this song silly
A lot of people infected, it’s a strong pity
You got a jimmy hat? Then you should put on jimmy
Let’s protect ourselves, we should all, really
I’m tryna live long, won’t you live long with me?
Suburbs to the city, sing this song with me

He rides to it
Don’t stress a lot
Put protection on
If he’s in your home

He rides to it
Don’t stress a lot
Put protection on
If he’s in your home

He rides to it
Don’t stress a lot

Start drawing a picture cause I’m immortal my nigga
Beef is played out so I don’t bother with niggas

Put my palms on the trigger and shoot you all in yo liver
Injure all of you niggas, I’m cool and calm as a killer

Robbed the liquor store just so we can get some Ciroc
Ate Corn Flakes, no Fruity Pebbles and Pops
Got chased by the stray dogs when I fled though the block
Bought a 50-cent razor, now I’m ready to rock
I step to your block with a George Jefferson bop
I cut him cross peddle bike, he bled to his socks
Cuz Miles didn’t have a chain when I peddled and popped
My leather bomber was better than that pleather you rocked
I wore old bomber way before Michelle and Barack
I heard up North you wasn’t reppin a lot
You never caught a 10-3, you respected the cops
How you gon use that jail shit to try to get to the top?
You woke up in PC, never slept in a box
He said he hungry so I fed him the ox
My gun is like an independent record label, Heckler and Koch

Pappa Bear,"(Cherish the love we had)
As far back as I remember, the game¹s been played
Boy chace girl and Girl dissed da boy.
But there¹s only one exception to da rule

And that is loot and a whole big bag of it.
Now, I¹m speaking from experience,
And when you¹re broke you know you get no skiniens.
And if you lucky like Luciano, now here¹s my motto,

Lay it one by one and make sure it¹s legato.
Straight up macin in a rental, now see me smile.
My clothes are all from marshalls and I got my game tight.
And prayin¹ that the gold stays on my ring

And if not I¹ll spray that shit on, again.
It¹s all good, I learned how to roll with da punches
In order for me to get a little somethin¹-somethin¹.
It wasn¹t da bomb, but, Yo, I ain¹t complainin¹.

I thank the lord and so I cherish it, oh.
Cherish the love we have.
We should cherish the life we live.
Cherish the love, cherish the love, cherish the love.

Cherish the love we have for as long as we both shall live.
Cherish the love, cherish the love, cherish the love.
Oh, aha, yeah.
Nucky for this Biggie Bear Body

The game¹s alright, but this fellow got no kind of money.
So funny, cause I is broke as a joke,
But still I maintain to hold my own.
Selective, and checkin¹ my prospective, active,

And you all disreactin¹, negative,
Cause all I speek is the truth, all I need is a roof
And the rest is all good.
I¹ve played the Mac, but so does everybody else.

I¹m blessed with my family and my friends.
A chosen few in my life that I cherish
And you other ³playerhaters² better just venish.
I often pray before I lay down by your side.

If you received your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night.
I¹m telling you, man.
Cherish the love we have

We should cherish the life we live.
Cherish the love, cherish the love, cherish the love.

You ride my rainbow in the sky
And I will catch you if you fall
You never have to ask me why
And when the rain begins to fall
I'll be the sunshine in your life
You know that we could have it all
And everything will be alright

Contemplating away to give thanks
To the one person that was there to hold my hand.
That's the one person who was there, even when she wasn't there.
Never cared and kept focused and raised a strong BEAR.
By herself and three kids in a strange country.
Educate yourself and the kids with short money
Wise words to guide you when your outdoors
And the respect to get when you're indoors.
From better to worse, from worse to terrible.
For what you've achieved - yeah, it's incredible,
And you taught me how to stay a black man,
Learned how to say sorry and how to say thanks.
I guess, there's no other way for me to express,
But I'm sure that you know, so for this - God bless!
I wish for my Mama to live forever
And for this I'll be there in any kind of weather.

And when the rain begins to fall
You ride my rainbow in the sky
And I will catch you if you fall
You never have to ask me why
And when the rain begins to fall
I'll be the sunshine in your life
You know that we could have it all
And everything will be alright

When the rain starts poring down from up above
May every drop be a symbol of my love,
Cause I'm a grown man, now, let me state,
Cause, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be here today.
On various occasions you bailed me out, swear me out,
And say: Hey, Boy, shut your mouth!
Now, I'm my own man, with my own ways,
Love for my peeps, oh Lord, I prays.
For you to live forever and be amazed,
How your boy could chase all the rainy days away.
Bring the sunshine and joy every day
Yeah, that's your boy, yeah, that's the Bear!

Oh, don't you know what we could have, baby ?
You know that we, we should be together forever

And when the rain begins to fall
You ride my rainbow in the sky
And I will catch you if you fall

Paquita la del Barrio,"Lo nuestro pa empezar no es de novela
Ni de Romeos muriendo por Julietas
Ni haremos de Love Story la secuela
Ni somos de este circo marionetas

Lo nuestro tiene un poco de desquite
Y no comparte fines de semana
Lo nuestro se cocina en escondite
Y se sirve de a dos sobre la cama

Por hoy déjame ser tu hombre perfecto
Mientras que te aparece el indicado
Para casarte busca un arquitecto
Para hacer el amor un desalmado

Lo nuestro no pregunta por futuros
Jamás llegue o me fui con equipaje
Lo nuestro se sustenta en lo inseguro
Y no se ampara en celos ni chantajes

Durara hasta que termine

Estamos pa' los modales
Que requiere el protocolo
De las páginas sociales
Ni tu ni yo, ni yo ni tu

(Me esta oyendo inútil?
Este amor durara hasta que tu quieras)

Lo nuestro es por salvaje verdadero
Y no se ampara en códigos morales
Lo nuestro es clandestino y tan sincero
Que no precisa abrir mas sucursales

Jamas te amenacé ojo por ojo
Ni hago chantajes con lo que dijiste
Reinventas Kamasutras a tu antojo
Y nunca pregunté donde aprendiste

Paquito d'Rivera,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while

Sigue aquel dolor por creer en ti
Qué fue de la ilusión y de lo bello que es vivir?
Para qué me curaste cuando estaba herido

Haha, can y'all feel that
Can y'all feel that
Jig it out, uh

Here I am in the place where I come let go
Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a mardi gras, everybody party all day
No work all play, okay
So we sip a little something, lay to rest the spill
Me an Charlie at the bar runnin' up a high bill
Nothin' less than ill, when we dress to kill
Every time the ladies pass, they be like ""hi Will""
Can y'all feel me, all ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Hatian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But every time I come I always wind up stayin'
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin'

Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
""Welcome to Miami""
""Bienvenidos a Miami""
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach till the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami

But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin out, ""Will we loved your last hit""
So I'm thinkin' I'mma scoot me somethin' hot
In this salsa-merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees
In the Carribean seas
With the hot mamis screaming ""¡Ay papi!""
Every time I come to town, they be spottin' me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin' me
So, cash in your dough
And flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
An if you ask how I know I gots ta plead the fifth ""Miami""

Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin' on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin' heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnimon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimmie your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jetskis, loungin' in the palm trees
'Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, e'ybody got em
Ain't no surprise in the club to see Sly, Stallone

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Fue tan poco y sin embargo yo te amaba
Fue mi canto para ti siempre completo
Sin ti no pude volar en otro cielo

Confundido y olvidado
Y otra mano me ofreció el fruto anhelado

Ya no vuelvas a buscarme
No tengo nada que darte

Vete a volar a otro cielo
Y deja abierta tu jaula

Pero dale de beber

La primera vez que ofreces
Para que yo aquí me quede

Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2006

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,

I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2006

And oh, and oh
It took twenty-five years but I finally see

Not the boy I was
In the car that you saw leave
But I'm still not the man that I thought I'd be

When the good Lord calls my name
Oh, I'm gonna be with you, oh I'm gonna be with you

The hour's getting later
He was supposed to be here
She's sure he would've called
She waits a little longer
There's no one in the driveway
No ones' said they've seen him
Why, is something wrong?

She looks back to the window
Suddenly the phone rings
A voice says, something's happened
That she should come right now
Her mind goes to December
She thinks of when he asked her
He bent down on his knee first
And he said

I want you forever
Forever and always

We'll grow old together
Forever and always

She walks right to the front desk
They lead her though a million halls
A maze that's never ending
They talk about what happened
But she can barely hear them
She tries to keep a straight face
As she walks into the room

She sits by his bedside
Holds his hand too tight
They talk about the kids they're gonna have
And the good life
The house on the hillside
Where they would
Stay, stay there forever

Forever and always
Through the good and the bad and the ugly
We'll grow old together
And always remember
Whether rich or for poor or for better
We'll still love each other
Forever and always

Then she gets an idea
And calls in the nurses
Brings up the chaplain
And he says a couple verses
She borrows some rings
From the couple next door
Everybody's laughing
As the tears fall on the floor
She looks into his eyes and she says

I want you forever
Forever and always
Through the good and the bad and the ugly
We'll grow old together
And always remember
Whether happy or sad or whatever
We'll still love each other
Forever and always
Forever and always
Forever and always

She finishes the vows but
The beeps are getting too slow
His voice is almost too low

I'll always love you

Lightening will flash and He'll split the sky
Nobody knows the day or the time
The trumpet will sound and we will arise

When heaven calls, this life is over
We'll stand before our God and Savior
When heaven calls we must be ready
To trade these mortal things for immortality
When heaven calls

For every man there is a time
To love and to laugh, to live and to die
So I'm living for the one who is love
And I'm dying to hear, hear Him say, ""Well done""

When heaven calls and this life is over
I'll stand before my God and Savior
When heaven calls I will be ready
To trade these mortal things for immortality
When heaven calls

Now behold the Lamb who takes away my sin
The splendor of paradise will welcome me
With arms opened wide

When heaven calls, this life it will be over
We?ll stand before our God and Savior
When heaven calls I must, you must be ready
To trade these mortal things for immortality

Paradigm Shift,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

The stillness takes us over,
Anticipation sets in,
Like the distant strings of your favorite song,
And the first note is the best note,

You were like the ocean,
Perfect is your motion,
The world is closing in,

You were like a scene that I played in my head,
Singing now or never,
Swearing every word,
We said we'd be together,
Said we'd always have a chance to make it,
We'll make it,

Every month is another mistake,
Every second growing closer to heartbreak,
What are we doing here,
Why is nothing clear?

In your eyes,
Surprises have shown me the way that I hurt you,
I swear I don't want to,
You're always there to remind me of when,

You were like the ocean,
Perfect is your motion,
The world is closing in,

You were like a scene that I played in my head,
Singing now or never,
Swearing every word,
We said we'd be together,
Said we'd always have a chance to make it,
We'll make it,

No you'll never know,

Which way to go,

And pretend that you're a ray of light
When you're a broken candle
You're keeping time with yourself
When it'd all start moving way too fast for you to handle

Heavy on time
You lost the words
But you found the rhyme
It's all just poetry now

Non-exclusive policy on determining
Exactly who we open up to
And let into our families
Then who becomes a part of our united mass of harmony

Now that's kinda become
The thesis to this song
Through suffering
Acceptance 
Grief 
And strife
There's no way that your puzzle piece
Fits into our puzzle wrong
Cause everyone is welcome
On this stage that we call life

And we don't really care who you are
Everyone is capable of looking up
And wishing on a star
So catch it so contagious
This day dreamers disease
And hope can be your sword
Slaying darkness with belief

So bring me all the worst
Of your broken bruised insane
Cause that's the thing with music
When it hits you fill no pain
No matter what you did
I promise we forgave it
When all that's left is your voice
You got no choice but to raise it
All you broken hearts
All you dejected dreams
Just let yourself be free
Because even broken wings
Can fly away

Oh in time you'll fine 
That life's a painting
And you're the artist
Just open your heart
It's never too late
To clear your canvass

So paint me jealous 
Paint me rage
For gods sake
Paint me anything
Just paint
Your brush awaits

And the walls are singing
Hallelujah amen
We're all just singing
Hallelujah amen
Come on keep sing
Hallelujah amen
Let your walls keep singing

Hallelujah amen
The walls sing you to sleep
(Hallelujah amen)

Keep you safe tonight
I swear that everything
Will be alright",Sanctuary,2010

Life becomes untrue

Sin the last diversion
My fate will be untouched
Dismissed now, 
The anger of a fool

Shadows haunt the night
Forgive me as I die

Hating the disgrace
I'm taken all the more
And I'll take all that I see
You'll do it all for me

All the more, you feed off my rejection
All the more, I tear your soul in two

Lonely are my tears of pain
And I'm punished by their cause

All the more, I'd lay myself to rest",Crying for Eternity,1992

Lost in your prayer
Lost in your insanity
It seems to be real

Soothing the pain that you feel
Can't find the key to destiny
Life is your quest, 
Erase your quest

Your Christ is failing you, 
Like poison running through
Does God know what to do, 
As I tell the harboured truth

While grief lies at your door, 
For shreds of flesh you torn
The pain comes back for me, 
Too vague for you to see

Lord, smile at me
My ashes have scattered the plains
Won't return again
Lord stare at me

Rise again

And wasting away the time I've got left

Hearing you talk is a waste of silence

",Deus Misereatur,1993
Paradise Lost,"As a withered hand grips right through fear
The cold caressing rains
The reaping arms of silence, evolve for us to see

Overruled by a lack of paitence, it's untold
That's the secret that has mad it

Constructive powers flow desire
The last intense degree
Scratching at the surface, for all of us to hear

Gatrher around, the secrets that you know
And the speech that makes blood flow
Blame desire, you'll blame revenge

Standing at the solemn shores
Where blessed fools are born
Happiness is wasted, waster blood and tears

Re-abuse infiltration, it's untold
Raping life from other nations

Rewarding enemies
Shells of empty faces, crying to be free

Dying free, the spirits gather round
While the soul lays underground
Will the voices call again?",Dying Freedom,1993
Paradise Lost,"A mass of breathing souls
For times are desolate
Passing judgment on my sentence
As I perceive my dying day
Give me a promise.
The word I will never hear
Sympathies forging, stalling in me

I'm closing all the doors
While my frown remains
Until I reach my golden haven
I'll let the sadness pass my way

Preaching the words of angels, 
To a darker side of man

My halo's fading with all the sin I deal
Have I been banished, 'a forgery'

Sear, the tender feeling as my solar glow dies
And I'm waiting for my sweet hell
You'll wait for 'your' hell, 
I wish you hell...

And this prison which we serve in
Will be a witness to our pains

Preaching the words of angels, 
To a darker side of man",Forging Sympathy,1993
Paradise Lost,"Breathing here, 
And the air is clear
Changes of which I could foresee

Violence caressing, 
Impending distress
As my body lay sleeping, 
Internally bleeding, and

Shallow despair, broken years 
Years you cannot repair
Summoned here, 
And all must see the hypocrisy
Peed back the face, the sorry mind, 
A vacant space
Born deprived, 
The moods expired in reality

A fantasy, based on harmony
A victim released accordingly

Scatter the ashes, 
Remains of life's passages,
Mocking and meaningless, 
Toys of the empty, and

Mighty and proud,

Free from the sanity of them

Destroyed by human hands,
Spare the trouble you feel, 
Save a breath for your next

Spit on the laws that I made for you
Betray the treasures within hearts

Paradise Lost,"The sullen man before me turns a head and demonstrates
The power of a weak mind can't conceal or captivate

It's lost in a bleak scope of fragmented ways

The thoughts arising, there's
no disguising where you've been

Reveal to me, your mind's identify

You'll pay, pay for the feelings that you feed me
Don't hold on to what you call a life

Anger compels a force of weakness or fear
I'll promise no forgiveness for the rest of my years

Feel it, feel it, like the pain of dying

I just sense pretentious signs...

And suddenly that name
Will never be the same
To me.

I've just kissed a girl named Maria,
And suddenly I've found
How wonderful a sound

Say it soft and it's almost like praying.

That someone needs to put an end to it all
And so when Peter comes home
He tells his mom

I'm going out in the world to save our planet
And I ain't comin back until she's saved
I'll walk my way to see the King and parliament

He walked his way to see the King and parliament

700 years of cold nights it's been there
700 years of power fading away
Mysteries, enigmas steeped within its walls
Secret hidden never to be known

Like a massive Guardian
Crouched upon the hill
Windows look like eyes
Ramparts seem like teeth

A view of all around if sightless eyes could see
Industrial madness encroaching on its brief
Insidious decay
Nothing stops its spread

Don't bring down these walls
Don't destroy history
These old stones tell us so much
To fall would be an end to
Serenity, on the hill
Serenity, on the hill

See the life on the hills all around
Keep destruction at Bay
Don't surround us with modern things
Let history survive, keep industry away

Warm Summer Nights
Moonlight on the walls
Worlds are at peace
Please, let there be
Serenity, on the hill
Serenity, on the hill

Listen to the massage, a voice from the past
Heed its warning, this monuments won't last
Help to stay the plight of these ancient walls
Now the time to fight they must not fall

See how they stand
So majestical and free
Etched on the skyline
Our heritage for free
Serenity, now's the time
Serenity, peace of mind

Watch the final scene
At the Bucher or the stake
Gonna build a tower to bum
Torch, a flaming brand, a pyre blazing scourge
Heretics Clad in flames die in silence

It is no doubt the right way
The perfect way to go
An end to this damn heresy
An end to this damn war

Crowds watch and wait the spectacle unfolds
Orgasmic in intensity their hate
Look, feel the power as flash begins to char
Die now and speak your useless prayers

Yell for forgiveness
Grovel in your shame
You'll find that your protector
Won't save you from the flames

Your vision of a brand new day
Was ravaged by the war
Fire is your just reward
Ignominy your fate

Flames shall feed the fire
Flames shall purify
The church of Rome has issued this decree
Flames destroy the works
Flames destroy the liars
Fire destroy the heresy we fear
The heresy we fear

So, if you don't see it our way this is what you get
War and flaming towers as reward
So renounce your teachings
Come back into the fold
The choice you have peace or holy war

It is no doubt the right way
The perfect way to go
An end to this damn heresy
An end to this damn war

Burn if you desire
Burn this very day
We have a thousand torches
To help you on your way
Burn if you desire
Burn in silent right

Could even save you all

For lives lost in the fire

For its part in the history of the burning

At the bidding of the king
Their swords began to sing
No living thing was sale from punity

You will find no safety
Within your city walls
We will come right through you
Until your back's against the wall

Destroy all the leaders
Bring their heads to me on a plate
Seek out the kids and the wives

Kill, kill them all

God will find his own among
The slayers and the slain
We're just here to butcher
Not to keep the score

Who!

On this day the order
To slay was handed down from the king
Kill everything that gets in your way

Destroy all that live
Hope and pray that none survive

That no-one will remain
If one man is still standing
There'll be one to lay the blame

We live by the law
Wrapped in the world
Nobody wavers
Nobody strays

Are looked upon as right
But lonely days and lonely nights
Are a symbol of our fight

Along way to go, way to go, evermore

Everything is right

Shake off the scorn

Our welfare comes last

",Search for Perfection,1989
Paradox,"[A short poem about the Castle that was home to the lyricists during writing of this album]

700 years of cold nights it's been there
700 years of power fading away
Mysteries, enigmas steeped within its walls
Secret hidden never to be known

Like a massive Guardian
Crouched upon the hill
Windows look like eyes
Ramparts seem like teeth

A view of all around if sightless eyes could see
Industrial madness encroaching on its brief
Insidious decay
Nothing stops its spread

Don't bring down these walls
Don't destroy history
These old stones tell us so much
To fall would be an end to
Serenity, on the hill
Serenity, on the hill

See the life on the hills all around
Keep destruction at Bay
Don't surround us with modern things
Let history survive, keep industry away

Warm Summer Nights
Moonlight on the walls
Worlds are at peace
Please, let there be
Serenity, on the hill
Serenity, on the hill

Listen to the massage, a voice from the past
Heed its warning, this monuments won't last
Help to stay the plight of these ancient walls
Now the time to fight they must not fall

See how they stand
So majestical and free
Etched on the skyline
Our heritage for free
Serenity, now's the time
Serenity, peace of mind

I felt it was leading to a

When I wrote this
I may have been finally able to address how it feels

Another brick-red room, another black-top town
Another misspelled band burning their own houses down
Another pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day
Another star, a touch of orange over purgatory gray

Another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
Another song that runs too long, God knows no one needs
More misguided ghosts, more transparent hands
To drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our riot dance

Beneath another burning sky, behind our painted lips
In scares of catatonic smile-covered ankle-bitten ships
So throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea
As protection from the paper-thin perfection you project on me

When this repetition ends behind the window shades
A semi-conscious sorrow sleeping in the bed I've made
That most unrestful bed, that most original of sins
And you'll say that's what I get when I let ambitions win again

I'd hate to let you down so I'll let the waters rise
And drown my dull reflection in the naive expectation in your eyes
Back in a cast bit-part, back when I felt most free
I had a butcher's heart and no one thought they knew me

So before the regiment resumes, before the dreaded sun appears
My driver's waiting, so let's make one point crystal clear:
You see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine

You're no friend of mine
You're no friend of mine
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine
You see a flood-lit form
I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours and you're no friend of mine

I see myself in the reflection of people's eyes
Realising what they see may not be even close to the image I see in myself
And I hate I might actually be more afraid to let myself down
I feel like they know the story
I saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat
Twelve years ago I stood on the shore
Jump in and grab the coat
And the river is rushing toward a waterfall
And my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land
I let go of the coat but the coat won't let go of me
In any case please let me know if there's more I can give you
If nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful",No Friend,2017

And you kiss me, and you wish could see what happens next

Headfirst into shallow pools

Paramount Studio Orchestra,"I've never met you, yet never doubt, dear;
I can't forget you, I've thought you out, dear.
I know your profile and I know the way you kiss,
just the things I miss on a night like this.
If dreams are made of imagination
I'm not afraid of my own creation.
With all my heart, my heart is here for you to take.
Why should I quake? I'm not awake.

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic?

Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
while all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic
merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Isn't it romantic?
Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
and when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.
Kiddies are romantic
and if we don't fight we soon will have a troupe.
We'll help the population,
it's a duty that we owe to dear old France.

In the alley for the cypresses that leads to the house

Pardinho,"Em um bar de Ribeirão Preto
Eu vi com meus olhos, esta passagem
Quando o champanha, corria a rodo
No alto meio da granfinagem

Nisto, chegou um peão
Trazendo na testa o pó da viagem
Pro graçom ele pediu uma pinga
Que era pra rebater a friagem

Levantou o almofadinha
E falou pro dono eu tenho má fé
Quando caboclo que não se enxerga
Num lugar destes, vem por os pés

Senhor, que é o proprietário
Deve barrar a entrada de qualquer
E principalmente nesta ocasião
Que está presente o rei do café

Foi uma salva de palma
Gritaram viva pro fazendeiro
Quem tem milhões de pés de café
Por este rico chão brasileiro

Sua safra é uma potência
Em nosso mercado e no estrangeiro
Portanto, vejam que este ambiente
Não é pra qualquer tipo rampeiro

Com um modo bem cortês
Responde o peão pra rapaziada
Esta riqueza não me assusta
Toco em aposta qualquer parada

Cada pé desse café
Eu amarro um boi da minha invernada
E pra encerrar o assunto eu garanto
Que ainda me sobra uma boiada

Foi um silêncio profundo
Peão deixou o povo mais pasmado
Pagando a pinga com mil cruzeiros
Disse ao garçom pra guardar o trocado
Quem quiser meu endereço
Que não se faça de arrogado
É só chegar lá em Andradina
E perguntar pelo rei do gado",Rei do Gado,1998

Ran down on a bitch, she almost pissed on her leg
Bitches think they fuckin' with me, must be sick in the head
Why don't you chill with the beef and get some chicken instead?
Got the crown, shut it down, how they hype up in the 6
If she dead, let her lay won't bring no life into this bitch

I never got a yo when my pockets were low
But now I'm makin' dough it's all hello, hello
Since I got to dunkin' these motherfuckers I be duckin'
Callin' me on my beeper they ain't really dumb or nothin'
All up on my jock lookin' for nuts for the lickin'
Havin' such an ass, the nearest one I'm kissin'
All up on my diznick and all up in my business
So drop ya panties before ya want to give me kisses
I keep em' yes I keep em' reminiscin'
Thinkin' about my thoughts and I get with em'
Just because I'm makin' money my neighbors never blink
So happy birthday mom, ya gift is not a clock but a mink
Father was a trip, always steady trippin'
Basically cause my eyes were always red from smokin' up on spliffin'
Said I want to out the jack, can bum up in his plumbers house
But he sung a different tune when he heard about my bank account
I guess I'll be OK, I'm really not the guilty
The null is not to follow which they is filthy
Been tokin' marijuana smokin forty ounce
I never was a hoodlum but I must admit I knew em'
Forget where I came from, I know I'm always stankin'
And removin' the junkie hookers
That was givin' me up to Spinky on the lifeline

[Verse 2]
Talkin' about back in the days of my grade school years
I used to be a wild child smokin' blunts drinkin' beers
Up against, on the ends it's sticky gum on the seats
Shootin' spitballs and cause crazy fights every week
I was the complete rascal, Dennis the Menace
I there was any trouble goin' down best believe I was in it
suspension and detention became the normal activity
Teachers callin' mom cause they couldn't deal with me
And my behavior, even the next door neighbor gave up
Advice, on how to chastise me right
Sayin' whoop his ass, give him a beat and a whiplash
And that'll put an end to ya problem Mrs. Gash
Mom took heed and on the body got frame
But did it help, nope just caused more brain damage
Course the same way, the next day I was at it again
From terrorizin' the halls to cuttin' classes with my man
But my educational span was spectacular
I'm just a jerk to do my cause most Polly want to cracker
And I ain't a actor like the one with true identity
So wait, that's cool cause it wasn't for me
See I knew I could never be like Doogie Howser
So after eleventh grade I was outtie five thousand
On my lifeline

[Verse 3]
When I got mid-teenage, I started the rage with rough ones
Known as the Run-Out Crew and go snatchin' thugs
Pullin' plugs on suckers and it's on every corner
My grandma tried to school me said son your a goner
But I don't listen I was like stop breakin' my balls
Threw up my hands and gave 50 Grand a call
I told him to put me down cause the sacks pay a lot
Now I'm throwin' rocks, dodgin' cops and goin' out like pops
Daddy cool cause he went to school for an education
He found the nation but he still found his self facin'
Time in the ghetto and communities
And that pledge allegiance to the falg shit ain't foolin' me
He heard my story he put me down like folks
And they was on they way to Arizona loc
He droppin' the keys, makin' these G's, that's what I need
But someone else could drop off threes, I got freeze

[Verse 4]
Lifeless cat can he help us with each other
He's my partner, he's my cop, he's my buddy
I'm the mack oh yes a frame, yes a frame oh yes I am
What a brother gotta do to make em' chill
Damn, at the club smokin' pot, chillin' in the parking lot
Drinkin' forties talkin' shit and what not
There was a guy and a girl K-S-L called em'
Said they tried to start beef send to the butchers
Didn't know that he had guns, we heard buckshots and bullets
My eyes had to lie as we jumped through the bushes
Had to say thanks, thank God we got away
Saw the fool by himself the very next day
Now should K-S-L leave em' alone or should I let my lips whistle
He's a stupid motherfucker with a pistol
As for the dude he wasn't scared
Until I held a pistol to his head
He started to cry, K-S-L put it down do not lie
Go on my lifeline

This is a letter to myself
Painted picture, cry for help
It feels like I am now alone
I can't call you on the phone

If I could reach into your heart, I'd tear your world apart
It kind of broke inside of me

It's always hard when you lose a friend
I don't quite know what words to say
Whispered nothings fade away

Pay close attention
And witness knowledge born on the microphone
for the people that I call my own

even though it wasn't saying (shit)
Well them days is gone I don't play that
Pick the punk and I'll say like wack
Stick with the sick style for the serious
Hip-Hop lovers can't get enough of this
Black tracks on wax are so smooth
You can't get help but the thought to move
This is a call and a plea for unity
Black is back uplift and be free
Keep pushin, our movement moves on.. so strong, now

With a raised fist I resist
I don't burn, so don't you dare riff
or step to me, I'm strong and black and proud
And for the (bullshit) I ain't down
Life in the city's already rough enough
without some young sucka runnin up
You don't know me, so don't step
I roll to the right and then bust your lip

I drop science, and keep the peace

with forces strong as Allah's my third eye
Black is back and P-Dog'll never die
Who said that you can't do this
Can't be wise or be for the movement
Games I won't have so don't you play none
You'll see why when I'm gone
Skinheads end up dead cause I don't play
Brothers swarm under the form of Scarface
Round up, roll out, we'll roll em up like Rolo's
I stomp sixteen solo

Can't be the cure for a sick disease
Just the way the devil had planned it
Rape then pillage everyone on the planet
Then give 'em fake gods at odds with Allah
Love thy enemy and all that hooplah
Hear close to the words I wrote
Crack, cocaine are genocide on black folks
Cool when I write mine, never coulda missed this
Damn right when you think seditious
And I move swiftly, you can't get with me
The triple six moved quick but missed me
When I came off involved in conscience
So don't ask why next time I start this

Now let's get wild, allow me to freestyle
I build and fill your mind up with know-how
Common sense, a defense to next time
A pig tried to step to this, listen
Never let someone work on ya
They don't belong 'till they set you from
Ya can't be intrigued by the leads a pig lead
Unless you don't give a fuck to be free
Keep stompin' on, keep stompin'
Attitude but I ain't from Compton
I can't be fucked around or muffed around
I can't be held down, check the sound
And keep in tuned on point on target
The revolution won't be thwarted
A set back, cause my man it's plain to see
Lost in a white surpremacy

to help improve another brother's life
by coming through with the righteous groove
Tells right from wrong, makes people move

who want to build and uplift my people too, so

Cause the words are truth and truth's what I teach
By talkin bout the things that I see
When talkin bout this color called ebony

Not sellin drugs, I'm above a thug
Killin off his own, tryin to make a buck, naw
That ain't the way it's done today
Gotta come together and gotta educate
Gotta, uplift, lift up your head
Stand strong and proud, don't end up dead
Take time to make that move
Be sure to be straight and you'll improve
Live long, be strong, and you'll see
That better is a life lived long and carefree
Just stay on a righteous path
You'll see the truth and won't have to ask why
I don't make the rhymes that say
how ignorant brothers act nowadays
I just talk about the things that I see

Brethern heed the call of enlightenment
Of truth, Asiatic discipline's frightenin

Hear the call and all heed the savior
Praise Allah cause in his energy made ya
the cream, Asiatic earth-born manchild
Freedom's comfort for some but meanwhile
Young brothers just don't realize
Cocaine's the plan, the devil derived
Produced and let loose to youth for profit
Fake so-called negroes won't stop it
Witness lies fed straight to the brotherman
Hopes are lost to the malevolent gameplan
Annihilation of original citizens
of this great planet Earth - listen
P-Dog spits the dope words born
Batterram's rollin task force swarm
Pigeons squawk with the talk of a new high
Controlled by the man whose plan is genocide
Intense is a sense of ignorance
When the wack can't get with the pro-black
program that's designed to enduce thought
Rhymes ya bought keep Panthers taught
Punks stay put, skinheads are flatfoot
Keys are played as I stay on route
Down the path of the righteous chosen
Word is born as the wack stay frozen
Locked in time, mindset is Babylon
P's the martyr while MC's babble on
Letter sixteen is me and some see
I freeze and snuff MC's like pipe dreams
Makin a mark with the start of the movement
Tracks in fact weak wack can't do this
Tooth decay cause the fake been snozin
Lead the lost and the cost is you've been
freed from lies by the wise new messenger

can't underestimate or recreate

Which brings us to the next move - it's a simple case of
show and tell or rather show and prove
Of made up gank moves and foolish fairy tales

And train your brains with the pride and the insight
to do what's right, yo black, it's yo' life!

To lead the lost for the cost of a beat tape

But the plan had plans of it's own for a brother man
A bad case of the right place at the right time
Makes you just ask, why?

I guess, you suppose you know what a nigga do
To a female that was meant for you
Jealous 'cause your girlfriend screwin' a black man
So you bust caps on an innocent by stand

But I guess, we all look the same
A goddamn shame, you don't know my name
Must-a just been two blacks so the payback
Fit the ID for someone like me

Rollin' twenty-five deep, troop down in a parkin' lot
Ready movin' steady when I bust your spot, huh

And leave the dog alone till the dancin' is done
But then when you're ready for the brother who leads
And feeds all rap lovers with rhymes like these
I dish a little taste of the bass of Scarface
And paste a rhyme space to chase the weak-kneed
'Cause I don't play, well my name ain't
A A-T-C, a N-W-A
I'm Paris, the Asiatic lord of light
With the power to fight and write rhymes to stay

Step and be prone to a cap to the dome
I don't quit, I'll start tearin' up shit

This is a Scarface set and no snakes allowed
Keep the pace ready set brothers rollin' out
Packin' a MAC-10, strapped and capped in
Now who's to blame for the hate that hate made?

Not lotto but I'm in it to win it and never lose
Never singin' but swingin' and bringin' nothin' but bad news

Won't slip and the record won't skip, better get hip

Paris,"Back in the day 1986
Me and Mad Mike puttin' records in the mix
Doin' party after party, high schools and jam
Back before the glock was king and brothas spoke like men
Makin' demo after demo tryin' to come up quick
It's funny how niggas treat you when you ain't got shit
But now I kept on cause pops told me 
Never to let anybody in the way where I try to get
It was me and D.R. freakin' with the funk
Jerry in the jail, I had a system in the trunk
And it was on, Friday night the party's jumpin'
Summertime hits had the speakers straight bumpin'
And believe me even though we had no loot
Everybody knew that we was finst' to come up soon
I still remember them days
They was crazy but now they gone
It ain't nothin' like it used to be before
Back in the days...

1990 fresh out of college
Public and the media settin' niggas up with knowledge
And I love it cause without them there would be no me
Took a trip down to Oakland
Heard the minister speak, felt deep
And shortly I was in 
On while forever down for my people 'til the day that I die
That's when ""Devil Made Me Do It,"" it was made
I still remember the days, still remember the rage
And I was into everyday building, trying to be much more
Took a trip down to Cuba, met Assata Shakur
Had dinner with Fidel, talked about old times
And now America's steady tryin' to destroy minds
And when I got back it seemed much clearer to me
And when my cousin went to war he was only 19
I still remember them days
They was crazy but now they gone
It ain't nothin' like it used to be before
Back in the days...

1992 when I'm sour inside
Cause a couple homies passed away before their time
And even though I'm movin' unity
Schoolin' better than most and it ain't the same 
Cause I still feel pain and I'm tryin' to coup
And everyday's gettin' clearer to me
Cause if it ain't guns and drugs, it's the pigs and HIV
And now I'm lookin' for a way to try to fight it back
But you see it's votin' time and now you want to ban rap
Thought I was fucked playin' by your rules
""Sleeping With the Enemy"" was album number two
Let's take a look around
And see which one of you all
Gotta balls to put me out
Here's a middle finger off for all you
Tripped for a minute but before too long
A young brotha said: ""Fuck it!"" and a label was born
I still remember them days
They was crazy but now they gone
It ain't nothin' like it used to be but yo
Now it's 94 and I'm servin' album number three
How many fake want to-be Gees do I see?
Now we're back to days of the nigga and the bitch
No deposit, no return, it's a trip, I check my grip
And realize that it's all in your mind
Mothafuck you and that fake gangsta shit
I stays righterous and serv'em with the dope
Should a truth get a clue?
Monkey see, monkey do
Back in the days...",Back in the Days,1996
Paris,"On the scene back again with the mothafuckin' grip
93 was the year P-Dog came rippin' shit
Bouncin' out the belly of the beast
And still the same nigga
That was hollerin': ""Fuck peace!""
But check it out, it's the same old thing
Cause now the year's 94
And ain't a damn thing changed
Niggaz still droppin' dead like flies
And i'm still lookin' for a way
To make us raise
I impose that I still hate the devil
(That's right!)
And I'm a mothafucka 
That'll take your ass to the next level

Yeah! Right back at you once again in 94...

Back up in you with another mothafuckin' bomb...
And we kickin' the real...

So anyway I'ma do it this time
So you want to hear
Specially designed for your mind and soldier's ear
Cause niggaz nowadays just shoot

And fuckin' with the crew
Will get your ass peeled like fruit
And everybody want to be a Gee

Please, fuckin' with them fake fairytales
Nigga, i don't trip cause I still kicks the realiest shit
So please back on up, I'm lettin' off
Representin' Allah and I'm raw

What I'm kickin?: It's real

So I'm still comin' on with this

Regonize that it ain't nothin' but a thang
To see a nigga lockdown, underground or in the sweep
And you ain't never gonna take me out cause I...

Paris,"[Paris]
Still in this bitch, ninety-eight is just another year
I murder money drama bitches, that fall in piers
Comin out the city where no pity be a way of life
When niggaz quick to bust a cap in you to earn they stripes
Ain't nothin changed in these West coast killin fields
I seen so many homies die that I ain't got no feeling
So I handles mine, pack a strap and keep on strivin
And quick to let these niggaz if it get down to violent
Cause these haters ain't no friends to me, they make it plain
But I refuse to be a victim of these ghetto games
Break away from all the stress, bullshit and aggravation
And now I'm quick to blast if you want a confrontation
But it seem like every time I turn around it's drama
Hella flowers, coffee drinkin, and cryin momma
Somethin tellin me this madness ain't gon' never stop
So I keep strivin fo' the top

[Chorus]
Now everything you think you seein might not be the truth
Understand these cowards fold when these niggaz shoot
Understand this rap shit is just another way
Just another lick where motherfuckers gettin paid
It really ain't the same as it was in the past
Back when shit was new, niggaz thought that it would last
Understand this rap game is just another front
Just another way for motherfuckers comin up, and it's like that

[Paris]
So what's the ticket out the ghetto for these young players
Slangin dope, playin ball or bein rhymesayers
They want the money fast, FUCK SCHOOL, that ain't what's happenin
So some of them niggaz got together and they started rappin
And it would be like who the tightest on the microphone
Makin demos in the basement of they momma's home
And 'fore you know it niggaz got theyself a record deal
And now they makin money, doin what they love for real
Limosines, fast cash, and autographs
Groupie hoes after every show be workin the staff
And magazines givin love cause they shit is best
Unless of course it's The Source and you from the West
Now momma's braggin cause they baby's on the television
And they livin every day, like it's Thanksgiving
But you know, what they say if it sound too good
to be true it probably is that's the music biz

[Chorus]

[Paris]
I'm 28 and I've been in the game since '86
World tours, cash money, and hella hits
Done seen these rap stars disappear like civil rights
And go from po' to rich to po' again, overnight
So many perils in this game if yo' team is faulty
That's why my lawyer keep these motherfuckin devils off me
And freak bitches be, quick to set you up by playin
that pussy game like, you the daddy or you rapin
See dumb niggaz get they money took, tryin to be
that motherfucker on the television out with Robin Leach
A couple of cars, hella clothes, and before you know it
That nigga to' back, hella broke with nuttin showin
So here's a little game from a homey that's still playin
The mo' shit you see a nigga with, the mo' he payin
In this rap life, nuttin what it seem to be
I hope you motherfuckers feel me, that's reality

Ain't nothin new, sheeit, I keep it mannish

What's happenin junior?  What's goin down?
How the women actin, heard you was crushin 'em in the town
Look good don't they?  Hell yeah, shoulda saw
the ones last week at the mall, hella raw
And all tryin to come up, like video queens
So fine they make some of us do the stupidest things
But be careful though, get caught up, know what you doin
Fuck around and be a teenage pop, and life is ruined
How ya momma doin?  She cool, is that right?
Seen your sister last week at the bank, lookin tight
Keep yo' eyes on her, cause niggaz, nowadays
always lookin for some new ones to train, so many ways
And I'm amazed, but not amused as such
We all brothers but some of us gettin caught in the clutch
Another, day go by another, day's the same
Another, day of strife I say a, prayer for change
But I cain't complain, and if I did so what?
The best we can do is try to find the truth and come up
I'm still bangin on these tracks, still keep hope for us
Yeah I'm back, still rough on wax, and still bust

What's on your mind?  What, your homey died?
Over what, some bullshit?  Is that right?
I known him since back in the days, we was tight
Used to date his older sister back in late '85
I just wonder why, the shit don't make no sense
How many gotta die befo' these niggaz convinced?
Death is final every day for my people I'm prayin
Seems so many lose our futures fuckin 'round in the game
A motherfuckin shame, another life is ruined
Know you want to ride but gunnin for them niggaz is useless
See we all confused, damn, but everything is a test
Don't let ego and emotions be the reason you slip
Cause though your boys might fall, fall for doin wrong
Friends drop like drawers, nobody mobbin like the law
And we don't need no more in the pen or at war
It's open season every brother on the street is a target, believe

And though it seem it ain't gon' stop, I still rise
above this bullshit hip-hop, I still rise
Supply, wise words, disguised in rhyme verse
I curse, what these niggaz is sayin, ain't nuttin real
Just fairy tales of pimpin these sisters and makin mail
I see 'em pose, see the bitchy roles they play
See these videos they shitty, see the way we portrayed
See these sellin out acts just sellin our rap
Believe wannabe macks with powerhouse tracks
Redefined black manhood, defied Allah
We rise up, fuck this bullshit, survival or die
See them thuggin niggaz muggin with that criminal pout
See 'em frown in every photo, see that shit in they mouth
See 'em tattered lookin battered chasin pussy and weed
Makin hookers out of queens every video feed
I see these labels sit back, push this shit like crack
Now every record every act, got you thinkin it's black
to act a fool chasin pussy like it's hard to get
I see these crackers think it's cool, bein niggaz for chips
I split jiggaboo chins, analyze these trends
If it's down to me and them I'm sendin flowers to kin
Ain't nuttin easy in this world, struggle makes the man
Don't let these motherfuckers do you understand the plan, believe

That's how they do it to us, it seem we caught in between

Everybody chasin' dough, if them ain't your folks, then here we go
If we ridin', then let's ride, do-or-die, homicide
But tell me the reason for lost lives
Could it be we all caught up in a scandalous system?
Fallin' through the cracks, blinded by the lies we given
Seen these g's on these streets bleed freely but why?

Conversation keep these cowards off my stick when I bust
Forget versache-watchy cartier playas, I'm still the same
But I can't condone the phony 'cause I'm prone to be me

From the atlantic to the bay, what? life goes on
To all my people gettin' paid, huh? life goes on
Never forgettin' where you came from, life goes on, fa' sho
Now keep on strivin' and survivin' don't let life get down on you
Forget these haters that betray mistakin' kindness for a fool
Keep your head up, don't get fed up, keep on doin' what you do

Paris,"I see a message from the government, like every day
I watch it, and listen, and call 'em all suckas
They warnin' me about Osama or whatever
Picture me buyin' this scam I said never

You in tune to a Hard Truth Soldier spittin
I stay committed gives a fuck to die or lose commission
It's all a part of fightin' devil state mind control
And all about the battle for your body mind and soul

And now I'm hopin' you don't close ya mind - so they shape ya
Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us AIDS and raped us
Another Bush season mean another war for profit
All in secret so the public never think to stop it
The illuminati triple 6 all connected
Stolen votes they control the race and take elections
It's the Skull and Bones Freemason kill committee
See the Dragon gettin' shittier in every city

What would you do if you
knew all of the things we know
Would you stand up for truth
Or would you turn away too?

And then what if you saw
All of the things that's wrong
Would you stand tall and strong?
Or would you turn and walk away..

Now ask yourself who's the one with the most to gain (Bush)
'Fore 911 motherfuckas couldn't stand his name (Bush)
Now even niggas waivin' flags like they lost they mind
Everybody got opinions but don't know the time

'Cause America's been took - it's plain to see
The oldest trick in the book is MAKE an enemy
Of phony evil so the government can do it's dirt
And take away ya freedom lock and load, beat and search

Ain't nothin' changed but more colored people locked in prison
These pigs still beat us but it seem we forgettin
But I remember 'fore Septmember how these devils do it
Fuck Guliani ask Diallo how he doin

We in the streets holla ?jail to the thief? - followv Fuck wavin' flags bring these dragons to they knees
Oil blood money make these killers ride cold
Suspicious suicides people dyin' never told

It's all a part of playin' God so ya think we need 'em
While Bin Ashcroft take away ya rights to freedom
Bear witness to the sickness of these dictators
Hope you understand the time brother cause it's major

What would you do if you
knew all of the things we know
Would you stand up for truth
Or would you turn away too?

And then what if you saw
All of the things that's wrong
Would you stand tall and strong?
Or would you turn and walk away..

So now you askin why my records always come the same
Keep it real, ain't no fillers, motherfuck a blingin
Mine eyes seen the gory of the coming of the beast
So every story every word I'm sayin' ?Fuck Peace?

See you could witness the illuminati bodycount
Don't be surprised these is devils that I'm talkin' bout
You think a couple thousand lives mean shit to killers?
Nigga I swear to God we the ones - ain't no villans

Or any other word they think to demonize a country
Ain't no terror threat unless approval ratings slumpin
So I'ma say it for the record we the ones that planned it
Ain't no other country took a part or had they hand in

Just a way to keep ya scary so you think you need 'em
Praisin' Bush while that killer take away ya freedom
How many of us got discovered but ignore the symptoms?
Niggas talkin' loud but ain't nobody sayin' shit

And with the 4th Amendment gone eyes are on the 1st
That's why I'm spittin' cyanide each and every verse
I see the Carlyle group and Harris Bank Accounts
I see 'em plead the 5th each and every session now

And while Reichstag burns see the public buy itv I see the profilin' see the media's compliance
War is good for business see the vicious make a savior
Hope you understand the time brother cause it's major

What would you do if you
knew all of the things we know
Would you stand up for truth
Or would you turn away too?

And then what if you saw
All of the things that's wrong
Would you stand tall and strong?
Or would you turn and walk away..",What Would You Do?,2003

Paris,"I came from a place I forgot
I woke up in the parking lot, far from a meal and a cot
On the corner where all the streets got the same name
Maybe my brain's on the brink of (insane!)
Pain between the papers while sleepin' on the train
This the land of milk and honey (know what I'm sayin'?!)
The invisible man times three
Black, down and out, out standin' on a corner (no doubt)
Now a nation of homeless sleepin' in bus stations
Another win for the pilgrims who said (no more Haitians)
As I proceed, someone to feed me is what I need
(Three blocks of dealers tryin' to hit me off with some weed)
Yeah, avenues and boulevards hungry as a (fucker)
Hope to get a ride from a (trucker aye yo man)
Everybody know I ain't no (sucker)
Every time I used to drop thirty at the (rucker that's it)
Away from the crazy kids in Generation Wrecked
Dissin' pyramids while praisin' projects
(Walk past old folks gettin' no respect!)
Callin' young folks a bunch a no-good rejects
And I walk on

[Chorus]
An eye for an eye, I can't recognize the man in the mirror
Is it I? It is I
Now who this cat I'm lookin' at?
Cause I've been waitin' so long, to get where I'm goin'
An eye for a eye, in this country 'tis of thee
Now how the hell, can I be free
And who this cat I'm lookin' at?
Cause I've been lost so long without anybody knowin'

So I move on (uh-huh) and I walk on (yeah yeah!)
Past the preachers and the pimps gettin' their talk on (say word?!)
Why do home gotta be where the negative roam
To be or not to be (so I roll alone)
I'm trapped within, this skin and these bones
Amongst temporary kings, on cellular phones
Can I last, as I walk past
Mad cigarette billboards, and malt liquor ads
(Walkin' on da bottles and potato chip bags)
Everyone I see got the nerve to brag
Where they from, what they got, and don't own squat
Disrespect where they from and you might get shot
Zombies askin' me, what the latest bomb be
(You shoulda shot the fuckin' sheriff and the fuckin' deputy G!)
For okayin' the drug trade and lettin' it be
But I know prison for me, is an industry
So I walk, heard the best things in life be free
(Didn't God make this land and the air that we breathe)
Not for the homeless, don't give a damn about me
In the mirror somebody else is starin' at me
Maybe prison is the skin I'm within
All this time I been sufferin' can't fix it with a Bufferin'
Plus they said I'll never work in this town again (God damn!) 
So I keep on walkin', yeah

Lil' DayDay is Big Day and just did time
Seen him standin' (on the unemployment line?!)
Which collided with the line of the health clinic
I seen Crazy Stacy, her ass standin' up in it
No more welfare, they cut her Medicaid
(Damn! My momma used to do her braids)
I keep walkin, so they don't see me
But I doubt if they doin' much better than me
So I walk on, never take the planet for granted
I paved the concrete, asphalt and granite
I walked past three brothers, sittin on the porch
With a yard of dirt, and littered with Newports
Talkin' how they comin' up while they sittin' on they ass
As I walk past 'em I'm the target of they laughs
And one said ""Let's get him for his fuckin' stash""
As I walked fast, past the other yards with grass
Had a little cash, I tried to make it last
From a few deals I made from cleanin' windshields
I ran like a (rally) they caught me in the (alley)

You got to tell 'em JUST LIKE THAT, you know what I'm sayin'?

You dig what I'm sayin'? Yo man, all they wanna do is get what you got
But when you ain't got nothin', then they wanna cut you off

You know what I'm sayin'? I mean long distance

C'mon, kick it!

Back one more time, here to put the message in a rough rhyme
It's important that you knowin' the time
Cause I'm seein' the program, know what I know and
Until we get together we will never be up for sure
So I wreck like I'm posessed by Malcolm X
See the feds want us dead, we too complex
I always speak the truth, comin' from me to you
We movin' as a unit so you know we refuse to lose
I got my eyes on the lies from Washington
I'm a survivor, I know how the West was won
See a show and tell, the way the CoIntel
Undermine the real hip-hop so the cops can trail
But know bad boys move in silence
Save us all from the pain of a life of violence
They tappin my phone, full grown and knowin'
And still prone to refute the lies, won't stop until we rise

[Chorus]
Rise up! ""C'mon, ah-c'mon""
Rise rise up! ""One more time""
We rise rise up! ""C'mon, ah-c'mon""
Rise rise up! ""To the beat y'all""

I'm a hard truth soldier to the bone for change
Demonstrate and separate the fact from strange
Blame companies killin' our children
When the villain's on the record 
Never think for a second that's the way we live
Wanna squeeze on the fleas at MTV
We quiz knots for the cops at BET
Seize the time, always rhymin' combinin' the antidote
For dope Interscope and fake gangster quotes
Cause I can recollect times when records set
Collect a dead brother you mind if you silence it yet
Rest the program, defeat the beastie
Cause on the street they do as we influenced by what we see
And yes it ""Weighs a Ton"" I say it once again
That's why the Enemy is down with Paris and KAM
It's all fam, we collide we live
Better decide on which side you ride, won't stop until we rise

[Chorus]

Y'all don't know, y'all don't know uh 
Y'all don't know, y'all don't know uh 
Y'all don't know, y'all don't know uh 
Y'all don't know, y'all don't know uh 

I know the power of fame, ain't never playin' no games
Never croonin' is provin', that we ready for change
Never simpin' but they pimpin' my people, for the dollars
So I holla back it keep us from evil 'til them devils are collared
And like I said it's on, I say it once again
Better know the plan to keep us ignorant
Brother to brother, ain't no other can smother
Or erase my case, we marry words with bass
Just another wicked rhyme that I'm rappin' on
S1's got my back if the clappin' come
Pass on the work, makin' sure the words are known
Keep 'em nervous, make 'em understand we servin' foes
Keep it goin' strong, nevertheless, know the enemy
And never back down, you can take it to press
'Less the mic like the art dart told you before
We for the prize emphasis the fight, now c'mon and rise

Paris Bennett,"Intro:

I'm jus (caught up)

(Caught up)


Verse I:

I never thought I find myself stuck in the middle (the middle), of a two way street (two way street)

Tryin' to keep the both of you would be so simple (so simple), but that jus ain't me (aint me).

My east side got that good love thang, but my west side got that best friend thang (friend thang)

Now inside I'm torn between the two and I don't know (I don't know), I don't know what I'm gonna do


Hook I:

Tell me, who do you choose? Who do you give your love to when you get caught up.

Tell me, what do you do? You don't know 'til it happens to you, 'til you get caught up.

'Til you get caught up

'Til you get caught up


Verse II:

I tried to trust my heart to go the right direction (direction). It's pullin' me both ways (both ways).

I can't deny with both of them it feels so electric (so electric) I jus can't walk away.

My east side got that magical touch but my west makes my heart feel love (heart feel love)

I can't decide I'm torn between the two and I don't know (I don't know) I don't know what to do


Hook II:

Tell me, who do you choose? Who do you give your love to when you get caught up.

Tell me, what do you do? You don't know 'til it happens to you, 'til you get caught up.

I don't know what I'm gonna do. Its like I'm stuck and I just can't move.

And how'd my heart lead me to this road (this road)

And I don't know which way to go.


Break:


I don't know where to go


Hook II (Repeat)

Tell me, who do you choose? Who do you give your love to when you get caught up.

Tell me, what do you do? You don't know 'til it happens to you, 'til you get caught up.

I don't know what I'm gonna do. Its like I'm stuck and I just can't move.

And how'd my heart lead me to this road

And I don't know which way to go.

VERSE: What I wasn't cute enough was it my crying was it the way I laugh was it the timing did it cost too much for the diapers and formula to be there for me what made you reject me and stop trying how could you forget me tell me what I did to never go for ice cream or have you pushing my swing now I'm grown and you're still not there for me

Paris Combo,"
Elle s'appelait Irénée
Elle était envoûtée
Par le charme hidalgo
Les castagnettes et le tango
Son souhait le plus ardent
De prendre pour amant
Un beau caballero
Un vrai, tout en chair et en os

AÏ, aï, Irénée, pourquoi n'es-tu pas née
En pays latin, plutôt qu'en pleine Vendée
Aï, Aaï, que dolor, de n'avoir pas le corps
Des andalouses, que l'on jalouse et 
qu'on adore
C'est pourquoi, pas à pas, elle envia 
les appâts
Qu'elle n'avait pourtant pas, aï, aï, 
quelle déception!

Consumée par sa passion
Elle tenait toujours bon
Dansant le flamenco
Sur son parquet à coup d'sabots
Mais un jour, n'y tenant plus
Elle reprit le dessus
En bateau s'embarqua
Direction la Costa brava
“Aï, je suis folle de voir tant d'espagnols!”
Criait l'hystérique en péninsule ibérique
Mais l'allégresse fit place à la détresse
Quand dans un bal, elle découvrit 
l'ampleur du mal
Les madones endiablées se raillaient d'Irénée
Car tous les espagnols la trouvaient 
mollassonne!

Tel un taureau dans l'arène
Fonçant sur tout c'qui bouge
Irénée hors d'haleine,
Furieuse, finit par y voir rouge
Saisissant les éventails,
Les cheveux en bataille,
Irénée frappait fort,
Avec la grâce d'un matador
“Mé qué, mé qué, mais quelle mouche l'a piquée!”
Bégayaient ainsi les conchitas qu'on tapait
“Aï, aï, caramba, mama, quelle corrida!”
Bissaient les gars qui, ma foi, n'en 
revenaient pas
D'assister à ceci, tout ça sans sourciller
Se gardant bien d'y mettre le holà, olé!

C'est donc en perdant la tête
Qu'Irénée fit la conquête
De la population
Mais surtout d'un certain Ramon
Quant au bellâtre, elle eût dit
“Oui, tu es le mâle de ma vie”
Elle en profita aussi
Pour avoir le mal du pays

“Aï, je voudrais
Tant revoir ma Vendée
Aï, mon Ramon
Ramènes-moi z'y, si tu es un homme”
Le pauvre gars,
Ma foi, n'eût pas le choix
Avec Irénée
Franchit donc les Pyrénées
Et voilà, qu'en Vendée, l'on se vante, 
à tout va
D'avoir tous les soirs de la s'maine 
une corrida

Où seuls de vieux, de très vieux singes sont assis
Dans leur cuisine, ils gambergent
Pour améliorer leur living

Un jour que j'étais dans mon antre
Où l'on entre sans frapper
Quelqu'un a pris l'escalier
Sur une petite idée de colimaçon
Il était maçon, il avait les mains tendres
Et de qu'elle façon, il m'a bien fait comprendre
Que de tout l'immeuble, j'étais
La voisine qu'il avait le plus envie d'aimer

Alors, j'ai dit: ""Merci...
Merci beaucoup, mais voyez-vous
Je viens d'emménager dans cet appartement
Où je vie seule, tout simplement!""

{Refrain:}
Mais au même moment, j'ai pensé
J'ai pensé, j'ai pensé, j'ai pensé...
L'amour a frappé à ma porte
J'ai ouvert, que le diable m'emporte
Tout mon squelette est ravi
Et ça, je l'emporte au paradis...

Mais Senor, il faut que je m'agace
Pour l'heure, il faut que je ramasse
Tous mes sentiments égarés,
Mes pôles oubliés
Mon ressort abimé
Mais Senor, il faut que je m'agace
Pour l'heure, il faut que je ressasse
Tout mon squelette en entier
Mes plaies non suturées
En mon coeur isolé

Votre amour tombe à pic
Mais moi, je vais tomber de très haut
Si vous n'me laissez pas le temps tactique
De me remettre en selle au galop

{Refrain:}
Mais au même moment, j'ai pensé
J'ai pensé, j'ai pensé, j'ai pensé...
L'amour a frappé à ma porte
J'ai ouvert, que le diable m'emporte

Et ça, je l'emporte au paradis...",Señor,2000

Si mon amour était comme un petit ruisseau
On aurait bien envie d'aller se mettre à l'eau
De patauger au gré de cette onde joyeuse
Se disant: “qu'il est doux, mais qu'il est doux d'être amoureux!”
Oui mais mon amour est un orage
Qui fait chavirer en moi tout ce bel équipage
Oui mais mon amour est un naufrage
Car dans mon âme, souffle le vent du large, le vent du large

Si mon amour était comme un petit oiseau bleu
Il volerait de bonheur en petit bonheur
Ne se lassant pas de gazouiller à toute heure
“Mais mon Dieu, qu'il est doux, mais qu'il est doux d'être amoureux!”

Oui mais mon amour, est une buse
Un grand rapace qui plane au dessus de ses muses
Oui mais mon amour, est un carnage
Car dans mon âme, souffle le vent du large, le vent du large

Si mon amour était comme un petit nuage
Tout doux et tout moelleux, sage comme une image
Deux anges passant par là, étonnés et curieux
Se diraient:” Mais mon Dieu, quel ennui d'être amoureux!”

Oui mais mon amour est infernal
Là où l'on cherche le bien, on y trouve le mal
Oui mais mon amour est infernal
Car dans mon âme, souffle le vent du large, le vent du large.",Si Mon Amour,2000

Sans rancune, sous la lune
On applaudit les somnambules
Pas trop fort, juste un réconfort
Pour leurs efforts
Dans la nuit, juste un bruit
Celui de leurs pas sur les toits
Cible, ô sensible, tu t'immobilises
Au bord de l'abîme

Trois pas en arrière
Que glacent nos artères
Trois pas en avant
Pour prendre le temps
D'imaginer la chute, mais chuuut...

Sans rancune, sous la lune
On applaudit les somnambules
Pas trop fort, juste un réconfort
Pour leurs efforts
De tous ceux qui, dans la nuit
Sans se soucier vivent un rêve
Et leurs yeux, leurs yeux grands ouverts
Ne voient pas le danger

Une ombre menaçante
Abîme dans l'attente
Juste un fil dans le vide 
En suspend, l'oeil livide 
Est-ce là le moment de la chute, mais chuuut...

Sans rancune, sous la lune
On applaudit les somnambules
Pas trop fort, juste un réconfort
Pour leurs efforts
Dans la nuit, juste un bruit
Celui de leurs pas de gouttière
Qui s'effacent, sans en avoir l'air

In an industry man made, cause it runs through my veins
It pumps through my brain, through my name, nothing will change

Ghost rider, flaming chopper, caressing the night
Chasing the glimpse of a forever fading florescent horizon
He just lights up the skies (lights up the skies)
While running through this circus
With the heart full of good vibes (heart full of good vibes)
That's pumping through his circuits

Spit fire round his lungs
A war torn mustang, through an empire of the sun
Catch him diving in his rhythm
Rhyme and gliding in his vision
Manifest music mementoes to remind him of his mission
He just rolls like a bowler
A soldiers forward composure
With butterfly net full of dreams hangin' over his shoulder he says

While the other slips underneath
Steals inches from me
All the lights seem to dim on command
Lifting oxygen from eyelids
Calm yourself
Deep breaths quarter rest fill the lungs up in your chest
Careful not to strain the sound waves you'll save
Just might be that of your own voice breaking
Sounding out the words
Slipping over teeth and out through tongue

Slip down, white knuckle the chair
Bring your eyes back to earth or whichever one comes first
Don't leave yourself hanging back
Right now feels as if it never happened
Why is my face all red?
Why are my clothes all wet?
All the attractions all the retraction and I still feel dumb

Blink me in or blink me out
You got such a great disguise you hide yourself on the inside
Clinging to the side of my mind
Where they'll never look to find you
Never look to see just what's inside of me

Slip down white knuckle the chair
Bring your eyes back to earth or whichever one comes first
Don't leave yourself hanging back
Right now feels as if it never happened
Why is my face all red?
Why are my clothes all wet?

Quoting none but fools blowing out all my breath seeping in from somewhere

East of everywhere

Strapped to the floor

Now that you've got a trail to cover up,
Why are you whispering to me?
And deep inside my room there's no such thing as light
Passing through these bars
Talk out loud so I can hear your voice scattered clearly
Lungs breathing evenly
Often I sleep
And often you'll leave
Just one more reminder keeps you wandering
Waking up inside bleeding through the eyes
Caught up confused all the anchors sigh
Strapped to the floor

It's how disaster makes me feel. All I can think to do is stare and say, â??It's OK.â?? Just one more day spent tending ruins, 'cause of you. One more connection cut off by affection. One more useless night spent in this life. Lick your lips wet, try to forget. Jump in headfirst, who cares if it hurts? One light flashing, over guessing. If not for the life in you, I don't know what I'd do. It's how disaster makes me smile. The thought strikes as nice once in a while. One more connection cut off by affection. One tank short on gas, one bullet built to crash. These broken lungs have little air left, if some. The cause and effect is as simple as a car wreck. If not for the life, then this thought of you. It's a stupid thing to think that I won't lose, when all I want is this: To be more of the friends that sometimes kiss.

Bled into the clatter, as they sipped at what you poured
I cling to your perimeter as you float in their margins
Oblivious to being stung, there satellite becomes my son
I’ve flown into that trap before
When things have gotten dark
In the depths of strangers glances lies the most ferocious spark

Most freedom is deceiving
If such a thing exists
When I was young I knew but didn’t care
Faces change and shape to represent the same old beast
I want to flee but I can only stare
It’s the sound a captive heart makes as it sizzles into vapor
The title hum of fondness like a spike-wave oscillator
The rabid UV grin that beckons me into approaching
Grasping as it recedes into space
Who greets me first when I arise
Who breaking into my half shut eyes
It’s in the blaze of your embrace where I feel more real and alive
The bosom of 1000 watts into my skin into my guts
Running circles so proud until he got caught
In his brief emancipation he can feel what I cannot

There’s a patch of light that hits the floor I’ll often occupy
Stretch my arms and legs and close my eyes
I now can hear my pulse alone, this manic pace I cannot slow
I do not miss the child you stole
Frying and abiding, I’m in your control

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Girl I was fucking too early
15 knowing money was green
Puffing too early, body big, not grown knowledge'd up and too early
Thought it was cute to flirt with older kats up in they face
Didn't have a daddy so I put a daddy in his face
My mami was my shelter but I broke free
Learning that the streets was harder that I thought they'd be
Wanting to be grown, rebelling
Ain't no telling what I'd be pussy selling (huh) never would I
Instead I wore a g-string
Thought never could I
Thought I had to, to be grown beginning of my life

[Chorus]

Yo, close myself down
Held myself in
Explode by myself alone no one helping
What am I to do but cry alone at night
No one in the house nude TV is my life
Who was I to tell and what would they think of me
No one understood the pain that was sent to me
Broke down from the things men would say to me
Selling drinks to a naive kid
I blame me
But I never really had someone tell me what to do
Teach me that I'm better than just pussy that's true
Teach me that the future was written already waiting to respect my self in
Life not to be someone would hate me
Do positive and positive will happen
Stay positive and positive was rapping
It was like my brain was clouded with unnecessary shit
But I chose to see through the negative and make hits uh

[Chorus]

Uh, uh, yo, yo
Now I'm 20 years old and look where I'm at
I thank the Lord every night and pray there's no turning back
I wanna keep my family happy and that's that
Seen tears in my mother's eyes from platinum plaques
See things I've done I don't regret I just learn
From mistakes in the past knowing now I had to earn respect and earn trust
Survival school was never giving
The way you find out what life's about is simply living to be strong
Stay strong let nobody crush you your body is your temple young girls
Don't let him touch you
He'll respect anything you say if he really loves you
Don't settle for second let him put no one above you
I did a lot of things in my life
I take back gotta take from the good and the bad collect that
Cause it help the bill who you see now respect that
Young, black, and strong keep me in ya

All the days that she's cried
But never once did I ever see the pain in her eyes (No no)

That a man who doesn't care isn't all alone (Silly ass nigga)

Its about Drag off the strip out the orphanage
Of course this is same kid
Coughing off the nics

All I keeps different is my woman no kids so a nigga chilling
Stay peeling, what are you kidding money stacked to the ceiling
Chicks wit a frown see my rims spinning grinning

Than pop wheelies till our back touch ground
People on the side say ""here go the action now""

We be in and out catch you back at the spot
Tank top, bike hop, bank stop

Made it past the front desk, then the rifle's here

Then she ain't even want to get breakfast
She just want to hop right up in the truck and get reckless
Top from the club all the way to the exit
Ask me her name, couldn't tell you if I guessed it

And they pay for everything, I don't pay nothing

Dirty denim, Timberland, or a Nike pimp
