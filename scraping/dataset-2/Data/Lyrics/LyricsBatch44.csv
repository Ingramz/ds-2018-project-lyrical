Chet Atkins,"When the moon is in the Seventh House
And Jupiter aligns with Mars
Then peace will guide the planets
And love will steer the stars

This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius
The Age of Aquarius
Aquarius! Aquarius!

Harmony and understanding
Sympathy and trust abounding
No more falsehoods or derisions
Golden living dreams of visions
Mystic crystal revelation
And the mind's true liberation
Aquarius! Aquarius!

When the moon is in the Seventh House
And Jupiter aligns with Mars
Then peace will guide the planets
And love will steer the stars

This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius
The Age of Aquarius
Aquarius! Aquarius!

Harmony and understanding
Sympathy and trust abounding
No more falsehoods or decisions
Golden living dreams of visions
Mystic crystal revelation
And the mind's true liberation

Chet Atkins,"Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Black bird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night.

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise,
You were only waiting for this moment to arise,
You were only waiting for this moment to arise",Blackbird,1969
Chet Atkins,"Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

Na na na nananana, nannana, hey Jude",Hey Jude,1969
Chet Atkins,"Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me

I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me

Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe her now

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me

Don't want to leave her now
You know I believe her now",Something,1970
Chet Atkins,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon",How High the Moon,1970
Chet Atkins,"If I could see you just one time
Oh how it'd ease my troubled mind
If I could hold you just one time
And then pretend that you're still mine

[Chorus]
Oh, how I miss you so
Oh I need you so
I'd give this heart of mine
If I could see you just one time

Lips that used to thrill me so
They now thrill someone else I know
Gone is the love that once was mine
Wish I could see you just one time

[Chorus]

Wish I could relive just one time
Turn back the pages and there I'd find
That same old love that once was mine
Wish I could see you just one time

[Chorus]",Just One Time,1971
Chet Atkins,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you",Snowbird,1971
Chet Atkins,"Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who find the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlegs
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
Pa pa pa pa,
See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night you stocking needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet",Lady Madonna,1971
Chet Atkins,"Sometimes when I'm down and all alone
Just like a child without a home
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on
Oh honey,  all I ever need is you
You're my first love, you're my last
You're my future, you're my past
And loving you is all I ask, honey
All I ever need is you
Winters come and they go, and we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
Some men follow rainbows, I am told
Some men search for silver some for gold
I have found my treasure in your soul, honey
All I ever need is you
Without love I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every single day
I won't sleep at night until you say, my honey
All I ever need is you",All I Ever Need Is You,1972
Chet Atkins,"I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear Savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

Just like a blind man, I wandered alone
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that god gave back his sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

[Chorus] 
I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

I was a fool to wander and stray
For straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the Lord, I saw the light",I Saw the Light,1972
Chet Atkins,"Thine love is mine.
Thine heart with mine entwine, love.
My soul for thee doth pine.
Thine eye doth shine.
Thine life with mine combine, love.
Thou art my valentine.
Lips like apple wine.
Face like kalsomine (oh, fine).
My clinging vine,
My voice for thee doth whine.
You're older than Auld Lang Syne.

Twinkle, twinkle little star,
How you wonder who I am.
Way up in the sky, so low,
You're a better man than I am, oh, by Jove.

The polar bear sleeps in his little bearskin.
He sleeps very well, I am told.
Last night I slept in my little bare skin,
And I got a heck of a cold

Pease Porridge hot,
Pease porridge cold,
Pease porridge in the pot
Nine days old. Peehew!",Liebestraum,1972
Chet Atkins,"And those weird China blues
Never go away
Sad, mad blues
For all the while they seem to say

Oh, Limehouse kid
Oh, oh, Limehouse kid
Goin' the way
That the rest of them did
Poor broken blossom
And nobody's child
Haunting and taunting
You're just kind of wild

Oh, Limehouse blues
I've the real Limehouse blues
Can't seem to shake off
Those real China blues
Rings on your fingers
And tears for your crown
That is the story
Of old Chinatown

Rings on your fingers
And tears for your crown
That is the story
Of old Chinatown",Limehouse Blues,1972
Chet Atkins,"Chinatown, my Chinatown
When the lights are low
Hearts that know no other land
Drifting to and fro

Dreamy, dreamy Chinatown
Almond eyes of brown
Hearts are light and lights are bright
In dreamy Chinatown

Chinatown, my Chinatown
When the lights are low
Hearts that know no other land
Drifting to and fro

Dreamy, dreamy Chinatown
Almond eyes so brown
Hearts are light and lights are bright
In dreamy Chinatown

Chinatown, my Chinatown
When the lights are low
Hearts that know no other land
Drifting to and fro

Dreamy, dreamy Chinatown
Almond eyes of brown
Hearts are light and lights are bright
In dreamy Chinatown

Chet Atkins,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee,1973
Chet Atkins,"Song sung blue
Everybody knows one
Song sung blue
Every garden grows one
Me and you are subject to
the blues now and then
But when you take the
blues and make a song
You sing them out again
Sing them out again

Song sung blue
Weeping like a willow
Song sung blue

Sleeping on my pillow

Funny thing, but you can
sing it with a cry in
your voice
And before you know,
start to feeling good
You simply got no choice

Song sung blue
Everybody knows one
Song sung blue
Every garden grows one",Song Sung Blue,1973
Chet Atkins,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do 
If I had you
 
I could show the world how to smile

Chet Atkins,"This nine pound hammer, it's a little too heavy
For my size, baby, for my size
I'm goin' on the mountain, gonna see my baby
But I ain't comin' back, well, I ain't comin' back

Roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
Tell me, how can I roll, when the wheels won't go?
Roll on buddy, pull a load of coal
Now, how can I pull, when wheels won't roll?

It's a long way to Harlan, it's a long way to Hazard
Just to get a little brew, just to get a little brew
Well, when I'm long gone you can make my tombstone
Outta number nine coal, outta number nine coal

Hey, roll on buddy, don't you roll so slow
How can I roll, when the wheels won't go?
Roll on buddy, pull your load of coal
Tell me, how can I pull, when wheels won't roll?",Nine Pound Hammer,1974
Chet Atkins,"Who's Sorry Now?
Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue?
Who's crying too?

Right to the end, 
Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;

Chet Atkins,"Where you been Johnny?
What you been doin'?

I'm just fiddlin' round

I played this guitar till my folks were sick of it
They won't never get well as long as you're pickin' it

I played this old harp 'til my mouth looka funny
It aint no fiddle but it sure makes more money

You'll live to a hundred though, fiddlin' 'round",Fiddlin' Around,1974
Chet Atkins,"Sweet dreams of you
Every night, I go through
Why can't I forget you, and start my life anew --
Instead of having sweet dreams about you?

You don't love me, it's plain
I should know I'll never wear your ring
I should hate you, the whole night through

Instead of having sweet dreams about you?",Sweet Dreams,1974
Chet Atkins,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a well remembered dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme

Chet Atkins,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star

Chet Atkins,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

Chet Atkins,"You know, every time I look in the mirror I see my Dad
I think that's why this song means so much to me

When I was young
My dad would say
""C'mon son, let's go out and play""
Sometimes it seems like yesterday

And I'd climb up the closet shelf
When I was all by myself
Grab his hat and fix the brim
Pretending I was him

No matter, how hard I try
No matter, how many tears I cry
No matter, how many years go by
I still can't say goodbye

He always took care
Of Mom and me
We all cut down a Christmas tree
He always had some time for me

Wind blows through the trees
Street lights, they still shine bright
Most things are the same
But I miss my dad tonight

I walked by a Salvation Army store
Saw a hat like my daddy wore
Tried it on when I walked in
Still trying to be like him

No matter, how hard I try
No matter, how many years go by
No matter, how many tears I cry
I still can't say goodbye

",I Still Can't Say Goodbye,1988

It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",Imagine,1988

Chet Atkins,"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,1989

After you've gone there's no denying,
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad,
You'll miss the dearest pal you ever had.
There'll come a time, don't you forget it,
There'll come a time when you'll regret it.

Chet Atkins,"Southern nights
have you ever felt a southern night?
Free as a breeze
not to mention the trees
Whistling tunes that you know and love so.

Southern nights
just as good even when closed your eyes.
I apologize to anyone who can truly say
That he has found a better way

Southern skies
have you ever noticed southern skies?
It's precious beauty lies just beyond the eye.
It goes running through your soul
Like the stories told of old
Old man
he and his dog that walked the old land
Ev'ry flower touched his cold hand.
As he slowly walked by
weeping willows 
Would cry for joy
Joy

Feel so good
feel so good
it's frigth'ning.
Wish I could,
stop this world from fighting.
La da da da da da la da da da da da da da da

like this and many others in the trees
Blow in the night
in the southern skies.

So I'll just take my old guitar and walk out the door
Forget about it, I'll be gone and you'll have memories
You'll find hard to ignore

'Cause after all I'll see you sometimes, maybe
When I can't recall how you drove me crazy
Forget about it when forever's over
I won't remember how much I love you anymore

Forget about it, put me out of your head
Now that you're free and easy out there on the town
Forget about it when you're lying in your bed
Just wishing I was there to lay my body down

'Cause after all I'll see you sometimes, baby
When you will recall how I drove you crazy
Forget about those starlit nights laying by the fireside holding tight
I can't remember when it felt so right so just forget about it

Forget about it, if you see me on the street
Don't wave don't wink, don't try to tease me with your smile
Forget about it, if we chance to meet somewhere
Don't think it's 'cause I'm tryin' to reconcile

'Cause after all I'll see you sometimes, baby
When I can't recall how you drove me crazy

He'd cheat and steal and gamble
And I guess, he tried most everything lowdown

And then a big policeman came
And slapped him down

He's in the jailhouse now

Well, when I met Bill's old gal Saddie
And she said, ""Have you seen my baby?""
And I told her, he was downtown in the can
Well, old Saddie she started fussin'
She went down to the jailhouse a cussin'
She said, ""I come down here to get my man""

She's in the jailhouse now
(She's in the jailhouse now)
She's in the jailhouse now
(She's in the jailhouse now)
So you can understand how little old Saddie
Got throwed in the can

Well, old Bill broke out one day
I guess, he thought he get away
But at the railway station they took him by the arm
The chief said, ""I've come for you""
And Bill said, ""Now, this won't do""
Because Bill Campbell never was my name

He's in the jailhouse now

He's in the jailhouse now

Well, old Bill he broke out
And all over town the fool walked about

Chet Atkins,"We are a rock revolving
Around a golden sun
We are a billion children rolled into one
So when I hear about the hole in the sky
Saltwater wells in my eyes

We climb the highest mountain
We'll make the desert bloom
We're so ingenious we can walk the moon
But when I hear of how the forest have died
Saltwater wells in my eyes

I have lived for love
But now that's not enough
For the world I love is dying   And now I'm crying 
And time is not a friend (no friend of mine)
As friends we're out of time
And it's slowly passing by ....right before our eyes


We light the deepest ocean
Send photographs of Mars
We're so enchanted my how clever we are
Why should one baby feel so hungry she cries
Saltwater wells in my eyes

I have lived for love
But now that's not enough
For the world I love is dying   And now I'm crying 
And time is not a friend (no friend of mine)
As friends we're out of time
And it's slowly passing by ....right before our eyes

We are a rock revolving
Around a golden sun
We are a billion children rolled into one 
What will I think of me the day that I die
Saltwater wells in my eyes
Saltwater wells in my eyes

Chet Atkins,"One thing I miss is Cold Ethyl and her skeleton kiss 
We met last night making love by the refrigerator light 
Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms 
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms 

One thing 
No lie 
Ethyl's frigid as an eskimo pie 
She's cool in bed 
Well she oughta be 'cause Ethyl's dead 

Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms 
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms 
Come on Cold Ethyl 
Freeze me babe 

One thing, it's true 
Cold Ethyl I am stuck on you 
And everything is my way 
Ethyl don't have much to say 

Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms 
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms 
Come here Cold Ethyl 
What makes you so cold? Ooh so cold 

Cold Ethyl 
Cold Cold Ethyl 
If I live 'til ninety-seven 
You'll still be waiting in refrigerator heaven 

'Cause you're cool 
You're ice

You're my paradise",Tip Toe Through the Bluegrass,1997
Chet Atkins,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1998

Chet Atkins,"Spring was never waiting for us, girl 
It ran one step ahead 
As we followed in the dance 
Between the parted pages and were pressed 
In love's hot, fevered iron 
Like a striped pair of pants 

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark 
All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it 
'Cause it took so long to bake it 
And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no! 

I recall the yellow cotton dress 
Foaming like a wave 
On the ground around your knees 
The birds, like tender babies in your hands 
And the old men playing checkers by the trees 

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark 
All the sweet, green icing flowing down 
Someone left the cake out in the rain 
I don't think that I can take it 
'Cause it took so long to bake it 
And I'll never have that recipe again 
Oh, no! 

There will be another song for me 
For I will sing it 
There will be another dream for me 
Someone will bring it 
I will drink the wine while it is warm 
And never let you catch me looking at the sun 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one 

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it 
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it 
I will have the things that I desire 
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky 
And after all the loves of my life 
After all the loves of my life 
I'll be thinking of you 
And wondering why

All they got is romance

Every lover's in a trance

Every guy has got a wench
Every couple's got a bench kissing shamelessly
Night and day they're making music
While they're making love in French

The poor people of Paris
Milk or water from a sink
Make a true Parisian shrink
Wine is all he'll ever drink

And it worries me
For with wine as cheap as water
Oh it makes one stop and think

Had the craziest love affair
And the day after they parted there
He cries bitterly

Not unless you want romance

And tomorrow you're gonna find me right here

Chet Atkins,"Well my old friend said to me
That I ain't being what I'm supposed to be
Well I don't know it could be true
I know I wasn't always there for you

And now you're ready to walk out
You're ready to run
Talk to me can't you see
I would never want to do what it
Seems I've done
You can't deal me the aces and think I 
Wouldn't play

Don't let this be the reason you would
Walk away
The things you think I should do
I've never understood that part of you
You know I've tried to be a friend
But you feel underminded and hurt again

Now don't let it convince you
Please don't take it to heart
Compromise and realize
You can never really run everything
You start
You can't deal me the aces and think I
Wouldn't play
Don't let this be the reason you would
Walk away

And I guess I said I couldn't see
How thing's could turn out like they've
Come to be
And if I lied and if I knew
Well I was only trying to think of you",Aces,2011
Chet Atkins,"I don't want to be standing here
With this ticket for this outbound plane
'Cause I've been here before
But somehow it doesn't feel the same

We may never figure out just where our love went wrong

[Chorus]
I don't want to be standin' here
And I don't want to be talkin' here
And I don't really care who's to blame
'Cause if love won't fly on its own free will
Its gonna catch that outbound plane

The old folks say loves not forever anymore
Because these young people walk away
From love alone, to pace the floor
Young or old I say that love is still the same
And you may walk away from love
But you'll fall head and heel again

[Chorus]

Two lonely hearts in this aiport knowing
Neither cares where that other heart is going
But if love won't fly on its own free will
Its gonna catch that outbound plane

Hat crown you're wearin'
Is just your halo turned upside down
Where is the laughter we once shared
Back in the lost and found
These broken wings are gonna leave me here
To stand my ground
You can have this ticket
For that lonely plane that's flyin' out

Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't you free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't you free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies, to try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart?",Cold Cold Heart,2017

I knew tonight when you never came around
That you had left me on the lonely side of town

And asked him to tell me what was on his mind.
He said, ""Money, honey!
Money, honey!

Chet Baker,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me [*],1956
Chet Baker,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

sit there and count your fingers, what can you do,
Old girl, you?re through.
Just sit there and count your little fingers, unhappy little
girl blue.
Sit there and count the raindrops falling on you,
It?s time you knew,
All you can count on are the raindrops that fall on little girl
blue.
No use, old girl, you might as well surrender,
Your hopes are getting slender, why won?t somebody send a tender
Blue boy to cheer up little girl blue.

When you were very young, the world was younger than you,
As merry as a carousel,
The circus tent was strung with ever star in the sky,
Above the ring you loved so well.

I hear music when I touch your hand,

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air.
The walls of my room fade away in the blue,
And I'm deep in a dream of you.
The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend;
You come to my arms, may this bliss never end,
For we love anew just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you.

Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing;
We glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing
That I'm soon revealing my love for you over again.

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

You tied a string around my heart
So how can I forget you?

I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?

And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

Is your mouth a little weak? 
When you open it to speak
Are you smiling?

A bitter tragic joke, have found with you

That puts gold to shame.

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time

It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye

Just to be with Dinah Lee! 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean!, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes, some who took me up to the skies

Chet Baker Quartet,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1958

Blending in a soft and sweet refrain

When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low

Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender

Like the ocean beats upon the sand

Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

He/She has taken my complete heart,
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart

Its gonna be just dandy
The day I take my ""Candy""
And make him mine all mine

We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely

And your eyes can make me swim

Then again everything seems new
I can barely hold my tongue
To say the least I'm into you

And your eyes
Are saying more than we can talk and warmer than our bedroom sport
And your thighs
Are kisses from the outside, girl that's all I need

I'll take you down the other road
To breathe in something more

I find it harder to ignore
The things I want you for

I know you don't want
I love you can sing
The music was at the start
Do do do do do do do do do do do do

The rhythm was all
I needed to hear
A woman can treat my heart
Do do do do do do do do do do do do

When I press an ear up to your breast
I can hear the rhythm start
It's hard to tell our beats apart

So I hope you're listening right now
'Cause I can barely hold my tongue
The shit we do could warm the sun

And I
Twisted in a melting fall and sleeping with the scratching claws
And your words
Let me know you're feeling me and seeing all the things I see

It drives people to extreme behavior, even unspeakable crimes.

I just did what I had to do
I had to steal a little time baby
So I could spend it all on you
I parked the car down the street
And I unplugged the phone
So it would look just like
Ain't nobody home
I put a rose on your pillow
Where you lay your pretty head
I'm gonna rub your tired shoulders
Bring your dinner to your bed

So I could spend it all on you

I'm gonna light a candle
Put the champagne on ice
And if one ain't enough
Well we'll just have to do it twice
I done made myself a will
And I've called my next of kin
'Cause I'm gonna love you over
And over and over

Se apagan las estrellas
Te vas y pierdo dirección

Entra, mi alma está desierta
Me lleva la tristeza
Yo no puedo estar lejos de ti

Entra y abrázame con fuerza
Estoy desorientado
Transtornado y sin control

No hay nada que no remedie el pedir perdón
Me equivoqué otra vez
Y no concibo la vida cuando tú no estás
Me equivoqué otra vez

Entra, mi puerta sigue abierta
Si yo soy un cometa
Tú la estrella fugaz que perdí

Entra y abrázame con fuerza
Estoy desorientado
Anulado por amor

No hay nada que no remedie el pedir perdón
Me equivoqué otra vez
Y no concibo la vida cuando tú no estás
Me equivoqué otra vez

Noquiero hacer daño
Mas a veces soy yo
Quien trata de escaparse
Quien trata de jugar

No puedo ser más irreal
No puedo ni caminar sin tropezarme
Te necesito para aterrizar

No hay nada que no remedie el pedir perdón

Y no concibo la vida cuando tú no estás
Me equivoqué otra vez

1.
Je suis né dans la cité
Qui enfante les usines,
Là ou les hommes turbinent
Toute un' vie sans s'arrêter,
Avec leurs haut's cheminées
Qui s'élancent vers le ciel
Comm'pour cracher leur fumée,
En des nuages artificiels.
Et dans le bruit des sirènes
Des hommes vont, des hommes viennent,
C'est la grand'ville qui surgit,
C'est la grand'ville qui surgit.

REFRAIN

Comm' c'est drôle
Ces gens qui marchent dans la rue,
Comm' c'est drôle
La vie perdue dans la cohue,
La sérénade des fauchés
Monte comme une mélopée
La sérénade des gens biens,
Et puis des ceuss' qui n'sont pas bien,
Et moi je les regarde viivre
Et j'trouv' ça drôle.
J'trouv' plus ça drôle.

2. Juste au bout de la cité
On ne voit plus les usines,
On ne voit que la fumée
Des bateaux et leurs machines
Il y a la gru' géante
Qui des quais jusqu'aux bateaux
Avec sa marche obsédante
S'amuse à cracher dans l'eau
On dirait un' drôl' de fête
Où se promène la tempête
Et le Bon Dieu qui est là-haut
Doit trouver ça rigolo.


Refrain

3. Mais il y' a dans la cité
Une fille à la peau douce,
A la va comm' je te pousse
Un' fill' toujours mal peignée,
Elle a sa rob' déchirée,
Mais j'ai trouvé dans ses yeux
Un bout de ciel égaré
Et qui n'appartient qu'à nous deux,
Je ne vois plus les usines,
Et je n'entends plus les machines
Qui donc se dress' sur la cité ?
C'est l'amour et sa liberté.

Refrain

Comm' c'est drôle
L'amour qui marche dans la rue,
Comm' c'est drôle
Deux coeurs perdus dans la cohue,
La sérénade de l'amour,
La sérénade des toujours,
Monte, monte sur la cité
Pour lui chanter sa mélopée
Et moi je suis là pour la suivre,
J'trouv' plus ça drôle.",La Grande Cité,2001

Took a moment to believe
How tricked was I
I never want to leave

Coursing through these veins I'm locked on you

Oh, and never could I've known I'd crave a bite quite so much

Wide open, careful where the mind goes

Well here's a tip, don't follow through
You feel the nightmares never end
And now it seems it's coming true
No one should see what I can see
It's up to you with weakened knees
That little creep just grabbed my arm
It's gonna be the longest night

If it's my time, well I'm going out alone

Alone, alone, alone

Night, you're a friend of mine, another family
Better not divide, any, armed, with its beastly doom
I'll beat this jackal down, this interference ends
Send it back beyond

When hunter, meets hunter, this hunter, eats hunter

Chevy Woods,"Yeah
Ugh
Ugh
Ugh

See I've been going on and on forever
Them haters probably wonder when I'm gone stop, never
Most of it's been good but I've seen some bad weather
And niggas watching now, wouldn't even give me an umbrella
But I ain't tripping, I made a million on my own
May come to your surprise but I pictured it all along
When I was sixteen, finna get put out my home
Now the man make the money, my nigga, my money grown
And I can do what I what, went form being hated on
To niggas try to go down the same road I made it on
Ain't no love lost but ain't no love shown
So now when niggas call I just don't pick up the phone
I'm breaking down the weed, put it in the bong
Blow a hundred racks, put it in the song
Party every weekend, hardly ever home
Don't get a chance to see me face to face
So you have to talk about me when I gone

Stay away from the fake or phony (phony)
Niggas who can't support their role
So keep hatin' me from the crowd
Everybody wants to be the star of the show-ow-ow
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)

The drinks poured up, weed's rolled up
And all my jewelery ice age the piece froze up
I only like to see the hoes who keep their nose up
Have any nigga in the world but she chose us
I remember them same hoes ain't even notice us
Get you to buy a drink than its over cous'
We back around the time that she sober'd up
But shit ain't been the same since the limousine showed up
The best moments of my life
Never filled this much plastic off of Polo in my life
Rarely gon' to see, smoking with ya wife
Plus anything you want I can afford to buy it twice
It's the way we know, wake up in the morn'
Like ""where did all my paper go""
Roll some more weed and get medicated
Everyday is a holiday so we celebrate it

Stay away from the fake or phony (phony)
Niggas who can't support their role
So keep hatin' me from the crowd
Everybody wants to be the star of the show-ow-ow
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)
The show-ow-ow (ow-ow)

Niggas losing their roles
Can't play they positions (play they positions)
One day they down for the team (team)
Next day they missin' (Next day they missin')
Same ones was all in the front
Supposed to be there for support (there for support)
And half the time it's the ones you care for
Fuck you here for, huh?
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one
Everybody wanna be a superstar
Big shot, only number one
But everybody wanna be the star though
They wanna be a big shot, only number one
Everybody wanna be a superstar
Big shot, only number one
But everybody wanna be the star though
Ugh
The money come, the money go
And when it come down to it
That's something niggas with real money should know
We partied a lot, and drank
Now they don't talk to me
Started off not so great, now I'm on top of things

I guess the difference is we ain't thinking the same
So if I'm guilty of change, I guess I'm the one to blame
I see the bigger picture on the wall in the frame
Spent a couple of days on team making it rain
I was cool but, I was thinking ocean views
Polo trunk shades on and boat shoes
Cantox lick oil, my nigga I ain't slippin'
You won't star me out, ugh bad transmission
So if for the better, yeah a nigga different
That west coast weed, my homie Wiz twistin'
Mattress money put up 'cause now my money different
You got a lot to say, but they ain't never tried to listen
Record all night in the studio in the morn
Playin' back when we did, now tell me is that wrong
Crack the Rose, pop a top or two
And toast to what this hard work got us to",Star of the Show,2011
Chevy Woods,"You be anything you want
Uh, just keep going, going, gone, gone, gone
Uh, it don't stop here nigga
Yea, uh

Back when I was young I had dreams of getting richer
Then my homie Breeze set me down schooled me to the picture
I was with some wild niggas put me on the game
Told me if you tryin' to make your move you gotta know your lane homie
All you got's your name and your words will never break
For this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it
'Cause most niggas never make it they stranded where I'm from
Ain't no conversation all they understand is get a gun
I was riding in my Bonneville hoping I could make it out
Selling peas and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street
Way back in the day before I had all of this paper
Before I had all of these diamonds, before I had all of these haters

Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't needed or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name 'cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it
Say I fucked the ones who hate it rolling up and celebrate now let's get medicated

Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
I'm hella faded

Rolling weed up and smoke it
Take your bitch home and poke it
Juicy begin so faded
Thank God I got a chauffeur
Only good Cali' bud
Pulling hoes bad as fuck
Just like a youngin' my nigga
Juicy do all them drugs
Niggas smoking that babbage weed
I be on that light green
Pop molly in the after hours
A member of no sleep team
Get a whole pound smoke it by myself
Or maybe after Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps

You know I'm fresh up out that corner, twistin' marijuana
They copy us, they clone us
Yeah we so fly we on us
Got acting like they been before
But they ain't never been at all
8 balls I was in no hole
Ain't have time to fuck with y'all
Champagne when we celebrate
Keen sense so I smell the hate
Middle finger we getting paid
It cost much but don't press that eight
That dotted line it ain't like that day
Comic book let me illustrate
Like power bang when they lift that cane
My cousin died wish I can get that day
Back like it's a vertebrae
Bring that nigga on front street
Talk about and never be about it
They don't wanna beef 'cause that's lunch meat
So anything you need you know that's on me
And that's OG, I swear homie

Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
I'm hella faded

Riding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique
My city holding on to me so niggas holding on their heat
Throwing up their side, rolling up that leaf
On-doers get high, all we want is peace
Always on the grind that's every day so police looking
I'm just rapping killing beats and tryin' to stay away from booking
Yeah my niggas dirty crooked I just had to make it known
And let me hit the studio to show they happy to be home

Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't needed or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner

Cheyenne Jackson,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land
Where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true

There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away
All the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why wont that sun appear

Were lost in a cloud
With too much rain
Were trapped in a world
That's troubled with pain
But as long as a man
Has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly

Deep in my heart there's a trembling question
Still I am sure that the answer gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle
And while I can think, while I can talk
While I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream, please let my dream
Come true, right now
Let it come true right now

Chiara,"Nessun posto è casa mia 
Ho pensato andando via 
Soffrirò nei primi giorni ma 
So che mi ci abituerò 
Ti cercherò nei primi giorni 
Poi mi abituerò 
Perché si torna sempre dove si è stati bene 
E i posti sono semplicemente persone 
Partenze improvvise, automobili, asfalto 
Le ombre di una notte in provincia 
Il coraggio di chi lascia tutto alle spalle e poi ricomincia

Non era la vita che stavamo aspettando ma va bene lo stesso 
È l’amore che rende sempre tutto pazzesco 

Nessun posto è casa mia 
L’ho capito sì, andando via 
È sempre dura i primi tempi ma 
So che mi ritroverò 
Avrò sempre occhi stanchi e mancherai 
Poi mi abituerò 
Perché si torna sempre dove si è stati bene 
E i posti sono semplicemente persone 
Voglia di tornare, luci basse, stazioni 
Anche se non ci sarà nessuno ad aspettarti 
La bellezza di chi, nonostante tutto, sa perdonarti 
Non era la vita che stavamo aspettando ma va bene lo stesso 
È l’amore che rende sempre tutto perfetto 

È l’amore che passa si ferma un momento saluta e va via

Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Chiara Pittman,"Oh,Mickey, you’re so fine
You’re so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey, (Hey hey)
Hey Mickey (Hey, hey)

Oh, Mickey, you’re so fine (You’re so fine and you’re mine)
I’ll be yours till the end of time
'Cause you make me feel
Yeah, you make me feel
So shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time (Touched for the first time)

Like the one in me
That’s O.K.
Let’s see how you do it
Put up your dukes
Let’s get down to it

Hit me with your best shot
Why don’t you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away

Na na na come on
Na na na na na, come on, come on, come on

'Cause I may be bad but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it

Sex baby,
Let’s talk about you and me
Let’s talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be
Let’s talk about sex (Alright)
Let’s talk about sex (A little bit, a little bit)
Let’s talk about sex, baby

Baby, all through the night, I’ll make love to you,
Like you want me too

(And I) And I guess it’s just the woman in you,
That brings out the man in me
I know I can’t help myself
You’re all in the world to me

It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time
It feels like the first time

It’s going down fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me collab creations bump, like acne
No doubt, I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch, a dog couldn’t catch me, straight up
Tell me who could stop when Dre making moves, attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers (Shorty get down)

Good Lord
Baby got them open up all over town
Strictly biz she don’t play around
Cover much ground got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can’t get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby

(Girl)I like the way you work it,
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby,

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby

You've been through every girl in town
Havin' fun, you're number one
Now I think it's time to slow down

You could never break my heart
Oh no, I have spoke to my connection
I bet you think you're pretty smart

So the fellows imitate you
They think you're so together
All the girls wanna be with you
So cool that you fool them all

Maybe in time you'll change your direction
Be honest with yourself
Recognize all your faults
And try to correct them

Chic,"I loved you more than words could tell
Oh I loved you more than words
Seems like we all live
All alone for ourselves
Seems like we all live for ourselves
But how can we say live
When these hearts of ours can't give
Any love to the ones
That you hold so very dear

I loved you more than words could say
Oh I loved you more than words
If you see the stains
When you look at my face
If you see the stains on my face

Tears are not only bad
Sometimes they come when I'm glad
And I'm glad when I think
Of the love that we had

Now I know you've known
Other lost souls like me
That lived their lives
In search of peaches and cream
If all this cold world
Has to offer are dreams
Rescue me, oh please, oh please

I loved you more",I Loved You More,1980
