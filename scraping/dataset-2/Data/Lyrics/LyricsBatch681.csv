Autopilot Off,"Tonight I have decided that there's only one way out
And I tried so hard to fight it but the blame kept coming down

Nowhere to hide
You were always way too strong
Out in the night
As cicadas sing their song
Tell me are you listening
'Cause no one hears a thing

Tonight I have decided that there's only one way out
And I tried so hard to fight it but the blame kept coming down
And I've got a torrid story but there's no one I can tell
I don't know if there's a Heaven but I'm sure that there's a Hell

I feel the knife
Like the first time breathing in
Come to life
Like we'll never be again
Tell me are you listening
'Cause no one hears a thing

Tonight I have decided that there's only one way out
And I tried so hard to fight it but the blame kept coming down

And it led me right where your heart should have been
And it was the last thing you saw was it in

I feel the knife
Like the first time breathing

Tonight I have decided that there's only one way out
And I tried so hard to fight it but the blame kept coming down
And I've got a torrid story but there's no one I can tell
I don't know if there's a Heaven but I'm sure that there's a Hell

Autopilot Off,"You're probably sick of being tired
You can't find the strength to close your eyes
You can't let go,
But you can't change everything
Stop laying in this burning bed

Write it on the walls and read it
Bright red so you can see it
Don't fail me now
Write it on the walls and read it
Until there are no secrets
So safe and sound
At least for now

Time's gonna warn you with a whisper
What it wants to let you know
You can't live in fear of the things that aren't for sure
So stay alive by playing dead

Write it on the walls and read it
Bright red so you can see it
Don't fail me now
Write it on the walls and read it
Until there are no secrets
So safe and sound

Still there are lines for us to write before we close our eyes
And only time will tell the ending when the ink runs dry
Time will tell everything,
It's ever so quiet counting down

Write it on the walls and read it
Blood red so you can see it
Life leaking out
Write it on the walls and read it
Until there are no secrets
So safe and sound
At least for now
At least for now",Clockwork,2004
Autopilot Off,"Divine intervention
So few and far between
Like lightning when it touches to the ground
Answer me the question
I'm ready to believe
I hold my breath before I let it out

The face we show
The one we hide
The hands we hold and leave behind
For all we lose
And all we find
Here while we live and while we die

The wait for redemption
It gets heavy on the mind
And I burn my eyes out staring at the sun
At this intersection
We are looking for the signs
And up ahead these roads they bend to one

The ties we bind
The ones we break
The solid ground beneath us shakes
What it tears down and what it makes
And what we give is all we'll take

To ride along the horizon
When these days are gone
It's what we become
As we ride along the horizon
When these days are gone
It's what we become

The face we show
The one we hide
The hands we hold and leave behind
For all we lose
And all we find
Here while we live and while we die
The ties we bind
The ones we break
The solid ground beneath us shakes
What it tears down and what it makes
And what we give is all we'll take

Hanging in the air we breathe
And I'll fill my lungs with all that they can hold

We've got everything we need
To guide us now whichever way we go",Divine Intervention,2004
Autopilot Off,"I was waiting 
Watching every single move 
On the wire I cling to 
Had a feeling 
Like a cold and empty room 
There was nothing left to lose 

And I know, I know you're waiting 
I'll see you again if it's the last thing I can do 
I know, I know it's all that's true 

I was wasted 
Without everything I knew 
I was lost without a clue 

I know, I know you're waiting 
I'll see you again if it's the last thing I can do 
I know, I know it's all that's true 

Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 

And I wandered so far, and it brought me back to you 
And I screamed at the sky, and it turned from black to blue 

And I know, I know you're waiting 
I'll see you again if it's the last thing I can do 
I know, I know it's all that's true, that's true, that's true! 
That's true! That's true! That's true!

Autopilot Off,"I don't know if we'll make it home
All we can do for now is hope

I don't know if we'll make it home
Water all around could swell and wash us all away
Away
And if we never said I'll be on land again
This will be one last song I will not forget

And if you drown
You won't even make a sound
You'll just swallow water down
At the bottom you'll find out
That it's quiet when you drown

I'm losing track of all the days
Lost inside a life boat
Drifting out with all the waves
The waves
And some will find their way by looking towards the sky
And some will leave their fate up to these ocean tides

And if you drown
You won't even make a sound
You'll just swallow water down
At the bottom you'll find out
That it's quiet when you drown

And when you drown
You'll never even make a sound
And when you drown
You're gonna swallow water down

The water gets so heavy
The water gets so heavy
The water gets so heavy

The water's heavy when you drown
You won't even make a sound
You'll just swallow water down
At the bottom you'll find out

I swore I never would unleash

Onto someone's sliced off dick
Woman's face removed with care
Still attached to scalp and hair
put it on my face and stare
And think of what comes next

Decorated with toenails
Now I look at the pair of breasts I've severed
On my tray

When you lie on some bodies, blood comes out of their mouth, and the weight

No end to the cadavers
Ridden with disease

Faces decomposing
Screaming in pain and despair
Becoming one with the earth
Flesh deteriorates until bones are bare

Bones collapse
From advanced decay

No more blood to bleed
No end to the cadavers

Autumn,"And in the morning
After years have passed
It seems
Oh even now to overwhelm me
And in the stillness
After life has passed
It seems
Even now to grow like cancer
And in the fallout
After war days have passed
It seems
Even now to keep from dying
And there you are, going deep into and through me
And there you are, keeping distant all who knew me
And filling me with a new kind of life
But it's one I never wanted, one I never imagined
And even now, you send me reeling
For you and I have been together much too long
And though I drink my mind will not grow numb
'cause it's one I never wanted, one I never imagined
And even now, you know I'm reeling
For you and I have been together much to long
Much too long, don't you know
Oh and here we are, and here it goes again
I know I've waited much too long
I have weighed it all, delayed the fall
But even so, even nowâ?¦

",Even Now,1997
Autumn,"Seconds
Once ignored - now cherished 
As they begin to tick away 
Panting, like a dog in the wind 
Throat constricted 
Swelling as a tumor - I can scarcely breathe 
My eyes stand in the way 
To the world I need to see 
Hazy melting images coated in glue 
Begin sliding from my view 
And I trample on top of them 
Now a blind fool 
Now a blind fool 
Oh my heavy, heavy aching legs 
Cannot do the work of ten men 
To lift my feet of stone 
Clumsy, my arms 
Long and leaden - they drag behind me 
Carving deep trenches in the rotting earth 
Oh so tightened 
Stretched beyond belief 
My skin cracks 
With the weight of my dying body 
And the rage in my head 
Blood trickles down from my burning eyes 
And stings my charred lips 
Oh dear god - if you would but save me
So much as a finger on my hand 
Surely I could find the strength to climb 
Atop a cloud in your sky 
And echo your praises 
Into the light of a new day 
But my words are lost 
As my bones 
Snap suddenly 
And I am left to lie upon the burning remnants of my life 
Seconds 
Eternity 
The clock ceases inside of me 
Oh this silence, this emptiness inside 
For the grinding of my teeth at the searing pain 
Of my flesh and the stench which infiltrates my every pore 
Silence 
Eternity 
Might as well relax 
It's much too late 
To cancel 
All my reservations in hell",Seconds,1997

[Intro: U-God]
Forgive me..
For all that shit I did in my past..
You know what I'm sayin'...

[U-God]
Is anyone out there? Does anyone care?
This is my testament, my bedtime prayer
I resent my sins, oh Lord, listen clear
I can feel it in the heat of the night, and in the air
Lord, give me your ear, I want you, to understand
Please forgive me, I'm a righteous man
Tryin' to do the best I can, just to feed my fam
I might die, in these streets, by some jealous hands
Now I can it's some scam, from the root to the fruit
Cuz when they see me in the streets, grimey's guns salute
Me, it's the moment of truth, I got mud on my boots
Plus the sounds of the sirens, cops in hot pursuit
Pray for me..

[Chorus x2: Autumn Rue]
As I lay thee down to sleep
I pray the Lord, the soul to keep
If I die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, the soul to take

[U-God]
All this pressure, building up in the pot
When the schemes released, I'm bout to blow my top
I'm the cream of the crop, when machine guns pop
I seen the death angel come when I see son drop
I cried, tattoo tear drops, cuz inside it hurt
I saw his life flash before him, as he lied in the dirt
And searched for heaven on earth, in his debts, sold in land
I poisoned my own community, with kilos and grams
And people don't take a stand, politics tempers flare
They build, prisons 'stead of parks, children end up in there
It's the welfare, the precinct, the daycare's, indecent
The churches, the priest, inside the belly of the beast
It's, diseases, crack babies, people actin' crazy
Oh Lord, can you save me? If not, snatch up my baby
Ohhh..

Always I knew what you meant but now I don't know
I see the trembling veil of your soul and tears that never dry...never
Dry
Woe is me - sometimes I can't sleep at all
So close - the distance still grows
And sickness, our foe, still blows
I noticed your fragile thoughts and stars that changed their colours
We sat together so far away...so far away
Yesterday I sang a melody of autumn
In your hearse we'll rest tonight

And said, ""Anybody want to go on up to Greasy Lake?
It's about a mile down on the dark side of Route 88
I got a bottle of rosé so let's try it
We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe
And I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go

And he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
He said, ""Trust some of this, it'll show you where you're at
Or at least it'll help you really feel it""
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake
I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her 'cause I was too loose to fake
I said, ""I'm hurt."" She said, ""Honey, let me heal it""
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band

Stand right up and let her shoot through me

Now, the night was bright and the stars threw light
On Billy and Davy dancin' in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Well now, Hazy Davy got really hurt
He ran into the lake in just his socks and his shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt
Singin' our birthday songs
Janey said it was time to go
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to Gypsy Angel Row
Felt so right
Together we moved like spirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night)...

Ava Cherry & the Astronettes,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Un día mas se va y tu no estás 
Quisiera escapar, huir de esta soledad 
Pero algo me impide dejar todo atrás 
Sin ti, nada es igual 

Quizás haya una razón por la que luchar 
Cuentan que un ser provocó 
La ira de un dios por su perfección 
Su envidia acabó con el don, en dos le separó 
Y el dios descansó 

Intento no pensar, no quiero estar triste 
Mi vida ya no es igual si tu no estás 
No entiendo la razón, pero algo me dice 
Que un día tú y yo 
Haremos temblar a ese dios, ya lo verás

Que han roto esa maldición 
Han de hacer caso a su corazón

Avalanch,"Junto a la fuente de un bosque se oye llorar
A un joven pastor que un dí­a perdió su único amor
Cuando anochece se acerca hasta el lugar
Se sienta a esperar por si ella regresa a verle en la oscuridad

Y ella le ve, se sienta con él
Todas las noches hasta el amanecer
Le habla al oí­do, le roza la piel
Y cuando se va le pide en silencio que vuelva otra vez

Junto a la fuente en la que un dí­a yo jure
Que jamás querrí­a tanto a una mujer
Rezo en silencio por tenerte otra vez
Yo no sé si me ves
Solo sé que jamás te olvidare

Fue una noche de invierno cuando él se durmió
Que ella le habló y en sueño profundo su voz escuchó
Sé que mi muerte te ha roto el corazón
Pero has de vivir pues viéndote así­ mi amor, sufro por ti

Y él comprendió que debí­a ser
Su ultima noche hasta el amanecer
Pues al despertar tenia con él
Sus ropas, su anillo y el fino olor de su piel

Que jamás querrí­a tanto a una mujer

Tell me, when did I lose my first Love?
Where did the fire and passion go?
Burn in me Your holy fire, give me back my lost desire,
And restore in me the love I felt for You.

Can I remember how it felt, when they looked into my face,
and they saw the love of Jesus in my eyes?
When I look back on my life, and question where I've been,
Can I really say, I've done my best for you?

All who are wounded by sin
And just as we are, we can fall in His arms

With burdens and struggles to face
Only in our losing
Do we really see how much we've gained

Let everybody see it in our lives.

Why, why someone try and tell me why
We would want it any other way.
A heart can change before our very eyes.
Well, I've seen the difference that love can make.
Where is the kind of love the world can never explain
It's time to let the gospel put us straight.

So they knew from the start this road would not lead to fame
All they really knew for sure was Jesus had called to them

With reckless abandon they came

Empty nets lying there at the water's edge
Told a story that few could believe and none could explain
How some crazy fishermen agreed to go where Jesus led
With no thought for what they would gain
For Jesus had called them by name and they answered

We will abandon it all for the sake of the call
No other reason at all but the sake of the call
Wholly devoted to live and to die for the sake of the call

Drawn like rivers are drawn to the sea
There's no turning back for the water cannot help but flow

Because of the love He has shown
And because He has called us to go we will answer

Avalon Cats,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You,2000

But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I'm desperate cause the clocks ticking
Only got 4 minutes to go

Who are these people I don't know in my house and they scratching my floors
Takin' furniture outside and the U-Haul pull up to my door
What's the reason that I get this feelin that you can't keep it real with me
Is it cause of the prime relationships I had off in the streets?
Never mind that this is your conscience speaking and you need to get your girl back
You gotta find a way to try to get to her heart
I'm takin' suggestions I've learned my lesson
Think conscience you're my last lifeline

I thought this love would last
But I can't let you go baby
You're my everything lady
The reason I smile and the reason I talk baby
The reason I breathe, the only one for me, yea
You can't go through with this
If you left me my life wouldn't exist
Cause I'm still in love with you
And that's my word I don't give a damn what you heard
Oh, baby I'll be true

I only got 4 minutes
And I'm running out of time

What else can I do to prove my love to you
I'm going crazy baby and your love will make me

In escalades and Caddies ice drippin

To all my ladies wit they top down
And the Bentley's is sitting low to the ground
I had to tell that girl to exhale, why's that?
Cause she seen me rollin' on Sprewells
And her booty was packed just like a lunch pale
But my game was tighter than a pair of Channel's
She said you remind me of L.L.,then Kelly, then Nelly
I'm like yo' that's cool be, but you can call me AV

But we ain't Hollywood

Yo' you can catch me on the back street
In the hood wit the girl off in the back seat
She said she's from Puerto Rico, I said yo' I need to stop and get some petro
She said, OK stop at the gas station
She's in the passenger seat just waiting patient
She put her foot up on my dash, I'm like what?
Girl get them down and for that go pump my gas

We just Flickin, every day of my life that's how we livin'
From N.Y. to Calli chrome spinning
In escalades and Caddies ice drippin

We just Flickin, every day of my life that's how we livin'

Bump Jay, I come through
Chopping like I know kung fu
TV's make you feel like your sittin'
In yo front room, bang in the trunk too
Everybody hood know we got it good
We ain't Hollywood
We just flickin, so wipe a playa down, we pimpin
Everyday it's another bust down it's sickin'
I will up the chrome and flame, and for my nigga

You were seventeen
And you thought you was grown 
I found a thrill when we went up a hill
And you use to feel me
My body would get chills

I brought you candy and popcorn
At the movies
I had it made when I, got paid
And we, go roller skate

You were my world 
'Cause you brought me my baby girl
She so fine and she's all mine
And I promised to love you
Until the end of time

That's ok cause I felt the same way
But you're running game
And that's when everything changed
The phone calls and your two ways
And your attitude
You wanted too many pimp tapes

The finest linen, the type of ish she love to cop
The Miss Stiletto heels, she a fan of Barcelona
She hatin' attention, but every naked eye on her

Straight out of Arizona, I told her that I'm a loner
I'm offerin' crystal, but she prefer lime and Corona
Super saucy, Sergio Rossi sandals
And when she in the Jacuzzi ooh, she lightin' candles

Stuntin' all the way across the floor for sure
Freshly molded by the hands of the Lord and oh
Heavens angel, curves in every angle
Time to play two to tango, bring the hook sang

You on the brink of bubble-latin', your body's displayin'
And I'm a spitter on the come up been patiently waitin'
To tour Jamaica, maybe meet a couple Jamaicans

That makes us equally compatible, expectations
For you it's education, for me is to rock the nation
Now that's a combination we should be modulatin'
Crunchin' on Greek salad under some conversation

Sippin' on apple pucker twerpin' that mariuchi
I'm diggin' the purse, your matchin', that's authentic Guuci
And you the chick that I been searchin' for across the globe
And I just wanted you to know

But I know I got a good thing right here, 
That's why I say (hey)

Nobody gonna love me better, I'm gon' stick wit you forever
Nobody gonna take me higher, I'm gon' stick wit you
You know how to appreciate me, I'm gon' stick wit you, my baby
Nobody ever made me feel this way, I'ma stick wit you

Listen give me 10 minutes
Well gimme 5 minutes aight
B-before you leave I just need these last 4 minutes

Pardon me if I'm talking fast and stumbling all over my words
I heard you were leavin' town I thought I'd be the one to know first
If you have a minute let me talk to you and see what's going on
Don't say it's nothing when it's something that's gone wrong
Now let me explain but I don't know what to say
Cause I don't know what the hell happened
I come in the house to try to work it out
And all you're doing is packing
Close your suitcase let me think straight
Damn what could be the reason?
Baby talk me I'm almost outta time

I only got 4 minutes to do what I gotta do to prove to you that I'm gonna do anything
Only got 4 minutes say what I gotta say to make you stay and show you that I done change
Cause in 4 minutes I'll never have my girl again
In 4 minutes I'm a lose her to some other man
For no less no more
I'm desperate cause the clocks ticking
Only got 4 minutes to go

Who are these people I don't know in my house and they scratching my floors
Takin' furniture outside and the U-Haul pull up to my door
What's the reason that I get this feelin that you can't keep it real with me
Is it cause of the prime relationships I had off in the streets?
Never mind that this is your conscience speaking and you need to get your girl back
You gotta find a way to try to get to her heart
I'm takin' suggestions I've learned my lesson
Think conscience you're my last lifeline
I'm down to my last second

I only got 4 minutes to do what I gotta do to prove to you that I'm gonna do anything
I only got 4 minutes say what I gotta say to make you stay and show you that I done change
(I'm a changed man)
Cause in 4 minutes I'll never have my girl again
In 4 minutes I'm a lose her to some other man (I'll be all alone)
For no less no more
I'm desperate cause the clocks ticking
Only got 4 minutes to go

(I've done) I've done things in my past
I thought this love would last
But I can't let you go baby
You're my everything lady
The reason I smile and the reason I talk baby
The reason I breathe, the only one for me, yea
You can't go through with this
If you left me my life wouldn't exist
Cause I'm still in love with you
And that's my word I don't give a damn what you heard
Oh, baby I'll be true

I only got 4 minutes
And I'm running out of time
I only got 4 minutes
I only got 4 minutes

4 minutes I'll never have my girl again (I'll never have)
In 4 minutes (oh no) I'm a lose her to some other man (I'm a lose her)
For (oh ho) no less no more

What you want is too demanding

It's such a mental chase
Tired of saving face girl

All types of suggestions

Did everything I knew by the book, but it just didn't work
I figured happily ever after wasn't, wasn't in the plans for me
Had just about given up on love until you came around and showed me exactly what it was

I finally found someone, a girl I can lover forever never thought it would happen for me
Feels like I'm walking on water walking on water
When I'm with you impossible it's easy to do
Never thought it would happen for me
With you I'm walking on water walking on water

Nothing seemed to matter much without ya
But life has changed another song about ya, and even if I try to go back no it just wouldn't work ooh

Avantasia,"Where do I go?

Never had a very real dream before.
Now I got a vision of an open door.
Guiding me home, where I belong,
Dreamland I have come.

Oh where do I go?

Never had a flesh and blood like this before.
Got a new appearance when I passed the door.
Is it a dream I am within? Oh what's going on?

Down, down, down
Go down, go down, go down
I roam into nowhere.
Don't see an end: eternal wastelands.
And I hear the voice, the voice, the voice, the voice

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Never been a fighter, neber been a man.
But I must help Vandroiy, he's my only friend.
Nowhere to go but I know that he knows how
We will get her out

Magic of transcendence
Brought me to this place
Vandroiy in reality lead me on my race.
Told me to bring back the seal
But still I don't know where I shall go.

Can't you 'feel' the voice?
You don't have a choice.
What a kind of life
Freedom in flesh shackles on your mind

Go all the way to the tower!
Find out the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
For all the wisdom of ages doesn't die.

Men have good intentions
On their way to the light.
But som of them are venal
And end up in the night.
Maybe it's better for you, mankind,
Not to know what's going on.

Sometimes we must go
Ways that seem to be wrong.
What a kind of life: Freedom in flesh,
Shackles on your mind

Go all the way to the tower!
Find out the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
Find out the name of the one
Who reigns from inside

You have come the long way through ages
To bring me the seven parts of the seal.
So now throw it over the walls of the tower.
Throw the seal!

But first Godfather, what about the prophecy? What
About your reward: The ultimate illumination, the
Gnosis and the power to defend your kingdom on
Earth with a strong hand? What about the prophecy?

I realize

For the glory, for the glory, for the glory,
For the glory. Oh what is going on?
For the glory, for the glory, for the glory,
For the glory. Oh what is going on?

Gabriel I can feel
You have it back book and seal.
Still no war is won, we have just begun

Go all the way to the tower!
Long for the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
Found out the name of the one
Who reigns from inside

Go all the way to the tower!
Long for the secrets behind!
Go all the way to the tower!
Found out the name of the one,
Of the one

And the mark of the beast

When I'm walking through the fen

And you don't play by all those temporal rules

To push you all over the pain

You roam the barren wickd plains abound
In evil lies and evil speak
Abound in all you evil freaks

And meant be
What about your flesh and blood
And defiers like me?

Their evil eyes are looking down on you
And those who don't are losing sight of you
Facing the rage to chase away
The specter of disgrace and shame

He's raping your children

When everything's lost?

Slit my throat, everyone's to blame
Lost in the fields of confusion

To set me free
Caught in your grasp, how?
Just let me be
Give me control out
Out of these depths
A fiery hell
I pray for death

I've been the wrong one time and time again
Now I'm on my knees forgive me please
Tore out my heart and handed to me on a silver platter
Sew up the hole, emptiness in the place of compassion

I am the product of your creation
Sew up the hole, and now, look the other way

Screams of evil men.

For me to take what's mine, until the end of time
We were more than friends, before the story ends,
And I will take what's mine, create what God would never design

I was weak with fear that something would go wrong,
Before the possibilities came true,
I took all possibility from you

Almost laughed myself to tears,
Conjuring her deepest fears
(Come here you fucking bitch)

Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times,
I can't believe it,
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes,
Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it

Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard,

To repossess a body with which I'd misbehaved

Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears

Ripped his heart out right before his eyes

Now that it's done I realize the error of my ways
I must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave

While you burned in hell, no peace forever

Roll out of bed but I'm never quite alone
Tension is pulling me in all directions
And I'll be done once you use me as a rope
Sometimes the pressure will just drive you crazy
At any time I could explode
I need some piece of mind, it's got me tired
Don't wanna lose it, but I'm turning down that road

I need a moment cause I've spread myself to thin
We all need a moment in our lives
Works hard, the days too long
And that's just where it begins
Tension has had us all this time

I sit in traffic every single morning
Just as I arrive, I'm slaving to the grind
Making the money so I feed my family
But I can't raise them, 'cause I ain't got the time
I got no free days on my busy schedule
I turn the page and it's the same
Don't like my situation, you don't either
Don't wanna look back scared, I will get away

I need a moment cause I've spread myself to thin
We all need a moment in our lives
Works hard, the days too long
And that's just where it begins
Tension has had us all this time

But every now and then
I drive alone
And over all
Hot summer days
A gentle breeze that feels alright
Home alone
And I can't feel the pain
Only strain
Enjoy the sights
I feel alive
When actually here just feels alright
Far from home

We all need a moment in our lives
Works hard, the days too long

""We have one collective hope: the Earth And yet, 
uncounted people remain hopeless, famine and calamity abound 
Sufferers hurl themselves into the arms of war; 
people kill and get killed in the name of someone else’s concept of God
Do we admit that our thoughts & behaviors spring from a belief 
that the world revolves around us? Each fabricated conflict, 
self-murdering bomb, vanished airplane, every fictionalized dictator, 
biased or partisan, and wayward son, 
are part of the curtains of society’s racial, ethnic, religious, national, 
and cultural conflicts, 
and you find the human ego turning the knobs and pulling the levers 
When I track the orbits of asteroids, comets, and planets, 
each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, 
choreographed by the forces of gravity, 
I see beyond the plight of humans 
I see a universe ever-expanding, 
with its galaxies embedded within the ever-stretching 
four-dimensional fabric of space and time 
However big our world is, our hearts, our minds, 
our outsize atlases, the universe is even bigger 
There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on the world’s beaches, 
more stars in the universe than seconds of time that have passed since Earth formed, 
more stars than words & sounds ever uttered by all humans who have ever lived
The day we cease the exploration of the cosmos 
is the day we threaten the continuing of our species 
In that bleak world, arms-bearing, 
resource-hungry people & nations would be prone to act on their low-contracted prejudices, 
and would have seen the last gasp of human enlightenment 
Until the rise of a visionary new culture that once again embraces the cosmic perspective; 
a perspective in which we are one, fitting neither above nor below, but within""",Exist,2016

To make you come home
Seems so long ago you walked away
And left me alone
Y yo me acuerdo what you said to me
You were acting so strange
Quizas fui ciego y no quise entender
That you needed a change

Was it something I said
To make you turn away
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
Right now

I've been seating here
Can't get you off my mind
I try my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane wishing I can touch your face
But the truth re-mains
You're gone
Tu no estas, gone
No-o, gone
Oh baby girl, baby girl you're, gone
No-o, gone

I don't want to make excuses baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone no no
Pero si algo es verdad mi amor
Siempre me rindo a tus pies
El tiempo pasa tan lento baby
Esa es mi vida sin ti (esa es mi vida sin ti)
And maybe I can change my everyday
Pero no puedo mi amor
So I'll just hang around and find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you
Y yo se corazon que tambien sientes lo mismo por mi
Dime que si

I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind (no puedo mas)
I try my best to be a man and be strong (ooh)

But the truth remains
You're gone
Tu no estas gone
No-o gone
Oh baby girl,baby girl you're gone
Noo-o gone

Dime que puedo hacer
Si no estas junto a mi
Dime niña que no vez
Que me muero por ti
Now that we are apart
Am I still in your heart
Niña linda que no vez
Te necesito aqui

Ooh
I've been sitting here (sentado aqui)
Can't get you off my mind (en falta de tu amor)
I try my best to be man and be strong (listen to your man)
I drove myself insane wishing I can touch your face
But the truth re-mains
You are gone
I've been sitting here (sentado aquí)
Can't get you off my mind (can't get you off my mind)

La dama perfecta, toda una belleza, ella es mi inspiración
Somos feliz ella y yo (ella y yo)

Y aunque tiene dueño, yo solo tengo un sueño, ser su protector
Somos su marido, ella y yo

No me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás su marido no mande en su corazón
No sabes quien es victima en la confusión

Oye mi pana lucha por amor
No, no me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás ese tipo no mande en su corazón
Tú, no sabes quien es victima en esta confusión

Mi esposa y yo, somos felices dos almas matrices sé lo que es el amor
Por eso te entiendo y aunque sea casada 
no te alejes por temor, no lo hagas Don, ay no no no

Mi amigo ella y yo teníamos claro que era una locura esta relación
Pero la carne nos llamaba, y la cama nos hacia una invitación
A solo hacer el amor

Ay ya te expliqué
Cuando hay personas que se aman, el amor tiene que vencer
Y ya el marido entiende que perdió su hembra ahora es tu mujer
No pueden ganar los tres

Y te repito lucha por amor

No sabes quien es victima en esta confusión

No seas tan tonto lucha por amor
No, no me aconsejes en tu posición
Quizás ese tipo no mande en su corazón
Tu no sabes quien es victima en esta confusión

Amigo pido perdón yo nunca te fallé
Me traicionaron las ganas de volverla ver
Y aunque todavía no puedo creer
Lo que este amargo encuentro me hizo comprender
Pues tú también llegaste a ese lugar
Donde tantas veces yo la fui a buscar
Y aunque no es fácil lo que voy a hacer
Admitiré que salí con tu mujer

Salí con tu mujer (¿qué?)
Salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer
Salí con tu mujer

Que te perdone Dios, yo no lo voy a hacer
Los perdí a los dos y a la misma vez
Ya veo que todo era mentira cuando ella me decía
Que se iba pa' Puerto Rico a vacaciones con su amiga
Me mintió, tu y ella en una cama, allá en Bayamo
Quizás en Isla Verde o Carolina, cuantos hoteles ensucio,
Tú también, los odio a los dos (no me entiende)

Me mata el dolor

Un infeliz, me acusa de maleante no he dicho que soy perfecto pero
De algo hay que vivir se que en la forma que gano dinero no es legal
No me importa te quiero yo solo vivo para ti

Papa no te va a escuchar, yo se que vas a fracasar
Mejor que piense en lo que yo siento por ti
Te amo pero por favor no ponga en riesgo nuestro amor
Entiende niña hay compromisos que cumplir
Mi amor no te imaginas como yo me estoy sintiendo cuando me hablan
Mal de ti, si no son los vecinos es mi padre con consejos no puedo
Seguir así

Se que no es fácil dejar lo que haces has un intento antes que
Fracases yo también vivo para ti
De que te quejas corazón si lo que quieras te lo doy
Los lujos a mi no me importan solo tu
Entonces solo ámame yo se cuidarme créeme
Si caes preso hay mismo olvídate de mi

Mi amor entiende bien mi padre cuidara de mi no quiere que me pase nada
Entiendo que el te quiere pero mas te quiero yo no pierdo esta batalla
Vuelvo y te digo deja lo que haces has un intento antes que fracases
Repito solo vivo para ti

Me afecta mucho por que te amo corazón

I've been into foreskin since puberty
I want an uncut Latino with a libido
The size of Reno, Nevada to bang me
'Til My bladder splatters
A dick fatter than a beer can
Lay down, stand
Or in the back of his van
He sports Tommy, Adidas
Fubu, Timberland
Pinky ring on his hand
His wish is my command
I'll suck his dick on the can
Or on the Puerto Rican sand
That's my man with the nice clean fade
And when he gets paid, I get paid
And when I get laid, I'm glad he stayed
'Cause there's nothin' like more than foreskin
I drop my chin so I can fit it all in
And then he eats my ass
Like he eats rice and beans
Until the plate's clean
You know what I mean?

Yes, I do, just the other day
I got a blowjob from a hoe job
With no job
Seen him at the bar
Battin' his eyelashes
Show me where your cash is
I'll show where my stash is
His ass is on my bed
The head board hit his head
'Til his head turned red
In and out was the motion
KY was the lotion
And that's the way it goes girl
When you fuck until your toes curl
I rocked his world
With mad stamina
Hot like panama
Shot like an enema
I'm sending your ass back to the store to get some rubbers
So I change the covers

Well, it won't be long
Before he takes off my thong
(But it wasn't a thong until you put it on)
Shut the fuck up
I'm the one getting laid here
He's back from the bodega
With a case of beer and a bag of weed
So I'm on my knees pulling out the seeds
He wants to squeeze my 34Bs
Until I can't breathe
Someone pass the poppers and a bottle of lube
Before he bangs me from the back
With his rough rider attitude the routine
We fuck on the rug so the sheets stay clean
Damn, my man is heaven sent
He got me horny like the ex president
Just thinking of my man's big dick in my face
And then he cums in my face
And then runs out of the place
I don't care, he'll be back
'Cause he loves this ass
And when he's done his friends'll be over fast
You got a problem with me?
You should get your ass off of Avenue D.

See you like the type of guy that works at the pizza place
Sweat on his face mustache above his lips
Open shirt, gold chain and a crucifix
I like the type of guy that east vil style
Chill for a while if he's versatile
But the bottom direction give me his ass
And give me affection
Did I happen to mention?
(No, I don't think you did)
Well, I like to keep my man in the 718
'Cause I'm in the 212 and got things to do
(Like what?)
Like whatever, I wanna leave this
With no shame
Behind me
But all I see is his name on my caller ID
Which reminds me of the time we took three ecstasy
You know, one things leads to another
I see him on the weekends
(What about the weekdays?)
That's when I'm busy messin' with his brother

But I can't stop tryin', I can't give up hope

I couldn't sleep a wink last night just a-thinking of you
Baby things weren't right I kept on tossin' and turnin'
Turnin' and tossin'  tossin' and turnin' all night
I threw the blankets on the floor, turned my pillow upside down
Then I thought of you some more
And I kept on tossin' and turnin' turnin' and tossin' 
Tossin' and turnin' all night
Jumped out of bed, turned on the light
Pulled down the shade went to the kitchen for a bite
Pulled up the shade, turned off the light
I jumped back into bed it was the middle of the night
The clock downstairs was striking four, couldn't get you off my mind

To a world young and free, we shall fly, follow me.
April green, everywhere, April songs always there,
Come and hear, come and see, follow me.
To the tree where our hopes hang high,
To the dream that should never die,
Where our long lost tomorrows still are in the sweet bye and bye.
Time goes by, or do we, close your eyes, and you'll see
As we were, we can be, weep no more, follow me.

Averi,"I've been warring with myself
I've wrestled these ideas and all these things I've felt 
And I don't feel any better 
The war goes on, but whatever 

We all think too much
I guess I sat here just hoping
That all these things you were throwing
Would reassure my uncertainties

I start to choose a direction 
When you shake your head and I question the steps I start to take
And I'm sure the view is breathtaking 
If I could only step to that ledge

They take a picture of you at the top
Oh, did you smile when the flash went off?

[Chorus]
If I stop to catch my breath 
Could you please slow up?
Because it hurts that much
When my lungs are numb
And if I hint at giving in
Remind me I'm strong
And I need to be 
Where I want to belong

It takes time to feel sure about this
Security is something I can't quite grab ahold of yet
I start to lose my direction
When you choke on your words

And I question the steps I start to take
Words are not necessary
So instead of that could you maybe 
Just let me go my way?

They take a picture of you at the top
Oh, did you smile when the flash went off?

[Chorus]

I'm naked for the world
And it's chilling to be outside
Where I can't see anything in front of me clearly

It's a right of passage
Like a child in it's adolescence
It's a passing storm 
And I can only wait it out
So I wait it out
I wait it out
I wait it out
With or without you

Wish I could be there

[Verse 1: Murphy Lee]
Check, back in '93 I had it all
I was a kid, yo I grew up on the ""Player's Ball""
Shiit, born in the 80's man, St. Louis Hailey Ann
Showin' my jewels to prove I was the ladies' man
Shake all the ladies' hands, feel on the ladie's pants
I'm doin' the latest dance, makin' the hatas glance
I'm wit the older crowd, big brother showed me how
To make my mama proud, look how it turned out
Well lemme get back on my bullshit
To be a playa yo you had to learn to push it
Yo, 'cause it was crazy how we hooked up
I looked up, found my face in her butt like ""What the fuck?""
""Stop, what you doin? get yo face out my fanny""
Tuckin' her shirt in so I wouldn't see her panties
We laughed, and that was a beginning of a past
That keep on huntin' my ass, now who the asshole..

[Hook: Avery Storm]
I don't really think
I don't think that you..
I don't think you say ""my ways""
I don't think I want to stay..
I don't think that you can say, your way
I've done made a lot of mistakes befo'
Yo my girl, I think I better go..

[Verse 2: Murphy Lee]
Yo, yo, yo..verse 2 is how we set it off
It took ya derrty 2 years just to get it off
Shiit, and even though it wasn't bout that
'cause we was young and I knew I'd be the first cat (eh-eh)
And I got proved wrong, and I knew all along
Cause 2 years lata someone said they was the first to bone
Now I got a circumstance on my hands
Supposed to be her man, first one in her pants
I stayed wit her, spent much years, days wit her
Laid in the shade wit her, sit and played spades wit her
I always knew that it would happen again
So on the side I always kept about 2 or 3 friends
Two wrongs don't make a right, but yeah right
I was in love, you what it took to keep it tight
A year later, the shit didn't shape up
I caught her on the Kastle lot straight shakin' her butt
Whut?

I don't really think
I don't think that you..

Verse 3 is how I fell for it
If a happy home at 70, you gotta go through hell for it
I answered calls and chanced it all
Knowin' damn well we wasn't advancin' at all
Now we back at Mickey D's and movies
Chicken from Popeye's, ""I know a biscuit come wit this two piece!""
Her attitude used to urk me, sweet as can be
Booty like pie, but bah, please dessert me
And I'm not gonna be able to do it
And she knew if we spent time together we'd be right back to it
Yeep, she be like ""spend the night"", I be like ""damn right""
But when I wake up in the mornin' man I see the light
I got the same circumstance on my hands
Instead of bein' a man, controllin' what's in my pants
I left, I thought it'd been the end of the mess
But she still call my phone to death, I need help..

You don't like cheap sex, I laid a mil' on the bed

Hop off in the whip and we can roll around in it
In the back seat and we can go to town in it

But he's back bigger, better,
Stronger and free (ha ha ha),
Like I ain't fucked my way out
Of all these motherfuckin' situations, Watch this,

I'm here to remind you, just in case you forgot,
MR 305 no label stay hot,
38 choppers, but please no glock,
Used to move work but had no
Trap no block no spot,
Ma was cool with work, but no rocks,
Until she found my first nickel ruff bag,
Said I had enough shit to push a dad,
So she told me to get the fuck out the pad,
I was out to my first baby mama's crib,
Caught her fuckin' round with her wellas crib,
Thank god for music my saviour,
That's what helped me fight Xavier,
Don't believe these rappers and what they play ya,
I wanna be owner, fuck a playa,
Shit better say it,
I am an owner, bitch!

Let 'em know now that they gon' remember,
City on my back and I won't surrender,
Let 'em know now that they gon' remember,

They don't know (everything I been through),
They don't know (what it takes to get through),
They don't know, they don't know,

Struggle, hustle, grind,
Them boys knock me down,
You must be out yo fuckin' mind,
My mom taught me to fight,
Dade county raised me right,
And we gon' take over this thing,
Put down my fuckin' life,

Lemme come back, I've been here for years,
Grindin', blood, sweat and tears.
I don' gave the game my life,
Turned the streets from my bitch to my wife,
Every mornin' I woke up to the same shit,
Everybody sayin' that I ain't shit,
Them boys in the streets on that hate shit,
Them boys on the same street doin' that same shit,
Planned to move bricks, but it's 8 balls,
Y'all want me, I hate y'all but I ate y'all,
Young and stay, we realest,
I'm on my way to the show,
Gettin' paid, marvelous rates,
You the ace I'm the spade,
Cut cut gay, buck buck spray,
This ain't a duck duck goose,
This duck duck hey, plus hey duct tape ace that.

I got the city on my back and I won't surrender,
Let 'em know now that they gon' remember,
City on my back and I won't surrender,
Let 'em know now that they gon' remember,

Now you can stack the world against me,
Close the doors, I can't come in,
You could bet your life against me,
Bet your ass I'm gonna win,

Oh, it's like my eyes got a cover on em and something holding me back
A better man better level better know I try

[Jadakiss]
Yeah yo, Listen I done played with the snakes in the grass
Paid for my mistakes I made in the past
Everybody ate when I came wit the cash
At least I tried to ride the wave till it crashed
Same wood on the gun handle is on the dash
All the hoods that son ran through is on smash
They can't identify you wit a mask
And the bible I'll tell you nothing is gonna last
The name of the game's survival
If you make it alive when you ride through they make it arrival
My boo is gon' ride you know I am gon' ride too
Make an M every day I am gon' try to
Let's go

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Yeah yo, I tried to tell niggas I am willing to blast for it
I only try to give it to niggas that ask for it
Got them things on the scale I am still weighing em
Thought my dues was paid I am still paying em
Couple Elanor's and the Goose I am still baying em
Semi's and the fulli's know that the truth stay wit em
Wolves and gorillas is loose so don't play with em
Something's holding em back there's nothing that you can say to em
Popped champagne wit biggie at the palladium
Put that good hawk work in with the titanium's
Shit switch around when them heats get fired
And ya peeps just died but I least he tried Let's go

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Yeah, 
Watch the game get taken over
I am still on the same side of the fence I am just looking over
A solider from the gravel to the grass
To the obstacles in life I travel in the past
Whether I am holding a mic or holding a mac
It's like an invisible force is holding me back
But I ain't letting go of my pride
After I get the dough I slide
Better know I tried, let's go

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Avery Storm]
Here come another day up on me
Put the pressure on me here we go again ah
I try to do what's right when life is so wrong
I want a better way, I see a better day

God knows that I try but time won't wait for me

Mhmm
Yep
Ah-a
Yo..

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]

Take a second, what if we could rewind the hood?
Better yet, what if the L.O.X. woulda signed with Suge?
What if Puffy never signed us?
What if Oprah made them comments
Like Imus?
What if you designed this
Thought like I did?
Said it like this:
What if Peyton was fighting dogs instead of Mike Vick?
What if Arnold would just let Tookie get life?
What if B.I.G. missed the party, what if 'Pac missed the fight?
What if you was caged in?
What would you change then?
What if there was no Rocafella law for +Made Men+?
What if hate ran through me?
And what if Portland
Would've drafted Jordan
Instead of Sam Bowie?
What if you really have to be nice to get a deal?
What if all of these rappers' ice was really real?
What if I hit you with the razor from cheek to chin?
What if Mike Jackson never would have bleached his skin?

[Chorus 2x]

What if you never knew things that you needed to know?
What if you never been places you needed to go?
What if you get there, and learned them as you go?
""What if"" is the question, can I ask then once more?

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]

What if the pain went away?
What if you changed in a day?
What if you can eliminate
All the games
People play?
What if Shyne beat the case?
What if Diddy did a dime flat?
What if Nelson Mandela could give his time back?
What if Malcolm was silent?
What if Martin was violent?
What if you could really ""sneak an uzi on the island""?
...Yeah
What if I made you kiss the niner?
What if a brick was only just a misdemeanor?
What if Manhattan was hit by Hurricane Katrina?
What if a black man was the one controlling Fema?
What if we ain't never let emotions come between us?
What if the last time we rode, someone seen us?
What if...

[Chorus 2x]

What if you never knew things that you needed to know?
What if you never been places you needed to go?
What if you get there, and learned them as you go?
""What if"" is the question, can I ask then once more?

[Third Verse: NaS]

Yeah, yea, Yo..
I flow calm
But don't push
What if Saddam
Hung Bush?
What if ""One Mic"" was called ""One Hook""?
What if the Bridge never showed me how to hold a weapon?
What if I ran into that sick chick with no protection?
What if I never wore that army jacket?
Carhard to match it
Unlaced tims, the hood on my first album cover under plastic?
What if I was just another corny rapper?
What if I went first instead of Notorious, who would tell my story after?
What if we loved less and lust more?
If Obama was on Mount Rushmore?
Would Ali give Tyson a busted jaw?
What if I never glared out the project window?
Whenever the the scared for me and the life of my kinfolk?
What if that gun pin broke?
I would have never learned back in the body of an Enzo
All red 
What if all real niggaz was all dead
What if Hiliary and them
Were reptilian?
And 2012 was the end of men
And all world civilians?

[Chorus 2x]

What if you never knew things that you needed to know?
What if you never been places you needed to go?
What if you get there, and learned them as you go?

So I'm gonna really need to hear you say

When was the last time you heard me call you sweet darling, yeah
And when was the last time I heard you say hey baby, hey, (I just want you to call my name)
It's been such long time since you heard me call you sweet darling, (?)
I just can't remember (I just can't remember baby) the last time you called my name (Call me, call my name)

When was the last time I heard you call me sweet darling
And when was the last time I heard you say hey baby, hey (things, things just aren't the same)

Avery Watts,"Here's what it looks like (Looks like) 
Being the best
What it looks like, to be a cut above the rest

Nobody understands what it takes to be the man
Having every single person say you can't when you can
To give up everything you've ever known for a dream
And never stop the fight no matter how hard it seems
You sacrifice, you bleed, you sweat, and you cry
Doing everything you can not to lay down and die
When you fall and you call out, there's no one to help
So you've got no other option but to pick up yourself
At the end of the battle you're the only one standing
Everyone watching, the stage you're commanding
The pages of history will speak of today
And when they talk about the champion
This is what they'll say

Here's what it looks like (Looks like) 
Being the best
What it looks like, to be a cut above the rest

People will break you right down to nothing if you let 'em
They'll say, ""There's a million others like you, what makes you better?""
But remember that these folks are afraid of the unknown
They're the ones who wet the bed if they go 10 miles from home
Stay Down: Is what they scream in your ear
The only weapon that they have to use is fear
So you take all the beatings and you take all the hits,
But your back on your feet for more, you don't quit
You'll never back down, never stop, never pause
Never give up, never sacrifice the cause
This is your life, you gonna let somebody take it?
Look in the mirror That's all you need to make it
Here's what it looks like (Looks like) 
Being the best
What it looks like, to be a cut above the rest

The smoke has all cleared, and you own the throne
You're king of the castle, and everybody knows
They bow in your presence, and fear your might
Cause they know for damn sure what it, what it

This is the real deal not a test
Now society is calling out an SOS
Get down on the ground, put the earth to your ear
You feel that sound? That’s revolution you hear

Welcome to the greatest battle of all time
We’ve just officially been targeted by our own kind
The time has arrived now were sounding the alarm
Man up, grab your loved ones, get everybody armed

Exactly what you’re really made of inside
When comes right down to it what you gonna choose
To proudly hold your ground or just lie down and lose?

The enemy approaching outside the door
Dust off your voice box, time to be heard
And as the gate drops

We gotta makeover, takeover these communities
Analyze, capitalize, opportunities

Cause I just started an army picking up a pen

This begins a global collaboration
To take the whole world and make but one nation
This ain’t no imitation what you hearing is elite
That's why everything stops when you hear us speak

Oh! Back to the mission at hand, we’ve got a plan
Take the message that were sending and spread it across the land

Avery Watts,"Go into the mind of the everyday grind, of the blind in the darkness
What do we find? It’s a kind of confinement combined with pain,
Aligned by mankind and set to drain

Stuck in a 9 to 5 to stay alive, living in a dive to barely survive
The whole time you try to get ahead,
Just to get a little peace before you get dead
Nuff said.

Since your very birth, since your first breath on earth
It seems that life has been preordained
The order that it goes in? I'll explain:
Welcome to the world, go to school, get a job,
Get married, have a kid, be a dad, be a mom
Move along

Don't think, don't stop, don't dream
Everything in the world is exactly how it seems

Were told how to look, how to act, how to feel
What’s good, what’s bad, what’s fake, what’s real
And when times get tough and it’s hard to deal
Just pick your poison and the pain will heal

Got the blues? There's plenty of booze to choose,
Drugs to use, money to lose
You don't need to educate yourself on the truth,
That's already done
On the evening news

Born to lead, but we act like cattle
Not anymore, get ready for the battle
Sick of it all? Then get one fist up and
Scream at the top of your lungs, hey

That's enough
Throw those hands in the air
Get ‘em up
Show we've had it up to here

Put your seat-belt on, prepare for a collision,
cause those who see with the eyes of the blind,
They lack vision

Work, eat, sleep, wake, repeat
8 by 5 by countless weeks
Coffee, copies, floppies, faxes
Troubles, traffic, caskets, taxes

Fact is media sees, we find lifes answers in magazines
But why even read?
Everything that you need to believe is on a box we call the TV

Don't think another thought
Stop, erase, forget what you’ve been taught.
You can cheat what you don't know let’s break it on down
Here we go!

Your Brain? BAKE IT
Waist? FAKE IT
Don't have money for it? JUST TAKE IT
Your Hair? DYE IT
Courage? BUY IT
This will make it bigger over night, just try it

Go into the world and make a name
Or just do it online, in a video game
You can stay inside until you scream
And live your life in front of a screen
It’s sickening

What have we become?
You’re better than all that, don’t play dumb
It’s never too late to change all this stuff
Don't be afraid, stand up, say
That's enough
Throw those hands in the air
Get ‘em up
Show we've had it up to here

All this pissin’, dissin’, and bitchin’ got me on a mission
My ambition got you wishin’ you weren’t in the position
To be the personal ignition of my lyrical rage
I’m out the cage, blowing off the ever-lovin’ chain
Insane

To put it plain mein I’m Gone
I’m the bane of all existence from this day on
If you want more - that man I be
I’ll snatch your eyes out cha head before you get a chance to see
Who me?

To be the first pick, first string, first in, front line

But I refuse to dummy down and follow the herd
I’m gonna say what I believe and stand by my word
See, i’ve never known the taste of a silver spoon
Never took the blue pill, not to mention i’m immune

Can’t be controlled, won’t do what i’m told
I’m not a number, a name tag, or fit into a mold
As my story unfolds I will proudly stand
Forever unapologetically; I don’t give a damn
This is

Who I am (what I believe)
Who I am (with every breath I breathe)
Who I am (tried and true)

‘Cause you can talk all day long and never say a thing
We don’t even need the music for me to convey i’m not playing
I’ll write it out in braille, you can feel what i’m saying
That’s real

No facade, I will never be part
Of propped up pop propaganda, fake art
With no heart, no soul, I cannot be sold
I’ll be the bright light in a dark mine that’s black as coal

Whether i’m mocked, blocked or knocked still i’ll never stop
Like a rock, as consistent as hands on a clock
You can bet i’m gonna be locked, loaded, ready for a test
I don’t walk and talk, I do better than the best.

No vest on my chest, i’m not afraid to die
I’ve been blessed, so I live every minute i’m alive
And I take this vow; while i’m here above ground
Never will I ever back up or bow down

When death comes to get me i’ve got no regrets
I threw it all on the table when I placed my bet
Said it all, did it all, and i’d do it again just so

Avicii,"Liar, liar!
Why on earth won't tell the truth?
Liar, liar!
Can't nobody see the lie of you?

Follow you to dust
Leaving footprints on the clouds as we're walking home
Iron hearts all turn to rust
By tears and the days on a diamond street

Is this apocalypse?
Chasing shadows, living dreams that don't exist
Anymore...
We need to find a way...

Well, we are who we are, and we're all going under
When the past with the last and will last until under

Liar, liar!
Why on earth won't tell the truth?
Liar, liar!
Can't nobody see the lie of you?

Wall closing in your head
Counting heartbeats 'til the feeling's good and gone
On a dark path there to watch
A sad greed pouring rain over everything

You'll think it's apocalypse
With the whispers of the sand and the sun eclipsed
Forever more
We need to find a way...

Well, we are who we are, and we're all going under
When the past with the last and will last until under

Liar, liar!
Why on earth won't tell the truth?
Liar, liar!
Can't nobody see the lie of you?

They keep talking but I can't hear them, no
I just sit there and watch them come and go
There might be something underneath it all
But at least I'll find, we'll all find out in the end
But at least I'll find, we'll all find out in the end",Liar Liar,2013

Neon lights at the water, reflecting the city of I'm lost in
That's me right there on the corner, I one day would be leaving
For a dream that I didn't have, that I'd one day would believe in
Strange how the same place I ran from's
The same place I think of whenever the chance comes
It's inevitable cause wherever I go

I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm

I'm from a place where we never, openly show our emotions
We drown our sorrows in bottemless bottles and leave them to float in the ocean
I'm from a place where we never, seperate people from people
Some generalize, but in general I still believed that we are treated as equals
My father, my mother, my sister, my brother, my friends and my family's there
My hope and my money, my innocence in a sense, almost lost everything here
Rught where I was founded, is right where I'll be found dead
The streets of my backbone until I get back home

I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I that I've lost my backbone
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm

I'm not alone, I am the fire that burns not of the city, but out of the 'burbs
A river that's just dying of thirst, I am a reverend lying the church
A cracking in the pattern, a miracle waiting to happen
I promise that never was kept, one of those moments you'll never forget
I am that feeling inside the one we all know but can't really describe
I am the blood spill, but I'm in love still

Somewhere in Stockholm, but I'm not alone
Don't have to get by on my own, I'm finally home
Hemma I Stockholm

My heart's been broken and I'm down alone the road (but I know)
My dreams keep fading 'til I get old
Breathe for a minute breathe for a minute
I'll be okay",Sunset Jesus,2015
Avicii,"Alone searching for devotion, and the fading melody
So trying to cross an ocean, and I won't bare to leave
Locked up my, who know what I try to say
My heart all the time was stolen, begging for a treat

Some nights I talk to myself
I said the words that I can´t say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I said the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself
I said the words that I can´t say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I shout the words I never said when you were with me

I'm gone, love has got me open, love is insanity
So long words I left unspoken, I couldn't set them free
Won't sure the love [?] [?] going on the thing
My heart, I left it for broken, [?]

Some nights I talk to myself
I said the words that I can't say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I said the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself
I said the words that I can´t say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I said the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself

Avicii,"Ten more days under water
And I already know
I'll be fine
Ten more days 'till it's over
'Till the darkness goes
And I see the light

I'm torn between
Fulfilling my wildest dreams
To satisfy the beast inside of me
And I grounded love

That raises me high above
The grabbing hands of cowards
And of thieves
Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days 'till I'm awake
Ten more days 'till I don't have to fight

I don't need a future king
There ain't a prayer that I could sing
Ten more days and I'm gonna make it right
You see my conscience betrayed me
But baby I'm strong enough to take the tides
The bed it trembles beneath me

But wherever the road is rough
You know I'll rise
I'm torn between
Fulfilling my wildest dreams

To satisfy the beast inside of me
And I grounded love
That raises me high above
The grabbing hands of cowards
And of thieves
Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days 'till I'm awake
Ten more days 'till I don't have to fight

I've been a loner and I've won the reign

I'm a million miles smarter, but I ain't learnt a thing

Never been last, but I've never been first

Oh I may not be the best, but I'm far from the worst

But I've seen enough joy, I've had more than my share
I'm still not done, I'm only halfway there
I'm a million miles ahead of where I'm from
But I still have another million miles to go

Why I keep on searching for the city of gold
I'm gonna follow this yellow brick road
Thinking it maybe, it might lead me home
I'm a million miles farther and a long way from home
I know that there's a plan that goes way beyond mine
I got to step back just to see the design

are the troubles and suffering great
there too in the warm and beautiful land?
Does the dew descend as pearls on Mount Hermon?
Does it come down and fall like tears?
And how is the Jordan and its clear waters?
And how are the mountains, the hills?

And my brothers that are working
And planting with tears will take
The harvest with Joy

We saw the flags flying on the moon
And through the gates of delirium so fast
Believing in the light was a beginning
Only to believe in you
Only to believe in you

She give me love
When I was losing fast
I was awakened by the dream
She was the love for me
the first and last
And all that I remembered
Was the roundabout only to believe in you

iii Who Was The First
(Anderson Howe Wakeman Bruford)
Who was the first to show
The moon at night
Is never so far away
We are the first to define the
Languages of love

Who was the first to learn
The universal consciousness divine
We are the first to discover
This day in our time

And when the history of science
Re-writes itself eac",Quartet,1999
Avon Long,"Liza, Liza, skies are gray
But if you smile on me, all the clouds will roll away.
Liza, Liza, don't delay
Come keep me company, and the clouds will roll away

We could make a date with Parson Brown.
So, Liza, Liza name the day
When you'll belong to me, and the clouds will roll away",Liza (All the Clouds'll Rollaway),2000

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt His worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder beams a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, O night divine

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here came the wise men from the Orient land

The King of Kings lay in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend
He knows our need, to our weakness is no stranger

Behold your King
Before the lowly bend
Behold your King
Before Him bend

Truly he taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease

Let all within us praise His holy name

Feeding the baby she's all alone 
She turns on TV 
Guess who she sees 
Skater boy rockin' up MTV 
She calls up her friends 
They already know 
And they've all got
Tickets to see his show
She tags along 
Stands in the crowd 
Looks up at the man that she turned down

He was a skater boy 
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her 
Now he's a super star 
Slamming on his guitar 
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Sorry girl but you missed out 
Well tough luck that boy's mine now 
We are more than just good friends 
This is how the story ends 
Too bad that you couldn't see, 
See the man that boy could be
There is more that meets the eye 
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy 
And I'm just a girl 
Can I make it any more obvious 
We are in love 
Haven't you heard
How we rock each other's world

I'm with the skater boy

I'll be back stage after the show 
I'll be at the studio

Nobody said it was easy

Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart

Avril Lavigne,"No wonder why my insecurity is growing wide. 
I struggle to focus. 
People walk into my life and judge me by what they hear. 
No one has ever been there or ever gave the heart to care. 
Deeds of shame. 
The world around me, know my pain.
The world that I see. 
So maybe I am bound by fate. 
A problematic scarring induced by hate. 
To me the night captures a sudden glimpse.
I am all alone. 
But what is another night all alone, 
When you are spending every night on your own.
She's lost inside, lost inside.
She's lost inside, lost inside.

Sneaking in the neighbor's swimming pool
Yeah, he taught me how to break the rules

Hey, those days are long gone
And when I hear this song it takes me back

We were on top of the world
Back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun
All we needed was love
That's the way it's supposed to be

Stealing beers out of the trailer park
Flicking lighters just to fight the dark
My favorite place was sitting in his car
Seventeen
We laid a blanket on the roof top
That time I knew I wouldn't make him stop
The nights were cold but we kept 'em hot

We were going all night
Didn't care about anything

Hush hush, now

So go on, live your life
So go on, and say goodbye
So many questions
But I don't ask why, no
So go on, live your life
So go on, and say goodbye
So many questions, but I don't ask why
Maybe someday
But not tonight

Avril Lavigne,"Love that once hung on the wall
Used to mean something, but now it means nothing
The echoes are gone in the hall
But I still remember, the pain of December

Oh, there isn't one thing left you could say
I'm sorry it's too late

I'm breaking free from these memories
Gotta let it go, just let it go
I've said goodbye
Set it all on fire
Gotta let it go, just let it go

You came back to find I was gone
And that place is empty, like the hole that was left in me
Like we were nothing at all
It's not that you meant to me
Thought we were meant to be

A brand new life, down this road
Where it's right, you always know
So this time, I won't let go

There's only one thing left here to say
Love's never too late

I've broken free from these memories

Forever and today

Avvah,"Ich seh die Welt in schwarzweiß 
Alles blass wie vereist, ich muss farbenblind sein
Renn gegen Mauern aus Stein
Ich dreh mich um mich selbst und ich seh wie die Tage vergehen

Doch jedes mal wenn ich bei dir bin, ist alles ganz leicht
Du nimmst den Filter von meiner Welt
Du schiebst das Grau einfach weg und bringst die Farben zum mir zurück
Blau und gelb und grün und rot 
Du bist mein Kaleidoskop 

Und wenn der Regen kommt, auf meiner Welt
Schatten im All
Machst du sie wieder Wolkenlos
Du machst den Himmel bunt
Machst alles hell, alles strahlt
Blau und gelb und grün und rot 
Du bist mein Kaleidoskop

Wenn die Nacht mich entführt
Alle Wege blockiert und ins Nirgendwo führt 
Dann stehst du vor meiner Tür
Egal wo niemand sonst, der mich so gut kennt wie du

Depuis mes yeux te chantent ne me quitte pas de Brel
Je me rappelle on se parlait qu'avec des poèmes
On passé des nuit blanches a s'endetter chez SFR
On refaisait le monde avec le pinceau de notre utopie
On se racontait nos vie comme lors d'une thérapie
On revait d'une grande famille au bord de mer, d'une grande cérémonie après le OUI devant le maire
C'était nous contre le monde et ca quoi qu'il arrive
Pire quand mon épiderme ta rendue orpheline
On s'était promis de voyager sur le dos d'un éléphant traverser les océans pour s'échouer sur une ile

Dis moi à quoi sert mon bac +5?
A quoi sert d'être un homme honnete quand tu n'peux pas mettre a l'abri les gens que t'aime

Car les problèmes me font aimer la bouteille
Aide moi

Les années nous ont changé et la routine a volé nos promesses
Dans nos vies familiales, on bat de l'aile et on se crache
des nom d'oiseaux a force d'avoir des prises de bec
Malgré ca, je connais tes sentiments pour moi
Pourtant aujourd'hui on se parle qu'a travers nos avocats
On croyait que l'amour nous protégerait de tout
Mais la vie de couple ne résume pas qu'a I love you

That it was all just a dream
No a nightmare I can't breathe
Falling false hope I had become lost
Always felt like I was the one who was forgot
A little worn a little torn

Bright lights it's getting hard to breathe
Black dreams pull me from underneath
Why don't you save me, save me
Fake love you took the missing piece
Eyes shut forgetting what I believe
Why don't you save me, save me

It was never as simple as black and white
I feel like I lost myself in life

I never wanted to be this way

I can't change I can't change
The way I had left you all alone
I don't ever want to see you fall again
I'm not saying, I'm not saying
That I can make it all ok
I'm just wanting you to hear me say
I don't  ever want to see you fall

Never thought I'd break, never thought I'd be this way
I can say sorry but that'll never be enough
