Skull Dugrey,"Check this out playas
All y'all gangster niggas
Y'all motherfucking gangsta bitches out there (the dope game) 
I'm a let y'all know something (welcome to the dope game)
Something that'll never end, this shit is going on like fucking numbers
Black on black crime, nigga it go like this here
We live an eye for an eye

You kill me, I kill you, my partners kill your partners
And you dead ain't no love on my spot
Me and my partners pushing rocks
Got them 17 round glocks at your ass spitting like loogies
We packing heat, 32 round clips, my automatic uzi
But I look into the eyes and I stare, I see death
Goddamn thinking ""the fuck?"", it could be me
My little homie on the ground crying
I'm thinking I'm gone, Oh my lord
My little homie Tony's dying (ripped his heart out)
He never had a chance to see his life glow
And he never had a chance to see his wife bro
And his little kid is only 8
It ain't about me or you motherfucker 
You gone peep defeat off the tree  
Cause you die and you murder, how could you live on the streets
And you never hurt, another nigga with a glock G
I'm thinking about Tic-Toc Boom, there goes another one
Send him to the moon
Ain't no rocket ship bitch, it's the temple of doom
I mean the ghetto, cause it's wicked
Most niggas out there in the hood, trying to get a chicken
But never even seen a bird
They die for that cain and that weed and they water
And they to fucking high, to see the enemy
Niggas that pretend to be, fools don't come close to me
Your best friend will kill you
I'm from that 3rd Ward, Caliope Projects 
Where they peel your caps like bananas
Police trying to stand on them buildings with them radars and scanners
But they can't stop the murders 
That's happening in my hood motherfuckers
Cause everybody study capping in this
Everyday, all day niggas dying, mothers crying
But y'all niggas ain't realizing that the hood is murder
Find your ass in a 6 inch gurder
Cause niggas banging like Charlie Chan
You'd better pack a piece nigga 
And welcome to the never ending game

The never ending game, (the dope game) the never ending game
Will I die up in my sleep, or die on these streets
Cause the ghetto ain't no joke
Niggas in my hood everyday getting smoked
Welcome to the never ending game
Will I die up in my sleep or die on these streets

And the ghetto ain't no joke
Cause every motherfucking day another nigga gets smoked
And momma pray it ain't me
But I'm addicted to this dope game, addicted to this green cheese
I be making mail like the mailman
This is for my partners in the hood pushing massive cain (ice cream)
Through the hood of the projects
Its fiends walking up for bubble ups
You think I'm bout to reject
When a nigga get some money, I got them gats cocked nigga
I ain't living like no dummy
If I die, I ain't scared to die, but don't ask me why
Will I retire and give it up realize
That's this my only mission of money
But y'all niggas look at a nigga hustling like its funny
But I got to feed the family
Even though if that take me getting fucking scandalous G
And I have to hurt shit
Put a nigga in the dirt, mean putting in work
Lay him down, and punch in your time card
Cause you never know when your ass bout to go meet the Lord
So I live ruthless, reckless, and rangeless (dangerous)
Don't give a fuck, my clique is ready to hang shit
Off the rack, ain't no trap
Just a bunch of motherfuckers walking with gats
Through the projects and walky-talkies
Jacking shit motherfucker ungh, that's why they bark
Like dogs, watch a nigga hard
And I be slanging dope like I'm getting paid like Lou Rollins
And the white folks can't stop this
And the Taz can't stop this nigga, cause I'm in the hood slanging rocks
Getting paid cause I'm major
And if I die fucking retire my shoes and hang up my pager
And give 4 G's to my sons and kill my enemies
Y'all can't stop a nigga please, even if I'm dead G
And when I go out, I'm going out with a bang
So fuck what you heard and welcome to the never ending game",Never Ending Game,2013
Skull Dugrey,"-This goes out to my best friend
-My partner
-The only person I can trust in this world
-This for you mom

Momma, this is one thing I still can't realize
How you been so strong when my brother died
You done kept the family together tight
Thinkin' about how we gone get through this sorrow night
This is crazy, I can't sleep nope
Even though i got revenge written across my throat
Five kids and you done lost one
Never had a daddy, but put it on your oldest son
Ain't that a be	, leave me to watch the family
To make the bills get paid, you got to live scandalous G
Cause the ghetto got me pressured
Will I die sellin' dope, or would I sell a million records
Oh momma won't you feel me
Even though Ms. ?? said somebody tried to kill P
And you know your boy's sellin' dope
But all you say is watch yo back
Cause you don't want to see me go

Chorus: (Repeat 2X)

		Momma I don't want to see you cry
		No more tears
		Cause I'm deep in the game
		Sellin much cocaine

Momma how you be so strong
Even tough the ATF, done kicked down your home
And ran right through and got me
But you still came to see me
And said that you love me
And I know that you real though
Cause when I got out, you's the first one at the door
Knowing that your boy turned into a man
But you done tripped cause I still understand
That I'm trying to make some money
And if I die in this game, I guess that won't be funny
But you still on my side cause you a soldier
You the only friend I got and ma I told ya
One day I'ma change G
Even though the ghetto's crazy, think about your baby
If I make it out this dope game
I know that life won't be the same, momma I gone make a change

Cause we ain't takin no shorts, in the 9 scrilla
Say what you want fool I guess I'm a drug dealer 
>From the southside of Richmond, California
Where niggas run through with gats all up on ya
You better break North or South, before we take you out
Ain't no love in this motherfuckin' crackhouse 
Lay down on the floor bitch break me off
Before you meet my little partner Mr.Sawed-off

Drop the top on the Regal, shot a desert eagle
Candy cane switches that's how us G's roll
Hoo-ridin' to the lizzay
Seen Tina from the town laid her that's a dizzay
The side show was jumpin' (bumpin')
Oozin bikershorts and daisy dukes outside pumpin'
And niggas from Richmond rollin' hella deep
My little homies from Oakland got chased by the police
And these hoes want to kick it 
I met a bitch from Frisco gave me her number on a traffic ticket
And tonight I'ma page her
My niggas talkin shit bout these hoes fade ya
When your ballin they jealous they hatin'
I guess they mad cause a nigga own gold daytons
And they bitches started lookin at me
Niggas I'm trigger happy, fuck it and my ass nappy
Get more hoes than freak show 
Ask your bitch, nigga she know
But ya'll can't fade us
Cause No Limit niggas come harder than the Raiders
I'll break you off a little left and feel it chump 
What you see motherfucker is what you saw
Cause ain't no stoppin' No Limit
TRU and Master P it's only the beginning 
And we in it to win it like a roitweiler
I won't stop fool I already made a million dollars
And I'm up and outtie on a comeback
Tryin' to get a fuckin' million in big stacks

Say wassup to all y'all players out there

Things ain't what they used to be.  
Things ain't what they used to be.

[Verse 1: Master P]
I remember back in the days it wasn't like that
Everybody knew everybody, now days it ain't like that
We used to stand on the corners and drink brew 
Now days you gotta duck when they drive through
Cause they blastin', life is like plastic
But who would be the next egg took out the easter basket
Is it you, me, or her or she or he? 
who would live to see the long age of 23? 
Cause once you dead and gone who gives a damn
On your tombstone would read Rest In Peace Sam  
But in the ghetto you cooked 'till you dead 
Ain't no love when you dead and gone cause you red 
Like roaches for the gutter, peanut butter
your life in the gutter , fool cause you fluttered 
With this game that I spit, shoot out, don't quit 
Now you a victim of society another statistic
I heard the gunshots rain from the middle of the street 
The gun-smoke cleared three people on the concrete
I mean it's crazy, slippin' on daisies
Time to call it quits, they done put a bullet in a baby

[Chorus: Master P and Mo. be Dick]
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be

[Verse 2: Master P]
Watch you back in the ghetto black 
Open the box, Mom's ain't nothing to eat 
Back in the day, I thought we was a family
My little brother on the street corner selling crack 
Only 15 used to be a quarterback
I wish the law would rehabilitate my auntie 
I came home try to visit that girl tried to do me
Started tweakin' said that she needed crack
Stole my grandma's rent money out her purse black
I stay Tru 2 Da Game you devils' can't see me 
I put that on my mom, I put that on my gold teeth   
My homies bangin' ,no respect for the American flag
But they kill over that blue and red rag

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Master P]
I remember back in the day smoking weed was the everyday drug
Now days they shoot heroin and sell blood 
Back in the day catchin' the clamps was gettin' us shot 
Now days catch the AIDS and your time will stop
My lil' homies doin' time, 25 with a L
A victim of the system, I'd rather die and go to hell 
I try to be legit and start my own company
Till these sucker want to bump into P
They point the finger at me for tellin' another what to do
How could another person tell you what to do
I could tell you to rob or steal or kill 
that's like pointin' the finger at Jack or Jill
For being the first person on this little earth
Is like askin' Mary why she had to give birth
And who would be the next victim to lose his life 
And who would be the next one to make a life
But when you make a life you gotta learn to teach your kid
So one day they can grow up and make it big
But all this gangbangin' and turf wars gotta cease
Cause y'all know we livin' in the last days G

And just like my boy said
Yo ass got plucked

Gotta show them I ain't fakin'

I started counting my dope
Everything was cool black
Headed to the front
Got them fiends walkin' in the back
I ain't even trippin'
Ain't no time to serve these fiends
I got 40 g's and two fuckin' keys
Headed to the bienz to put the fuckin' cash up
Jumped on the freeway nigga fuckin' dashed bro
Think I see the rollers behind me through the rear-view

But I ain't even trippin' 'cause I ran through clear view
Stopped at Egg-Zone tried to get some gas
That's when I see two robbers on my ass
Played it all cold
Told be	 to get that pistol
Jumped back in the bienz shoulda seen they head whistle
I went back to the house and my homie want some flour
I ain't Scarface but got the money and the power
They call me Nino Brown
Or fuckin' Frank Nitty

But if you come up short
There's gonna be some shit up in my city

Y'all better talk some senses in 'em
Cause new orleans niggas don't yap where I'm from
Bust backs with a gun, up in the club, get to clapping and swung
And my bullets don't hum, they burn
And it ain't no aftermath if you catch a nigga ak'n bad

Building buildings

For the rest of his life he will see us kicking him down

Of somebody's place we busted up

So I wonder why it turns me on?

Sky,"I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

(Don't go sharing your devotion)

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little smalltalk, a smile and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think I was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion

Puttin' all my effort into you
My heart is bare

You know exactly what you're doing to me
That's okay 'cause I'm not playin' any more

[Chorus]
I see what you're tryin' to hide
Didn't take me long to realize
You can't fool me with your disguise
I can see right through your lyin' eyes
Take your shot, push me around
You're never gonna take me down
So get outta my face with your masquerade

Since I've moved on
Things are goin' every way but wrong
It's a brighter day (whisper) across the sky
A new life, new friends
It's got me wonderin' where I've been
I was in a haze
I know you're still bearin' down on me
That's okay 'cause I'm not runnin' any more

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

I met her on a ship just west of eyeball bay
We ate fish and we listened to some old time rock n' roll

She's some kinda big shot

Great kids, nice home and a brand new Chevrolet

Sky Sailing,"This old mountain side
Where we used to reside
Is slowly recalling
The things we discovered inside

Oh the crystal caves

We shed both our jackets
And I hammered brackets
From old metal chairs
To the walls, a crude set of stairs

To lead us down

And you tied a rope
To the steepening slope
A Jerry rigged harness
So we could descend in the dark

But the tide came in

And we found ourselves in the sea
Deep under water
We both found that we could still breathe
So we spent the day submerged

And we swam the evening away

The water was clear
Like the pure atmosphere
As we kicked and fluttered
Through caverns all cluttered with age

In the afterglow

We swim hand and hand
Over white satin sand
And you left a ribbon
To honor the pale gibbon moon

But that was years ago

And we never came up for air
Down there
We can go anywhere

The old world was dying
While we took our flying
Like peregrine falcons
Beneath the transparent blue waves

Far below the surf

And we spent the hours
With submarine flowers
I knew I'd remember
That day in November
As we
Felt alive again

'Cause we found ourselves in the sea
Deep underwater
We both found that we could still breathe
So we spent the day submerged
And we swam the evening away
We swam the evening away",Explorers,2010

Floating softly in the sky
Among our dreams that pay goodbye

Moving through transparent space,
Drifting through the stratosphere
And onward 'till they disappear

Below the misty mountain clouds
There's a lovely silver bay
Where sunset sailors often hideaway

Speedboat driver on the dock
Sailplane pilot in the blue take me up there with you
The world looks brighter from this high altitude

I was walking through the trees (Sailboats wish they were stars)
And I was swimming through the seas (Cause they don't know who they are)
I was falling through the air
When it hit me right there
My eyes are tired; I don't even care

An airplane carried me to bed,
Where I slept above the coast
And dreamt I had become a ghost

I sail above the frozen peaks,
Deep in cold cathedral caves
Across the hills and far beyond the waves

Take the car on the run
Fly the jet to the sun
And bring the spacecraft
'n soon while I play chess with the moon
I feel like sleeping through this cold afternoon

Once in 1964 (Sailboats wish they were stars)
An actress ran on the shore (Cause they don't know who they are)

And though you'll never return,
I love you Audrey Hepburn
Sometimes I can see your face in the crowd

I stare at them but they won't go!

Why failure is the fashion every time I come to town.

",Just What Nobody Wanted,1995
Skyclad,"[Chorus ""Panis Angelicus"" by Cesar Franck]

Unto those who have enough you give more free of charge,
What becomes of those with nothing?
You stand back and let them starve.
Well is your conscience clear safe in your Land of Plenty?
We wait outside your walls - our pockets and our bellies empty.

""Panis angelicus - fit panis hominum,
Dat panis Caelicus - figuris terminum.
O res mirabilis - man ducat dominum,
Dat panis caelicus - figuris terminum.""

A systemized autocracy of authorized burocracy
Seems to have our people by the throats,
It's time to make your choices -
Stand up and use your voices,
While you've still legal rights and votes.

Let the wishes of the few outweigh the needs of many -
In this land where money talks we have little chance if any.
Bring the nation back to basics -
Lionize Dickensian dreams,
Hide a heart that's grey and cold behind an image squeaky-clean.

We're fighting to be free - driven by necessity,
She is the mother of invention.
God bless the working men -
Slaves three score years and ten,
Who never beg for divine intervention.

""Panis angelicus - fit panis hominum,
Dat panis Caelicus - figuris terminum.
O res mirabilis - man ducat dominum,
Dat panis caelicus - figuris terminum.""

So run for your lives when the shrapnel's spinning.

Someone else's problem - you're sitting on a landmine.
When will we see reason? Sometimes I think we'll never
Learn that children have the right to laugh - and dying is forever

All I hear are peace talks and battle cries.

No time for laughter - we're too busy dying,
In this 'Devil's Playground' - bullets are flying.

There's another star in heaven - and footprints on the moon
So ignore the reign of terror - the bloody red monsoon.
Neighbour fighting neighbour - oh see how quick they run
To tear down the white flag and pick up the gun.

Peace talks and battle cries - apathy can kill
Put a price on human life - pay 'the butcher's bill'.
Everybody's losing - nobody's winning,
Run for your lives when the shrapnel's spinning.

For a child in an unmarked grave.
Take my hand in the hour of darkness -
While there's someone left to save.

Born into a battlfield - war's all they've ever known.
Neighbour loving neighbour - will that day ever come
When we shake hands in friendship and survey the damage done.

A place where the city lights don't shine.

Why don't you come up here with me?
Let Aphrodite take you by the hand,
And we can tell the future how it should be
When we set sail for Alexander's land.

A stranger in the garden 'neath a full moon in the sky,
This is the Old God's country -
You can bring me here to die.
It's a thinking mans Valhalla -
A long weekend in paradise,
Package tour to Eden -
My spirit yearns for freedom.

So leave your troubles far behind you -
Take care not to pack them in your case.
Your jaded spirits lifted - your body born anew,
The minute golden sunlight hits your face.
I'll fly as high as any eagle -
Watch me now I soar above the sand.
I get the strangest sense of deja vu
When I set foot on Alexander's land.

This is the Old God's country -
You can bring me here to die.
It's a thinking mans Valhalla -

Strangely intangible - somewhere between,
Frankly absurd and naively serene.

Lady Luck came along, took my dreams away,
And the tears hurt more than a broken nose -
I bled from the thorns of a barbed-wire rose.

I know that I'm supposed to pray
Thanking God for each new day.
Would it disturb his master plan
To one day be a happy man?

I've tried to be positive, tried to be nice.
I've turned the other cheek so I'd get hurt twice.

My next birthday will, I fear
Be much the same as every year.
Inside the wrapping there
Are a few more wrinkles and a little less hair.

Another Autumn leaf is turning,
One more soul for candle-burning.
Hid beneath the sham and glitter
I taste a cake that's stale and bitter.

On my Christmas card last year it said:
""So sorry, Santa Claus is dead.
Crawl into the oven when you've had enough
'cause it keeps sitting here quietly waiting to be stuffed.""

What a festive way to go
Here beneath the mistletoe,
With open eyes and an open wrist
To vanish from your Christmas list.

I've tried to be positive, tried to be nice.
I've turned the other cheek so I'd get hurt twice.

Meanwhile back on British loam,
Irish driven from their homes.
Persecuted Welsh and Scot,

Bound unto the plough and yoke,
they broke the backs of honest folk.
Built a gentlemen's Jerusalem.

Insidious, incestuous love ?
(A feeling more akin to hate)
Vying constantly for power
And changing sides with every hour,
In homes built with machine-gun-towers,
(the sights trained on the garden-gate).
Seems we made our greatest error when we named it at the start
For though we called it ""Human Nature,"" it was Cancer of the heart

To show compassion makes you weak
So don't dare turn the other cheek,
Try hard to hide the fear you feel

I watch your pride before the fall
And realise I don t belong at all.

We try to leave the past behind us
Racing onwards, blind and mindless
Now the milk of human kindness won't serve for one cup of tea
We sate the hunger, quench the thirst
Then lock our doors, expect the worst
Be sure and always do to others first what they could do to thee!

Six sided is this box I've made you'll dance on it when I am gone.
Seven times I've wondered whether Heaven's truly waiting there,
I smoke another eight ball to convince myself I couldn't care.

Down the street at Number Ten they're talking long and loud.
Life's a game of two halves I'm not on the team of winners,
Each time I set the table seems that Judas comes to dinner.

Thirteen black cats cross my path ignoring all the others,
There is no bride waiting for me I'm not one of seven brothers.

Is your silver hair and my flight

Little black boys dancing

On the bottoms of their shoes

with this girl that I hate
He didn't have to tell
why last night he was late
I can't believe what you tell me
Your lies have come undone
Now I'm living on the run
looking out for number one

I took a ride to the city
Had to get out of this place
I just can't stand the pity
When the tears fall down my face
I used to think it was over
But its only just begun
Now I'm living on the run
looking out for number one

One day you'll see me
but only when your dreaming
One day you'll say I was the one

I hitched a ride on a Greyhound
stashed away on a train
Bought a ticket for the subway
Playing guitar in the rain
I want to follow the rivers
to an island in the sun
Now I'm living on the run
looking out for number One

day you'll see me
but only when your dreaming
One day you'll say I was the one

Late at night start to fight
I just might think about him
Right now I'm feeling fine
I'm better off without him ya!

And when they told her she's delerious
She didn't care- she's just oblivious
She likes to make everyone curious

Coal instead of candy
In my stocking this year

So why doesn't Santa like me?

Like me

When I took it for show and tell at school
And my brother has recovered
From the time he took the remote control

There better be my name
Or else my Christmas this year
Just won't be the same

And out poured all the goodies

Can we, hey, hey, work it out?

Screw your head back on cause here comes your mother
With her curlers made of dynamite she's throwing them at us tonight

Got a bowling ball on a tablespoon
A striker, striking you out, drop it on your head!
Kill you a hundred different ways but you're still not dead

Some wanna sleep
And some wanna rise
Some wait their whole life to hide
I'm goin' go out like Bonnie & Clyde
Cause I'm a wild one
and I don't give a damn, no
I made a bet with myself
I'm gonna make it
Something that I want, I'm gonna take it
Small town mold, I'm gonna break it
And get out of here
And make my dreams come true
Na na na na na
Na na na na na

There are some things you're gonna miss
Growing up in a small town like this
Big city, big problems
But it's me and you boy against the world now
I met a man named hate
I met a lady named malice
We met on the avenue and not in a palace
And everyone we meet is so damn ruthless
So boy don't ever leave me

Lost kids in a lost world livin'

Forging through the barrier to a
New dimension

Afraid to fall asleep and to dream evil acts
To be betrayed again and again in
Grey-scale beyond the dreamers labyrinth

Turn around where you lie under
Supervision of emptiness
Perspiring and heavily breathing
Through screams inside

Hunted by your eternal enemies with the
Dawn as your heaven, your savior
All you fear is summarized into one nights
Torment of mental terror

I close your eyes, I make you disappear
Forlorn memories, At the border to insanity
I close your eyes

You savage fantasy
Madness and sick surroundings create

Another wants a date right now
For some double talk and cigarettes

Go down to the hotel and find me some action
They say that's where it happens
They say that's where it's at
But when I paid the doorman I knew I'd smelt a rat
The band playing in the corner may be Clapton, Beck or Jimi
No one seemed to care much someone said it sounded tinny
Well so much for the good time then the rat began to smell
I knew I'd hit the middle of Hotel Hell

I headed for the men's room feeling like a long lost pup
But it was overcrowded with guys all throwing up
So I crossed my legs and went back to the bar

So much for my Chevy I shoulda brought my gun

I went back inside to get my paycheck cashed

How about a chat
Like to read some poetry or maybe paint my flat
She said I like your body but gee I hate your face
When it gets dark enough come over to my place
So much for the good time see you later Jezabel
Show me to the door I gotta leave this Hotel Hell

I saw Frankenstein, Gargantua and Eskimo Hell
Down at this place they call Hotel Hell
Someone stole my trousers and tore off my lapel
At this place out in the suburbs called Hotel Hell

When Thursday comes around you know I'm staying home
Yes I've learnt my lesson there's no way I'm gonna roam
From the room above the laundromat on the dirty side of town
When the fridge is always full and the beers not watered down
Where they never lock their cars or punch each other heads
Spike your drinks with mandies or try to sell you reds
Where Clapton, Beck and Jimi are jamming in the sun
And the girls are very friendly I think I'll get me one
You know I've had a good time drinking my moselle

I feel like a good time that's never been had
I feel a bit fragile
I feel a bit low
Like I learned the right lines
But I'm on the wrong show

I'm livin' in the 70's
I feel like I lost my keys
Got the right day but I got the wrong week
And I get paid for just bein' a freak

I feel a little insane
I feel a bit dazed
My legs are shrinkin'
And the roof's been raised
I feel a little mixed up
I feel a little queer
I feel like a barman that can't drink a beer",Living in the 70's,1998
Skyhooks,"Josie lives in a two room flat
Just across from the elevator door
She spends her days just gettin' high
Up on the sixteenth floor
She's working nights but she'd rather not say
Just what she does to collect her pay
Not everything is heaven sent
It is what it is and it pays the rent
Some dreams were never meant in Powdertown

Frankie looks like a nice young cop
But he's got an old cops face
He believed in truth and justice
Till they took him off the case
Now he's walkin' the beat on the wrong side of town
Bustin' drunks and shakin' them down
Don't ask him who he's working for
All he knows is the laws the law
And it'll be like this for evermore in Powdertown

The  thunder rolls and the rain pours down
But it can't wash away the dirt
It can't wash away the memories
That make this old town hurt
Years go by Everyone gets older
The steel begins to rust
Life goes on and the lights go out
And dreams they turn to dust

Stevie says he's a business man
But that's no business of yours
He buys and sells commodities
That come from distant shores
Briefcase full of unmarked bills
Come get your love get your thrills
He's the man who sells you fun
Hides his face but he shows his gun
Some people never see the sun in Powdertown

So if you're driving through one day
And see that exit sign
You might slow down take a look
Risk a parking fine
But if you're smart you'll pass on by
Get where you're goin' kiss this place goodbye
Not everything is heaven sent
It is what it is and it pays the rent
Some dreams were never meant like Powdertown",Powdertown,1998
Skyhooks,"He gets his hair cut at Marini's
And he drives a Lamborghini
The finest thing that ever walked this earth
His flat is just divine
He buys yogurt and buys wine
A million dollars is what he's worth

[Chorus]
Well, he's a village playboy
Toorak Cowboy, yes, he is
Well, he's a village playboy
Toorak Cowboy, yes, he is

He dyes all his gray ends
And he's got lots of gay friends
He is twenty-nine if he's a day
And he wears tinted glasses
And his girls have got tight arses
And if he's camp he wouldn't like to say

[Chorus]

He'll be at the supper show on Friday night
Goes once a month just to make it look right
At interval he'll say the movie's a drag
As he gets a cigarette from his leather shoulder bag

[Chorus]

Well, he bought his first dope outside the South Yarra Arms
A whole matchbox full in his hot little palms
Nineteen Sixty-Eight and the scene was cool
And all of his friends knew that he wasn't a fool

He knows the antique dealers
And all those other stealers
I'll be glad when he goes overseas
My friends, he don't do nothin'
He just ain't got no stuffin'
He's just another social disease

Well, he's a village playboy
Toorak Cowboy, yes, he is",Toorak Cowboy,1998
Skyhooks,"Sometimes when I'm driving
Driving all night long
My mind gets round to thinking
About the place that I belong
I gotta make it to the river
And see the water shining bright

In the Westgate light
In the Westgate light

The steelyards and the factories
Standing in the rain
The empty streets and houses
This place will never change
When I get off that freeway
I know I'm gonna feel alright

In the Westgate light
In the Westgate light
In the Westgate light
In the Westgate light

When I look out on this city
From way up on that bridge
I see a million diamonds shining in the night
There's a million people out there
Who don't even know my name
But I know that's where my friends are
So I love 'em just the same

I know that she'll be waiting
For me to come around
We'll listen to those foghorns moan
When I shut this motor down
We'll stand out on the balcony
And hold each other tight

Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy

Another day another Dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math I'm gone
What am I 'posed to do when the club lights come on
It's easy to be Puff, but its harder to be Sean
What if the twins ask me why I ain't marry their mom (why, damn!)
How do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown
Shit! But I ain't finished growing

Another day another dawn

""A House is Not A Home"", I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones are gone (no)
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'
Baby we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love
But we've been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your own
Pick up your phone, come on

""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", I love that song
Whenever it comes on it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
'Til we back cruising through Harlem, these old blocks
Is what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away than embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles

I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back

When everyone was telling you don't sign me
Everyone at the fucking label, lets tell the truth
You risked your career for me
I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm crying in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe its my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more

Went through friends, some of them I put on
But they just left, they said they was riding to the death
But where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends
All I need is him
Fucking backstabbers
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, fagots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass
Little crack a jack beat making wack ass backwards producers,
I'm back bastards

How much money does it take to really make a full clip
Nine eleven building seven did they really pull it?
Uh, and a bunch of other cover ups
Your child's future was the first to go with budget cuts
If you think that hurts then, wait here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
You get it then they move you so you never keeping up enough
If you turn on TV all you see's a bunch of ""what the fucks""

I hit the studio at 16, stupid ill

This is my own honest view of who I am behind this, music
Ryan the whole bottle of patron Connoisseur
At a point in time I thought I blew it, doing crime
I would've washed a pill down with a shot of my own spinal fluid
And my momma knew it, she saw especially right through it
That I wasn't protected because peer pressure be like (do it)
But I couldn't fight through it, the beef started

Feel like I knocked the 8 ball in

I'm reaching for my nine
If I point it at myself will it help to quiet the demons screaming in my mind?
And if I go, to the other side
Just tell my mother it was her prayers that kept her young'un thugging son alive
Plus my daughters and my butterfly, tell my son that I, love him
Tell my nieces and nephews their uncle tried
To take this music to the fucking peak
But I'm still a drug dealer as we fucking speak, that's fucking weak

Behind the tours and fanfare, hospitals and cat scans
Shoulder, when they call him bipolar, happiest mad man
Don't know my story, my struggle, the demons that I combat
Or how I'm starin' at them waiting for eye contact, beyond that
I got a soul mate that's naive, so the thought of me is prison to her
Baby momma that's crazy and a ten year old that listen's to her
My fam and friends think I'm the bank
And the way they keep coming back you think I'd got thanked
To you it's a dream, to me it's labor, these aren't monsters, these my neighbors
And we watch each others back, I guess its favor for a favor

Shoot me with your lovin' but me feelin' no pain

If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him

People ever give a shit but I had to say
It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm living
Put a dick in your rear end and guess what
Every time you mention a lyric, I thank you for it

For drawing more attention toward it
'Cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude
Thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battle for it, mad awards, act paranoid

You think it's a joke til you're bullet riddled

Just to go out watch Batman

With my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther
So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't of been a parent I'll never grow up
So to hell with your parents, and motherfucking father time
And it ain't never gonna stop.

A pessimist who transforms you to Optimus in his prime,
So even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive
Throw all my half empty glass in a cup, now my cup is runneth over
And I'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster

I'm goin' back to what got me here, yeah cocky, and can't not be, rude off
So fear not my dear, and dry up your teardrops I'm here
White America's mirror, so I feel awkward and weird,
You stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too
You shouldn't be as shocked, because everybody knows

Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go
""Oh, everyone knows""
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows",***Hole,2013
Skylar Grey,"Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'
But don't think I ever stopped
To think that I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
It was like I blinked—sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous
‘Cause I was getting sick of this feelin'
Like I am always under attack, man
I could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'
Women dishin' but really thinking 
""If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls 
Like this I would kill him.""

Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many people ever give a shit 
What I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawing more attention toward it
‘Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, and I just zoned out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde
It's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out
‘Cause I was tryin' to leave, no doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history

Quit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he round about
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, but Goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhanding a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck is all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my belt—word to Pacquiao
Momma said there ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if the insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a Goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto before they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado
So get lost, Waldo! My soul's escapin'
Through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole, and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm taking no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac
In fact there they go tryin' to dip out the back-door, retreatin'

Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed ""ICP in this bitch!
How do fuckin' magnets work?""
‘Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
‘Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet
‘Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind
Like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind

But chopper going off in the hood man
Like Afghanistan or the Gaza strip somewhere man
Yeah, we hear it so much we probably numb to it by now
After all, it’s the American way right?

Home of the brave and free (It’s America)
Free just to murder me (land of the handgun)
Land of the beautiful (home of the shotgun)
Cursed by the hate we throw (You’re dead if you ain’t got one)
Is this the new national anthem? (It was like this before I got here baby, I ain’t do it)
Is this the new national anthem? (I ain’t start it, I’m just a part of it)

Turn it! Aite

You say this the home of the brave I guess
I say this the home of the K’s and the vets
All alone with the J’s smoking yay cause he stressed
On chrome with a Tek taught to spray for respect
I learned from the best used to stay in the “jects”
Bought work from the vets burning rubber in the vets
This as good as it gets used to play with the rats
Then I got older and learned stay away from the rats
God blessed this nigga, to hustle up and make eight figures
Turned from a goon to a great young nigga
No complaining just doing what it take young nigga
I was raised in a decade of hate young nigga
Always dodging polices because they hate young niggas
And we hate them too, 38 in him shoe
All the changes the system will take him through
He ain’t a killer but he will if you make him do it
Homicide he’ll ride, they’ll put him on trial
Let him have a life sentence then do it with a smile
And he only 19, he ain’t even had a child
As a child, told his mama he’ll be gone for a while
And she cried, still they just put him inside
Now she all on her own because her other son died
Listen to the politician as he lied and he lied
He a snake in a suit, trying to hide in disguise

Home of the brave and free (well damn officer what did I do?)
Free just to murder me (Naw hold up man don’t shoot, I live over there)
Land of the beautiful (ay, ay man what you doin)
Cursed by the hate we throw (you trippin' dawg)
Is this the new national anthem (how many times has that ever happened to you, what the fuck do you know about being a black man in America?)
Is this the new national anthem (And you wonder why we walk around with straps)

Fuck is you sayin' (Who you gon' talk?)

For the stars and the stripes prison bars and the pipe
Young nigga rolling weed in a cigar he can light
Bang red either blue selling hard and the white
Live by the gun, never run from a fight
Trayvon in a hoodie, walking through the neighborhood he
Didn’t do shit to buddy, he didn’t have to die did he?
I guess it’s because his dad was a judge in the city
They didn’t want him in the pen with the thugs that could get him
A jury of his peers said all was forgiven
But touch one of mine, right or wrong, I’ma kill them
Fill them with the lead like they put in Martin Luther King’s head
Like they killed Malcolm X, Edgar Hoover did that
You can catch me in the hood where they shooting niggas at
They don’t know if Neighborhood or the Hoovers did that
Whether Piru or VL's or GDs wit me we
Down to uprise from the OG’s to peewees

Home of the brave and free (Don’t get it fucked up)
Free just to murder me (If you ain’t found something you’re willing to die for, you ain’t fit to live)
Land of the beautiful (To get something you’ve never had, you must be willing to do something you’ve never done)
Cursed by the hate we throw (I’ma die by mine)
Is this the new national anthem (America, you created a monster that refused to beat noise, the ? Is up)
Is this the new national anthem (yeah we do evolution, ? Stupid shit)

Hell is what is you chaning' dawg
What is you doin'

Let me ask you something
If the kids are the future
Tell me why you can get more for being C.O.
Than you can for being a teacher.
Tell me why it means more to the government
To pay the people who got to watch over the prisoners
More than the people who got to keep the children from becoming prisoners.
That make sense?
Tell me why 9 ounces of crack will get you more time than a rape right now
Tell me why them crazy white boys can tote a gun but I can’t right now
Yea I had felonies, I done did dirt in the streets
But I ain’t ever gave it to anybody that didn’t deserve it, you know what I mean?
I ain’t ever ran in no public place with no pistol
Shooting no innocent people. I ain’t never ran in no school killing no kids
Man this is the result of you refusing to deal with the issues at hand
We are a product of the environment you placed us in
We ain't do it, we just lived through it

Home of the brave and free (message to my people)
Free just to murder me (stop waiting on folk to help you, help yourself, it starts with you)
Land of the beautiful (get yourself out, reach back, get somebody else out)
Cursed by the hate we throw
Is this the new national anthem (and that’s the way we’re going to get ahead)
(Sittin' around waiting on government to do something for us ain't never gonna happen partner they don’t give a fuck about us)

Feel like I've been asleepin' alone and lovin' this angel
Entangled between a dream and a coma
Walkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner
Then wake up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona
Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them
Then they pack up and leave and then you bitch about how you miss 'em
You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel

'Round and 'round we roll, where it stops, baby nobody knows
Some people go crazy and they lose control
Some people jump off, some people won't let go

I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony

A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

Been chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)

I got a new attitude and a lease on life
And some peace of mind
Seek and I find I can sleep when I die
Wanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride
And shit I'm straight
I'm on my wave, I'm on my wave
Get out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?
I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave
And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name
So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?
Did I look out for the people or did I do it all for fame?
Legend, it's exodus searching for euphoria
Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us
Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors
My mama told me never bow your head, woo!

I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again
I was born for this, born for this
It's who I am, how could I forget?
I made it through the darkest part of the night
And now I see the sunrise
Now I feel glorious, glorious
I feel glorious, glorious

I'm feeling glorious
The crib looking Victorian (oh yes it is)
You know that we been going in (been going in)
Since we hopped out that Delorean (Delorean, yeah we win)

En garde, things are just things
They don't make you who you are
Can't pack up a U-Haul and take it with you when you're gone
We posted on the porch, my family's glasses to the stars
My grandma smiling down on me like woo, that boy got bars
Okay, okay, yes I do
I said amen and hallelujah, let me testify too
Another morning, a morning, don't let self get in my way
I got my breath, I got my faith and I remember why I came

I feel glorious, glorious
Got a chance to start again

Skylar Grey,"I'm stumbling, I can’t see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again

Now I’m the one thing, you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot to hell, I'm falling helplessly
I'm embarrased, I don’t want no one else to see
'Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, definitely doesn’t help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
But makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms, I’m wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay though
'Cause I know she loves me—my friends, what do they know?

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

In my moments of weakness
I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war, when she
Gets goin' she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
Me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something about her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain, I'm drowning

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her hell
But it annoys her to see me get the strength to say, ""Screw her!""
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
And this time this piece of shit's running through her
I can see the light, now I'm running to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it!
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she doused the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief

Took an hour just to get myself together
I felt violently meek, but my silence would speak

Made a few good friends and lost a couple dozen
I felt glued to the wall, and in spite of it all

I kept on sinning, but I felt like a saint

Still rings in midnight silence,   in her ears

Let me hold her for a time
But if allowed just oe possession
I would pick her from the garden,  to be mine

Be careful how you touch her,  for she'ss awaken
And sleep's the only freedom that she knows

Got the time, got a chance, gonna make it
Got my hands on your heart, gonna take it

Can't stop the hurt inside

I don't know what we're fighting for
When we treat each other, baby
Like an act of war
I could tell a million lies
And it would come as no surprise
When the truth is like a stranger
Hits you right between the eyes

There's a time and a place and a reason
And I know I got a love to believe in
All I know
Got to win this time

It goes without sayn, sprayn the niggas that change clothes
Use the key word with one of my main hoes
Then I had to dumb her and grind it all summer
Your front run has turned hand bumpers?
My gun's slumkin', and leave you in the slum dunkin'
My understanding is zero, tryna play a hero?
I point a Desert Eagle at yo ego
That's just me tho
Squeeze the hammer when I see a vandal
And beat enamel off his teeth with the heater handle
Fuck around and violate the squad Imma buck 'em down
Who got the muscle now?

All in together now, it's whatever now
John threes and low nit sweaters now
The old league is ours like forever now
Filthy forty and ninety if you let us now

I'm all in money, so this isn't comin' down
They talk, hair's funny, I'm listening for now
And the all head hungry descend if they want a round
Now do believe I'm true indeed, the 2 to 3
Shovel's worth and I'm butter's worth on a shootin' spree
Sharp shooters, part shooters, move the seas, get it?
Shovel's worth, part the seas
Jesus, are we even aimed at the same dot?
Thrown for the great, I'll cook you a straight swap
Man down, cootoes, you know, you stand up with me
You standin' next to a Pharrell like a Hugo
For this new wave, this all swingin' for mine
I was probably hit yo mom's, impended your rhymes
I can't lie, if you see me in and outta yo place
I should have stuck with my gut and let it rot on her face

I'm touring all the time, what the fuck do he know?!
Ten percent blood sucker under poor
I might tuck the gun, bump the sucka on the floor
I don't like boy rappers
All mark for death like the pipe boy hatcher
I'm the rasist white boy rappin'
Gut money, look, I just despize toy rappers

We all know the leaners, how they lean, but never fell from here
We know how they not and how they arms is start to swellin here
Pain don't never mind is just a sign to what they sellin here,
Never fear, never scared, my city is one alone,
Couple clowns jumping on, fuck them heavy undertones
Never float like I was from nowhere else than I'll be from
Living proof of winning courtesy, or what my life be done

Swear to God I know this city like the pockets and the breathe
And I know the clock ain’t in my reach

Police harassing us, the color of my skin offend em
Not every black hit on that corner, out here drug selling,
Yeah I'll be drug selling, I'm just one more felon
Doing me to survive, it’s hell into a better heaven
Everybody aiming for your melon,
Bedrooms turn in more bedrooms,
We facing voodoo headwinds, quitting I did not blood through,
Blotch out here, drown and hit me
Winslow when I heard the gun blow
Welcome to America, you see the bright lights gleaming
Hustlers hustling into fiends, fiending
The subway beat you there, just make sure that you know where you're going
Get caught up in the drama, 'cause this forever flowing.

Know the plan still, it's turn 1 into 5
You literally see the double start to comin' alive
Come alive like heart rates, followed by a car chase
Chris Rock selfies with a top 5 arms race
Moncler skullies pulled over like cover ups
On the up and up, all the bottoms all Balmain
So even a robbery is expensive
Fly guy etiquette, my niggas get extensive
Abide by peddle, a homage from off the benches
And find mine buried in solemnly by the trenches
Bed-Stuy's version of Nas, no mirage
Freeze y'all on speed dials, the murder squads
From where the arms echo like they hear the falsetto
While I'm in here with a Mimi, forreal'll hold a rod
That's like 3 lines in one couplet
So that's 312 like I'm callin' Cabrini

And bein' fitted for rings is the only thing we in touch with

I'm just tryna fill a trophy room
Until it's no mothafuckin' room left
Shit I'm just tryna fill a trophy room

Everything just feels so perfect
I'm on top of the world
Top of the world
On top of the world

Closet full of kicks, the lot is full of whips
Sippin' nothin' but the finest bottles of the Myx
Tryna see it all 'fore I lie up in a ditch
No takin' it with me, fuck depositing my chips
They bite a nigga's dick
Cause when I get bored I take a model for a trip
But go dine up in the Ritz
Why would I hide it if I'm rich? I'ma show off
Forreal, why you think Statik signed me to the clique?
Fuck you, pay me, least I said it to 'em nicely
Hate me, I reflect 'em, sendin' miss precisely
We put them grands in Jacksons to the safe
Cause of Washingtons, we spendin' them with wifey
Remember that? Thought you seen the end of that
But we carry tradition, what would be the sense in that?
Take though from Ea$y, might as well send it back
Got goons everywhere, where you gon' spend it at?
I'm done with the scramblin', pack handlin'
Shook the Ds like big titty bitch dancin'

But watch I still kill it all through whatever arrangements
Got a shot, long range, Danny Ainge 'em
I can't blame 'em, I transport the message like Jason Statham
Sleep is minimal, perspiration, elevated
Rippin' shit easy like perforation
Soon they gon' hold for investigation
More soul than your grandma cookin'
I wonder, got 'em hooked like I know what you did
Last summer, it's a bummer tryna step to me
Bein' black right now, stressin' me
I'll shoot the sheriff and the deputy
Smokin' mad weed so this shit do not get the best of me

Grew up with a bunch of Lenny Cooke's
May God bless 'em all like a Biggie hook
They hooked us early as far as the way these women look
And looking for 'em had us looking for a bigger push
Call it the laws of attraction baby
It's nothing more than a reaction baby, we push this to get you
Whatever ""this"" is, as long as what it gets is
All that we assumed but shit you know the way that this fits
In square trucks Tryna bring a couple models 'round
The same ones who brought your bottles down
I bottled up the ambition and passed it around the room
'Til half us around the room know the logic now
And all of us ain't see the vision so some of us got left behind
But nothing could yet divide us from our calling now
Like how the call to the corner was as sweet as quarter water
All for you to wanna climb up on us now
Salute to the experience

Sweeter than sweet potato soufflé
Store runs for extra sugar and those runs showed us
More than those who sent us ever would've
Or as sweet as a scam that left our finger prints dirty
But our sneakers clean and our company cleaner
The taste of life in all its glory
Be it Harvard or heinous, we took it where none would take it
And poured Henny over it's glory

Back when me and Biz played the coupe
He showed me the lane, I showed him stoops
We showed each other money, and loyalty be everything it seems to
So lil' Biz will be straight if you ever need dude
The same agenda applies to all of my friends who
Saw that coinciding was nothing coincidental
Never, it's just the way we're put together
And none of this shit could be any better
Salute to experience

A generation generating genius
Hard headed like the curb beneath us
They say in the absence of logic you search for motive
But really motive defines us based on being aware of logic
And aware of the dollars and yea mo' money mo' problems
But no money no options, see the logic

Money makes us happy and, happiness is everything
And everything is now and, now is more than never and
There'll never be a moment where happiness doesn't matter so
If you can quote the prices of your happy then get at us yo
Get at us yo, learned it from right where you saw me posted at
Grew up holding on to it all unless there's hope attached
Cause me?, I don't hope for much, uh, if anything at all
They said your cue will depend on what you can bring along
So we was bringing everything that mattered to us most
It was money and it was cars and it was habits to keeping both
It was hundreds and it was scars and they just happened to be close
It was hunger getting involved so then it was back to being broke
And we just wanted a shot or 2, Melo on the follow through
Promised me it would open these doors the way that they promised you
So I just do, whatever it takes to fuck with it all
And enough to buy my way next to Jesus if I get lost, swag

And they say money makes the world go, money makes your girl go
Money turns some of its earners into something terrible
Ask yourself where did the person who was in the mirror go?
Why am I unrecognizable, so unbearable?
In the pursuit of paper, it was then I wasn't there with you
To do it over I'd have taken better care of you
It costs money for the birth, more for the burial
Purposely I'm saving up to purchase us a miracle
We want more but need less, desires and requests
I guess moving constantly at this rapid speed just
Effected my velocity, then the evil got to me
And strangely, it fucked around and changed my philosophy
I always heard it's not the quantity but it's the quality
In all honesty, past mistakes seem to follow me
Sometimes I feel like if my psychology will swallow me
So my apologies, what's my problem yo, it's gotta be the money

And we already had too much and so we was brushing it off us
In pictures in front of back drops til like 4 in the morning
In all of this Dapper Dan for all of your dapper adornment
Or its falling on the badge in the murder of pick a name
And my name fill the blank and I'm blanked and I drift away
And you kiss my cold cheeks, chicks crying like I was Cochise, would you stand up
And send me a slow speech?, because money makes us happy and, happiness is
Everything, and everything is now and, now is more than never and, there'll never

Told em pay us like you owe us but attention you can keep

Call it how it be but we'll never be with the belows
If we looking underneath then we looking up under seats
Now look up at your beliefs, and down at your wrist
Then you look up at what you need and blow it down on a flip
I'm just looking to get a key, the one for the door furthest
And the dream turned into short orders and tall murders
With a fist full of dollars ignorance is so blissful
Wishful in thinking where that ignorance can get you
Get us where we need and we'll call it even and leave

And sleeping in the thought of the above off the love

Skyzoo,"As I think of how to begin this, I already thought up the ending
And if the ending dictates the way the start of it’s written
Then I’m really rewinding what isn’t, get it?
Swear it gets harder to get it but when you got it
To get it again’s more innocent, it’s like product
Concealing the end is in a sense how lights got us
And sealing the win’s where it begins, it’s right by us
Labeled it type bias, to be one in the same
Or maybe they might buy us, to see one of us change
Or say that they might bye us, and leave us yet again
For a gain like pills on the banners of your screen
Know to handle the regime is the handle on the lead
And the hands do extend 'til a hand is outta reach
And the reach be the limbs that’ll balance out the means
And the means to it all will get a ski mask involved
And you winning or you swimming in a flood of the maroon type
Sheets by the dozen and you covered by a boom mic
Pardon, the most humble of an autograph
The threaded needles of desert eagles and honors raps
The high of thinking you can find more
The balance of the script when a shooter signs off
Ballerina fits like two inside four
All for the intrigue of a suicide door

Saw the doors lifting up
And then they never came down
I mean they rode around the block with the doors lifted up
Like they was flying off the ground
And then they told us that they call those suicide doors
They said they call those suicide doors
The break lights was 100 dollar bill green
And we was green for a suicide door

And as we take this to a further route
The steps move like its word of mouth
The steps move like if they was stepping with us when we further out
So step two becomes to work around
It gets lighter than a fly knit, tighter than a eye slit
Brighter than the writer you was bright enough to climb with
Complimenting you while biggin’ up me
Just brings us up to speed to the steps that we aligned with
Then it all ties in, tied up to keep down
Or cover up your eyes when it flies like you Dee Brown
The complexities of rubbing arms next to me
It all adds to these bags of longevity
It’s like, I’m Wayne Shorter with a ratchet fetish
Or, I’m Mendecees with a jazz collection
In other words, I covet what they covered
Like overflowing cupboards spilling gold medal dreams
And running to the cupboard like you’re gold medal breed
Or bred, and fed how that gold medal steam
Meanings all over, you can pick the one that suits you
Depending the tie the accessory could lose you

You know how we get it, right Duffle bags for it

And putting your belief in a baton as the centerpiece

In the crossfire and something's drawn and dumping off
Half don't make it, the other half will duck and crawl
And turn Caine tryna save who remains
Raised as a JW and so the way I was laid
Is on a stake and not a cross, blood stains on the floor
Intuition will kick in and find a way to pry me off
I bring the stake wit me and keep it as memorabilia
Dealers is my audience, uniformed all of it
Made sense like as if I was there when they was offing it

I never shook the feeling of the mood that y'all was in

Where the heights are getting higher 'til they grew up outta place
And the lights are getting brighter so you shooting by the stakes

And park in front of Soco back to back like we in line
And leave the speakers jumping while we take over inside 
Ignorance is bliss and bet there's beauty all in mine

Like pull up parallel and get to backing back around

Addicted to trophies, so bet that's what I shoot at
And bet she talking replay if I ever go and shoot that
Women crush passenger, 7 on my jersey
An arm in my PR's, double meaning, early, addicted to trophies

Let the children use it

I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

Slaid Cleaves,"In the melting snows of Ontario
Where the wind'll make you shiver
It was the month of May up in Georgian Bay
Near the mouth of the Musquash River

Where the bears prowl and the coyotes howl
And you can hear the osprey scream
Back in '99 we were cutting pine
And sending it down the stream

Young Sandy Gray came to Go Home Bay
All the way from P.E.I.
Where the weather's rough and it makes you tough
No man's afraid to die

Sandy came a smilin', Thirty Thousand Islands
Was the place to claim his glory
Now Sandy's gone but his name lives on
This is Sandy's story

Young Sandy Gray lives on today
In the echoes of a mighty yell
Listen close and you'll hear a ghost
In this story that I tell, boys
This story that I tell

Now Sandy Gray was boss of the men who'd toss
The trees onto the shore
They'd come and go till they'd built a floe
100,000 logs or more

And he'd ride 'em down toward Severn Sound
To cut 'em up in the mills for timber
And the ships would haul spring summer and fall
Till the ice came in December

One Sabbath Day big Sandy Gray
Came into camp with a Peavey on his shoulder
With a thunder crack he dropped his axe
And the room got a little bit colder

Said, ""Come on all you, we got work to do
We gotta give 'er all we can give 'er
There's a jam of logs at the little jog
Near the mouth of the Musquash River""

With no time to pray on the Lord's day
They were hoping for God's forgiveness
But the jam was high in a troubled sky
And they set out about their business

They poked with poles and ran with the rolls
And tried to stay on their feet
Every trick they tried, one man cried
This logjam's got us beat!""

But Sandy Gray was not afraid
And he let out a mighty yell
""I'll be damned, we'll break this jam
Or it's breakfast in hell, boys
Breakfast in hell!""

Now every one of the men did the work of ten
And Sandy scrambled up to the top
He is working like a dog heaving 30 foot logs
And it looked like he'd never stop

They struggled on, these men so strong
Till the jam began to sway
Then they dove for cover to the banks of the river
All except for Sandy Gray

Now with thoughts of death they held their breath
As they saw their friend go down
They all knew in a second or two
He'd be crushed or frozen or drowned

They saw him fall and they heard him call
Just once and then it was over
Young Sandy Gray gave his life that day
Near the mouth of the Musquash River

But Sandy Gray was not afraid
And he let out a mighty yell
""I'll be damned, we'll break this jam
Or it's breakfast in hell, boys
Breakfast in hell!""

East of Giant's Tomb there's plenty of room
There's no fences and no walls
And if you listen close you'll hear a ghost
Down by Sandy Gray Falls

Through the tops of the trees you'll hear in the breeze
The echoes of a mighty yell
""I'll be damned, we'll break this jam
Or it's breakfast in hell""

And Sandy Gray lives on today
And he let out a mighty yell
""I'll be damned, we'll break this jam
Or it's breakfast in hell, boys
Breakfast in hell!""",Breakfast in Hell,2000
Slaid Cleaves,"Sherry had a pawn shop band of gold
A sink full of dishes and a love grown cold
Along came a boy, pretty as the devil
She took his hand, the whole thing unravelled

There's no turnin' round, it's broke down

Billy took the ring, jammed it in his pocket
Drove down town and tried to hock it
Down at the bottom of Lake Ponchartrain
There's a love not carved inside a wedding ring

Broke down, cracked and shattered
Left in pieces like it never even mattered
Broke down, torn and frayed, ain't nothin' left you could give away
There's no turnin' round, it's broke down

Ain't no tellin where love goes
Maybe down where the black river flows
Won't be comin' back round, it's broke down

Baby in the back seat, and another on the way
Sherry thinks of Billy at the end of every day
Spends her nights waiting for real life to start
Listening to the sound of her double crossed heart

Broke down, cracked and shattered
Left in pieces like it never even mattered
There's no turnin' round, it's broke down

On the other side of town, two lovers lie still
Cigarette smokin' on a window sill
There's a picture locked up in an old suitcase
Billy closes his eyes but he still sees her face

Slaid Cleaves,"There's an old dirt road, just off route nine
Fades into the lake, at the low water line
Sometimes I wander down that road alone
Remembering the town, that I once called home

I grew up in the valley, every neighbor a friend
Until the modern world started creeping in
One day came the lawyers, with cash in hand
They swore that our village would light up the land

The dusky waters move cold and slow
And the ghosts of a village still wander below
Homesteads of families and friends forever more
Haunting the valley below this sparkling shore

Surrounding the valley was a painted red line
Drawn by company men like marking a crime
A silent reminder that all inside it must go
Or be lost to the rising dead river's flow

Some folks too the money, started grinding gears
While the rest of us held out, twenty odd years
We watched our town, like a photograph fade
As the company came, to take it all away

They tore down the church, the schoolhouse burned
They dug up the graves, the wheels of progress turned
They got Dutchie's store, and Haven's pool hall
When the dozers rolled, it shattered us all

The dusky waters move cold and slow
And the ghosts of a village still wander below
Homesteads of families and friends forever more
Haunting the valley below this sparkling shore

Old May Savage stayed as long as she could
Her house on the hill towered over the flood
It rose up alone, in the dark of night
Its face on the water, the cold moonlight

I shake off the memories, on my lips a prayer
Thanks for the grace, and the beauty down there
And while the porch lights glow, all over the state
There's nothing but darkness, under the lake

The dusky waters move cold and slow
And the ghosts of a village still wander below
Homesteads of families and friends forever more
Haunting the valley below this sparkling shore

They haunt the valley below this sparkling shore

Fuckin' right I'm famous, balling like the Lakers
Only time I move is to go collect my paper

See me on the wanted poster, Mad and La Coka Nostra
Hop out of my Porsche, pull my trunk and extort ya
Yup we west coast and dog we stay posting
Walk with two toasters Louis Vuitton holsters
I'm a bad fucking bastard yup I'm fantastic
Four but I'm the Silver Surfer flying through your door
Heard you cryin' for the war Im'a try to serve you more
Madchilds a dope man leave you lying on the floor
Damn chicken heads get their feathers all ruffled up
Put the potato on the pound sound muffled up
We can get it on like Samoans and Tongans
Or we can get to war like the angels and mongols

Black mask over my face, I get em
Four-five stuck on my waist, I hit em
Beat a hater up till he dum dum diddum
Swollen and La Coka don't fuck with em

So ladies and ah forget it were not gentlemen
I roll up in a stolen car come hop in with them
Hand me a pill bottle I dump it and pop ten of them
Give me some booze, I sip juice like Rakim and them
I got a fuse that's too short and a noose that's too long
Feeling I could do no wrong
This invincibility they're convinced is killing me
Has essentially gotten me through any pinch you'll ever see
When my henchmen are with me tensions on the scene
Dreams are being changed a wrench in the machine
One mention of the team leave the masses buzzing
The rebel, you thought you're on my level, you wasn't

Hotter than Ecuador, son brought a metaphor
P-1 I'm ready for war I'm on the front lines
Runs in my bloodline thirsty like lost boys
Big money bounce my accounts keep em offshore
Caribbean breeze there's ten million reasons
Y'all super eight like rich we four seasons
Fine linen, sterling silver, Bright Brightlen, the lady killer

Black mask over my face, I get em
Four-five stuck on my waist, I hit em
Beat a hater up till he dum dum diddum
Swollen and La Coka don't fuck with em

I started war and bids when y'all was just kids
Came to your town and jumped the fuck around
Stomped out a few of you and fucked your lady
You still married her and you gave her a baby
We were young, we were crazy, we were wild and free
Ain't a groupie bitch alive get a child from me
And now you come to the shows and you reminisce
And while she waits for an autograph, you give her a kiss
She slips me a hug and a look that's knowing
If I say get on the bus, baby girl its on
Lyrics keep flowing and flowing and just flowing
Hoes keep hoeing and hoeing and just hoeing
Trees get rollin' smoking keep blowing
Coka and Swollen legend keep growing
Fast lane living no time for slowing
Gotta know where you been and watch where you're going

Slaine,"This song is about goin' crazy
Losin' your fuckin' mind
Stayin' out too many days at a time
Yeah

I'm starin' down a dark tunnel and I can't see the light
Rats crawlin' everywhere, you know how they be at night
I got a gun in my hand, and I gotta squeeze it tight
I'm tryin' to get out of here, no one said it's easy right?
My stomach is queasy like, I got a fuckin' lump in my throat
More than a decade, I'm searchin' and I'm huntin' for hope
Soakin' in alcohol, smokin' usin' somethin' to cope
But how much water can you bail from your boat, 'fore it sinks?
My hijinks, made my eyes chink, pink from the lye stink
Pockets broke made want to rob things
Fuck this rap shit! My city's full of suicide kings
So from here on, this is now a do or die thing

I got a baby on the way, mad bills to pay
But I took too many God damn pills today
And I can't get out of this haze, out of my bed
Can't get these sick thoughts outta my head, I'm goin' crazy

I don't wanna talk shit, but this weed in my pocket
Is makin' me crazy, just get me a straight-jacket and lock it
I'm fueled like a rocket, the topic of conversation
Is I'm a little +Insane in the Brain+, and I can spark it
Like a suicide bomber, homey I'm ready to bomb it
Adrenaline takin' over, think I'm gonna vomit
But I can promise you one thing, I walk it like I talk it
If I shoot a comet at you better hope that you can duck it
Fuck it, I'm annoyed with some of these shitty rappers
Tryin' to turn the fuckin' lights out just call me The Clapper
Cause homeboy is a poser, takin' it so far
I put you on the corner where most of my hoes are, and

You can make money for daddy, just don't be mad at me
But this is what happens any time you throw a jab at me
You can take a stab at me, and really get peeled maybe
It's time to put you away, homey I'm still crazy

Lord forgive me I'm surrounded by sin, insects crawlin' under my skin
Demons knockin' at the door of my mind, I feel like lettin' 'em in
What you call drug dependency. I call settin' a trend
I was always into drugs, just nobody caught me
I learned it from the best teachers, my family taught me
I got knocked went to trial, guess what that bought me?
The aura of invincibility, you can't stop me
My great grandfather was a doctor, his son was a doctor
Soon as I found pussy, I wanted to play doctor
In my middle school locker I had a bottle of vodka
Took a shot at lunchtime, sprayed my breath with Binaca
I'm no psycho, my sheet says I'm a sociopath
I enjoy prescription pills and blowin' that grass
What you callin' big cash, I would throw in the stash
That weed you saying's exotic I throw in the trash

I got nothin' to live for except a 40 cal slug
Waitin' up in the barrel I can take it in the mug

I never learned karate, but I know crazy",Crazy,2010
Slaine,"This is my life

I always knew I was different even back at six
They tied me to a pole with a rope and wrap my wrists
They punch me and kick me and slap me with sticks
In the ribs and the kids called my daddy a bitch
Said my father's a faggot, it aggravated my dealings
I didn't know no better but knew I hated the feeling
From laughing at me whenever they would crack jokes
On my way to the store to get a pack of smokes
For my Nana, Benson and Hedges 100 with a note from my grandmother

It's something she suffers from arthritis
Hands stuck together, drop down elbows
It looked like baseball, she called marshmallows
I could see the silhouettes of the past, hello
The days back when I had those rain tap windows
To peer through and just look at the world
I was just a boy, I never knew what would occur
Blur ahead to myself as a half-dead fiend
Fucked up in my head from what happened between
With my body on the floor I'm asleep from beans
My life flashed before me, I peeped the scenes

[Chorus]
Yeah, the ghosts talk to me in my head
They said I'm already dead
And I had so much blood to be shed
But I can't spill it no more
And I have died a thousand deaths
On the ground so out of breath
Yeah I've been down that flight of steps
But you can't kill me no more

It's a chain, we all grew up with the same dreams
But hit the potholes in the street and became fiends
Got in fistfights every night with the same team
Right around the time that ? came clean
I was hurt from my broken home and going crazy
Rolling up coke in bones and so I am maybe
One these troubled youth in this modern day America
Thank God I'm still alive, I gotta say it's Erica

Who's always by my side, that's why I love her forever
She knows my whole pain and all the stormy weather
That I been through, what I overcame and what it meant too
Other people looked at me like a freak with a pencil
I got enough rage for every page in my books
What I done I should be in a cage with the crooks
But I'm not, barely by the skin of my teeth
Maybe there's a reason, time for me to finish this beef

[Chorus]

It's the dawn of a new day and I've been given a platform
All the moments in my life, I got a rap for em
I gotta tell my story, bring it back for em
Either that or I could slip away and the crack's gone
You think I let it happen well that's wrong
Who would've ever thought I would be saved by a rap song?
I gotta capitalize cause I'm rapping with guys
That I idolized as a kid, I'm revitalized

Always looked at life through a writer's eyes
I learned this shit is hard, really man you either fight or die
So I'mma stand up and fight that fight
I'm going home broken bone and bloody tonight
You motherfuckers ever look and study your life
And see how fade and grayed they've made whatever you like
Cause I can feel it in my fucking gut when I write
This pain is sweet, I needed to be cut with this knife

A rock star poppin’ rotches in bars
Used to flip bud now just rappin’ cop me a car
No tellin’, Connecticut felon, I GPS ‘em
And find my mark like Magellan with more lines than Corey Feldman
I never cease to impress ‘em
I cardiac arrest ‘em
With every studio session I'm killin' ‘em, no question
Webb’s back, better hold your breath when I’m rhyming homes
I murder beats, I’m Jonah Hex on the microphone
Fiends saying I’m the dopest yet
And haters? I shrug ‘em off until my fucking shoulders sweat

Scored a hand, I’m the winner playing the Game of Thrones

I’m buckwild, stupid, and dangerous
My best friends are not strangers
These are the motherfuckers I hang with
We speak the same language
And I ain’t saying French, English, or Spanish, or Spanglish
I mean pain and anguish, this cocaine slangin’ bang-bang shit
MAC-11s that we aim with
In other words, I’m rolling with the same clique I came with
I’m the sameness and fuck being famous
Fame dreams are for groupies
I’m a real-life gangster that you ain’t seen in the movies

Always with a half-ounce stuffed into a sandwich bag

For the kids on the corner, but still got the laugh of a mental patient
The infiltration of the game
Born from a central hatred of fame
A pencil shaking with pain
An injured stake in the claim from the wrath I became
My paragaphs’ insane: they're futuristic pictures of the past from which I came
And this is Slaine with a shotty in the hooptie son
My whole career’s a robbery that they could never scoop me from

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,

Her only answer is one little smile,
