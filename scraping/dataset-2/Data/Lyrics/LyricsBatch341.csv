Hank Jones,"I get no kick from champagne,
Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Some get a kick in a plane,
Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,
Is my idea of nothing to do,
But I get a kick out of you.
I get a kick, out of you.",Hank's Pranks,1956
Hank Jones,"Yesterdays, yesterdays
Days I knew as happy
Sweet sequester days
Olden days, golden days
Days of mad romance and love

Then gay youth was mine, truth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life
Forsooth, was mine
Sad am I, glad am I
For today I’m dreaming of yesterdays

Yesterdays, yesterdays
Days I knew as happy
Sweet sequester days

Hank Jones,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul,1957
Hank Jones,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss",But Not for Me,1957
Hank Jones,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,
It had to be you, wonderful you,
It had to be you.

It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue,

It had to be you.",It Had to Be You,1957
Hank Jones,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1958
Hank Jones,"I often wonder why he came to me
Brought such a flame to me

And let it die
And if another love should find my heart
It will remind my heart of your goodbye

With every new love you
Will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

If I love again
I'll find other charms
But I'll make believe, you are in my arms
And though my lips whisper

""I love you""
My heart will not be true
I'll be loving
Every time I love again",If I Love Again,1958
Hank Jones,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1958
Hank Jones,"Oh she may be weary
Them young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old miniskirt dress
But when she gets weary
You try a little tenderness

Oh man that
Un hunh
I know shes waiting
Just anticipating
The thing that you'll never never possess
No no no
But while she there waiting

Try just a little bit of tenderness
That's all you got to do
Now it might be a little bit sentimental no
But she has her greavs and care
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
Yeah yeah yeah
And it makes it easier to bear
Oh she wont regret it

No no
Them young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Yeah yeah yeah
But its all so easy
All you got to do is try
Try a little tenderness

Hank Jones,"I wish I knew someone like you could love me
I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance?
I wish I knew, but only you can answer.

If you don't care, why let me hop[e and pray so
Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so,
Should I keep dreaming on, or just forget you?
What shall I do, I wish I knew",I Wish I Knew,1961
Hank Jones,"Early in the morning and I can't get right
Had a little date with my baby last night
Now it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
Well, it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
Now it's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothing but the blues

Went to all the places where we used to go
Went to your house, but you don't live there no more
Now it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
Well, it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
Early in the morning
And I ain't got nothing but the blues

Well, it's early in the morning

Hank Jones,"Good morning heartache
You old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache
Thought we said goodbye last night

I turned and tossed until it seems you have gone
But here you are with the dawn
Wish I forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you
When my love went away
Now everyday I stop I'm saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new?

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight to Sunday blues

And you can get it if you try

Strollin' with the one girl
Sighin' sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?

And if you get it, won't you tell me how?

Hank Jones,"My heart is heavy as lead
Because the blues has done spread
Rocks in my bed

Of all the people I see
Why do they pick on poor me
And put rocks in my bed?

All night long I weep
So how can I sleep
With rocks in my bed?

There's only two kinds of people
I can't understand
There's only two kinds of people
I can't understand
That's a deceitful woman
And a hard faced man

She took my man away
And ain't goin' bring him back
She took my man away
And ain't goin' bring him back
She's lower than a snake down in a wagon track

My man's gone, so instead

Hank Jones,"I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something I never had
Never had no kissin'
Oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be? 

The night is cold and I'm so alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be? 

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ear
Hugging and a-kissing
Oh, what I've been missing
Lover man, oh, where can you be?","Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be? )",1975
Hank Jones,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch over Me,1976
Hank Jones,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",Lullaby of Birdland,1976
Hank Jones,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots & Moonbeams,1976
Hank Jones,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Hank Jones,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new

Hank Jones,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1977
Hank Jones,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there

When they see you out with me

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh,
And I know the reason why

Goodness knows
You're my honeysuckle rose

Don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweeter when you stir it up

When I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips

Hank Jones,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble

You can break my heart
Forever, if you want to

Hank Jones,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,1979
Hank Jones,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!

Hank Jones,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

And high above

But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear And shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all","I Surrender, Dear",1998

Once in a while",Once in a While,2004
Hank Jones,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way,2004
Hank Jones,"Manhattan-I'm up a tree
The one I've most adored
Is bored 
With me
Manhattan, I'm awf'lly nice
Nice people dine with me
And even twice
Yet the only one in the world I'm mad about
Talks of somebody else
And walks out

With a million neon rainbows burning below me
And a million blazing taxis raising a roar
Here I sit, above the town
In my pet pailletted gown
Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor
While the crowds at El Morocco punish the parquet
And at '21' the couples clamor for more
I'm deserted and depressed
In my regal eagle nest
Down in the depths on the ninetieth floor
When the only one you wanted wants another
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?
Why, even the janitor's wife
Has a perfectly good love life
And here am I
Facing tomorrow
Alone with my sorrow

Half a love, never appealed to me

Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall

I would be, caught in the undertow

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,2006
Hank Jones,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is

To hear the angels sing.

They bend on hovering wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds

Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow;
Look now, for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing;
Oh rest beside the weary road
And hear the angels sing.

For lo! the days are hastening on,
By prophets seen of old,
When with the ever-circling years
Shall come the time foretold,
When the new heaven and earth shall own
The Prince of Peace, their King,
And the whole world send back the song
Which now the angels sing.",It Came Upon the Midnight Clear,2012

Darkness be over me, my rest a stone
Yet in my dreams I'd be nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

All that Thou sendest me in mercy giv'n
Angels to beckon me nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise
So by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee,

Hank Jones,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

[Chorus]
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

[Chorus]

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

[Chorus]

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

Hank Jones,"Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known.
In seasons of distress and grief,
My soul has often found relief
And oft escaped the tempter's snare
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
The joys I feel, the bliss I share,
Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for thy return!
With such I hasten to the place
Where God my Savior shows His face,
And gladly take my station there,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
Thy wings shall my petition bear
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless.
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His Word and trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
May I thy consolation share,
Till, from Mount Pisgah's lofty height,
I view my home and take my flight:
This robe of flesh I'll drop and rise
To seize the everlasting prize;
And shout, while passing through the air,
""Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!""",Sweet Hour of Prayer,2012

When they ask me about you I just laugh out loud
This old mask that I keep wearing goes with me every place
To keep a hurt from showing I wear my happy face

These walls that surround me I'm glad that they can't speak
Because at night I cry and talk to them until I fall asleep

Fraulein, Fraulein
Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein
 
When my memories wander
Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me
The face of my pretty Fraulein

Walk down by the river
Pretend that your hand's holding mine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you

Hank Locklin,"If you ever go across the sea to Ireland,
Then maybe at the closing of your day,
You will sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh
And see the sun go down on Galway Bay.
Just to hear again the ripple of the trout stream,
The women in the meadows making hay
And to sit beside a turf fire in a cabin
And watch the barefoot gosoons at their play.
For the breezes blowing o'er the sea to Ireland,
are perfumed by the heather as they blow.
And the women in the uplands digging praties
Speak a language that the strangers do no know.
For the strangers came and tried to teach us their ways,
And scorned us just for being what we are
But they might as well be chasing after moonbeams
Or light a penny candle from a star
And if there's going to be a life hereafter,
And somehow I am sure there's going to be,
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven
In that dear land across the Irish Sea.",Galway Bay,1995

From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow

While you linger there in silence thinking only of the past
May your teardrops kiss the flowers on my grave

Hank Locklin,"I still have the photograph that you gave me I'll treasure it until the day I die
My only happiness is the picture that's all you left me the day you said goodbye
Your pretty eyes just seem to look right through me
They bring back memories I can't erase
And if it's wrong to love the way I love you I sin each time I kiss your paper face

Since the day you walked away with my heart
A million tears have trickled from my eyes
They say you found true love with another I should forgive you now I've realized

In my heart I hold the sweetest memory
And each time I gaze into your eyes it's heaven
I can see the same sweet girl so dear to me

Hank Locklin,"I get the blues as we dance
I get the blues in advance
For I know you'll be gone
And I'll be here alone
So I get the blues in advance

Some get the blues from a song
Some when love has come and gone
You don't know how I cry
When you tell me goodbye

I get the blues in advance
There's no hope for me now
You will change dear somehow

I may be wealthy with more than my share
I may be able to go anywhere
I may own a kingdom and sit on a throne
Still I'll be lonely while I'm livin' alone

I can follow the bright lights
Keep a smile on my face
I can travel this whole world
But not get any place

I need you near me to stick by my side
Please give me true love and don't shatter my pride
If you should leave me all the dreams I have known
Will never come true while I'm livin' alone

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family

Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",The Windmills of Your Mind,1969

I found myself on the floor

And I wondered what I'd come there for

As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

Hail, oh queen, mother of mercy
Our life, sweetness, and hope
Hail, hail, oh queen
To you we cry, exiled sons of eve
To you we sigh, mourning and weeping
Oh clement, oh loving one

You let down your people Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
But in the end you could not deliver

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
And she's not coming back to you

Show business kept us all alive
Since seventeen October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamor's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
She's not coming back to you

Far across the world

Is there somewhere you can tell me?'

Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

You and me in paradise
Oh think twice, it's just another day for you,
You and me in paradise

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying

Oh Lord, there must be something you can say

You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place

I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.

Looks like we both agree

I will send your baby boy to your side

She kissed her darling boy and then she died
But smiling in the arms of her boy there she died",I'm Just Here to Get My Baby Out of Jail,1958

Hank Snow,"In the Dodge City yards of the Sante Fe
Stood a freight made up for the east
And the engineer with his oil and waste
Was groomin' the great iron beast;

While ten cars back in the murky dust
A box-car door swung wide
And a hobo lifted his pal aboard
To start on his last, long ride;

A lantern swung and the freight pulled out
The engine it gathered speed
The engineer pulled the throttle wide
And clucked to his fiery steed;

Ten cars back in the empty box
The hobo rolled a pill
The flare of the match showed his partners' face
Stark white and deathly still;

As the train wheels clicked on the couplin' joints
A song for the ramblers' ears
The hobo talked to the still, white form
His pal for many a year;

For a mighty long time we've rambled, Jack
With the luck of men that roam
With the back door steps for a dining room
And the boxcar for a home;

We dodged the bulls on the eastern route
And the cops on the Chesapeake
We traveled the Leadville Narrow Gauge
In the days of Cripple Creek; 

We drifted down through sunny Cal
On the rails of the old S. P.
And of all you had, through good and bad
A half always belonged to me; 

You made me promise to you, Jack
If I lived and you cashed in
To take you back to the old churchyard
And bury you there with your kin;

You seemed to know I would keep my word
For you said that I was wise
Well, I'm keepin my promise to you, pal
Cause I'm takin' you home tonight;

I hadn't the money to send you there
So I'm takin' you back on the 'fly'
It's the decent way for a Bo to go
Home to the by and by; 

I knew that fever had you, Jack
And that doctor just wouldn't come
He was too busy treatin' the wealthy folks
To doctor a worn out bum; 

As the train rolled over it's ribbon of steel
Straight through to the east it sped

A lonely spot I know 
Where no man will go 
Where the shadows have all the room

I was ridin' free on this old SP 
Humming a southern tune
When a man came along 
Made me hush my song 

Kicked me off way out there
As she pulled out of sight 
I turned to the right 
The left and everywhere

But all I could see 
Was a cactus tree 
And a prairie dog playin' there
I watched the prairie dog 

Feed on the tumbleweed 
That's his home way out there
So I threw down my load 
In the desert road 

Rested my weary legs too
I watched the sinking sun 
Make the tall shadows run 
Out across that barren plain

Then I hummed a tune 
To the risin' moon 
He gets lonesome way out there
So I closed my eyes 

To the starlit skies 
And lost myself in dreams
I dreamed the desert sand 
Was a milk and honey land 

Then I awoke with a start
As she was passin' by 
I caught her on the fly 
Climbed in an open door

Then I turned around 
To that desert ground 
Saw the spot I would see no more
As I was ridin' away 

I heard the pale moon say

And the north wind came howling down the line
With his sweetheart so dear stood a brave engineer
With his orders to pull old No 9
She kissed him goodbye with a tear in her eye
But the joy in his heart he could not hide
Oh the whole world seemed bright when she told him that night
That tomorrow she'd be his blushing bride
Oh the wheels hummed a song as the train rolled along
And the black smoke came pouring from the stack
And the headlight agleam seemed to brighten his dream
Of tomorrow when he'd be coming back
He steered around the hill and his brave heart stood still
For a headlight was shining in his face
And he whispered a prayer as he drew on the air
Or he knew this would be his final grace
In the wreck he was found lying there on the ground
And he asked them to raise his weary head
As his breath slowly went this the message he sent
To the maiden who thought she would be wed

Open the windows of his little shack and shouted oh dasher and dancer
Vixen and blitzen come on here were gonna get a goin' and spread some cheer
So limber your legs and sharpen your hooves
Cause tonight is the night were gonna jump on the roof
So the reindeer they were so proud and grand to take another trip all over the land
They jumped right into their proper place to get hepped up for that midnight race
Ol' Santa he shook off the ice and snow boarded his sleigh and then yelled let's go
All the little toys were happy too cause they were so bright and new
A little piano then started to play ol' Santa began to swing and sway
Thought he heard a toy drum starting to beat
But he found it was just the rhythm of the reindeer feet
The reindeer boogied in the middle of the road tonight we have a mighty big load
Don't boogie to the left now boogie to the right
Do the reindeer boogie this Christmas eve night

Hank Snow,"You put your heart upon an auction block and sold it,
Selfish greed and envy were the auctioneers.
The highest bidder won your heart but he can't hold it;
Love that's bought with gold can only end in tears.

The price I offered was my true love and devotion,
But you laughed and said that love had had its day
When at your feet I laid a heart filled with emotion,
You scorned the only price that I could pay.

May the golden price he paid you for your love, dear,
Keep you with him, may you never drift apart;
'Cause at the auction of regrettal, tears are worthless,
Bids are low for second-handed broken hearts.

When you tire of playin' princess, you'll recall
That love alone is life's true everlasting treasure,
And my bid, it was the highest after all.",The Highest Bidder,1989

The sadness of his eyes revealed the torture of his soul

Ho-ho-o Bo-o-o Bil-lie! 

No warm lights flickered around him, no blankets there to fold 
Nothing but, the howling wind and the driving rain, so cold 
When he heard a whistle blowing, in a dreamy kind of way 
The hobo seemed contented for he smiled there where he lay.

Outside the rain was fallin' on that lonesome boxcar door 
But the little form of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor 
As the train sped through the darkness and the raging storm outside 
No one knew that Hobo Bill was taking his last ride. 

It was early in the mornin' when they raised the hobo's head 
The smile still lingered on his face, but Hobo Bill was dead

Heart broken, God took her away.
That silk gown of white for her wedding tonight,
She wore as they laid her away.

As I walked to her grave where the blue bonnets wave,
I cried but my tears were too late.

And my tears stain the flowers on your grave,
In deep regret I think of the heart that I have wounded
Of the sorrow, and grief, and the life I could have saved.

Hank Snow,"My cowboy life is so happy and free
Out west where the laws don't bother me
I take my troubles like a toy
I'm just a yodeling cowboy

At the set of the sun
When my work is done
On my pony I take a ride
Where the coyotes howl
And the varmits prowl
With my forty-four by my side

I go down that lonesome trail
Just galloping long
I love to sing my yodeling
Cowboy song

Where a man is a man
And a friend is a friend
Where all my cares and worries end
I have no troubles, nothing but joy

Hank Snow,"I love a gal who invented kissin' I don't recall her name
But I do believe that gal should sit high up in the hall of fame
Until she came along just think what we were missin'
That's why today I'm shouting hooray for the gal who invented kissin'

She thought the fellows how to smooth instead of holdin' hands
And she showed them how to steel a kiss like they do in foreign lands
Until she came along just think what they were missin'
Loved was very nice but as cold as ice to that gal who invented kissin'

She showed the girls how pucker up and roll their pretty eyes
And she showed them how to kiss hello and how to kiss goodbye
Until she came along just think what they were missin'
They could only cook or read a book till that gal who invented kissin'

Mr Edison he invented the lights Mr Bell the telephone
And Columbus found America their names're all well known
But till she came along this world had somethin' missin'
And I'm tellin' you there was nothin' to do till that gal invented kissin'

Now I've been out with a many a gal and the things all were so nice
Some of them I kissed just once and other more than twice
But if I had my wish the only thing I'm wishin'
Is to make a date and stay out late with the gal who invented kissin'

She ever knows how to kiss so fire and how to kiss goodnight
On every kind of hug and kiss she holds a copy rhyme
But if I had my wish the only thing I'm wishin'
Is to make a date and stay out late with the gal who invented kissin'",The Gal Who Invented Kissin',1990
Hank Snow,"From old Montana down to Alabam' I've been before and I'll travel again
You triflin' women can't keep a good man down
You dealt the cards but you missed a play so hit the road and be on your way
Goin' board the Golden Rocket and leave this town

I was a good engine a runnin' on time but baby I'm switchin' to another line
So honey never hang your signal out for me
I'm tired of runnin' on the same old track
Bought a one way ticket and I won't be back

This Golden Rocket's gonna roll my blues away
Hear that lonesome whistle blow that's your cue and by now you know
That I got another true lover waitin' in Tennessee
This midnight special is a burnin' the rail so woman don't try to follow my trail

This Golden Rocket's gonna blow my blues away
Hear her thunder on through the night this Golden Rocket is a doin' me right
And that sunny old southland sure is a part of me
Now from your call board erase my name your fire went out you done lost your flame

And this Golden Rocket is rollin' my blues away
That old conductor he seemed to know you done me wrong I was feelin' low
For he yelled aloud we're over that Dixon Line
The brakeman started singin' a song said you're worried now but it won't be long

This Golden Rocket is leavin' your blues behind
Then the porter yelled with his southern drawl let's rise and shine good mornin' ya all
And I sprang to my feet to greet the new born day
When I kissed my baby in the station door the whistle blew like it never before

So I'm movin' on.

That big loud whistle, as it blew and blew
Said hello to the southland, we're comin' to you
And we're movin' on, oh, hear my song
You had the laugh on me, so I set you free
And I'm movin' on.

Mister fireman, won't you please listen to me
Cause I got a pretty mama in Tennessee
Keep movin' me on, keep rollin' on
So shovel the coal, let this rattler roll

You've broken your vow, and it's all over now
So I'm movin' on.

You've switched your engine, now I ain't got time
For a triflin' woman on my main line
Cause I'm movin' on, you done your daddy wrong
I warned you twice, now you can settle the price
Cause I'm movin' on.

But someday baby, when you've had your play

And will you protect her and honor her name

Share with her in poverty with her in wealth
For richer for poorer through sickness and health
All these things the Parson did ask me and then I whispered I do and I'd do it again

For I really love her the one I call wife and I'll go on caring the rest of my life

On the door of a cottage a wreath sadly hung
And a hearse stood there awaiting as the choir softly sung
There were flowers in their beauy and the old Parson he prayed
This was the last tribute as we left for her grave

She has reared you to manhood and now you've laid her to rest
Those flowers in their beauty ah to her they're unknown
Cause tonight she's with the angels up around God's great throne
So don't wait that late son to try and repay
Give those flowers and give those treasures but give them today

Would you care if I got my camera and took
A picture of you for my picture book?
If I wanna show the guys who I idolize

Would you be down-hearted if I up and started
With some big romancin’, lots of dates and dancin’?
If I kinda mention that it’s my intention
To be goin’ steady, would you be ready?

Would you mind if I tell you you’re the cutest thing?
Would you mind goin’ shoppin’ for a wedding ring?

 And his whistle broke into a scream

Without a thought of worry or of care,
When I saw the postman coming up the pathway,
With such a happy look and jolly air.

As I heard the postman whistling yester morning,
Coming down the pathway with his pack,
Oh he little knew the sorrow that he brought me
When he handed me that letter edged in black.

Oh, he rang the bell and whistled while he waited,
And then he said ""Good morning to you, Jack.""
But he little knew the sorrow that he brought me

I broke the seal and this is what it said:

Come home, my boy, your dear old mother's dead!""

""The last words that your mother ever uttered 
'Tell my boy I want him to come back,'

Hank Snow,"In the twilight glow I see her
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again

Love is like a dying ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages I remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Someday when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Now my hair is turned to silver
all my tears I've shed in vain
I can  see her star in heaven

Born to lose, I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.
Born to lose, it seems so hard to bear
How I long to always have you near
You've grown tired and now you say we're through
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.
Born to lose, my every hope is gone
It's so hard to face that empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.

You've gone and I know I'm the one who's to blame,

They say you were crying while packing your things
And left me your locket and bright golden rings,
The plans for your future I've broken apart
Now all I have left is your brand on my heart.

And that I'll find someone to love me someday,
Another to cherish the love you once knew,
But darling that someone can only be you.

The flowers you planted, that rose you loved best

And no more will I carry your brand on my heart.",Brand on My Heart,1991
Hank Snow,"Within my prison cell so dreary
I sit alone with achin' heart

She sent it just to lighten my gloom
And tell me that her heart was broken
And cheer me before I meet my doom

She wrote I picked it from the garden, 
Where once we wandered side by side. 
Now you hold no hope of pardon, 
And I can never be your bride.

Oh warden, at last I've found my baby here in jail""

""It was just 5 years today

He was found beneath the snow so cold & white
'Twas then I vowed to take his ring
And his gold watch & his chain
And the county laid his daddy in the grave
Yes warden, the county laid his daddy in the grave""

I will pawn you my diamond wedding ring

Each promise broken like my heart

I can do no more for your dog

With hands that were trembling
I picked up my gun
And aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it
I wanted to run
I wish they would shoot me instead

And looked up at me
And laid his old head on my knee
I had struck the best friend that a man ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

Tho' you don't speak
And I won't speak it's true

And whose hearts just can't be free

Or let's just say we're through

Will open and that you might walk with me

Might touch mine too

And to sit beside a turn fire in the cabin
And watch the barefoot cousins at their play

They scorn us just for being what we are

To lie asleep till wake by summer's rain

The wind it did whistle and the waters did roar
I heard of fair maiden make a pitiful sound
It sounded so lonesome in the waters around

I expect to live single all the days of my life

My love's gone and left me the one I adore
She's gone where I'll never see her anymore
She plunged her fair body in the waters so deep
She closed her pretty blue eyes in the waters to sleep

I never will marry I'll be no man's wife
I expect to live single all the days of my life

The shells in the ocean shall be my death bed
The fish in deep water swim over my head

And the grudges that I've gathered through the years
And leave a large bag of forgiveness
To give out to those who robbed me 
Of my laughter that sometimes filled my eyes with tears
And Santa please a box piled high with love and understanding
That I could share with all my neighbors and my friends
And leave one new temper cause I lost mine
Lost it one too many times

It's a tale of love and all its glory 
They tell when the lights are soft and low
Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate
Standing all alone every night you see her wait
She waits for the boy who marched away 
And though he's gone she hears him say
""Oh promise you'll be true fare thee well Lili Marlene till I'll return to you
Fare thee well Lili Marlene""
With the kiss she gave her promise 
To be constant as the stars up above
Every soldier knows she kept her promise 
And she has been faithful to her love
(Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate
Standing all alone every night you see her wait
For this is the place a vow was made and breezes sing her serenade)
Oh promise you'll be true fare Thee well Lily Marlene till I'll return to you
Fare Thee well Lily Marlene

Although each tale must have an ending 
No one knows just what the end will be
But tonight when twilight is descending 
If you'll come along here's what you'll see
Underneath the lamp post by the barrack's gate
Standing all alone every night you see her wait
And as they go marching to the prey 
The soldiers all salute and say
""We'll tell him you've been true. 
Fare thee well Lili Marlene till he returns to you
Fare thee well Lili Marlene""",Lili Marlene,1994

Hank Snow,"Just call Lonesome 7-7203
Had our number changed today although I hated to
But each time the phone would ring they'd want to speak to you
And it hurts to tell them you're not here with me
Maybe now oh telephone will let me be
It's not in the book now so you'd better write it down
Just in case your love for me should ever come around
You might want to call and break the news to me just call Lonesome 7-7203
I keep the telephone beside me all the time
Hoping you might want to call and say you're changed your mind
If you do then darling you know where I'll be I'm at Lonesome 7-7203
You're the only one I'm giving our new number to
So now if the telephone should ring I'll know it's you
If you ever long for love that used to be just call Lonesome 7-7203
Just call Lonesome 7-7203",Lonesome 7-7203,1994
Hank Snow,"Tonight down here in the valley I'm lonesome and oh how I feel
As I sit here alone in my cabin I can see your mansion on the hill
Do you recall when we parted the story to me you revealed
You said you could live without love dear in your loveless mansion on the hill
(The light shines bright from your window the trees stand so silent and still)
I know you're alone with your pride dear in your loveless mansion on the hill",Mansion on the Hill,1994
Hank Snow,"Maria Elena you're the answer to a prayer
Maria Elena can't you see how much I care
To me your voice is like the echo of a sigh
And when you're near my heart can't speak above a sigh
Maria Elena say that we will never part Maria Elena take me to your heart
A love like mine is great enough for two 
To share this love is really all I ask of you
(Maria Elena say...",Maria Elena,1994
Hank Snow,"I saved up my money to buy my sweetheart some flowers
For Saturday's date and I restlessly counted the hours
Then today in the mail I received a short little note
And I broke down inside at the message that her mother's wrote
Mary Ann regrets she's unable to see you again
We're leaving for Europe next week she'll be busy till then
They know that she loves me but poor boys don't fit in their plans
Goodbye true love goodbye my sweet Mary Ann
The weeks have gone by not a word have I heard since then
In the papers I read of the far away places she's been
I can't eat I can't sleep for over and over again
My mind reads that letter and I cry for my Mary Ann
My Mary Ann died they said she just wasted away
If I could have seen her I know she'd be living today
For we loved each other and if they had left us alone
Today she'd be wearing my ring not a blanket of stone
Mary Ann regrets...",Mary Ann Regrets,1994
Hank Snow,"Once I got a foolish notion to cross that big wide ocean
The future for me didn't look so bright
So I signed up with a tanker got on board and raised the anchor
Stood and watched the Golden Gate fade out of sight
Nineteen days and nights we traveled through the stormy seas we battled
Till we land again Australia far away
Far from friends and San Francisco and the Miss I thought I miss so
Till I stepped ashore of Melbourne that first day
But I met Melba from Melbourne she made my heart yearn
She made my tears flow like wine
She let me kiss her then made me miss her cause Melba could never be mine

So in love but couldn't get her cared so much I couldn't forget her
I fell in love just a little bit more and more
There I was just like I started all alone and broken-hearted
I recall the day I left Australian shore
I was standin' there and tryin' so hard to keep from cryin'
And the more I tried the more my tears would show
Then the south breeze seem to whisper hold her close and once more kiss her
It was hopeless so I turned away to go
But I left Melba from Melbourne she made my heart yearn
She made my tears roll like wine
She wouldn't leave there I couldn't stay there
So Melba could never be mine (Melba could never be mine)",Melba from Melbourne,1994
Hank Snow,"When the sun in the morning peeps over the hill
And kisses the roses round my window sill
Then my heart fills with gladness when I hear the trill
Of the birds in the treetops on Mockin' Bird Hill

Tra la la twitle dee dee dee it gives me a thrill
To wake up in the morning to the mockin' bird's trill
Tra la la twitle dee dee dee there's peace and good will
You're welcome as the flowers on Mockin' Bird Hill
[ guitar ]
When it's late in the evening I climb up the hill
And survey all my kingdom while everything's still
Only me and the sky and an ol' whippoorwill
Singin' songs in the twilight on Mockin' Bird Hill
Tra la la twitle dee dee dee...
You're welcome as the flowers on Mockin' Bird Hill
You're welcome as the flowers on Mockin' Bird Hill




",Mockin' Bird Hill,1994
Hank Snow,"In my adobe hacienda there's a touch of Mexico
Cactus lovelier than orchids blooming in the patio
Soft desert stars and the strum of guitars
Makes every evening seem so sweet
In my adobe hacienda life and love are more complete
[ guitar ]
In my adobe hacienda nested in the western hills
Evening breezes softly murmur harmony with whippoorwills
When setting sun says the long day is done
Sweet music starts to fill the air
In my adobe hacienda harmony is everywhere




",My Adobe Hacienda,1994
