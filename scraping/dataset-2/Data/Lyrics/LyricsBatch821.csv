Paul,"Abilene, Abilene,
Prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene

I sit alone most every night
Watch those trains pull out of sight
Don't I wish they were carrying me
Back to Abilene, my Abilene

Abilene, Abilene,
Prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene

Crowded city, ain't nothing free
Nothing in this old town for me
Wish to the Lord that I could be
In Abilene, sweet Abilene

Abilene, Abilene
Prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene",Abilene,1999

My mother told me these days would surely come,

Paul & Margie,"All my trials Lord, soon be over.

I had a little book was given to me,
And every page spelled Liberty.
All my trials Lord, soon be over.

If religion were a thing that money could buy,
The rich would live and the poor would die.
All my trials Lord, soon be over.

Too late my brothers, too late, but never mind.
All my trials Lord, soon be over.

There is a tree in Paradise
The Pilgrims call it ""The Tree Of Life""
All my trials Lord, soon be over.

Too late my brothers, too late, but never mind.
All my trials Lord, soon be over.
All my trials Lord, soon be over.",All My Trials,1998
Paul & Margie,"[Chorus]
Freight train freight train goin' so fast
Freight train freight train goin' so fast
Please don't tell what train I'm on
So they won't know where I've gone.

Freight train, freight train, comin' round the bend
Freight train, freight train, gone again
One of these days turn that train around
Go back to my hometown.

[Chorus]

One more place I'd like to be
One more place I'd love to see
To watch those old blue ridge mountains climb
As I ride ol' number nine.

When I die please bury me deep
Down at the end of Bleecker street
So I can hear ol' number nine
As she goes rollin' by.

Paul & Margie,"Viens, viens sur la montagne
Tout près du ciel j'ai ma maison
Viens, viens sur la montagne
Là-haut il fait si bon

Pourquoi ces pleurs dans tes yeux
Viens avec moi viens
Laisse ici ton amour malheureux
Viens avec moi viens

Viens ma maison n'est pas loin
Tout s'oublie je suis là prends ma main
Viens viens sur la montagne
Là-haut il fait si bon

Viens, viens sur la montagne
Tout près du ciel j'ai ma maison
Viens, viens sur la montagne
Là-haut il fait si bon

Si tu rêves de beauté et de jours sans fin
De torrents glissants au cœur des forêts
Viens avec moi viens

On y voit pas de méchants
Mes seuls amis sont Dieu, les fleurs et le vent
Viens viens sur la montagne
Là-haut il fait si bon

Viens, viens sur la montagne
Tout près du ciel j'ai ma maison
Viens, viens sur la montagne
Là-haut il fait si bon

Tes yeux tendres me font voir
Qu'à toi seul je tiens
Ne sois pas triste il n'est pas trop tard
Viens avec moi viens

Si tu veux bien prends ma main
Laisse moi je connais le chemin
Viens viens sur la montagne
Là-haut il fait si bon

Viens, viens sur la montagne
Tout près du ciel j'ai ma maison
Viens, viens sur la montagne

Paul & Margie,"Many months have come and gone 
Since I wondered from my home
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born
Many page in life has turned
Many lessons I have learned
Yet I feel that in those hills I still belong

Way down yonder in the Indian nation
I'd ride my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born
Way down yonder in the Indian nation
A cowboys life was my occupation
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born

As I'm standing here today 
I am many miles away
From the place I rode my pony through the draw
Where the oak and blackjack trees 
Kiss the playful prairie breeze
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born
chorus

As in life I turn a page 
To the land of the ole sage
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born
Where the black oil rolls and flows
And the snow white cotton grows
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born",Oklahoma Hills,1998
Paul & Margie,"You've long been on the open road you've been sleepin' in the rain
From dirty words and muddy cells your clothes are soiled and stained
But the dirty words and the mud of cells will soon be judged insane
So only stop and rest yourself and you'll be off again

Oh take off your thirsty boots
And stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh
And maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin'
And the mornin' in your eyes

Then tell me of the ones you saw
As far as you could see
Across the plains from field to town
Marchin' to be free
And of the rusted prison gates that tumble by degree
Like laughing children one by one
They look like you and me

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Just lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

I know you are no stranger down the crooked rainbow trial
From dancing cliff edge shattered sills to slander shackled jails
Where the voices drift up from below as walls are bein' scaled
Yes all of this and more my friend your song shall not be failed

Oh take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary, from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh, and maybe I can try
Just lookin for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes

So take off your thirsty boots and stay for awhile
Your feet are hot and weary from a dusty mile
And maybe I can make you laugh and maybe I can try
Lookin' for the evenin' and the mornin' in your eyes",Thirsty Boots,1998
Paul & Paula,"Evening shadows make me blue
When each weary day is through
How I long to be with you
My happiness

Every day I reminesce 
Dreaming of your tender kiss
Always thinking how I miss
My happiness

A million years it seems
Have gone by since we shared our dreams
But I'll hold you again
There'll be no blue memories then

Whether skies are grey or blue
Any place on earth will do
Just as long as I'm with you
My happiness

A million years it seems

Paul & Sheila Smith,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2006

Oh, no, everything is alright
Breathe, everything little piece of me

So you end up watching chances fade
And wonder in which way?

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay

Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today

The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us

It's weird how this enclosed space makes me think so clearly...so free! 
I wish 
all hours were so relaxing. 
Thinking of the next noise... making up the 
next noise. Scream loud, loud, loud, loud. Static intoxication, sing 
this lovely violin song. Beat this bottle on a wall. Scream, scream, 
scream. The baby cries. Record the noise. It all makes sense...we're 
capable of beauty. Through sounds which make one cringe. The dogs only 
hear us now. For the first time tears came to my eyes while I was 
listening. Noise brings so many things...make my tingling skin freeze.

of the ocean, to the swaying of your hips...shivering as your lover's 
caress touches your lips. Perfect world and perfect lives, we have the 
soundtrack for their futures. The seawater smell in the cold outside 
world seems to be enchanting the room. The chatter of riches keeping the 
beat, as the sea seems to freeze. The brisk air seems to make our hearts 
colder. The dimming smiles seem to have halted with a silent scream. We 
must play on. The perfect life torn apart in a matter of seconds...I hear 
their streams and cries...I know now that I'm the only one who possesses 
true happiness. We must play on. The perfect life torn apart in a matter 
of seconds...I hear their screams and cries...I know now that I'm the only

anyway. This day will soon turn black and my ""wants and needs"" will spill 
on my burning ashes. I learned to be selfish today...I learned to be 
alive. These things I care for are for my personal gain and my person 
happiness only. Why should I sit in your chairs and satisfy your 
standards. I've done it all before and I've confused myself a thousand 
times. The tragic day that I call morality just doesn't do it for me 
anymore. No more choices, just standing in the cold. The day will turn 
black and I will have either lived or died. Asleep mid-sentence- my words 
fall to the ground. Swept into this dreamland. Economic satisfaction, 
never succeed. But happiness has its place. Justice will not lie in your 
corner. New day towards death, only compassion for my own needs make my 
need necessary.
[Day two] Throw myself in the corner; I have nothing to complain about
here. A tragic day seems too peaceful to most, spoiled ambitious turned 
my heart to black. I'm figuring out this realization process- the process 
to never look upon bitter ground. Living dreams, loving dreams, awakening 
to what I've always dreamt of. The familiar sound of lovely love from the 
love of my life will keep the notes coming. From the reciting of the 
show, from the plip and the shevanel, from the grind that annoys, and the
season they hate...forever I worship. I'll kill, love, and hate for all of you.

Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Paul Anka,"Guarda il mare com'e bello! 
Spira tanto sentimento. 
Come il tuo soave accento, che me desto fa sognar. 
Senti come illeve salle, dai giardini odor d'aranci, 
Un perfumo non v'ha eguale per chi palpita d'amore. 
E tu dicro parto addio, 
T'allontani dal mio core, questa terra del amore, 
Hai la forza di lasciar. 
Ma non mi fuggir, non dar mi piu tormento, torna a Sorrento non farmi morir

Paul Anka,"Was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of self-pity  
What to do? What to do? What to do?  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?  
But the age of miracles hadn't passed,  
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere.",A Foggy Day,1963

Now the trees are bare
There's sadness in the air
And I'm as blue as I can be

I wanna hold you so much

And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off You

I need you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm the lonely nights
I love you baby

Don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby

And let me love you, baby
Let me love you",Can't Take My Eyes off You,1969
Paul Anka,"I was out for the morning sun
Couldn't sleep so I thought I'd take a walk
I was thinking of you and me
And I went to your house 'cos I had to talk
I could hardly believe my eyes
When I saw this guy closing your front door
Had a feeling of emptiness
Like I've never had before

And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
And I realize
It's a crazy world

As he disappeared in his car
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do
Everything I had ever been
Everything in my life's a part of you
And I just couldn't move my feet
So I stood on the pavement as you came out
You acted as you didn't know
What it was all about

And I close my eyes
Will you leave me, girl?
And I realize
It's a crazy world

Baby how could you do it
You just told me lies
Had you been behind my back with other guys?
Baby how could you tell me
There was only me
I was stupid to believe you
I was blind but now I see

Then you smiled and you took my hand
""There is something,"" you said ""that you may not know.
There's a couple of men in my life,
And one of them is my brother Joe.
He's been gone for a long long time
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay.
You'll be seeing a lot of him
He's so nice in every way.""

So did she

Papa broke down and he cried
And all he could say was, ""God, why her? Take me!""

He never went upstais
Because she wasn't there
Then one day my Papa said,
""Son, I'm proud of how you've grown""

Don't worry. I'm O.K. alone.""
He said, ""There are things that you must do""
He said, ""There's places you must see""

As he said goodbye to me

Paul Anka,"Now, these are the Teen Commandments

1, Stop and think before you drink. 

2, Don't let your parents down, they brought you up. 

3. Be humble enough to obey. 
You will be giving orders yourself someday. 

4, At the first moment, 
turn away from unclean thinking at the first moment. 

5, Don't show off driving. 
If you want to race, go to Indianapolis. 

6, Choose a date who would make a good mate. 

7, Go to church faithfully. 
The Creator gives you the week, give Him back an hour. 

8, Choose your companions carefully. You are what they are. 

9, Avoid following the crowd. 
Be an engine, not a caboose. 

10, Or even better keep the original Ten Commandments.",The Teen Commandments,1989

Paul Anka,"Hello, Jim, what do you say?
Remember my love
That I lost her yesterday

Hey, tell me, Jim, what's new with you?
You found another girl
Well, I hope she'll be true

Jim, you can't trust them
And don't even try
Or you'll lose her like I did
To some other guy

Keep one eye on her
And the other on him
I speak as a buddy
I'm telling you, Jim

Tell me, pal, what's your girl's name?
That's very funny
'Cause my girl's was the same

Is her last name Jones?
From the West end of town?

Yeah, thanks a lot, Jim
See you around, Good bye Jim
Goodbye, Jim

Paul Anka,"I can't stop loving you, I made up my mind
To live in memory of all lonesome times
I can't stop loving you, it's useless to say
So I just live my life in dreams of yesterday

Those lonely hour that we once knew
Though long ago, still made me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still, since we've been apart

I can't stop loving you, there's no use to try
Pretend there's someone new, I can't live a lie
I can't stop watching you the way that I do
There's only been one love for me, that one love is you",I Can't Help Loving You,1999
Paul Anka,"Although we've never, never danced
I loved you with just one glance

You were dancing, I was glancing
As you passed me on the floor
You saw me glancing but you kept dancing
Out of the room and through the door

I beg your pardon, but in the garden
He placed a flower in your hair
But when he kissed you, oh how I missed you
Wishing that I were there

Then I dreamed upon a star
Wishing I was where you are
How I thought the day would never come
And when I thought that I was first
All at once my bubble burst
And I was standing where I started from

To my regret dear, we've never met dear
But I love you just the same
Although we've never danced
I loved you with just one glance
And I never, no I never knew your name

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy

You would even say it glows

I thought I'd take a ride,

Misfortune seemed his lot,
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upset.

In a one-horse open sleigh,
He laughed as there
I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

And more, much more than this

When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fails, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, no not me
I did it my way

If not himself, then he has not

Paul Anka,"Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans,
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood,
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well,
But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell.

Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go Go
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.
Oh, the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade,
Playing to the rhythm that the drivers made.
People passing by would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play

His mama told him someday he would be a man,
And he would be the leader of a big old band.
Many people coming from miles around
To hear him play his music when the sun go down
Maybe someday his name would be in lights

Searching for shelter again and again

Waiting for the King
Down in the Jungle Room

They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis

Now Muriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would

Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
And she said
'Tell me are you a Christian child''
And I said 'Ma'am I am tonight'

Thinking that I felt you, when I really only dreamed of you again.
I'm clingin' to your pillow, like a dreamin' man would hold on, when I feel the flood of memories rushin' in.

And I flashback...Aww back to the time you were mine and we lived in a love song.
And I flashback...Aww chasin' the sun we would run with a dream we could grow on.
Everything that we touched...turned to love.

My cigarette has burned down, to my fingers, and it brings me back to now.
And I'm searchin' through the ashes, for the answers to the where, the why and how.
Did I ask for too much lovin', or did you need too much freedom? Did we both want more than heaven would allow?

Now as the seasons seem to fly
I see so many things at last, but didn't see the time go by

I've known delight, I've known disaster
The caviar, the humble pie
From the absurd to the sublime
I didn't see the time go by

I didn't see the years roll on
I didn't know the road would bend
Refused to see when youth was gone
Pretending it might never end
Now, there is price to pay for every day I threw away

It seems I've wasted half a lifetime
Within the blinking of an eye
I didn't hear the midnight chime
I didn't see the time go by

In still of nights and brief romances
I kissed the girls and made them cry
While there were balconies to climb
I didn't see the time go by

I was the guy with all the answers, 
The halfway-truths, the little lies
So sure, so certain in my prime
I didn't see the time go by

I hit the heights, I bit the dirt
I left some wreckage in my way
I didn't see that lies can hurt
I didn't know how hearts can break
And now, they come to haunt my mind, 
The lives I touched and left behind

I've sung a hundred songs of longing, 
Of sweet regret and hope run dry
I've searched for melody and rhyme, 
But never saw how time can fly, 
Newer saw the darkening sky

À l'horloge de mes faiblesses

Dans un rayon très limité
Dans le miroir de mes ""je t'aime""

Au tempo des amours pressées

When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I loved, I laughed and cried
Had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

Just to think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels

Sailed off in a wooden shoe
Sailed on a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew

""Now where are you going
And what do you wish?""
The old moon asked the three
""We have come to fish for the herring fish
That live in this beatiful sea
Nets of silver and gold have we,""
Said Wynken and Blynken and Nod

The old moon laughed and sang a song
As they rocked in the wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew

Well the little stars where the herring fish
That lived in the beautiful sea
""Now cast your nets where ever you wish
Never afraid are we,""
So sang the stars to the fishermen three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fishermen home

'Twas all so pretty a sight it seemed
As if it could not be
But some folks thought 'twas a dream they'd dreamed
Of sailing the beautiful sea
But I shall name you the fishermen three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

Now Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes
And a Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee-one's trundle bed

Paul Baker,"Oh what a circus, oh what a show
Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
We've all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right

Oh what an exit, that's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country in a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today

But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?

She had her moments, she had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the casa rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""
But that's all gone now
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

Salve regina mater misericordiae
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
Salve salve regina
Ad te clamamus exules filii eva
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes

Hail, oh queen, mother of mercy
Our life, sweetness, and hope
Hail, hail, oh queen
To you we cry, exiled sons of eve
To you we sigh, mourning and weeping
Oh clement, oh loving one

You let down your people Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
But in the end you could not deliver

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
And she's not coming back to you

Show business kept us all alive
Since seventeen October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamor's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
She's not coming back to you

At least those of you who still got an ear
I'll tell you a story that'll make a skeleton cry
Of our own jubiliciously lovely corpse bride

But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay
And you might try and hide
And you might try and pray
But we all end up the remains of the day
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (that's right)
Yeah yeah yeah

Well our girl is a beauty known for miles around
When a mysterious stranger came into town
He's plenty good-looking, but down on his cash
And our poor little baby, she fell hard and fast
When her daddy said no, she just couldn't cope
So our lovers came up with a plan to elope

Die, die we all pass away

Okay, Chancy, take it.
Yeah. Yeah! That's nice

So they conjured up a plan to meet late at night
They told not a soul, kept the whole thing tight
Now, her mother's wedding dress fit like a glove
You don't need much when you're really in love
Except for a few things, or some told
Like the family jewels and a satchel of gold
Then next to the graveyard by the old oak tree
On a dark foggy night at a quarter to three
She was ready to go, but where was he?

And then?

She waited

And then?

There in the shadows, was it her man?

And then?

Her little heart beat so loud

And then?

And then baby, everything went black

Now when she opened her eyes she was dead as dust
Her jewels were missing and her heart was bust
So she made a vow lying under that tree
That she'd wait for her true love to come set her free
Always waiting for someone to ask for her hand
When out of the blue comes this groovy young man
Who vows forever to be by her side
And that's the story of our own corpse bride

Die, die we all pass away
But don't wear a frown 'cause it's really okay

While he's trying to amaze? 
So I hold my arms apart

They tunnel on and on
Into these deep nights
Where the lights circle on are so steep

So steep

So steep

I’m suing you, yes, I’ll do this.

You paved the way, I don’t want to let you go.

I have proved myself and I’ve blown away,
It’s alright,
I don’t need this, anyway.

And then we’ll fly away,
And then we’ll fly away,
And then we’ll fly away,
And then we’ll fly.

I’ll sue you, I’ll sue you,
I’m suing you, you put so much pain on me.

I’ll take a ride in old sheets, I’ve looked inside, it’s all peace

The sudden exposure makes my mind recall the scene
Over my shoulder there’s a lonely heart that beats
So you only know me like the shoreline knows the sea

Erase the stone just like beginnings
We make our home above the stars, again
Behold!

Over my shoulder there’s a man that doesn’t speak
No expectations, they will only make you weak
So you only know me like the shoreline knows the sea
Over my shoulder there are phantoms, indiscreet

We chase the tombs as the sight begins
We gain these open silent showers in

So behold the science, your ever feelings to play
The science, there’s a life outside
Where our lucky passions reign

You only hold me

You only hold me like the canyon holds the stream
You only hold me
You only hold me like the canyon holds the stream

Could make me be true, could make me be blue

Might never be cross, or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do
For nobody else, gave me a thrill with all your faults, I love you still

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me

She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;

The different lays of nowadays
All set my brain a whirl
They're not the kind of songs they sang
When mother was a girl
Your spoony rags and coony drags
All made my poor heart ache
Bring back the rhymes of olden times
And just for old times sake
[Refrain:]
Won't you play a simple melody
Like my mother sang to me
One with good old fashioned harmony
Play a simple melody
[2nd verse:]
In days of yore, before the war
When hearts now old were young
At home each night by firelight
Those dear old songs were sung
Sweet melodies, their memories
Around my heart still cling
That's why I long to hear a song
Like mother used to sing
[Rag Verse:]
I don't care for long haired musicians
With their classy melodies
They have lots of highbrow ambitions
But their music doesn't please
Give me something snappy and popular
The kind that darkies play
Lots of rhythm
And I go with 'em
That's why I say
[Rag Refrain:]
Musical Demon
Set your honey a-dreamin'
Won't you play me some rag
Just change that classical nag
To some sweet beautiful drag
If you will play from a copy
Of a tune that is choppy
You'll get all my applause
And that is simply because
I want to listen to rag

Paul Bateman,"High flying, adored, so young, the instant queen
A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man 
I was slap in the right place at the perfect time
Filled a gap--I was lucky 
But one thing I'll say for me 
No-one else can fill it like I can",High Flying Adored [From Evita],2004

What to do, how to move him.

I seem like someone else.
I don't know how to take this.
I don't see why he moves me.
He's a man. He's just a man.

And I've had so many men before,
In very many ways,
He's just one more.
Should I bring him down?

Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love,
Let my feelings out?

What's it all about?
Don't you think it's rather funny,
I should be in this position.

So calm, so cool, no lover's fool,
Running every show.
He scares me so.
I never thought I'd come to this.

What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me,
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened.

And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Wanna shoot me in my gold teeth, blow me off the map
I attack like a shark would represent this hood
North Memphis, nigga Hollywood
Make it understand in my blood ain't no trakeness
Or no fakeness and no hoe couldn't break this, you can hate this

Dis bitch that bitch, nigga here's the deal
Crunchy ain't runnin' 'round here fakin' deals
Crunchy runnin' 'round here tryna get a meal
Why you fakin' a deal, it don't cost nothin' to be real

All ya gotta do is keep that shit real
Don't be runnin' 'round here hollerin' you got deals
Don't be runnin' 'round here hollerin' that you'll kill
It don't cost nothin' to be real but it costs when ya kill

I'm 'bout to crash into you suckaz like the World Trade
I'm riding Green Escalade, full of green grenades
You hoez always hollerin' that we be some bitches and shit
But everytime I turn around you got our name on your shit

I used to be with them mayne, I'm still with them
You wish you was with them
How the fuck you hate them when you always claimin them?
I think it's funny 'cause ya'll faggots be still calling my studio
Trying to get back, stay who you with 'cuz I don't need ya hoe

I call up my niggaz we buckin' and tossin' with no mercy hoe
We packin' mass case and decoratin' ya with bullet holes
La Chat I be ready you bustaz ain't got no reeds and shit
That leaves me no choice to grab my glock and go fucka wit

You speak killa talk but ain't no killa in yo blood boi
The infrared be beamin', I got this scope-a behind your door
You niggaz can't take it you hate the fact that we runnin' it
You ain't gotta love it but you gon learn to respect it bitch

Got some syrup in my cup, got some smoke in my mouth
Got some white in my nose, got your bitch on the couch
Got her head in my lap, trick I gotta keep it south
Got a problem with Three 6, gotta blow your brains out

Got that south sowed up, got them guns loaded up
Fuckin' with the Scarecrow, that'll get ya blowed up
It's a hold up, everybody fold up
Niggaz talk like they tough but they ain't got no nutts, bitch

I'm shootin' a dike in her breasto, coward in his chesto
And this police nigga, what we call em' Donnie Brasco
If you bitches want war, you can bring it, let's go
When I put this tone in yo face presto
(Click)

A killa in a black coat, goin' to make a mesto
Leave you in da street wit a bloody Willie Esco
Drankin' on some scotch and we choppin' down that coco
Tryin' to roll some pot in a fuckin' optimol-doe

Don't you make the wrong move and you'll get your ass killed dawg
A fake ass nigga but he claimin' that he real dawg
You ain't gotta lie to kick it actin' like you down dawg
Always lookin' lite trying to wear a murder frown dawg

Don't you get smacked and be gettin' off the pavement dawg
Don't you make me act a fool when somebody hatin' me dawg
Hypnotize Camp Posse got my fuckin' back dawg
Frayser Boy will leave you stankin', pop you with that gat dawg

I'm watchin' out for you polices, niggaz who'll tell it
This union will rip your head in pieces, I know ya feel it
These lyrics just like Mona Lisas 'cuz you can sell it
The posse click tight like feces, I know ya smell it

This ghetto hood shit is crucial just like a murder
You step, whoa, then we shoot ya we quick to serve ya
You hate us feelings mutual so don't be scared-a
The HCP will do ya mayne, we gon hurtcha

Won't someone hear my plea and take a chance with me
Because I'm nobody's baby now

Nobody's baby
And I've got to know the reason why
Last week I was walking down the street and met a boy and I said
""Hey! Maybe I was meant for you""
But he only shook his head and said ""Goodbye""
He kept on walking down the avenue

Paul Binnings,"SPENDING THE HOLIDAYS WITH YOU

Walking along trails under falling snow
Brushing off the snowflakes from the tip of your nose
There's nowhere else I would rather be
Than Spending The Holidays With You

When shoppers push and hustle
And the traffic takes it's toll
I'd rather spend my holidays close to you and in your hold
There's nowhere else in the world I'd rather be
Than Spending The Holidays With You

Who needs the pressure of another frantic season
It doesn't seem to make much sense
Without friendship and cheer the holidays have little reason
It's the giving and the feeling you get

Watching the winter starlight through foggy window panes
See the glowing embers spark into growing flames
There's nothing in the world that I'd rather do
Than find myself Spending The Holidays With You

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.

What a break!

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Had a bad dream in the cold cold night

Darling it came to me in the cold cold night 
I dreamed I looked for you but you were gone 
You were a shadow fading in the dawn 
And there was nothing but the memory to linger on 
I had been searching 
Searching for my destiny 
High and mighty 
Way above the clouds to find the soul in me 
While you were stuck here with your ball and your chain 
I was too far away to ease your pain 
And all you wanted was to feel you were alive again 
So let me hold you 
Let me hold you like it used to be 
Let me tear down 
Everything that's separating you and me 
For I was blinded but now I can see 
The price you have paid for loving me 
And there is nothing I won't do to try to set you free 
For in the end 
In the end it's just the two of us 
In the end 
Darling there is nothing but the two of us 
When all the passing ships have come and gone 
There'll be nobody else to lean upon 
And in the end it's up to you and me to carry on.

Like a child who knew no fear 
With such a need to be alive 
I was scared to get too near 
With such a need to be alive 
I was scared to get too near 

You burned so bright into the night 
A dancer in the fire 
I wished I had your nerve back then 
But I was scared to walk the wire 
Yes, I was scared to walk the wire 
I was afraid to walk the wire 

And now it's three years later 
You're still eager for the game 
But your eyes can't hide the times you tried 
To live too near to the flame 
Your eyes can't hide the tears you cried 
When you got too near the flame

But to you it makes no difference
Just how many times you fall
For you've seen the freedom through the flame
And you can't resist the call
You've seen the freedom through the flame
And you want to taste it all

You burn so bright into the night

I wish I had your nerve right now

This is the night hunting time 

Don't know what I'm doing here 
Got to get my senses clear 

Stumble in off the footpath 
Heard the sounds from below 
Get accustomed to the darkness 
Got to take it real slow

Smoke stinging my eyes

But this ain't no paradise

But now we're together, we'll guide one another, so.

 He's been there a hundred times before, 
 Looking for some pretty high class fool to play with 
 Back in his place when he pours out the wine 
 And the crystal snowflakes stand in line - 
 She won't ever find a faster way to heaven. 
 You can find him any night 
 Standing in the upstage light, 
 Waiting for some easy act to follow - 
 Watch him move in perfect time 
 Memorizing all his lines 
 Roll up! Roll up! see the Great Pretender 
 Dinner party, table for two - 
 Video turns to midnight blue, 
 He says ""do you like to do it this way?""

 Whispered lies underneath the quilt -

I did three bitter years inside 
A friend of mine who set me up 
And he was the one got away with the money. 
But I swore tonight would be the night 
This place couldn't hold me no longer. 

The rain was dancing on the yard 
The searchlight creeping down the wall 
The night it was so black outside 
I nearly jumped half a block from the rendezvous. 
But when I landed on the street 
I saw the green light come shining

I'm busted loose, I'm out on the run 
I'm so close, you're right in the sights of my gun, 
I'm nervous, I'm out of control 
I can't stop the hurricane down in my soul 
Nobody can hide you 
I'm standing right beside you 
Watching everything you do. 

I thought that I was strong enough 
To take the screws at their own game 
But they've got tricks they keep in store 
For anyone dreaming of beating the system 
They had me down upon my knees 
Soon I was begging for mercy

My girl she said she'd stick it out 
She kissed my fingers through the grille 
She whispered she'd love no-one else 
But then she took off with a creep from the south side 
The night they passed me down the news 
That's when the fuse started burning

And the fog banks running out of time, 
But you won't be here when they creep in tomorrow 
You're tired of dreaming someone else's dreams 

When they really don't include you any longer 
Miles from home, you're sliding down with each day 
And you need a woman's love to make you stronger 
And lately you've been getting doubts 

A voice inside keeps calling out 
That someone else's dreams don't get you nowhere. 
So shut the suitcase, kiss the year goodbye 
Don't let nobody stop you at the doorway 

And close the shutters on this empty room 
Where these crazy dreams come crawling to devour you 
And head on out across that line 
Where she's been waiting all this time 

And tell her that you want her there forever.

Can hardly bear to wait another minute

It was only the headlight
From the oncoming train

Hold on! they only want to discourage you
Hold on! trust in the rhythm inside of you

Except for a flying visit in a black Mercedes 
At election time
They cross the line
And everybody runs to watch the pantomime

A way to push aside the walls that block our path

When all the beauty that we shared was swept away
When every avenue we walked would lead to nowhere
Could you and I forget the tears of yesterday

It's the awakening	(And now you're ready to find peace of mind)

You can bet your life she's gonna hurt you

To put me down in company
In front of everyone we see
To take my loving when it's free

And I can love you like she can
Cause fancy clothes don't make no woman

Paul Brady,"Lately I been talking to some friends of mine
(You know the kind who understand)
Trying to get a handle on this heart of mine
(Sometimes it's hard to be a man)
How to find a way to end these wars with you?
(The more we run the more we hide)
Were we just fools to ever start?
Would it make sense for us to part?

Then I started looking for some sympathy
(You know that boys can still be boys)
Churning out this hurting deep inside of me
(Just like a child who lost his toys)
And I'm ducking and I'm diving
And I'm running and I'm hiding
From what's standing right in front of me
(Sometimes the truth's so hard to find)
Making me blind I could not see
That you were the perfect one for me

[Chorus]
Just in time
I saw a picture in the mirror, baby
Of a man acting like a fool
Just in time
I saw a vision of a future without you
Just in time
I realised a lot of things that I'd been hiding in this
Heart of mine
Just in time
I saw the beauty of a love that's oh so true

Baby, you and I we got this magic touch
(And we can fly right to the stars)
And maybe that's the reason why it hurts so much
(Cos when we fall we fall so far)
But all we gotta do is reach out to each other
And listen to our hearts inside
(Just let the wheel of love go round)
Love is a crazy carousel
Jump up on board and ring the bell

[Chorus]

And I need your love
And I need your love
Gotta have your love
Gimme all the love you got",Just in Time,1995
Paul Brady,"Jimmy's not a high concept guy
But he's front page news, let me tell you why
He's on the cover of the New York Post
All three networks, coast to coast
All he needed was a hot night in June
'Cause he had the needle and he had the spoon
When he spiked it bit, and man, he flew
Into America's living room

His brain was wired like a light in a socket
With his old friend in his back pocket

That horse could kick, that horse could scream
Ride you out of here into a different scene
Unrequited love, that makes it fair
But who keeps score when you're in mid-air?

He stared back up at a hot grey sky
Re-run his life and then he died

Well if you jump off a building, brother beware!
''Cause my friend Jimmy woke up mid-air
No time to smile, no time to wave
They buried him in a media grave

 Strong love come a rising high 
 Warm love and she whisper out

This is the moment you've been dreading 
Another bar-room in another lonely town 
You wish you knew where you were heading 
In everyone that you see 
You see her 
In every dream that could be 
You see her, need her tonight 

Chorus 

You're feeling the hurt again 
It's always the way 
When the arrow goes straight to the mark 
But try not to heed the pain 
It's only a gentle reminder 
That while you're apart...she's still 

Deep in your heart, and it's hurting 
Deep in your heart, still hurting 

You feel it coming, it's impossible to bear 
The thought of one more night without her 
You start imagining her perfume in the air 
From every woman round about you 
You try to find relief in someone else's arms 
She senses you're in need of healing 
But it would take more than just any woman's charms 
To wash away this empty feeling 

In everyone that you see 
You see her 
In every dream that could be 
You see her, need her tonight

Paul Brady,"The Island (Paul Brady) 

They say the skies of Lebanon are burning.
Those mighty cedars bleeding in the heat. 
They're showing pictures on the television. 
Women and children dying in the street 
And we're still at it in our own place. 
Still trying to reach the future through the past. 
Still trying to carve tomorrow from a tombstone... 

Chorus 

But Hey! Don't listen to me!.
This wasn't meant to be no sad song. 
We've heard too much of that before. 
Right now I only want to be here with you. 
Till the morning dew comes falling. 
I want to take you to the island. 
And trace your footprints in the sand. 
And in the evening when the sun goes down 
We'll make love to the sound of the ocean 

They're raising banners over by the markets 
Whitewashing slogans on the shipyard walls 
Witchdoctors praying for a mighty showdown 
No way our holy flag is gonna fall 
Up here we sacrifice our children 
To feed the worn-out dreams of yesterday 
And teach them dying will lead us into glory... 

Repeat chorus 

Now I know us plain folks don't see all the story. 
And I know this peace and love's just copping out. 
And I guess these young boys dying in the ditches. 
Is just what being free is all about. 
And how this twisted wreckage down on main street. 
Will bring us all together in the end. 
And we'll go marching down the road to freedom....

Paul Brady,"Hey, here we go again
Caught between the sun and rain
I see the magic in the storm
You want a world that's safe and warm
We've been here before
And here we go again
I know that I can let you down
But sometimes baby you're hard to be around
I want to skate out on thin ice
You spend a lifetime thinking twice
But that's OK

Just look at what we found!
Caught between the healing and the pain
Can fools like us remain
Together?

[Chorus]
(Up down, up down, up)
That's the law of love
(Up down, up down,
That's the law in Love Town)
(We're) Bound by the law of love
Hey, darling don't you cry
Dark days we'll let them walk on by
Love holds you underneath its spell
Then turns your heaven into hell
But that's alright

Next day we can reach the sky
Baby, when the storm goes out of range
That's when things can change
Like the weather

You should set them free (so they say)
But it sure is hard to do, 
But it sure is hard to do
I know they say if it don't come back again
Then it's meant to be (so they say)
Those words don't pull me 
Through cause I'm still in love with you
I spend each day here waitin' for a miracle
But it's just you and me goin' through the mill
Climbin' up a hill

[Chorus:]
This is the long goodbye
Somebody tell me why,
Two lovers in love can't make it,
Just what kinda love keeps breakin' a heart
No matter how hard I try, Your gonna make me cry
Come on baby, it's over...let's face it
All that's happenin' here is a long goodbye

Sometimes I ask my heart did we really...
Give our love a chance 
(Just the one more chance)
But I know without a doubt, that we turned it inside out
And if we walked away would it make more sense (only self defense)
But it tears me up inside, just to think we still could try
How long must we keep runnin' on a carousel
Goin' round and round and never gettin' anywhere
On a wing and prayer

Oh, long goodbye",The Long Goodbye,2000
Paul Brady,"We step on a stage 
 From straight off a page 
 Of everything that's gone before 
 We dream of a time 
 Of crossing a line 
 And opening another door 
 Rivers of stardust in our eyes 
 Leading us out there 
 How could this just be an illusion? 
 We play out our part 
 The chemistry starts 
 The future is a shooting star 
 We try to ignore 
 what's happened before 
 The storybook of who we are 
 Till suddenly one and one makes three 
 And lovers are losers 
 You and me drowning in confusion 
 Love hurts 
 Even when the love is strong 
 Love hurts even while the love goes on 
 Turning these pages in my heart 
 Over and over 
 Still only leads to one conclusion 
 Love hurts, love hurts 
 Can we just end this fight 
 Make out what's wrong from right 
 Or see with second sight 
 The reason why?

But how to save him, I do not know it

I own he marched up right manfully
Being much more like a commanding officer
Than a man to die upon the gallows tree

Oh what detains her so long from me
Or does she think it a shame or scandal
To see me die upon the gallows tree""

Just like waves against the shore

I could always love and leave them
I was the first one out the door
I can't get used to the idea
Not being with you anymore

I should've been more careful
I should've seen the signs
While all was calm, I guess
I should've read between the lines

So, now I'm standin' in the cold, hard rain
Instead of with you safe and warm
A fool who took your love for granted
In the calm before the storm

A fool who took your love for granted
In the calm before the storm",Calm Before the Storm,1996
Paul Brandt,"A rose in a box, wrapped up in dreams
A card that explains how much your love means
A table for two with soft candlelight
The words ""I love you,"" somewhere in the night

I meant to do that
Does that mean a thing
If you wanted songs
Then I meant to sing
I'd give you the world
If you'd give mine back
What I didn't do
I meant to do that

Late in the night, nothing to say
Maybe a call to talk anyway
A letter or two with some words that rhyme
To promise you love, for now and all time

I meant to do that
Does that mean a thing
If you wanted songs
Then I meant to sing
I'd give you the world

And love you more every day, until you know that

My heart has a history
Of hurtin' those who mean the most to me
Before you get too close to me
I think you oughta know
While other hearts are holdin' on
While other loves are growin' strong
My heart has a history of lettin' go

The first time I looked into your eyes
I knew this moment would arrive
I got a feelin' you're the one
But my heart keeps tryin' to turn and run
The problem is this happens every time

If we can take this one kiss at a time
Maybe we can tame this heart of mine

Completely taken by you
And I was sorry for every man in this world

And left 'em sittin' on the scales

Them bears was a-gettin' smart
They bought up some reinforcements
From the Illinois National Guard

There's armoured cars and tanks and jeeps
And rigs of every size
Yeah them chicken coops was full of bears
And choppers filled the skies
Well we shot the line
We went for broke
With a thousand screaming trucks
And eleven longhaired friends of Jesus
In a chartreuse microbus

Listen, ya wanna put that microbus in behind that suicide jockey?)
(Yeah he's haulin' dynamite and he needs all the help he can get)

Well we laid a strip for the Jersey shore
Prepared to cross the line
I could see the bridge was lined with bears
But I didn't have a doggone dime

We just ain't gonna pay no toll
So we crashed the gate doin' ninety-eight

When I heard my child in prayer.

And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair.

I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

Paul Byrom,"Once in the dear dead days beyond recall,
When on the world the mists began to fall,
Out of the dreams that rose in happy throng
Low to our hearts Love sang an old sweet song;
And in the dusk where fell the firelight gleam,
Softly it wove itself into our dream.

Just a song a twilight, when the lights are low,
And the flickering shadows softly come and go,
Tho' the heart be weary, sad the day and long,
Still to us at twilight comes Love's old song,
Comes Love's old sweet song.

Even today we hear Love's song of yore,

Deep in our hearts it dwells forevermore.
Footsteps may falter, weary grow the way,
Still we can hear it at the close of day.
So till the end, when life's dim shadows fall,
Love will be found the sweetest song of all.

Just a song a twilight, when the lights are low,
And the flickering shadows softly come and go,
Tho' the heart be weary, sad the day and long,
Still to us at twilight comes Love's old song,
Comes Love's old sweet song.",Just a Song at Twilight,2011

That's newly sprung in June

My Lagan love
Where Lagan stream sing lullaby
There blows a lily fair

And like a lovesick lenanshee

She hath my heart in thrall
No life I own, no liberty
For love is lord of all

And sometimes when the beetle horn
Hath lulled the eve to sleep
I steal unto her shieling low

Ghetto, I got these niggaz man
Clue, I'm the first line of defense
(Yeah)
(Yeah)
And I'ma show 'em what that means
(Yeah)

I know these niggaz hoped I wouldn't make it, fuck you
Your hatred only made me wanna cake ya, fuck you
Wherever I see you nigga I'ma buck you
And put a hole in your chest that's big enough to drive a truck through

I bring the drama back where you lives, flatter your wiz
Reload and then point the Mag at your kids
So what I sound remorse, the records I still peep guns on me
But the difference now is only Deserts

If I talk it's gonna be reckless, I'm ready to die
So when I apply pressure, niggaz gon' respect it
Tote guns to rob niggaz, I told 'em to use
And leave enemies of friends that like broken and bruised

They ain't crazy, they just broke and confused, cross me
And they'll be talks of how they found the man smoked on the news
I'ma career crook they used a mug shot from my graduation picture
And my junior high school yearbook

Paul Cain never appear shook
Yeah, I might talk to my enemies but never police
You wanna converse it better be brief, you ain't gotta say much
Show me the money and the cheddar'll speak

If it ain't involvin' bread, I ain't with it
I don't need D's on me, I'm already dodgin' Feds
When the shots from the revolver spread
Duck, I don't discriminate, leave CEO's and artists dead

Make slugs a part of his head
Vanish then pop up in a SL double nickel, scarlet red
Fuck you I'm tryna get my cash right
All my niggaz flip birds and blast pipes, addicted to the fast life

Live everyday like my last night, od'in or X

Bitch you don't wanna swallow semen, fuck you
No you hate the way I'm street dreamin', fuck you
That's why I ridin', clappin', wit the .40 Cal screamin', fuck you

When I pulled the 5 out, I kinda expected
For the back stabbers, to be standin' behind me, wit they knives out
Then the Range, wit the fins drove in
I wasn't shocked to see my foes, dressed in friends clothin'

But I still pull through the sty, wit handguns
As big as the one, Robocop pulled from his thigh
You prolly heard about the bullets I buy and how it look like
I'm throwin' batteries, when the bullets shoot by

So what, you wear a vest, why would I care
If I aim for ya chest, that be a good idea
Nigga, it's nothing to clap ya but I'm more worried
Bout the groupie cops, who wanna put they cuffs on a rappa

That's why I'm limpin' off wit a freak and a lawyer
Who woulda got O.J. Simpson off in a week
I could show you how to blow up on ya own in a Benz
That'll hit a buck and make the windows go up on they own

Wit a stash box compartment for a handgun
That make holes the size of peep holes, on apartment doors
My closet look like department stores and you wonder why
Ya girl's comin' home, wit a cigar sip for

'Cause I just dump the light Dutch, mash the guts
You won't believe how much ass I touch
Who else struts pass the sluts, and a chain wit so much
Ash and cuts, that it hangs much pass the nuts

That's why I get followed by broads wit deeper throats
Then the people at the circus, that be swallowin' swords
Y'all hopin' that the Don fall off but my money's long enough
To keep shootin' ya bank until, ya arms fall off

I'm eatin', and I ain't have to use someone's utinsels
And when you clean as me, you know that every bum is against you
But please don't let someone convince you to test the kid
And get hit wit slugs as long, as a No. 2 Pencil, fucka

I see ya faggot ass schemin', fuck you
Bitch you don't wanna swallow semen, fuck you
No you hate the way I'm street dreamin', fuck you
That's why I ridin', clappin', wit the .40 Cal screamin', fuck you

I'm on a mission to get richer, it's as simple as that
I make it obvious, when I pick up a pencil and rap
Like a .40 Cal, spittin' on instrumentals I clap
And these verses, are like the hollow point I sent through yo back

I get you murdered if I think you a rat
'Cause if you don't show loyalty
Then that show me where ya principles at

I'm right behind 'em in the Porsche drop
Linen soft top, sick chain with 20 point rocks
Take your bitch, why wouldn't I?
The whip got chrome shoes, cream leather seats with old wooden sides

[Fabolous]
Uh, yeah, what's really poppin', usually boys know
This ghetto superstar with the Bruce Lee-roy glow
Niggas has to hate the outcome (yeah)
Plus I'm in a throwback from the same year they assassinated Malcolm

[Paul Cain]
Make so much ends, I got to find faster ways to count 'em (yeah)
A minute on the block, how fast I make a thousand? (Cain)
That nigga you love to hate, still hug blocks and bubble weight
Off the love I can't

[Chorus - Fabolous (Paul Cain)]
Why wouldn't this joint make you want to dance?
Why wouldn't these jewels make you want to glance?
(Why wouldn't this whip make you want to ride?
And why wouldn't this thing be on my side?)
Why wouldn't this game have you on your knees?
Why wouldn't these 20's be on the V's?
(Why wouldn't this money make you want to hate?)
Why wouldn't I what?

[Paul Cain]
Why wouldn't I pull up to the spot, yellow is all (ok)
Dressed in yellow linen, covered in Canaries never a flaw (uh huh)
Why shouldn't I wear this much ice
The Princesses in my hair, are clear and cut, right?
Why wouldn't I talk this slick (why not?)
With a watch and bracelet this flooded, and a cross this sick?
So why wouldn't I get it homes (I mean)
To a nigga gettin' money like myself, a little brain that's minimal (yeah)
Might talk but I live it though, sick chain glitter roll
Never sleep and don't stop gettin' that

[Fabolous]
Uh, hold up Cain, uh, why wouldn't I have samples of raw (uh huh)
And academic sample the laws (uh huh)
Hypnotic samples the poor (woo)
The European sample is all (yeah)
Will on the right side do with the wings stamped on the door
It's the street family boss, I land by the shores
Get pampered by whores, eat scampy and claws
The kid's been trampeled before by a tramp with no flaws 
That's up to they get cramps in they jaws
I keep kefs jammed in the four
Amp meter draw, end up in a wheelchair rammed by your dog

[Chorus - Fabolous (Paul Cain)]
Why wouldn't this joint make you want to dance?
Why wouldn't these jewels make you want to glance?
(Why wouldn't this whip make you want to ride?
And why wouldn't this thing be on my side?)
Why wouldn't this game have you on your knees?
Why wouldn't these 20's be on the V's?
(Why wouldn't this money make you want to hate?)
Why wouldn't I huh? Why wouldn't I what?

[Fabolous]
After a million scanned on it (yeah)
Why wouldn't the Range look like it got 20-inch ceiling fans on it (woo)
Only reason you in my face ma'am
Is cause i got the same mic/mike stat Jordan had on the ""Space Jam""

[Paul Cain]
Why wouldn't I chase chips
Come through Aves, like ""Pluto Nash"" in Coupes that look like spaceships
Ridiculous bracelet and the outrageous 
Watch with flawless rocks, invisible placement

[Fabolous]
Uh, I oughta feel like a boss (uh huh)
Why wouldn't I get a 100 an appearance, quarter mil a endorse
I oughta feel some remorse
Cause I'm killin' 'em out there, and a stick shift sport utility Porsche

[Paul Cain]
Yeah, I know when you see us, it be pissin' you off
Cause you would think we paid a fortune for the shit that we floss
Spend summers in my Sicily loft 
Whole crib, interior decoration done by Christian Dior
(Baby girl), I got cops that's on the payroll
Jet skies, and speed boats docked up in Barbados

Green and cream Tims, brocolli and potatoes 
Why wouldn't you see the Storm for the rocks and these tornadoes

Paul Cain,"[Fabolous & (Cop)]
(Alright there ah buddy license and registration
Uh officer is there a problem man what's going on?
(Yeah, I had a report of a UFO
What's that?
(An unidentified Ferrari looking object flying by me on the highway
You know how fast you were going?)
Nah not at all man
(you must have been going pretty damn fast because my radar is over there smoking buddy
Keep your hands where I can fucking see 'em too
I heard about you in the paper, I know you got the toaster strudel 
Yeah I need some backup over here I've got two rap singers)

[Fabolous]
I wonder briefly
Could it be there's no roof above me
Or the 22's underneath me
That's keeping them sirens flashing on my ass
Should I get to pumping the brakes or mashing on the gas?
I'm naturally harassed
And I feel like I'm getting punked, but I don't see Ashton in the grass
Nor is there a camera stashed into the dash
It's a guy in a uniform and a passion that he has
For flashing wit his badge
And shining light in my face
Plus he keep his right hand right by his waist
The wrong move will get a gun right in my face
And they fighting for my life, I'm fighting the case
And I ain't trying to be the story they twist in the press
Like: the young man resisted arrest
Then he started reaching for something that looks like a pistol I guess
So I pulled on a nigga I mean I pulled on the trigger...figures

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I go around the corner what do I see?
Po Po's following me
Asking for my ID who's car I'm driving
Po Po's bothering me
Got me in a lineup, got my hands in cuffs
They don't want to set me free
Trying to bring me down, when they come around
Po Po's fucking with me

[Cain]
Awe shit the jakes are fucking with me again
They hate to see me rich, they'd rather see me stuck in the pen
Every time they walk or pull up beside me
Flash lights in my face asking for my registration and ID
I don't know the reason for the harassment
And the questions they asking
Or the ice grills they get when I'm passing
Or maybe its my fault
Cause I be out all times at night
Doing shit I know I shouldn't plus I don't be ridin right
Smokin' lye, no stash box for me to put the skit
Two warrants, no license and I ain't got insurance yet
I keep a hammer close because foes want to stick me up
But keep my movement swift because Po's want to frisk me up
Since '94 I've been told on by 50 descriptions
And in 10 years not once did they get a conviction
These pigs shouldn't provoke a rider
I'm so tired, they got one more time to fuck wit me before I open fire

[Nate Dogg]
Ones for the money and twos for the show
Three must be for the motherfucking po po'
I've seen ghetto kings fall to the floor
Cause they can't see ask 
(still some of y'all creepin with the Po Po's
Sleepin wit the Po Po's
Some of y'all walking wit the Po Po's
I ain't fuckin with the Po Po's)

[Fabolous]
Bitch!
They gon' have to put my back on the cement
Before I'm in the back with my knee bent
On my way back to the precinct
I'm back in the G-bent
Black wit the pre-tint
Vanilla aroma to cover the back with the tree scent
The way I ride I know I'm in for a case
But the coupe do 200 so they in for a chase
When it comes to lawyers I got the man Puff uses
That's why you never seen my wrists with handcuff bruises
I got them hollow tips, to stick up in the are's
Detectors in the dash, to pick up on the radar
Stash box in it when I purchased the vehicle
So I don't have a problem wit you searching the vehicle
They probably want to scoop an arrest
I try to throw shots but its cool, I got a coupe like a vest
And 'em troopers will just feel stupid I guess
The slugs will bounce off like they hitting superman's chest, nigga

Shit man a nigga ain't even do shit awe shit here comes this dude right now

Alright buddy unfortunately you came back straight, you and your buddy
Scain Scholar get the fuck outta here I don't want to see you guys around here again alright

Look
Like Michael J. Fox, I got +Family Ties+
Posing us can't be wise
Swept across the family dies
Something small as a look, can bring about a man's demise
And whoever he stands beside, hit him where he can't survive
Throw the drop, or slip an object, if not then missing
Nine shot, pop a clip in, pine box the opposition
Put him in formal dress, right hand across the left
No autopsy necessary, determined the cause of death
Six shots across the chest should explain his loss of breath
Skin peeled off your flesh, I know you wish you wore a vest
That's a no brainer, I'm coming with both flamers
I'll spray 'em, but I'm no painter
To this here, I'm no stranger
It's obvious you no bangers
You dudes pose no danger
Your whole crew chumps, in the closet like coat hangers
Like purple broke up in the dutch
Leave you broke up on a crush
That's what happens when shooters choke up in the clutch
We gonna body you, and have to hook your wife to an I.V. too

Throw the old woman out!

What's my secret? 
Frankly, dear — forgive my candor 
Family secret
All to do with herbs
Things like being 
Careful with your coriander
That's what makes the gravy grander

Eat them slow and 
Feel the crust, how thin I (she) rolled it! 
Eat them slow, 'cos 
Every one's a prize! 
Eat them slow, 'cos 
That's the lot and now we've sold it! 
Come again tomorrow

Hold it
Bless my eyes 
Fresh supplies! 

How about it, dearie? 
Be here in a twinkling! 
Just confirms my theory
Toby
God watches over us
Didn't have an inkling
Positively eerie

Is that a pie 
Fit for a king
A wondrous sweet 
And most delectable thing? 
You see, ma'am, why 
There is no meat pie

My nights and days are grey 
If I reached out and touched the rain

I could start another day 
But how many, just don't know 
You're the reason the sun shines down 
And the nights, they don't grow cold 
Only you that I'll hold when I'm young 
Only you as we grow old

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts

It may have a new perspective
On a different day

All the things I had to say

I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye",The Living Years,1994
Paul Carrack,"Do roo, do roo, do roo, do roo do...                                     
                             
Oh how happy (you have made me)
Oh how happy (you have made me)
I have kissed your lips
A thousand times
And more times than i can count
I have called you mine
You have stood by me
In my darkest hours
Sing
Oh how happy (you have made me)
Oh how happy (you have made me)
Oh how happy (you have made me)
Oh how happy (you have made me)
In our years together
We've got stormy weathers
But our love has been so strong
For some how we carry on
Sing
Oh how happy (you have made me)
Oh how happy (you have made me), ooh, ooh
You brought joy
To my empty life, yeah
And all that was wrong
You made it right
Our love (our love)
Our love (our love)
Our love, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Oh how happy (you have made me)
Oh how happy (you have made me)
Oh how happy (oh how happy)
Oh how happy (oh how happy)
Oh how happy, ooh... You...
You have made me (you have made me)
You have made me (you have made me)
You have made me (you have made me)
",Oh How Happy,1994
Paul Carrack,"Take the children and yourself
And hide out in the cellar
By now the fighting will be closed at hand
Don't believe the church and state
And everything they tell you
Believe in me, I'm with the high command

Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?

There's a gun and ammunition
Just inside the doorway
Use it only in emergency
Better you should pray to God
The father and the spirit
Will guide you and protect from up here

Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?

Swear allegiance to the flag
Whatever flag they offer
Never hint at what you really feel
Teach the children quietly
For someday sons and daughters
Will rise up and fight while we stood still

Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?

Can you hear me, can you hear me running?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me running, can you hear me calling you?
Can you hear me?

Hear me calling you
Can you hear me running, hear me running, babe?
Can you hear me running, hear me running?
Calling you, calling you",Silent Running (On Dangerous Ground),1994
