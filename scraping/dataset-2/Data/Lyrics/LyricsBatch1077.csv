Tammy Wynette,"Wouldn't it be fine if you could say you love me
Just one time with a sober mind?
Wouldn't that be fine, now wouldn't that be fine?

Wouldn't it be great if you could love me first
And let the bottle wait?
Now wouldn't that be great, now wouldn't that be great?

Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Lord, it's for our sake, now wouldn't that be great?

In the name of love, what's the man so great?
Keep thinking of, in the name of love
What a man he was

Love went to waste when the sexy lace couldn't turn his face
The bottle took my place, love went to waste

Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break
Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Lord, it's for our sake, now wouldn't that be great?

Wouldn't it be good? And I know you could if you just would
Wouldn't that be good? Lord, I know you could

Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break

Wouldn't it be great, hey, hey, wouldn't that be great?
Lord, it's for our sake, now wouldn't that be great?

Tammy Wynette,"Every breath you take and every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take, I'll be watching you
Every single day and every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay, I'll be watching you

Oh, can't you see you belong to me
How my poor heart aches with every step you take

Every move you make, every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake, I'll be watching you

Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying, ""Baby, baby, please""

Oh, can't you see you belong to me
How my poor heart aches with every step you take

Every move you make and every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake, I'll be watching you
Every move you make, every step you take, I'll be watching you

I'll be watching you
Every breath you take and every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take (I'll be watching you)
Every single day and every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay (I'll be watching you)
Every move you make, every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake (I'll be watching you)
Every single day and every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay (I'll be watching you)

Every breath you take and every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take (I'll be watching you)

Every game you play, every night you stay (I'll be watching you)

Every game you play, every night you stay (I'll be watching you)",Every Breath You Take,1994
Tammy Wynette,"Maybe you'll wanna give me kisses sweet
But only for one night with no repeat.
And maybe you'll go away and never call,
And a taste of honey is worse that none at all.
Oh little girl!

In that case I don't want nobody
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion,
I second that emotion.
So, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion.

Maybe you'll think that love will tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around.
Or maybe you'll think that love will make us fools,
And so it makes you wise to break the rules.
Oh little girl!

In that case I don't want nobody
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion,
I second that emotion.
So, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion.

Tammy Wynette,"If you were to wake up 
And I were beside you 
Would you gently smile dear 
And whisper my name 
And would you remember 
The way that I held you 
And would you want me 
To hold you again 

Time reaches to you 
Just like a willow 
That bends to the water 
And clings to the shore 
And there was a time dear 
That once you did love me 
And there was a time 
You loved me no more 

Rain on your window 
Light on your pillow 
The way you lie sleeping 
Is it like before 
For there was a time dear 
That once you did love me 
And there was a time 
You loved me no more",If You Were to Wake Up,1994
Tammy Wynette,"I put my little girl to bed with teardrops in her eyes
All day I've tried to comfort her and louder were her cries

I left her there to say her prayers and stepped outside the door
The prayer I heard was one I knew I'd never heard before

Please have my mommy ask my daddy to come home
Sometimes I try and get my way and mommy's so alone
She told me once that when I'm right I never should give in
So if at first I don't succeed I'll cry cry again

I know our little girl is right and we're both in the wrong
And so I've called you up tonight to ask you please come home
I can't go on or stand for long the way she cries today
And I can't go to sleep tonight because I heard her pray
Please have my mommy","Cry, Cry Again",1995

How long has it been?
Sure, I still think of you

Somehow I knew that you still would

More than I ever thought I could.

And I almost forgot how much I missed you
Seein' you has torn me all apart
Yes, I almost forgot how much I missed you
'Til your memory reminded my heart.

Thought love would change in time
Out of sight ain't out of mind
Oh, but some things never change
When it comes to you, I've found.

Your eyes are still as blue
And you smile the same way, too
And now it's all come back to me
Why I love you like I do.

Was the only place I thought I'd ever be
Next to you

You know he makes me happy
He's the first I ever wanted, next to you.

We are gathered together in the presence of god and these witnesses

Tammy Wynette,"In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the wedding rings
There on display

She smiles n' nods her head
As he says, ""Honey that's for you,
It's not much, but it's the best
That I can do""

Golden rings (golden ring) with one tiny little stone
Waiting there (waiting there) for someone to take you home
By itself (by itself) it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring

In a little wedding chapel later on that afternoon
An old upright piano plays that old familiar tune

Tears roll down her cheeks
And happy thoughts run through her head
As he whispers low, ""With this ring, I thee wed""

Golden ring (golden ring) with one tiny little stone
Shining ring (shining ring) now at last it's found a home
By itself (by itself) it's just a cold metallic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring

As they fought their final round
He says, ""You won't admit it,
But I know you're leavin' town""

She says, ""One thing's for certain,
I don't love you any more""
And throws down the ring
As she walks out the door

We didn't find it there so we moved on
I'd followed you to Alabam things look good in Birmingham

I know you're tired of following my elusive dreams and schemes
For they're only fleeting things my elusive dreams
I had your child in Memphis you heard of work in Nashville
We didn't find it there so we moved on
To a small farm in Nebraska to a gold mine in Alaska
We didn't find it there so we moved on

Tammy Wynette,"Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
Giving all your love to just one man.
You'll have bad times
And he'll have good times, 
Doin' things that you don't understand
 
But if you love him you'll forgive him,
Even though he's hard to understand
And if you love him oh be proud of him,
'Cause after all he's just a man  
 
Stand by your man,
Give him two arms to cling to,
And something warm to come to 
When nights are cold and lonely
 
Stand by your man,
And show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can

Her hair is just like, and she measures
But someday I'll fill in the lines when she and I are free
And we'll walk in the sunshine and me

And he'll kill the man who messes with his wife

Well, I've had the lit end of a cigar pressed against my belly
Whupped upon with a crowbar till my eyeball turned to jelly
Accidentally nailed my index finger to the wall
Cut off half my toes and soaked my foot in alcohol
Well I've had my pelvis ruptured by an angry kangaroo
But nothing's ever hurt me half as bad as losing you

Well, it's not because you measure fifty, twenty, forty-four
It's surely not because you own a chain of liquor stores
It's not because your daddy is the richest man in town
It's just that I've grown used to you and having you around

I've had my parents tell me son we don't love you at all
I've seen my sister's name written on a washroom wall
My best friend set my barn on fire and burned my horse to death
I went out with a girl who told me, ""George you've got bad breath""

Your way in and boy I know how

You tell me that I'm your only

If I'm supposed to be your lady

Tell me where, where'd you get the nerve
To even think I'd do you could play me for

'Cause we both know now, oh no

And look who's laughing now

Now you're trying to use us
Against one another but it won't work 
I see right through your game boy
And I know exactly where the blame falls

You, you try to deny all your actions
For once in your life be a real man
At least give me the proper respect of the truth
I already know you did it

Why should I believe anything you say
And how could you treat me that way
Where'd you get the nerve to even think that you 
You could play me boy

Now I see right through you baby
You try to tell me you want me 
Can't you just get it through your thick head

Tamyra Gray,"I was only 17 when he
Came around and passed my way
He was the finest thing I'd ever seen
And his eyes were green
Him and the boys played basketball
While I was chillin at the park
He had a smile that could shine a light
On your darkest days
He came up to me and said
Excuse me what's your name
I was just wondering if you would like 2 get away

[Chorus]
Do you remember me?
At the age of 17
You fell in love with me
But it was never ever meant to be

Later on as we got to know each other
I just wanted this day to last forever
But as I learned more bout him
I wondered if I'd ever see him again
There was something bout the way he made me feel
It felt as though the whole world were standing still
And when we talked I could see 
He was the perfect man for me
When he took me home that night
I knew that I was gone
He walked me to my door
And that's when I started to write this song

[Chorus]

Do you remember me?
At the age of 17
You fell in love with me
But it was never ever meant to be

Do you remember me?
I was only 17
Lived my life so wild and free
But it was never ever meant to be

I fell in love the moment I laid my eyes on him
But that's just the problem
'Cause he was already in a relationship
He said he wasn't happy
It wasn't working 
And I reminded him of the way that she used to be
He said he couldn't stay and that was just the way
At the sweet age of 17

Tamyra Gray,"Pretty brown eyed girl
She's so sweet and naive
She met a boy fell in love
Carved their name out in a tree
What a perfect memory
There's a swing out by the creek
They would meet there
He put a rose in her hair
Then she kissed him on the cheek

Those were the days of innocence
When a boy just liked a girl
But we didn't know the difference
We were livin in our own world

All alone and then I close my eyes
I think back to that time of my life
When everything that meant anything was you
Messed things up grew up a little too fast
I knew it was much too good to last
'cause the only thing that meant anything was you

After church one Sunday morning
Near the bottom of the stairs
Hair pressed a pretty white dress
Playing a game of truth or dare
I can still hear my momma saying
Child you need to pray
I knew it was wrong 
But it's been so long
Since I felt that way

Those were the days of innocence
When a boy just liked a girl
But we didn't know the difference

When everything that meant anything was you
Messed things up grew up a little too fast
I knew it was much too good to last

Starry skies under the moonlight
You and I two fireflies enchanted by the night
When I see a rainbow dance across the sky
I feel all warm inside 
I get teary eyed
Makes me think about you and I

All alone and then I close my eyes

Take me as I am

Y entre mis sueños te añoro (aja) 
Recuerdo aquel momento 
En que tu y yo eramos novios 
Vuelve conmigo te imploro 
Dejemos los rencores 
Dejemos atras el odio (tu sabes) 
Tu me tocabas con placer y deseo 
Yo devorándote la piel te halo el pelo 

Oye mami 
 
Yo te quiero tu me quieres 
Entonces porque ya no vienes 
Si sabes que por ti me muero 
Yo te quiero (me huele a dinero) 
Tu me quieres (aja) 
Entonces porque ya no vienes 
Si sabes que por ti me muero 

Entre tu y yo 
Han cambiado tanto las cosas 
Y hoy siento un gran dolor (sin miedo Jayco) 
Y un gran espacio 
Aquí en mi corazón eh
Y ahora necesito tu calor 
Amor, vuelve conmigo 
Quiero hacerte el amor 

Yo te quiero (tu sabes) 
Tu me quieres (oye bebe) 
Entonces porque ya no vienes 
Si sabes que por ti me muero (vuelve) 
Yo te quiero (aja) 
Tu me quieres (si tu me quieres) 
Entonces porque ya no vienes 
Si sabes que por ti me muero 

Señoras y señores no pueden negar 
Que en este momento se estan transportandose 
A otra dimension 
Llegaron los que viven en marte 
W y Yandel y el nuevo 
Jayco Jayco 
Que no se te olvide el nombre OK

I saw a flower glowing in the dark.
It looked so pretty and it was unique;
I had to bend down just to have a peek.

[Chorus:]
Hello old friend,
It's really good to see you once again.
Hello old friend,
It's really good to see you once again.

I saw you walking underneath the stars;
I couldn't stop 'cause I was in a car.
I'm sure the distance wouldn't be too far
If I got out and walked to where you are.

An old man passed me on the street today;
I thought I knew him but I couldn't say.
I stopped to think if I could place his frame.
When he tipped his hat I knew his name.

And my divine ALTHEA brings to whisper at my grates
When I lie tangled in her hair and fettered with her eye
Birds that wanton in the air know no such liberty
When flowing cups run swiftly round with no allaying THAMES
Our careless heads with roses crowned, our hearts with royal flames
When first decreeth in wine we steep when healths and rafts run free
Fishes that tipple in the deep know no such liberty
Stone walls do not a prison make not iron bars a gate
Minds innocent and quiet take that as a hermitage
If I have freedom in my love and in my soul am free
Angels alone that soar above enjoy such liberty",To Althea From Prison,2017

Tangerine Dream,"When I talk to the trees
O great trees who have learned to speak slowly
I know that they believe that they have an answer
Then I walk in the city where I cannot hear it

When I talk to the city
I have already learned three answers
Before I call the question
And slowly, I wish myself among trees
But can not hear myself wishing

When I talk to the people
Who are the trees that grow in the city
They reply with a fond kindness, slowly
But there is no answer
For experience to be made by mistake

Upon this key, time will slide,
Beyond the lock, you lose your mind.
And as our door becomes open,
A rush of sound is found inside
Creating dreams that pass you by.

You may live through your life a long long time
But you will never know from where it came,
Yet all you've seen is what you've wanted to,
You're walking forward as you look behind,
Still watching those old memories fade and die

This door is heavy, and is deeply stained,
With wasted tears, that try to fight in vain,
You may be sitting, feeling quite secure,
But listen carefully, and this key is yours 
For we can lead you far beyond that door

There are dangers hidden, trust in that language
And it is precisely this conception that which must not be changed
The epitome of our language is patterns containment of thought and sound
Shouting nonsense words
I die to fight!!
I die to fight!!
I die to fight!!
Shouting nonsense words

Upon this key, time will slide,
Beyond each lock, you lose your mind.
And as our door becomes open,
A rush of sound is found inside

Und seine feine zerstieben
And his enemies dissintegrate

Und die Ihn hassen and those who hate him
Fliehen vor seinem angesicht flee from his sight

Und leben entsteht and life begins to form

Und entzuende in jedem das and light in everyone the

Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?

And what shoulder, and what art
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat
What dread hand and what dread feet?
What the hammer? What the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? What dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?
When the stars threw down their spears
And water'd heaven with their tears
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?

Tangerine Dream,"I wander thro' each charter'd street
Near where the charter'd Thames does flow
And mark in every face I meet
Marks of weakness, marks of woe
In every cry of every Man
In every Infant's cry of fear
In every voice, in every ban
The mind-forg'd manacles I hear:
How the Chimney-sweeper's cry
Every black'ning Church appalls
And the hapless Soldier's sigh
Runs in blood down Palace walls
But most thro' midnight streets I hear
How the youthful Harlot's curse
Blasts the new born Infant's tear
And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse

Rise and look out; his chains are loose, his dungeon doors are open
And let his wife and children return from the oppressor's scourge
They look behind at every step and believe it is a dream

And the fair Moon rejoices in the clear and cloudless night

Tangerine Dream,"There is a smile of love,
And there is a smile of deceit;
And there is a smile of smiles
In which these two smiles meet.
And there is a frown of hate,
And there is a frown of disdain;
And there is a frown of frowns
Which you strive to forget in vain,
For it sticks in the heart's deep core,
And it sticks in the deep backbone;
And no smile that ever was smiled,
But only one smiles alone
That betwixt the cradle and grave
It only once smiled can be;
But when it once is smiled
There's no end to misery.",Smile,1996

Tanglefoot,"A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one day
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing lay
A few moments passed till she saw it
For it's feathers were covered with sand
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small hand

She happily gave her last peso
On a cage made of rushes and twine
She fed it loose corn from the market
And watched it grow stronger with time

Now the Christmas Eve service was coming
And the church shone with tinsel and light
And all of the townfolk brought presents
To lay by the manger that night
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a king
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to bring

She waited till just before midnight
So no one could see her go in
And crying she knelt by the manger
For her gift was unworthy of Him

Then a voice spoke to her through the darkness
Maria, what brings you to me
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door, let me see
Though she trembled, she did as he asked her
And out of the cage the bird flew
Soaring into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as new

Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started to sing
A song that no words could recapture
Whose beauty was fit for a king

Now Maria felt blessed just to listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and long
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's song",Gift,1996

Shadows painting the ceiling
Gazing at the fire glow

From [the] California to the [Staten] New York Island,
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf stream waters,
[God blessed America for me.]
As I went walking that ribbon of highway
And saw above me that endless skyway,
And saw below me the golden valley, I said:
[God blessed America for me.]

I roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts,
And all around me , a voice was sounding:
[God blessed America for me.]

Was a high wall there that tried to stop me
A sign was painted said: Private Property,
But on the back side it didn't say nothing
[God blessed America for me.]

When the sun come shining, then I was strolling
In wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling;
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting:
[God blessed America for me.]

One bright sunny morning in the shadow of the steeple
By the Relief Office I saw my people
As they stood hungry, I stood there wondering if

Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Tango For Four,"Si supieras
Que aún dentro de mi alma
Conservo aquel cariño
Que tuve para ti...!
Quién sabe, si supieras
Que nunca te he olvidado...!
Volviendo a tu pasado
Te acordarás de m? ..

Los amigos ya no vienen
Ni siquiera a visitarme;
Nadie quiere consolarme
En mi aflicción;
Desde el día que te fuiste
Siento angustias en mi pecho;
Dec? percanta, qu? has hecho
De mi pobre corazón!

Sin embargo
Yo siempre te recuerdo
Con el cariño santo
Que tuve para ti;
Why estás dentro de mi alma,
Pedazo de mi vida,
En la ilusión querida
Que nunca olvidar?

Al cotorro abandonado
Ya ni el sol de la mañana
Asoma por la ventana,
Como cuando estabas vos...
Why aquel perrito compañero
Que por tu ausencia no comía
Al verme solo, el otro día,
También me dej?

If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball

Ain't it sad
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me

So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same

Tango Group,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris

Tania,"The only aphrodisiac I need is your voice
Hearing you speak my name
Beckoning me to answer
Telling me you want me
So I tell you that you're the answer to every question I've ever had about love


Without words I use my tongue to tell the tale of us
Tracing your shadowscape
Kneeling before you my eyes feast upon your masculinity and
All its divinity and I praise you
Because all of that is for me


I begin to indulge myself of your delicacies
Digesting semi-sweet dark chocolate decadence as it melts
Dripping down my chin
Your taste is something Godiva couldn't re-create


Needing every atom of your anatomy
Necessity is placed upon me knowing you are the source of my serendipity
Dipping in and out of me stroking more than my consciesness
Subconsciously I find myself rewinding our love scenes
In my daydreams
Seeing that face you make when you're making me cum
And it makes me want you right there and then


Thinking of you in inappropriate places I get
Tingling sensations in private locations where I wish to be caught between a rock and your hard place


As wetness develops my legs begin to open and my spot turns to a backdraft and all I want you to do is extinguish it
You know my body like the back of your hands
And touch me and send me into ecstacy


My thighs quiver in anticipation of deep penetration which gets me high
Body rising
Sweating
Panting
Make-up melting
Pulling my hair and
Scratching my back
I get a temporary case of tourettes because all I can say are four letter words in a four octave-range screaming your name

Aye papi.... *English Translation of Spanish Lyrics* ""You are so big and so hard, you give it to me so good, you are my mortal sin.""


You fucking me makes me bilingual
You fucking me makes me bilingual
You fucking me makes me bilingual
You fucking me makes me bilingual
You fucking me makes me bilingual


I see your tongue pink between your lips and I want it between mine
And I struggle
As you lick torturing me
I try to get away but
Not really


Running out of room begging for more up against the wall that has been scuffed by my stilletos
Again
You pry apart my thighs and tell me to be still
And I willingly submit to you because I love the way you dominate me
Demanding that I cum for you so I do as I'm told


You've molded me so I'm good to no-one else but you
You've conquered this once orgasmicless world and multiplied it
Again and
Again

My face radiates with after-glow
My pillow scented by you
A fragrance which haunts me
My room smells of the best sex


Covered in body prints and finger prints and you above me
Your name written indelibly upon my body in your genetic history


You fucking me makes me bilingual
You fucking me makes me bilingual
You fucking me makes me bilingual
You fucking me makes me bilingual
You fucking me makes me bilingual
You fucking me makes me bilingual
You fucking me makes me bilingual
You fucking me makes me bilingual

Otra de manera de sufrir
Otra manera de vivir

Qué pasara, adónde irán mis juegos a parar
Y mi inocencia a terminar

Qué tal si me querrá

Qué voy a hacer si dice no
Ya yo no mando al corazón
Qué confusión, qué dicha, qué dolor

Siento al mirar que todo acaba de cambiar
Y veo las cosas para amar

Tania Libertad,"Somos novios
Pues los dos sentimos
Mutuo amor profundo
Y con eso ya ganamos
Lo mas grande de este mundo

Nos amamos
Nos besamos como novios
Nos deseamos
Y hasta a veces
Sin motivos, sin razón
Nos enojamos

Somos novios
Mantenemos un cariño
Limpio y puro
Como todos
Procuramos el momento
Mas oscuro

Para hablarnos, para darnos
El mas dulce de los besos

Son los cerezos

Como se extrañan las noches sin estrellas

Cuando hace mucho frío

En esas noches que no concilio el sueño
No te imaginas, amor, cómo te extraño

Te extraño 
En cada paso que siento solitario
Cada momento que estoy viviendo a diario
Estoy muriendo, amor, porque te extraño

Te extraño 
Cuando la aurora comienza a dar colores
Con tus virtudes, con todos tus errores
Por lo que quieras, no sé, pero te extraño

Ojala, que se acaben tus penas
Que te digan que yo ya no existo
Y conoscas personas mas buenas

Que te den lo que no pude darte
Aunque yo te haya dado de todo

Te adore te perdi ya nimodo

Cuantas cosas quedaron prendidas
Hasta dentro del fondo del alma
Cuantas luces dejaste encendidas
Yo no se, como voy, a apagarlas

Ojala que mi amor no te duela
Y te olvides de mi para siempre
Que se llenen de sangre tus venas
Y conoscas una vida de suerte

Yo no se si tu ausencia me mate
Aunque tengo mi pecho de acero
Pero nadie me llame cobarde
Sin saber hasta donde la quiero

Nos vamos a querer toda la vida

De un nuevo día

Podemos ser felices todavía

Buscamos un rincón cerca del cielo
Si nos dejan
Haremos con las nubes terciopelo

Y ahi juntitos los dos
Cerquita de Dios
Será lo que soñamos

Te llevo de la mano corazón
Y ahi nos vamos

De todo lo demás los olvidamos

Tania Maxwell Clements,"Well the street lights shine
Down on Blessing Avenue
Lovers they walk by
Holdin' hands two by two

A breeze crosses the porch
Bicycle spokes spin 'round
Jacket's on, I'm out the door
Tonight I'm gonna burn this town down

And the girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
The girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by

Kid's rubber ball smacks
Off the gutter 'neath the lamp light
Big bank clock chimes
Off go the sleepy front porch lights

Downtown the store's alive
As the evening's underway
Things been a little tight
But I know they're gonna turn my way

And the girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
The girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by

Frankie's Diner's
Over on the edge of town
Neon sign spinnin' round
Like a cross over the lost and found

Fluorescent lights
Flicker above Bob's Grill
Shaniqua brings a coffee and asks ""fill?""
And says ""penny for your thoughts now my boy Bill""

She went away
She cut me like a knife
Hello beautiful thing
Maybe you could save my life

In just a glance
Down here on Magic Street
Love's a fool's dance
I ain't got much sense but I still got my feet

Brough up on love and the reasons why

It's a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful thing
It's a beautiful, beautiful thing

Chances, changes are all that you have
As you take the hard stuff and lie on your back
The smoothness, strangeness
Fits like a glove
But the comfort of tease
Still rises above

I love you
I love you
I love you

But is it possible, possible, possible babe?
Is it possible for you and me?

Are the images that lead to the clues of why

Tanita Tikaram,"Today is my birthday
I stay outside the hall
Inside sit the butterflies
For the butterfly ball

All the boys are graded now
They come in their white socks, flat tops
And somehow they find a placr
All the boys are winning now
They play all the tricks with smiles
And a sorry past
For poor caw

Their own room
And winter tales
Never touched these girls before
They hear the car stereo
And know what life is for

All the boys are weary now
listening to the family sing song
Family say so

Must carve, must carve poor cow
Slice her, slice her up, poor cow
Slice her, slice her up, poor cow
Slice her, slice her up, poor cow

And your stance is akin to broken hearts
You've grown weary - I'm not weary
I can take your part

It's eye-open time, sailor
When they want you to pretend
You were inside that playground
You may be old - but not so old

That I can't see
See your old freinds and it's as fresh as dew
But see what's new and it's all the same to you
Now I'm not choosy and I'm just half grown

I took the old man - I gave the old man
I took the old man back home

Safe with us to serenade
To hang around your black scarf and black ways
I have ""no idea"" he said, ""no idea of what I'll do""

And talking less - it chases home
It chases dreams - but I have really no reason, no goal and so

If you ""want to"" help us make it

Unless it's all alone

Take my word on this

Just to take me home
To your serious house, with your serious tones
You're a serious man, with a serious smile
But the summer is hot and I might surprise you
In a very short while we'll have left them behind
With their faces quite pained
As they try to remind themselves
Oh, it's really so wrong
It's really so out
And it's really not cool to take a young girl about
And I know the young man with a century's face
A philosopher king - he will try to amaze
With examples of love and examples of hate
And to see them explode
We will just have to

But first I'll tell you about mine

But the problem's complex
When you keep holding back
We could talk for an hour
We could talk for a day
But the people we know would still have their say
Talk of such virtuous women
Talk of such noble men
But if I'm on the level I have met none of them
Oh, I've met troubled people with deep and dark thoughts
Who have hallowed my name
And sworn I will get caught
But why waste real feeling and
Why waste our time
To let the earth bow to no virtue of
It's a simple love story
It grows better all the time
You can tell me all about it
But first I'll tell you about mine
You know it's alright to just make mistakes
But to tail in with hurt - is the gravest make
We all create lives which we don't understand
But to point the accused is a job for no man
And we curse our own longing - and curse our own ways

That it's all growing

Was just another kind of walk with me

But see you, you never leave it if you have to touch

And I will always be waiting with a happy smile

We waste some time
Supposing, I let you

Enter, kisses not able
Not able to turn some tricks
Not able to give me favors
Not even when I'm thick with it

And my heart wasn't a stranger
But it sure made no sense to me
Made no sense to any flavors that came
Sown in so cautiously

Hey, hearts still yearn to
Make a sign
Watching
You send me in mind, mind, mind, mind

Well, our old stairs are all the same
The same weather, the same wood stain
You can beep from the left
You can beep from the right
Put it outside and let them turn wide
Put it outside and let them turn wide

Well, no respect, no leniency
Was not ever so well spooked in me
Was not evil so it hangs okay

Is that I might be losing you

And now I stare across the dirty river
And I'm sure upon this bridge I'll see you
'Cause I dreamt I'd kiss you up there

What I didn't know back then
Is how great the sin
How time goes so slowly

Is that I might be needing you

Yeah I might be needing you

I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine 
With letters to be read and heaps of paper waiting to be signed 
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so the usual place, the usual 
Bunch and still on top of this I'm pretty sure 
It must have rained the day before you came 
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two 
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue 
I must have kept on dragging 

Through the business of the day and without really knowing anything I hid

A matter of routine I've done it ever since 
I finished school the train back home again undoubtedly 
I must have read the evening paper then 

Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame the day before you came 
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so 
And stopped along the way to buy some chinese food to go 
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on tv there's not, 
I think, a single episode of dallas that I didn't see 
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten 

I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then 
I must have read a while the latest one by marilyn french or something in that style 
It's funny but I had no sense of living without aim

I'd be letting down the side

Lord knows I'll find a way
Through the sleepless city, its weary face
Holding you

Do you feel love is just a word I say sometimes
Do you feel love is just a word I say
For I feel so far from knowing
I feel so far from knowing
I feel so far from knowing
I feel so far

All my life I'll be running
From the things that I never done
All my life I'll be running
Keep me from harm",Love Is Just a Word,2005
Tanita Tikaram,"You've got me going, for all your lies
You've got me going, the hoop is wide
I keep believing, and what have I gained?
So play me again

You've got me running, all over town
You've got me running, so deep am I bound
To talk of love is only to flatter
Play me again
Please play me again
In the night time's wandering, that's where I hide
For in its blush I am alive
Searching for your light
Searching for you light

In the beginning, the word is hot

Tanja Solnik,"Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio dos luceros, que cuando los abro,
Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco
Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado
Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el oido que en todo su ancho
Graba noche y dia, grillos y canarios,
Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos,
Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario;
Con el las palabras que pienso y declaro:
Madre, amigo, hermano, y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados;
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos,
Playas y desiertos, montanas y llanos,
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano,
Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto
Asi yo distingo dicha de quebranto,
Los dos materiales que forman mi canto,
Y el canto de ustedes que es mi mismo canto,
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto
Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tant",Gracias a La Vida,2009

Some say it's a lot of nerve

We have been bucked and we have been scorned
We have been treated bad, talked about as just bones
But just as it takes two eyes to make a pair, ha
Brother we can't quit until we get our share

Slide your hand in my pants if you want to grab it
Bet as soon as you touch it, you call me ""Big"" Daddy
Want to lick all over you before I let you have it
Hold your legs open for me so I can really pack it
I'm already rock hard, you ain't gotta jack it
Bet the tip of this tongue make you really like it
Picture us on the floor with no clothes on
You eatin me, I'm eatin you, shit we both grown
Let you ride me tonight off your favorite song
Tonight a special night, baby a freak is born

Seeing how a goon move, got you wantin to chase me

See if I could make you nut without even fucking you
Feel me pushing up against ya, then go on and rub it
Now you mad you wanna fuck, I can tell how you cussin
Just a couple minutes ago, you wasn't fucking nothing
Now you pressing up against me because that pussy gushing

It's bloodshed, feel the cracks in my city streets
I'm from the crack of them city streets
Used to sell crack in them city streets, born in Blood nigga
In a coma five days, life of a thug nigga
Momma ain't show, grandma almost pulled the plugged the nigga
Used to pull the gun out, just because of 'cause niggas
Five shots to the head 'cause I'm a Blood nigga
Nothin' brewing but suwoo'ing where the fuck I'm from
You lucky if you make it out of Compton, ask Andre Young
Smell the scent of dead bodies ridin' down Green Leaf
No peace so don't get caught up with no piece
Fuck Fatburger, we cooking that real beef
Momma's mourning they sons, I'm talking real grief
Real funerals of them lost Juveniles
Trying to be generals, be missing your dinner now, huh
Say it's a blessing when you die in ya sleep
'Cause the coroner don't need no sheets, capishe
I'm sayin', stop playing, wrap him up in what he lay in
Fold a nigga arms, now a caskets what he pray in

Know your place and dedicate your role, to the faith that you'll die alone
Trace your steps when I do step in a fire of broken bones
And I require my heart's desire and when I reap what I sew
I bought my momma a Benz, my boobie a jag
A cut for my dogs with a roof full of glass
But still I be feeling like none of my light never casts
Out of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast
But fuck that, I'm not worried, even when discouraged
Skirt off makin' them hurt off I should have hurt them in a hurry
Dirt off all under my fingers, dirt all of 'em gon' is gone
Shirt off when precesure, resuscitation came early
I need you to keep quiet as a mouse
Which is ironic 'cause rats is what I'm talking about
I'm hearin' the sonics of gun fire
The whispers, the silent cries even though I know it's an eye for an eye

I said she see no evil
She gonna knock it at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'ma see you again

So Heaven can you heal, I'm only just a man

You want to go to Compton? Nigga I'll take you there
Hub City bodies get burnt butt-naked here
Respect the code, a nigga's calling from the pen
Colombian neck-ties on the outside from within
And then, your momma never see you again
Casket to never wake up plastered in MAC make-up, huh
Niggas can't hear you talking from the sky
And only five year olds see your ghost when you die, no lie
Karma catches up to all you head honchos
2 Dome shots in that head, Griselda Blanco
Shit get real though inside the Foxhills though
Nigga living that fast life and get killed slow

In my race against time I, can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life 

God, why the hell am I here?
Is it a blessin', or a painful lesson
Of life and its directions?
Date of conception two twenty nine
I was birthed and won't be denied
Lookin' into these eyes
And witness lives' tragedies
The boy who made slaves out of men, that's me
For every lock there's a key
The only thing that ever made me click was ""Cash Money""
So that I lust for
Be it one of my deadly sins
You know the seven 
I got all of them deep within
Sometimes I slip, but you be there
Pick me up, now I'm on my knees like what's up
'Cause only in a world that's corruptin' the sick
Could you dare to look at my life and call it innocence 
Got me to a better sense
Cause what's yours is mine
Hear me lord, I'm runnin' out of time

Nobody cry for me
Cause I, want to see you smile for me
When I die look through my windows, to the soul
Tell me if you see Ja livin' to grow old
Cause too many niggas done died for what I hold
The talented warmer world
Which is so cold
Take me 
Save me 
Before I'm crazy
The only reason I live
Is for my baby
Never did you tell me that 
Life ain't a game
Maybe if you told me this 
Shit might be changed
But now I'm just racin' against time 
Tryin' to survive
And see why 
Y'all niggas drive over nigga's vibe
If you gonna live, know you gonna die
If you gonna steal, know you gotta lie 
Get drunk and stay high
Don't de-nigga-ny 
Cause they'll never take me alive
Feel me lord 
I'm runnin' out of time

In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light
Livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin too high
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light
Livin' my life 

I fears no man
But when its time to go
I'm gone
Racin' through the darkness
Learnin' what's right from wrong
Lookin' for the light
But all I see is the night
When everything else is bright
What happened to my life?
Is this what I am?
Is this what I've become?
A nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin' and no one
Cold, even though I gotta burnin' desire within my soul 
I must set this whole world on fire
If I control my destiny
Maybe one day I'll give this world the best of me
You know I never been one to judge right or wrong
I embraced and showed you love
Then I throw slugs
At the other side
Go get 'em in broad day light
What a nigga would give to live my life
You don't want it
Cause if you could get it you would try
Feel me lord

For you to say I'm trippin' it's just a homie from upstate (said it's just a homie)
Don't he know it's 1:00 in the morning

To sit a home and wonder where you are
Is he kissing you touching you holding you what
Take a drink and help ease my mind
I want to be mad after all those times

For me to ask you where you been
For you to say I better stop tripping
To grab your neck until you let me know
For you to run crying, crying out the door
To grab my coat and chase you down the street
To say it ain't you it's my own insecurity
For you to say yes I cheated on you
I won't care cause after all I put you through I deserve
I desrve yeah yeah yeah
To be mistreated sometimes
To even be lied to sometimes
Maybe you should go cheat on me

Maybe I should sit and wait by the phone
Cause I paged you about 3 or 4 times

I then put you through hell

Don’t even trip

I can take you all over the world though, even tell you pack light
The last lad couldn’t even get a cab ride
She don’t do the blogs, but if she did, she’d be on mad sites
Ass so mean that I’m always on her bad side
Uh, now she don’t ever stress me ’bout my whereabouts
Never seems concerned with other birds that she may hear about
She mind hers, it’s my turn, that shit she barely care about
Look amazing on me, why I’m always tryna wear her out
She don’t ride like you, no she don’t taste like that
Not with a waist like that, do I let her go to waste like that?
She a mix between Kama Sutra, yoga and porno flicks
Funny how her breath get shorter when I give her long dick, uh
And I’m telling y’all straight up
Might think I imagined shorty even when she not made up
She kill ‘em in Levi’s, see why, it ain’t even fair
Look good in whatever she wear, how could other women compare
They can’t

I done put another in your space
Damn if they do, it’s been hard to replace
I just want the same judge sitting on the case
She gon' hate, but she know

I can see the stars in the day time
Bitch, I miss you like a deadline
And the girl I’m with is just the girl I’m with
I mean it’s working out, so we’re staying fit
But you know love is nothing, ask Stan Smith
But I gotta keep a bad bitch like Brad Pitt
Remember our first kiss? Or our last kiss?
I used to go dummy in that pussy, crash test
You be fucking that nigga like you was fucking me?
Ha, fuck that nigga, he can’t fuck with me
I’m Tunechi bitch and you know that, and that pussy throw back
But any given night, I’d still pop that ass like a Prozac
Girl you know you got that murder, a beast in that La Perla
And every time we cut, I used to shred her; Ninja Turtles
And I know you still love me and I know ya still for me
That’s why we still fucking, cause she don’t put it down like you

She don’t put it down like you
Down-down like you, down-down like you, down-down like you
She don’t put it down like you

Love being ’round mine, no downtime, still nothing else even matters
Can’t even walk slow through that mall, 'cause paparazzi running after
Baby girl working it like a pro, slow it down or move it faster
Whether them lights on or them lights off, like I’m sleeping with the clapper
Said she watching what she eat, yet that ass keep getting fatter
How I’m sexing her, making likes of hers, no longer be a factor
Plus her and I already know, you done turn them all to desperate
Climb with the former rather ladder, you already know which one I’d rather
Cum on

In my race against time I, can't stop
Runnin' through the red light, livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too hot
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light, livin' my life 

God, why the hell am I here?
Is it a blessin', or a painful lesson
Of life and its directions?
Date of conception two twenty nine
I was birthed and won't be denied
Lookin' into these eyes
And witness lives' tragedies
The boy who made slaves out of men, that's me
For every lock there's a key
The only thing that ever made me click was ""Cash Money""
So that I lust for
Be it one of my deadly sins
You know the seven 
I got all of them deep within
Sometimes I slip, but you be there
Pick me up, now I'm on my knees like what's up
'Cause only in a world that's corruptin' the sick
Could you dare to look at my life and call it innocence 
Got me to a better sense
Cause what's yours is mine
Hear me lord, I'm runnin' out of time

[Repeat: x2]
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light
Livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin' too high
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light
Livin' my life 

Nobody cry for me
Cause I, want to see you smile for me
When I die look through my windows, to the soul
Tell me if you see Ja livin' to grow old
Cause too many niggas done died for what I hold
The talented warmer world
Which is so cold
Take me 
Save me 
Before I'm crazy
The only reason I live
Is for my baby
Never did you tell me that 
Life ain't a game
Maybe if you told me this 
Shit might be changed
But now I'm just racin' against time 
Tryin' to survive
And see why 
Y'all niggas drive over nigga's vibe
If you gonna live, know you gonna die
If you gonna steal, know you gotta lie 
Get drunk and stay high
Don't de-nigga-ny 
Cause they'll never take me alive
Feel me lord 
I'm runnin' out of time

[Repeat: x2]
In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light
Livin' my life
Even if I'm gettin too high
I'ma keep runnin' through the red light
Livin' my life 

I fears no man
But when its time to go
I'm gone
Racin' through the darkness
Learnin' what's right from wrong
Lookin' for the light
But all I see is the night
When everything else is bright
What happened to my life?
Is this what I am?
Is this what I've become?
A nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin' and no one
Cold, even though I gotta burnin' desire within my soul 
I must set this whole world on fire
If I control my destiny
Maybe one day I'll give this world the best of me
You know I never been one to judge right or wrong
I embraced and showed you love
Then I throw slugs
At the other side
Go get 'em in broad day light
What a nigga would give to live my life
You don't want it
Cause if you could get it you would try
Feel me lord
Ja has arrived

In my race against time I can't stop
Runnin' through the red light

Even if I'm gettin' too high

Maybe I deserve
For you to do all the things I did to you
Maybe I deserve ( oh yeah)
Maybe I deserve
Repeat Twice

For you to put on a sexy dress
For me to ask you Who the hell you trying to impress
For you to laugh it off like it ain't nothing
I know it's something Maybe just maybe

To sit a home and wonder where you are
Is he kissing you touching you holding you what
Take a drink and help ease my mind
I want to be mad after all those times

Repeat chorus 2X

For me to ask you where you been
For you to say I better stop tripping
To grab your neck until you let me know
For you to run crying, crying out the door
To grab my coat and chase you down the street
To say it ain't you it's my own insecurity
For you to say yes I cheated on you
I won't care cause after all I put you through I deserve
I desrve yeah yeah yeah
To be mistreated sometimes
To even be lied to sometimes
Maybe you should go cheat on me

Maybe I should sit and wait by the phone
Cause I paged you about 3 or 4 times
Girl I know girl I know I then put you through
I then put you through hell
And I don't care
And I don't care
And I deserve

A lot of people hittin' on me, mad to see me on
You grouch, Oscar, Academy Award
I can play now, first, yea I had to do my chores
Met a cougar and she told call anatomy your ma
Even though I'm a minor I can do what a major bring in two
Any rappers overdue I'm like his hated
Bet you bottom dollar
You could place a wager, won't be saved by the bell
You an AC skater
Mirror mirror on the wall tell me who the greatest, you are
And what you do to the beat is just heinous
A few years back people used to pay us
I can smell the fix now somebody call the rippers

Like every day is gluey as night (every day is gluey as night)
We're livin' life like a special occasion
Another day in paradise

Get my fly, get my fresh, I'm Armada
This is my house, gettin' rid of all these waters
If you ain't gonna do it you know get off off the potter
First week watch my numbers match every produce
Blast off you can tell Houston we have a problem
My shoe faluca rude boy rewind
I'm tryin' to swim with the sharks but you just a sea ada
You're not on my level, we can never see eye to
Eye on my fly, you can call me young Sodom

I'm a make you eat it
I'm taking over, taking over Genghis Khan
So hot I can burn through the frame retort
Shh I'm talkin', everyone remain cool
I can teach you how to work it, trade school
It's my occasion, you're witnessing the torch passing
You can't buy love but I brought passion
I'm thinkin' massive, my money sick
I'm thinkin' magic, no pun intend

Just drink your beer - Commandments
Thou shalt not puke cause there's no excuse
Just drink your beer - Commandments

Of the rules encased in stone
Ten written the rest were lost
When will they be found?

Laws misplaced for centuries
Where can they be? The brewery!

We sought a place to get some rest
The owner said: ""Please keep it down""

""We're good boys"" - so we lied
Raise some Hell!

Two days passed - fuckin' mess
The maids refused to clean our stys
Ravioli neath the rug
Stench of beer - everywhere

We were shit-faced - relieving stress is so much fun
Fuckin' shit-faced - getting sick and thrashing rooms

One week down - place was fucked
We tore the heater off the wall
And broke the windows in our room
No one cared - we were drunk

Raise some Hell!

Bed diving - brand new sport
From our beds we'd start to leap
And dive into the cabinets
They broke too - nothing spared

Went downtown - forgot the keys
We climbed into someone's window
But they shot teargas in our eyes
Didn't look - locked outside

Five minutes passed and it was thrashed
Last warning - they kicked us out

All that I want is a cunt for my prick

Too stupid at love, to ugly to fuck
Hiding and scolding boring all night
The longer it lasts the worse it becomes

If she says one more word I'll blow her away

Checked all closets and under the couch

You can't get home without a car

The wrong direction mile for mile
And getting sober all the while

At home? They'd tear the place apart

Cause all the shit that we've been through 
Put wisdom in my eyes 

So walk away, don't turn around

Cause all the lies that I've been living through 
Are becoming very clear

Don't preconceive what I'm all about
Look for a reason that you have to start
Acting like a friend that you are not

And when you think that we played it out
We come from the bottom and knock it out
Look for a reason that you have to start
Acting like a friend but you are not, yeah

And though I'm used to have you here
It doesn't change the man I was
When you found me
And there was no one else around me, yeah, yeah, yeah ooh

Tantric,"I know what you think of me but I had to move on
I know I'm landing on my feet and the hating's gone
Well, here I go down this path again
They say every road must come to an end
When the sun rises then falls into the dawn
Said everybody knows what's going on

All my blood has been forgotten
And all my tears have dried alone

Until the end begins
It seems that everything is coming back again
The end begins
Sometimes you have to start where you begin

I will rise above this thing you imprinted on me
And I will embrace all the pain and a need I will feel
'Cause it's given me sons but I won't give up
You can push me around but I won't shut up
I may fall to the ground but I won't get stuck
I can do it myself, I don't need your luck

Many words I haven't spoken
For everything I've held within

Until the end begins
It seems that everything is coming back again
The end begins
Sometimes you have to start where you begin

'Cause everybody's got to fight sometimes
Everybody's got to try sometimes
Even though it's hard to see the light
You will never know the time is right

From your demons, lay on to me
So now I feel the pain that you feel
And it's not getting better

'Cause I've been there before
A soul I came back for
What does life have in store
Before I lay, I lay

Well, stand up and leave
I see you sinking [Incomprehensible]
Don't be afraid of who you want to be
Just stand and brave the weather

Hope is in your hand
Don't let this feeling fade if you can
The home is not to you, it is your land
And faith will make it better

Sweaty palms and promises that someone slow to take in all away from me
Right now I'm livin' dreams that were dreamt by younger one
And as it spins into a web I'm gettin' caught, I'm barely able to see the sun

But to right the wrongs I'll take the long way just to find her
Way to be gone away from this

Get up again and hold it in
You're 'bout to be the lucky one
Get up again and trade it in
You're 'bout to be the lucky one

Look around to figure out around why certain things turn so quickly
I'm sick of all these random smiles I see, I'm all in a plastic city
I get around a moving lie just to look at another one
Oh, I don't know you anymore, I don't think I know anyone

To right the wrongs I'll take the long way just to find her
Way to be gone away from this

Get up again and hold it in
You're 'bout to be the lucky one

Will you follow me under

If I wash up on the beach
And I've lost all memory
Will you come into the shadow with me
Will you follow me under

If I decide to bring it all down
Will you stay and help me figure it out
Will you come into the shadow with me
Will you follow me under

Walk awhile with me
I've got something to say to you or ask you
Will you come into the shadow with me
Will you follow me under

Anyway so much to prove
Step away from the wreck

Someone's got to pay for this

And I know that smile is evidence of this
And I know my picture will not be carried with you
Now someone's got to stay and clean up this mess

And take from you barely enough for a lifetime of

And it's about, to make me lose my mind
We're running out of time, too many of my people dying

Day by day it's more impossible, to hold on
I'm going head up with the shadow of death, and getting stole on
Will I survive, is God gonna come and save me
I started out as a Christian, now look at how this world made me
I'm crazy, and I can't make it no better
Cause I can't stand none of my friends, my only love is for the cheddar
I remember, sipping on Tangaray and getting high
Down with eachother, long as we was barely getting by
We grown men, and all living in sin
Shooting a kite to my people, cause he in prison again
Letting him know that the streets ain't changed, still wicked
Plus I been burying so many motherfuckers, we bound to kick it
Up close and personal, cause niggaz be pushing my button
I handle my bidness, and exit they homes gangsta strutting
One deep, nobody's got my back
Motherfuckers just be hanging around me, because I rap
Trying to stab me in my back, and if they could they would
That's why I pack my twin bitches, cause I don't even feel safe in the hood
At least on lock, you know what the danger is and what's not
Free world you'll be evicted, when a coward bust shots
That's the life cycle, kick it with real niggaz
And never let the shife by you, because the devil is they idol
Man they tied up my nigga, and sawed off his head
The cold part about it, they ain't even take no bread

And the fast life, we bled the whole hood last night
Hard headed dumb niggaz, just trying to get they cash right

But like a chameleon, nigga the game done changed
Wish it would rain sometime, to help a nigga wash away the pain sometime
I shed ghetto tears daily baby, I can't hide the fact
Feeling like everybody's out to get me, so I don't hide my strap
I ride like that, with one up in the chamber
On my block if you ain't got a glock, you's in danger
Continuously head busting for nothing, my friends and my enemies
Nothing but recollection, as I remember the memories
If I could be like Jesus, I'd spread the love
But I can recognize the demons, so I spread the slugs
These motherfuckers say they love me, but I'm peeping they lies
Feel like jealousy and envy, when I look deep in they eyes
That's a friend for you, laced up with your girl and then try to
Spend your ends for you, and when it's drama they won't send for you
That's the reason Joseph, is one deep until he die

I had to get it no time to play with it, my money I was committed
And when I got my paper, my paper, I split it
When everybody ?? was down with it
But all of a sudden everybody start hatin (why they hatin)
I don't know, why everybody hatin'
They see me on them 22s givin boys the blues
When they see me shinin they don't have a clue
They be like who is that? I be like Mike Jones!
I'm like Pimp see - I got a (Pocket Full of Stones)
But it ain't work, homie it's my CD's
And I sold about 2 million in the streets
So why they hatin me? 'cause I pull up Jet Li
With the eighty fos and fos on that new Bentley
So I ask:

[CHORUS (Tanya Herron)]
Why they got to hate on me? Why they got to hate on me
(I wonder why) why they got to hate on me?
(I wonder why I wonder why)
Why they got to hate on me? Why they got to hate on me?
Why they got to hate on me?

[VERSE 2]
I spent a half million in the city baby (how much)
A half billion in the city baby
'97 ? boxster know how much I spent
I swear to god when it come to paper I ain't got no mint
When people needed money they'd holla at me
I swear to god when they needed it they holla'd at me
Club ice age I put everyone on they feet
Then they turn around and ? damn
I see y'all out there hatin on me
But I got the world waitin on me
They waitin on me why are they haiting on me
I ask the lawd but I ain't trippin get inside the booth and press record
I'm a g and these streets said that I ain't got to answer to nobody
Especially the ones with no ? so far ahead that they can't catch up
Why they wastin os on me tryin to set me up?

[CHORUS Repeats]

[VERSE 3]
Tell me, what have I done to you? What have I done to you
To make you all hate on me ay ay
What have I done to you what have I done to you
To make y'all hate on me
They see me shinin in the limelight
They see me shinin by myself and they say that I ain't right
Why is it that I had to grind on my own baby
V12 yeah I'm rollin on that chrome baby
I know he mad 'cause he lyin ? my name in your brain
I pull a wide frame I'm about to take your dame
I pull a piece of chain
Pinky ring to the turning lane
Why they hate on me mane
No need to explain

[CHORUS Repeats]

Tanya Herron,"Circumstances are like my first fight I lost
It was swinging, my arms bugging, adrenaline pumping
Oh shit, this little nigga's thugging
I mean, I was thirteen, I was nursing a knot on my face
But chose another time and a place
That I would avenge my last fight cuz the same shit
Ain't gonna happen that just happened last night
Knuckle game changed quicker than lightning
Hit 'em or slice 'em
Either stick 'em or blast pipes, it's the fastlife
I try to give another nigga advice, shoot dice
Do plenty of shit cause this life, how many you get?
How many niggas do you know get two?
Besides a nigga who snitch to skip a life-bid, be one a' your crew
I don't respect killers, I respect O.G. knowledge
Codes of the streets got new rules, but no guidance
Lessons, detrimental to a young disciple
Focus, take care of your brothers, niggas do as I do
Keep your enemies close, where they can see you
It's not your enemy who get you
It's always your own people

Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
Got me wondering, can I trust my friends?
Cuz they stick me in my back every chance they get
Am I paranoid? and if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?
I can't handle this, I'm losing it
With a loose grip I'm hanging on to emptiness
Help your brother, save him from the
Evil demons in between us, came between us

I know you hate me, don't you
I bet you sit and wish my time never came
You probably rather see me die in the game
You probably rather see me die in a plane
Well ya'll see me up on top of my dough
I get my money shit changed
And niggas start looking at me different than this
And downplay the real nigga shit to get with a bitch
But I'mma tell a motherfucker like this
You only good as what you come up against
Nigga you get what you get
Sure the grass is greener on the other side of the fence
But any attempts and you gonna need the guy in the trench
I'ma starter while you riding the bench
You saying you a player, well I'm the one designing your prints
Something to go by, to let these niggas know I
Don't believe in letting shit slide, nigga gonna die
Best friends since high school seniors
Where the homeboys are meaner, but let the bullshit come between us

Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
Got me wondering, can I trust my friends?
Cuz they stick me in my back every chance they get
Am I paranoid? and if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?
I can't handle this, I'm losing it

Evil demons in between us, came between us",In Between Us,2010

Through my heart too fast
Try to hold the thoughts down

But as your face keeps rising
Playing through my mind
It's time to take this on, now

I never held back from the edge,
And you hit the same the line in the edge
But I don't wanna fall down too soon,
Take every moment I can with you,
Not over 'til we're in the clear,
Hold tight and let go of the fear,
All the trouble we've left behind,

And me done have a man inna my life
Rude boy it's such a pity
I say it is such a pity you already have your wife
And me have a one man inna my life
Rude boy it is a pity

I would a like one of these mornings to wake up and find
Your face on a pillow lying right next to mine
I would a cut out the partying the smoking and the rum
And buss a extra wine and make we seal up a son
Well every time mi fantasize me see your lips me see your eyes
Your trigger fornger do something a left the rude girl hypnotized
For you it's just a thing, just another little fling
But for me this is heaven and the angel them a sing

It's a pity you already have a wife
And me done have a man in my life
Rude boy it's such a pity
I say it is pity you already have your wife
And me have a one man in my life
Rude boy it is a pity

For buck you up in a public and can't even touch
It really fuck me up because me check for you so much
The respect when mi have for your woman for your kids
Believe me rude boy my criss, a nuh matey this
Who knows? maybe one day the world will be evolved enough
We'll share you in a civilized manner between the two of us
But until then I would a love see you again,
Me know we have for play it by the stupid rules of men

I said if we never get a chance to be together
Go with Jah, Tanya loves ya, who me seh?

So meet me round the corner, avoid Mitzy and Lorna
You know them a two of the biggest informer
I'm not starving for sex no, nah bawl out 'next no
But the way how you flex really be my interest yo
The you that people see a no the you and me loving
And the you what with me go much deeper than skin
I don't know exactly what it is you're feeling
But I wish this was a permanent thing

It's such a pity you already have a wife
And me done have a man in my life
Rude boy it's such a pity
I say it is such a pity you already have your wife
And me have a one man in my life
Rude boy it is a pity

Me know see you belong to she, you know see me belong to him
Me wouldn't want you this your queen, me would a never this my king
But when you play pon my riddim and when me feel your base a swing
You left me in a turmoil, you have me head a spin
It really make me sad for haffi waste so much water,
I think the two o' we can make a beautiful daughter
But it would be selfish to an innocent little youth
For bring her come and cannot tell her the truth
Tell her the truth

Tanya Stephens,"I guess I'm expected to say 'God bless you'
But you left me, me never left you
And what me do right now, me can't even say F you
But me can say this though

I hope you can't live without me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Can't get your mind to stop thinking about me
Can't eat can't sleep, can't breathe

I hope you whine up lonely
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Then you are gon' wish you coulda still come hold me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe

I bet you think I'm supposed to smile, put the best outside
Put on an act to protect my pride
You want me to take it like a man, but I'm a girl who cries
So if I puncture your tires, don't be too surprised

And while I'm at it, hell, I may as well key up your car
'Cause what you did to my heart that's an act of war
Well every step you take I'll be one step behind
Won't let you get me out of your mind

I hope you can't live without me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Can't get your mind to stop thinking about me
Can't eat can't sleep, can't breathe

I hope you whine up lonely
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Then you are gon' wish you coulda still come hold me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe

I should allowed to be bitter 'cause it's only fair
I'm falling apart, but you don't care
Why is she so happy? Why do you smile?
And why aren't you guys fighting all the while like we did?

I know it must be a charade, God please send me a shower
To rain on their parade, I hope she's cheating juggling nuts like a squirrel
Better yet I hope she leaves you for a girl
'Cause you can't live without me

I hope you can't live without me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Can't get your mind to stop thinking about me
Can't eat can't sleep, can't breathe

I hope you whine up lonely
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Then you are gon' wish you coulda still come hold me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe

Yo, both you know want go get married and you would love me to be there
I woulda tell you somethings, but them not fit for the ears
Usually me woulda say goodbye and I wish you well
But not to you, I hope your life turns out to be hell

Bet you think I want you to die but no, I want you to live
And suffer and cry like I did
I'm just keepin' it real
I just so me feel

I hope you can't live without me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Can't get your mind to stop thinking about me
Can't eat can't sleep, can't breathe

I hope you whine up lonely
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Then you are gon' wish you coulda still come hold me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe

What me say, yo, she can't cook like me, can't jook like me
No, and I know you in and out like a book like me
She no full a style like me, can't make you smile like me
And she can never bear beautiful child like me

She no tight like me, no fling it up right like me
And if me buck her one her way she can't fight like me
You done know, me say ah just so it go

I hope you can't live without me
Can't eat, can't sleep, can't breathe
Can't get your mind to stop thinking about me
Can't eat can't sleep, can't breathe

I hope you whine up lonely

Yes, I paid the price by look, how much I gained
If I have to, I can do anything, I am strong
I am invincible, I am woman

Are the same one's that's gonna stand my ground, yeah

You must be strong enough to lift your standard

Now you say I P.M. sing

",I Am Woman,2004
Tanya Stephens,"Once upon a time there was a happy family (a sweet little baby)
There was a baby girl, a daddy, and a mommy( a sweet little baby)
Mommy had a secret she told a little white lie
And when she tucked the baby in at night, she sang her this lullaby

You got your daddy's smile, you got his eyes
I feel my heart breaking every time you cry
I'm gonna burn in hell, but its no sacrifice
Your stability is worth a million lies
I see your daddy, in everything you do
And if you could talk, I'll bet you'll talk like him too
But he can't be your daddy, I hope you understand
The man who thinks he's your father
Is a much better man
Maybe one day, you'll end up crying on Ricki Lake
But baby its a chance your momma's willing to take
'Cause I love you! even if my heart is gonna break
Ain't no reason you should suffer for my mistake

And so I lie, baby I try, and it kills me inside
But I'm gonna live with this until the day I die
And I hurt, baby, oh how I hurt
But I know what you're worth, yeah
So I'm gonna live with this
Until I hit the dirt, someday

And everyday by herself the momma cried
But at night she smiled when the daddy was by her side
There were times she almost told him, and it really broke her heart
But she forced herself to keep the secret that was tearing her apart

Now I can't sleep at night
I've lost my appetite
Everybody keeps saying
The baby looks kind of light
And I tell them that every newborn baby looks the same
While I'm praying to God, please make your color change
The emotions on his face when he's looking at you
I couldn't tell he ain't your papa even if I wanted to
He's got your picture tattooed on his arm
Now he's bragging to his friends about his firstborn
Oh God, and I love him, really I do, if he ever found out it
Would kill me too, now I'm caught between a rock and a really hard place
I'd give anything to keep that smile on his face

And so I lie, baby I try, and it kills me inside
But I'm gonna live with this until the day I die
And I hurt, baby, oh how I hurt
But I know what you're worth, yeah
So I'm gonna live with this
Until I hit the dirt, someday

Mommy kept the family together the best way she could
'Cause she knew in this case the truth would do more harm than good
What the daddy didn't know, didn't hurt him
He had no cause to fret, and that's as close to happily ever after as anyone can get

I try, and it kills me inside
But I'm gonna live with this until the day I die
And I hurt, baby, oh how I hurt
But I know what you're worth, yeah
So I'm gonna live with this

Tanya Stephens,"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to invite you on a journey
I sincerely hope you are in a mood to travel right now
'Cause we're going back in time
Are you ready?

I wanna take you way back
To when a girl on a mike?s worth
Wasn't determined by the length of her skirt
I mean way back to creativity before MTV, before BET

I mean way back before recycling shit
When the props that you got was for your writing and shit
Let's rewind before the hype when you used to be low key
To be a singer you had to actually know key

I mean way back to before people made a job
Of seeing who's best at impersonating Bob
I mean way back to when you sweat blood on every line
To get one good song didn't cost sixteen ninety nine

To be considered deep you had to actually say stuff
And if it wasn't good, disc jockeys didn't play stuff
I mean way way, Marvin Gaye way back and I pray that you will

Come with me, let us journey past this melody
Give us room to exercise our minds
Take me to another place, another time, better hooks, better rhymes
Stronger lyrics every line, you could even press rewind

Come with me, let us journey past this fallacy
Give us room to exercise our minds
Take you to another place, another time, better hooks, better rhymes
Stronger lyrics every line, you could even press rewind

Well, it?s ironic that the chronic that I smoke
Got me singing shit that's bionic every note
That it?s affecting my judgment is what some people would hope
But I'm not tripping, I'm on a journey, come along now let's float

I used to be excited going to the record store
But these days I stay pacing the floor
Somebody please take me back to when the artistes were poor
'Cause when they made less they gave us so much more

let's take it back to a ballroom, cloudy microphone
Smokey Robinson, Nina Simone
James Brown was still occupying the throne
When the songs weren't sold off videos alone

Way back to when a star attitude wasn't defined
By somebody being rude
To when it was a pleasure definitely not a task
To greet a fan with a smile and sign a damn autograph

I mean way back to before you used to drive the Maybach
You dreamt about a mil but never made that
When you made some shit that we could play back

I mean way back to a whole ?nother time
Further back than your granddad?s hairline
I mean way back, won't you say that you will

Come with me, let us journey past this melody
Give us room to exercise our minds
Take me to another place, another time, better hooks, better rhymes
Stronger lyrics every line, you could even press rewind

Come with me, let us journey past this fallacy
Give us room to exercise our minds
Take you to another place, another time, better hooks, better rhymes
Stronger lyrics every line, you could even press rewind

And it came to pass in the glorious days of charts
That the music hailed and we danced to it
And threw a party but in our hearts we knew the musicians failed

And then came along brothers, Napster and Aimster
And though they were definitely wrong I think it's worse
To be forced to buy a whole bullshit album
Just to get that one good song , can I get an Amen

Come with me, let us journey past this melody
Give us room to exercise our minds
Take it to another place, another time, better hooks, better rhymes
Stronger lyrics every line, you could even press rewind

Come with me, let us journey past this fallacy
Give us room to exercise our minds
Take it to another place, another time, better hooks, better rhymes
Stronger lyrics every line, you could even press rewind

Tanya Stephens,"Oh, what a day, oh
Oh, what a day, oh
Day, what a day, what a day, oh, oh

I'm tired of the hunger I see on people's faces
Tired of the animosity between the races
Tired of corruption in high and low places
And pricks with money but no social graces

Tired of being judged for the style in my hair
And the music that I listen and the clothes that I wear
I'm tired of life and death being sold as a pair
And politicians who keep saying they care but

Maybe hoping for a change is a dream
Maybe life ain't as bad as it seems
But if dreaming is the best I can do
Then I'll be dreaming my whole life through

Oh, what a day when war becomes a thing of the past
And peace, we will have it at last
And life is finally worth its cost
And woah, woah, oh

What a day when men finally live what they teach
And love ain't just a concept we preach
And blood no longer runs in the streets
Woah, woah, woah, oh, what a day

Tired of leaving church, feeling like I've just been robbed
Two hours of rambling, not much mention of God
The richest man's the only one who does not have a job
A bunch of righteous freaks extorting worse than the mob, y'all

Tired of baby, momma, tired of baby, daddy
Chilling in the spot where the parents should be
Teenage mother saying, ""Leave my babies alone""
In 20 years the kid could be robbing my home but

I got a vision of a whole other plain
Where the spiritual can flourish again
I'm just awaiting for the fire to rain
Burn dung everything and start clean

What a day when war becomes a thing of the past
And peace, we will have it at last
And life is finally worth its cost
And woah, woah, oh

Oh, what a day when men finally live what they teach
And love ain't just a concept we preach
And blood no longer runs in the streets
And woah, woah, woah, oh, what a day

Ooh, what a day
Oh, what a day
Oh, what a day, what a day, what a day

Maybe hoping for a change is a dream
Maybe life ain't as bad as it seems
But if dreaming is the best I can do

Wondering why the hell I did this
Tomorrow I'm gonna make up
Stories 'bout how somebody spiked my drink

Tomorrow when the rumors fly
I'm gonna build me an alibi
Tomorrow when the stories spread
I'll be wishing we were still in bed

Just hold me for the moment
When the morning comes we'll figure where to go then
People are gonna talk, you know them
Don't have to stay together just to show them

We know they're gonna say we're wild
But we remember what we did and smile
Who cares what tomorrow will bring

Tonight, I wanna lay right here beside you
Tonight, I wanna put my arms around you
And hold you tight
'Cause baby, all that really matters is tonight
Baby, all that really matters is tonight

I see lovers shattered
Bruised and broke and battered
For better or for worse
Some people only get the latter

I see people making alibis
They hurt each other with their lies
But tomorrow when we walk away
There'll be nothing left to say

Tomorrow for certain
We know that this would have to end
And when we drop the curtains
At least we know we're gonna still be friends

And maybe if the time is right
Or some other lonely night
We'll remember all the passion we had
Remember what we needed so bad

Maybe we'll take separate roads tomorrow

verse 1
Came to your wedding uninvited 
Walk to da church and sat down inside
I wanted to scream your name
Let everybody see my pain 
When you said I do I died
And it was time for you to kiss the bride
Through tears I saw you lift her veil 
You kissed her and my world turned pale 
I thought I was apart of your life
But they pronounced you man and wife
Saw the emotion in your eyes
And in da church I started to cry

chorus
Damn you
And your wedding bells
Damn you 
Have me under your spell
Damn you 
You gonna burn in hell
And if its that wat you want 
I guess you got wat you want boy

And your bedroom eyes
Damn you
And your believable lies
Damn you
You know your gonna fry
And if its that wat you want
I guess you got wat you want boy

If you believe in karma then you know
What you do gonna come around to you
And the hurt that you dish today

2nd verse
So I got up and started running blindly
Had to get that painful scene behind me
The wind howling in my ears
Seem to be laughing at my river of tears
I didn't wait for you to walk my way
Or stick around until she through the bouquet
I couldnt trust my self to just sit by
And not flood the church with the tears I cried
Last night I was in your arms
You held me and kept me warm
Can't help feeling left behind
As she walks off with what you said was mine!

chorus
Damn you
And your wedding bells
Damn you 
Have me under your spell

You gonna burn in hell

Verse 1:

Where Bubba grew up, kept his tobacco chewed up. 
And when they use to hang ropes, they always kept two up. 
Had crosses burning all night, like the Church blew up. 
And if you didn't look like them, they would fuck you up. 
Time passed and Bubba turned forty years old. 
And all them Jack Daniels started taking a toll. 
Seem like Bubba was about to make a final bow, none of his friends from the Klan couldn't help him now. 
Family gathered at his bed side ready to sing the blues, when a doctor rushed in and said I got some news. 
The good news is Bubba I've found you a liver only bad news is it belongs to a nigga.

Chorus: 

Do you care bout the texture of his hair or the cocoa brown color of his skin' 
Do you still care' 
Do you still give a damn, now your in the predicament your in 
Do you still care' 
Does it still mean a lot now you're the one who's needing the help' 
Do still care' 
Do you still find it hard to love your neighbor as you love yourself 
Now tell me why can't you accept me as I am' 
Just the way I am now 

Verse 2:

Where Bigga grew up boys were suppose to be tough. 
Girls were trophies every man always kept a few of. 
When he was hurt and the tears would sting in his eyes, his mother said ""stop the noise yuh a girl' real boys don't cry."" 
He learn in order to be a man he had to know how to fight. 
And had some very definitive rules about what's wrong or right. 
He never had the luxury of being able to choose. 
So to him for being different there was no excuse. 
Bigga was hustling on the corner, making some cash. 
When he bumped into some beef that he had from the past. 
He watched the guns raised and the bullets fly. 
In disbelief as his friends all jumped in their rides. 
Lefted him in the gutter didn't care if he died. 
He was rescued by a car with a plates that said gay pride. 
It would have been fatal that shot in your head, They saved your life tho you always said chi chi fi dead. 

Chorus:

Now do you care bout the clothes that they wear' 
Would you rather if they left you there' 
Do you still care what your friends wanna think if they see you hanging out with a queer' 
Do you still care' 
Does it still mean a lot now your the one who's needing the help' 
Do you still care' 
Do you still find hard it to love your neighbor as you love yourself' 
Now, tell me why can't you accept me as I am' 
Just the way I am now. 

Verse 3: 

And that's the reason why, war can't cease. 
If you nah look like me, me a go pop my piece. 
And that's the reason why, we can't get along. 
If you nuh do it my way then your doing it wrong. 
And that's the reason why Iraqi babies gonna cry. 
And more Palestinians and Israelis gonna die. 
That's the reason why the world is in pain 
We say we want peace if reign but ah bullets again.

I'd get past my pride, you'd be by my side
I wouldn't be holding on to memories
I wouldn't need them, you'd be here with me
That I was separate and complete, was my confusion
My reciprocity turned out to be retribution
So caught up with what I wanted you to be
Convinced that perfection meant spot free

Bwoy, look at me now
A shadow of my former glory 
And the moral of my story is....

It may seem I'm holding it down 
But if you wanna know the truth
I'm slowly losing my ground, 
If you wanna know the truth
There's no one keeping me warm
If you wanna know the truth
I'm only good in your arms
If you wanna know the truth

I miss the way you used to say I wanna bone ya
But I have to resist the urge to phone ya
You must have moved on it's been over a year 
And it wouldn't be fair to burden you with my tears
I know I said I didn't need you and I'd be alright, 
But I got a much different story tonight
I miss your laughter such a beautiful thing
Now the silence closes in

Oh oh aye

Molly Marlo was a virgin girl
She lived a mile from a fool named Barney Dawson
Hell bent on getting inside Molly's world

He caught her after church one Sunday morning
And took her body with his rough hard hands
And walked off laughing as she lay there crying
Since then she's been known as No Man's Land

And as their hot eyes watched her body moving
They'd swallow hard and shake their heads and sigh

Molly went to school and studied nursing
Now you might laugh but it's an honest fact
The first year that she nursed at Millard's Clinic
Six men pretended they had heart attacks

But that was a long time and no matter how I try
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.

[Chorus]

There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.

[Chorus]",Angel from Montgomery,1978
Tanya Tucker,"Arrested on charges of unemployment,
he was sitting in the witness stand
The judge's wife called up the district attorney
Said you free that brown eyed man
You want your job you better free that brown eyed man

Flying across the desert in a TWA,
I saw a woman walking across the sand
She been a walkin' thirty miles en route to Bombay
To get a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man

Way back in history three thousand years
Back every since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women shed a tear
For a brown eyed handsome man
That's what the trouble was brown eyed handsome man

Beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her daughter go out and find yourself
A brown eyed handsome man
That's what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man

Milo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To get brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man

Two, three count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stand
Rounding third he was headed for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man
That won the game; it was a brown eyed handsome man",Brown Eyed Handsome Man,1978

Through the sweet and gentle years and now after all these tears we cried

",Don't Let My Heart Be the Last to Know,1992
Tanya Tucker,"Like a child lost in the wilderness
I knew not where to go
Surrounded by the emptiness
Of a love that left me cold
I stumbled through that darkness
Of nights that have no stars

And days that have no sunshine
To warm my naked heart
Like a bird in flight brought down by stones
From an unknown assailant's sling
A stranger took you from my arms
And I lost everything, In days to come I nearly ran

Out of ways to stay alive
But through it all I never lost
The will to survive
(And)

I'm not over you and I doubt that I'll ever be
But I've learned to live
And you won't be the death of me, oh no
Yes, I've learned to live and I'm doing well
But I'm not over you

Like a thief who takes just what he needs
And leaves the rest behind
You took the heart right out of me
And left me with my mind

And I've almost went out of it
At times believed I did
But gradually I learned you're someone
I'll have to live with
('Cause)

I'm not over you and I doubt that I'll ever be
But I've learned to live
And you won't be the death of me, oh no
Yes, I've learned to live and I'm doing well
But I'm not over you

I'm not over you and I doubt that I'll ever be
But I've learned to live
And you won't be the death of me, oh no
Yes, I've learned to live and I'm doing well
But I'm not over you

Tanya Tucker,"Out of the shoot he sits tall as the timber
One hand on the horse and one hand on the sky
Eight seconds later he lands in the money
And winning's a feeling that money can't buy
The kids love a hero and big silver buckles
The girls love the dream of a rodeo man
He loves the backroads and fields without fences
And I guess he loves me because I understand

He's a rain-rain-rainbow rider
He's hitched up his saddle he's ready to ride

Reno in June then off to Cheyenne

He's a rain-rain-rainbow rider
He's hitched up his saddle he's ready to ride

A dream chasing cowboy with a rode girl by his side

Lately he's talking about having a son
Someone who'll learn from the things that he's done
A young bronc bustin' a-buckaroo

A trailer behind an old white Eldorado
A red western sunset and a blue mountain range
Some things in this life he'd like to do over
But livin' with him is something I'd never change

Now that we're fallen apart.
How can we talk to heart to heart you're so far away what can I say.
I've tried to under-stand but things got so out of hand 
Held out as long as I can Now I'm on the telephone saying.

Can I see you tonight 
Just think of the time that we've wasted
Everything will be right 
It could be love if we make it.

Now that we're on the line 
I'll tell you what's on my mind
The love we're trying to hide. 
Well, it's suffering from to much pride.
When will we see the end to this game where nobody wins
For as long as nobody gives in It will go on and on and on.

Can I see you tonight 
Just think of the time that we've wasted
Everything will be right 
It could be love if we make it.

Well, I've got 'em all now
But I ain't got you no more

But I remember, the way you held me
And all the sweet things you used to say
When we were two young lovers
Dancing the night away

I remember everything
The way you wore your hair
The things your body told me
Will seem to float right through the air

I look so funny dancing
But you loved me any how
I wish, I could find somebody
To love me like that now

Turn the page and go back oh I wonder what you'd give
Looking back does it seem when you've planned when you've dreamed

I wish I was a Teddy Bear not livin' nor lovin' or goin' nowhere
I wish I was a Teddy Bear and I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with you
I wish I had a wooden heart and a sawdust mind
Then your memory wouldn't come around hurtin' all the time
I'd have a sewed on smile and a painted twinkle in my eye
And I never would've ever had to learn how to cry
I wish I was a Teddy Bear
I wish I had a string you'd pull to make me say hi I'm Teddy ain't it a lovely day

No crib for His bed,
The little Lord Jesus
Laid down His sweet head;
The stars in the heavens
Looked down where He lay,
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing,
The poor Baby wakes,
But little Lord Jesus,
No crying He makes.
I love Thee, Lord Jesus;
Look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle
Till morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus;
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever
And love me I pray!
Bless all the dear children
In Thy tender care,
And fit us for Heaven
To live with Thee there.
