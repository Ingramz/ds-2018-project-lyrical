East Coast All Stars,"Where do they go, the smoke rings I blow each night
What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue
Oh little smoke rings I love",Smoke Rings,2000
East Coast Band,"Ooh la, la, la, la.
I did you wrong, my heart went out to play 
And in the game I lost you, what a price to pay!
I'm cryin', ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
 
Mistakes I know I've made a few, 
But I'm only human;  you've made mistakes too!
I'm cryin', ooh baby baby ooh baby baby
 
Ooh baby baby
Ooh baby baby I'm just about at the end of my rope.
But I can't stop tryin', I can't give up hope 
'cause I feel someday I'll hold you near, 
Whisper I still love you 
Until that day is here ooh I'm cryin'.
 
Ooh baby baby ooh baby baby",Ooh Baby Baby,1999
East Hundred,"Reach back and release the power held in each 
The tools of knowledge we have received 
Our youth removed stripped of verity 
But a voice is crying out and we'll take it back

We'll take it back 
Take back our hopes our dreams 
All within the reach of those who believe in what can be 
In faith I wait 

I'll do what it takes 
My voice is still crying out 
And we'll take it back
We'll take it back

Waiting
Waiting 
I'll fucking hope 
I'll fucking dream 

I'll fucking believe 
But I'm still waiting 
Waiting 
I'll see the ascension of this disease 

Am I alone in my dream 
I'm still waiting 
Waiting 
Waiting 

I will wait",Wait,2007
East Is East,"Took a walk down paramount
(I've seen better days)
Left behind a friend of mine
(I've seen better days)
Passed by a statue of saint Augustine in prayer
Said for one, the only one
I turned my back at her

The elevator rose to the eleventh floor
(I've seen better days)
Her trench coat hangs inside her door
(I've seen better days)
A leaky window welcomed rain and left me standing here
A black-haired girl who taught me truth
I turned my back on her

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days

Made love in the toronto rain
(i've seen better days)
From hamilton i look the train
(I've seen better days)
What you regret, you softly said are things you never do
I regret i didn't turn
And run back home to you

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days, better days

Now i stand in sympathy
Not for her but for me
I could have turned i could have stayed
But i just walked away
I could have done a lot of things
In my better days

Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Lay me down, down, down
Too late for hope but a dream remembered
Better days, better days",Better Days,2005
East River Pipe,"You thought you were Axl or Iggy
But you were nothing like that
But you looked good with a bottle
And you smiled like a little brat

And I don't wanna go back
To your town

You thought you were Axl or Iggy
But then the dream came alive
Then we went out and they bought it all
And then I ran home again

And I don't wanna go back
To your town

You're caving in, you'll save yourself
You want it bad like no one else
You won't get in, you won't get through
And everyone keeps telling you
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine

You say it when you drink
How that shrink was on fire
When you kicked him in the nuts
And tied him up with wire
You're fine, you're fine, you're fine

",Axl or Iggy,1994
East River Pipe,"We're going down to Happytown
We never talked the way we feel 'til now

Got a view of the station
And the side of the Colgate clock
Got money downstairs
But you're still jumping off the docks

We're going down to Happytown
We never talked the way we feel 'til now

Can't you feel your life is burning underground?
Can't you feel your life is burning underground now?

We're going down to Happytown
We never said anything 'til now

Can't you feel your life is burning underground?
Can't you feel your life is burning underground now?
Can't you feel your life?

Feel your life
Feel your life
Feel your life
Feel it, feel it

East River Pipe,"I want the crystal queen. 
Go call her on the phone.
She smells like cigarettes.
She feels like silicone.
She feels like silicone.

I want the crystal queen, hey.
She'll kill the dream.
She'll kill the dream, the crystal queen.

September '95 I bought her ___
I took her home a couple times,
Now she never leaves.
She never seems to leave.

I want the crystal queen.
She'll kill the dream.
She'll kill the dream, the crystal queen.",Crystal Queen,2004
East River Pipe,"What's in my head? what's in my head? nothing. 
What's in my head? what's in my head? nothing.
Oh, it's nothing. absolutely nothing.
Could've been something. it's absolutely nothing.

No no
Nothing. absolutely nothing. nothing. absolutely nothing.
Nothing. absolutely nothing. nothing. absolutely nothing.
Oh",Absolutely Nothing,2006
East River Pipe,"Hey, where's my pills?
They were sitting on the window sill.
Should have known something was wrong when last week you tossed my favorite ball. 
Now it's gone.
You're messing with my drug life.
You're messing with my drug life.
___ flash up the union square.
People walk in serotonin pairs.
I remember it was only play 
Devil's sucking in the proteges.
Just shuffle off through the golden mist.
Take a number 'cause you're on the list
And later off second avenue
If it comes down to the drugs or you
Baby, we're through.
Cause you're messing with my drug life.
You're messing with my drug life.
You're messing with my drug life.
You're messing with my drug life.",Druglife,2006
East River Pipe,"Life is a landfill, baby
All this garbage piled high
Black dove filled memories
Secret wishes to the sky

I can hear them say
Come back, darlin'
Come back, darlin'
Yeah, we all know now
That they're piled high

Life is a landfill, baby
You can feel it in your gut
Dig down fifty layers
And you find the stone uncut

You can hear them say
Come back, darlin'
Come back, darlin'
Yeah, we all know now
It's a solo flight

",Life Is a Landfill,2006
East River Pipe,"Oh Lord you got the megatons
Your hatchet men ride 'round with guns

The money flows, the girls are young
Your slaves row fast into the sun

And you say 
Shut up and row you stupid fucks
Shut up and row",Shut Up and Row,2006
East River Pipe,"The ultrabright bitch
She's waitin' in a ditch
A couple hundred thousand bucks
She'll be okay
""Have mercy on the dead""
Spoke it in her head
A couple hundred thousand bucks
She don't even know if it was worth it or no
A couple hundred thousand bucks
She don't even know",The Ultrabright Bitch,2006
East River Pipe,"Prozac or alcohol?
This is my lucky day
Caffeine or Percocet?
This is my lucky day

Better living through
Chemistry she said
What are you on?

Paxil, Zoloft, Xanax
Up ahead
What are you on?

Cash machines and
Suitcase dreams all say
What are you on?

Data glowing
Ghetto blowing but, hey

East River Pipe,"You're gonna wake up someday soon
You're gonna fly right out that window
You're gonna see how you've been tricked
You're gonna smell which way the wind blows

[Chorus:]
You got played, my little girl, my girl
You got played, my little girl, my girl

I should have married you last year, last year
'Cause now you're waitin' 'round for nothing
Your father walks right through his ruse
He knew I never was just bluffing

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks

[Chorus: Snoop [Repeat x2]]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on deez nutz and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run

[Dr. Dre]
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tight than a mutharfucka with the gangsta beats
And we was ballin' on the muthafuckin' Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number 1 song after number 1 song
Long as my muthafuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch doin' the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suing cuz the shit she be doin' ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's takin' me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz

[Daz]
Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough up to no good
We flip flop and serve hoes like flap jacks
(Snoop: But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
Ya run up in them hoes and grab the cash
And get your dash on
While you're chillin', with your homies and shit
And how my niggaz kick the anthem like this
(Snoop: BEEEYYAAACHHH!)

[Chorus]

[Kurupt]
To the store, to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
So I head down the street to long beach
Just so i could meet, a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes
But I'm from the pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a hoe? (Snoop: Why?(echoed 3X)
Cuz a hoe's a trick
We don't love them tricks (Snoop: Why?(echoed 3X)
Cuz a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
And turnin' them trick ass hoes the fuck out
Now

[Snoop]
I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be up in them guts like everyday
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a muthafucka lickin' the protung
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggaz wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time
I'm back to the muthafuckin' county jail
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I get's released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr Dre
Scooped in a coupe, Snoop we got news
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some muthafuckin' chin checkin'
Move up the block as we groove down the block
See my girl's house, Dre, pass the glock
Kick in the do', I look on the flo'
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my hoe, yo
(Bitches ain't shit)
I uncocked my shit, I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed
Man, fuck a bitch!

[Chorus]

[Jewell]
(Dr. Dre in background ""Bitches ain't shit"")
I don't give a fuck about a bitch
But I and her know that they can't fade this
Cause I'm doin' my own thing down with the swang
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thing
I say you know can't deal
Cuz I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfucker need to step back, hell yeah
They need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck (Repeat x3)

And now I gotta do some
And now I gotta do some shit that's clean
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean
Like a washing machine
I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows
That I'm on the flo' ho
But they can't hang with my type on swang
I ain't tryin' to say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones
With the tip of the tongue
And then their sprung
With the nuts hung

Jumping out of the Jag
24's still spinning with a dealership tag
Brand New
Bright leather guts and pearl blue
These hoes they choosing like a lucky horseshoe
But that's alright cause I don't pay these hoes no mind
As I stroll to the front of the VIP line
Straight in I go, headed straight to the bar
I got a superstar status, so I guess I'm a star
Haters checking me out
Now tell me what's that about?
I'ma chill to the point haters checking me out
Sipping on the Crystal
Bitches want to get wild
Popping X and smoking dro' on the verge of my style
These bitches calling, asking where the after party
The Embassy Suites downtown, room 112, my darling
Bring your friends so we can let this party begin
And bring a box of Magnum rubbers so we can fuck till the end

Straight to VIP, my niggaz, man we deep
You gonna go through 2 or 3
Before you get to me

I said ""I'm 20 East, I'm headed to Decatur""
And motherfuck the hater
It's about this making paper
And while she choosing hard, guaranteed I'ma take her
So shake the saltshaker, the dro' is the vapor
I ain't got love for niggaz cause all they try to do is cake her
I ain't sippin on no chaser, that's what we tell the waiter

Just up off the pill, drinking on my beer
Sitting on a mill, but I'm pimpin still
Riding round the track, like Goldie in the Mack
Still I'm Don Coreleone pimping hoes from my realm
Mesmerized by the words coming out my mouth
So I'm flushing money quickly out these bitches' bank accounts
After that I bounce
To another ho, in a totally different city
for a whole other show
They say, ""why you don't call?"" I say, ""bitch, where my dividends?""
""You always out of town"" I say, ""bitch, where my dividends?""
""You probably in the club"" I say, ""bitch, where my dividends?""

Underground where we dwell, the hell with hip hop
Southside just reckless, from GA to Texas
And next it's gone be me flexing in a suburban or lexus
But it seem like the bigger I be, mo' figures I see
The mo' hating niggas try me
Big baby trick crazy thinking he bout' to fade me
Better sit and wait in consequences fo' you feel you can play me
From a place called T-town be down in the south
Where them' players throw dem' boz and gold teeth in they mouth
And dump dump if ya' jump jump
The club crunk off the funk that we bump bump and pump pump
Through yo' speaker when it reach ya' now you tweaking like Beaker
All the people out there hype as hell, I guess it Lil' Peter
From T-town to Atlanta all the way to Savannah to Alabama
I be damn a club ain't crunk in this manner
I can't stand a weak buster
For all the freaks, hustla's, to the clothes
Y'all gotta get it crunk and drop dem boz, drop dem boz

[Chorus]

I can't afford bigger, how ya' figga'
That you gone stop me from stacking six figures
Now you hating on me, because my game so tight
And could you be mad because I fucked ya' wife
Well it's true, that's the price nigga check that hoe
I'm from the ATL player, wear that reckland ro'
So stop talking all that shit, and trying to buck
I'm popping off at the mouth, we get cha' fucked up, now what's up

Now ladies are you tired of trick bitches in yo' mix
Acting like they want, to lick on yo' shit
Criticizing, everything that you do
And telling ya' who, and who not to screw
Nasty hoes, that ain't clean and shit
They go around sucking on every dope boys dick
Now is these hoes really yo' friend or yo' foes
You tell me, while ya' drop dem' bozs'

[Chorus]

Now if the club packed y'all from wall to wall
And everybody trying to ball, coz sizing all
Ain't nothing but love in the air, we geeing and macking
Some haters off in there, but at least they ain't macking
You got cha' cup filled up, ya' niggas is crunk
Put cha' hands in the air represent where ya' from
I'm from the GA baby, where freaks is shady
Man it can be so crazy, so we burn trees daily
When the beat a drop, everybody just lock ya' boz and shake dem' hoes
And proceed to rock, from the front to the back
With the blunts and gats, on the hunt for some cat or a fat ass sack
Tear da' roof off the club, show you niggas some love
And fill a swishe up with bud for my g's and thugs
Now dem' haters keep watching, dem' freaks a jockin'
The beats is rockin', so partner want you keep on dropping
For my thugs

[Chorus]

Now right now I want all my hard niggas to follow me, follow me

East Side Boys,"{*SIREN sounds*}
[Intro: Lil' John talking]
""Yeeeeah! (Yeeeeah!) It's been a long journey getting' to
this motherfuckin' point of this Crunk Juice shit. (What?!)
But we done got to the last motherfuckin' song niggaz
(Last shit niggaz!) And I got five of the hottest motherfuckin'
emcees in the world, givin' you that gangsta shit!
IT'S THE MOTHERFUCKIN' GRAND FINALE!!!!!!""

[Verse 1: Bun B]
We growin' doja in the basement in that underwater garden (Okay)
When hereon in the bank shed, dry it 'til it harden
Make it hash up in the oven (Man), put yayo in the hot plate
Drain and dry in the freezer, it's obvious we got weight
I said hard work, that's soft work even with wet work
Built-in clientele so we ain't gotta network (Let's go)
We always got work, so we ain't gotta get work
And if you ain't gettin' your work from us you bound to get jerked
We yayo experts, we been whippin' the yola since the crackas decided to
take the coke from Coca-Cola
Hold the rollers, the king of the Trill
The underground as well, you can step in the ring when you feel
Nigga just sound the bell
Can't sound the heaters in this game, but the grind I'm lovin'
Nigga we passed all that pushin', man it's time for shovin'
I got the mask, I got the strap, soon as I find the gloves
We gonna start exposin' off like Farhrenheit 9/11

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I'ma speak clearly 'cause I don't think they hearin' me
A nigga only fear's gettin' charged with conspiracy
I'ca get it right to ya, sticky green white to ya
Wear whatever you want, bullets goin' right through ya
If you stressin' to get buried
My niggaz'll send you back to the essence in a hurry
Sippin' Crunk Juice, blowin' Dutchies in the Chevy
Try to figure me out dawg, I'm light but I'm heavy
Yellow lemonheads in the bezzie of the presi'
And yeah, anybody'ca rock but D-Block rock steady (D-Block!)
FED's don't need no warrants 'cause why'all all informants
So I get higher than New York insurance
Try to keep shit clean like Florence
Moved on up on the East side 'cause I never lost endurance
And it's all real niggaz, if I ever get a license to carry
Shit, that's a license to kill niggaz

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I refuse to lose, I rather give these weak dudes the blues
And separate them from they jewels, teach 'em don'ts and do's
I raise tools, make crews make decisions confused
All spectators can say is, ""This lil' nigga's a fool""
A short fuse with some loose screws, some unscrewed
Better prove, you niggaz pussy as the Moulan Rouge
So who guardin' who, you know who to you know what
To you know where, goin' 'gainst 'em's too unfair
'Cause everywhere you do a show he got kinfolk there
Now you know I ain't no ?, I got ten folk there
They ain't powerful as the one at the end of your prayer
Got you runnin' for your life without a minute to spare
Catch you dead to the granite, melt the grease in your hair
When I go, them boys is gonna be indecent affair
Guarantee you nah a real nigga breathin' accounted
At your funeral, just your parents and the preacher was there
Hollow, television name-dropper reachin' for help
So I ain't gotta say a word, pimp you beatin' ya'self
You gon' get what you deserve for disrespectin' the game
Any nigga with the nerve to say another man name
When that other man ain't even present
And deny it when somebody ask him about it
That nigga's a lame, you like to lie on the mic
Hide behind fame, I was a G when I came
That's the way I remain

[Verse 4: Nas]
Who besides the Egyptian-walker, fuckers have a conniption
My existence persistent to bring foes misfortune
I dazzle 'em, like the alderman, Billy Dee in Mahogany, minus the perm
From the tiniest sperm that the mightiest The Almighty can muster
Project prophet, chronic blockage gives Alzheimer's to youngsters
Amongst them is me, can't remembers my beefs
With who? For what? They screw-face me up, my boo laced me up
Bolinsiaga, flimsy condo with bimbos in south of Kalan Gro in pimp mode
The inf' glow on his clothes and you know it's over
Hammer hit pin, pin hit shell, from the shell the slug gonna chew ya
Try not to lose me, I try not to lose'ya
Mamma say mamma sa mu makasa, fly to Cuba
To chill with some politi-kill niggaz who ill
'Cause why'all niggaz are losers, don't get comfortable nigga
Say hello to Mr. Bad Guy, get that cash par, I'm the last don
You'll ever know so, here you go why'all can take these thoughts
Anyway I'm chargin' emcees a late fee cost
So when why'all done with my style, please break me off
But never make Nas mad just in case cross
'Cause ah, lately why'all don't make me happy
To calm my nerve I need the herb GNC don't carry

[Verse 5: Ice Cube]
Who the fuck is that? It's Ice Cube motherfucka
He's a maniac, no I'ma fool motherfucka
Old school motherfucka, blow through a motherfucka
What you heard about a nigga so true motherfucka
See I'm ugly and prettay, I'm polished and grittay
Shoot better than that nigga that tried to kill 50
See, niggaz get shittay when I come to their cittay
When I hit the spot that bitch they like -- she cummin' with me
Cause I got an ego big as TO, but I'm not an Eagle
Bitch, I roll with Rigo 'cause gangstas don't dance we boogie
I told you motherfuckas Kobe didn't take that pussy
Get money, get paid, you can beat that shit
Even if the DA is a piece'a shit
Colorado got movatos, don't eat that shit
Another White bitch lyin' on thee Black dick
I keep it flippin' like flapjacks, pimpin' like black 'Lacs
Give niggaz flashbacks, they sweaty as ass cracks
When I hit the tar mat, it feel like a carjack
Niggaz get out and vanish like Star Treks
So fuckin incredible, I'm so fuckin' credible
No matter what happen, I'll never turn federal
And that's my report comin' straight from Cali

When a girl at the party when she backin' it
Now this girl dance freaky 'cause she passionate
If I ask for some chips, then she stackin' it
She don't need no introduction, she's a diamond of daw
And I don't mean no janitor, the way she mopping the flow
Tattoo on her backs saying 'ready to go'
Man this girl must get pimped away I'm ready too hoe
I'm going to take you out to ghetto girl around the globe
Freaking in the kitchen girl, go somewhere around the stove
In the chumps we chilling in some hotel robes
I put her towels on her body and massage her toes
There ain't nothing like some sex on a Friday night
But then again nothing like some sex in any night
After that gotta go got appointments girl
I'm a doctor, I got other clients girl
Now listen up close, I won't say it again

Hey Kelly!
Oh damn! There go expensive Chris
At the bar behind all the most expensive shit
And his car always got the most expensive kit
So his gun always got the most extended clip
Hey! Luda Luda, I'm built to last
Nicknamed double barrel and I'm built to blast
Since your girl ain't a freak, well you gotta convince me
Cause I'm all up in the fifth getting straight Lewinsky
And smoking some of that ""Kill Bill""
Ten Mil motherfucker I'm still trill
Can't party with the women that like it dick
Refuse to cut my hair like Michael Vick
Dirty bird even judges say the birds are dirty
We the reason that the clubs start closing early
Walk up and watch the crowd start moving quick
And I ain't gotta pay the DJ to play my shit

[Lil' Jon]
Yeah, hey, hey, hey
With the bull pimp cup man I'm sloppy drunk
I don't broke into club it's the king of crunk
Let the anal way find, and and the woofers blow
Throw some ass in my lap and I'm good to go
I spread a shined out bottle, crack a beer
While the ladies are all rubbing my neck and beard
No need to even ask it, who's the boss?
When the dreadlocks slam and the roof come off
The crunk juice got me up all night shit
And in last year making that bite shit
Not an essay calling me Loc De Niro
Stunned with my hell day, Oaklezero
Fresh by the front and I'm ready to play
Got the dog but I knew my had to lie (ok)
BME turn millionaire, and we all like 'what what, yeah'

Since the party so live, I can keep it going
Shit don't stop till six in the morning
Come seven o'clock a nigga still ain't yawning
Baby girl leaving now on her toes
Hangover, wait a minute girl you leaving your clothes
And tickets gonna sell for a major show
If yousa a hater at the booth and the booth is closed
And move out the way I'm a Luda fan

Through tomorrow come what may

Surrender to the darker side

Easton Corbin,"She was workin' a summer job
Sellin' t-shirts towels and sunblock
A Midwest girl who couldn't live without the beach
I was a local boy who worked next door
Never seen a smile like hers before
She put her feet up on the dash of my old Jeep
It was henna tattoos tank tops and ray bans
And hearts drawn in the sand

Cause summer flings ain't meant to last
They always burn too hot too fast
Ya don't talk about it cause you both understand
Ya get drunk on those boardwalk days
That pretty buzzed look on her face
And it fades away just like a seaside tan
And hearts drawn in the sand

Sit out on the St. Johns pier
She drank wine and I drank beer
And when we saw a boat light blink we'd make a wish
Then we'd take a walk where the waves hit your feet
She'd lean right in close to me
And I could taste the sun and salt on her lips
And that day would wash away when the tide came in
Like hearts drawn in the sand

Oh summer flings ain't meant to last
They always burn too hot too fast
You don't talk about it cause you both understand
You get drunk on those boardwalk days
And that pretty buzzed look on her face
And it fades away just like a seaside tan
And hearts drawn in the sand

I think of you and it all comes rushing back
All the good times that we've had, I think of you
I know you're better off where you're at
And there's nothing I can do to change all that

Wonder if it makes you think about me too

Why you gotta go and wear your jeans so tight?

Eastwood,"Everyday I fuck with two bitches and they both got duties
One do dirt, the other do dishes
My one bitch is viscious, the other is a real ho
The one under my pillow will leave a nigga crippled
The one layin' on my chest kno' how to work the strip pole
The other, family come from a long line of pistols
Now nina is a nine, and her brother is a 12 Gauge
Her mother is a .25 I packed in the 12th grade
Her pops, a .45 Heckler & Koch
And her uncle is a .44 Glock, they make ya pop
Her grandma is a revolver, .357
Her grandpa, big Mack-11, send yo' ass to heaven
I got the whole collection, family tree of weapons
Desert Eagles, Ak's, TECs, and Smiff & Wessons
That's my protection for when I'm steppin' in the club
For you bulletproof thugs, this is bulletproof love

Uh, Uh
You like the best thing to happen to me
And you said if we hung together, wouldn't nuttin' happen to me
I ain't even want to come outside
You kept braggin' bout the sun, and how we can have fun outside
So we hopped in the ride, I got you on my side
And I'm feelin' the urgent moment like Bonnie & Clyde
You keep poppin' that gangsta shit
How you could pop any man, its a plan about stayin' ya chips
How anyone get in front of ya, holla
How anyone get in front of ya, keep dollas or don't bother the kid
It's a cold world, you put the heat in dis bitch
Your the reason that Bin Laden, ain't defeated dis bitch
So I'mma keep this bitch, get deep down in the streets with dis bitch
Leak wit dis bitch, sleep wit dis bitch
Eat wit dis bitch, creep on feet wit dis bitch
I'm in love with a snub, and it's bulletproof love

We close together like me any my daughter
A shotcaller, when it time to rob we both in tact wit the manslaughter
I never knew that we would become so close
You on the block wit a nigga, everytime I slang yae and post
And you can never leave me, you know I fucks you the best
And if a nigga trip, I know you puttin' four in his chest
Do let the smooth jay fool ya, nigga my bitch will do ya
And they got nicknames like Nina's,Ross,Tech's, & Rugers
I love mine, wit a nigga through hard times
And when I tried suicide you wouldn't let me die
Yeah it's all hood, that's why I keep you close
Everynight you sleep wit a nigga and rest yo' head on my pillow
She's automatic, a Glock-9 Automatic
Ready to break off static, smashed off in a Benz wagon

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone

Death and robberies 
On the dark blocks where bodies bleed
Jake inside the P.J.'s, the heat waves
Kids play where heat sprays
Straight floods, no love, fake thugs
Draw blood with Four-Four snubs
Tear away your rug
Kids with clout 
Up in the Range Rover with chicks, spray in their mouth
Drain 'em out, set up for the wet up, bang 'em out
These streets in Queens remain the murder scene, blood stain 'em out

Inside the chambers of Hell
Where all the L puffin' niggas dwell
And fell 'cause of a loss of blood cells
Bullet shells, glass is shattered
Shit gets torn and tattered
Niggas brains is splattered on sewage drains when they be goin' at it
Static over addicts, revolvers and automatics 
It's illmatic how I seen one catch two in the cabbage
From an initial, official shiny nickel played pistols
Sparklin' like crystals, launchin' missiles
Domes get blown like whistles
Ain't no jokin', niggas will leave you and your Momma soakin'
And smokin' and blown open
Bodies found in Hoboken
Kids comittin' murder after murder
Shit is real so I feel for the ones that don't pack steel and burners
Bodies be droppin' down around Queens

The seams

Stay stackin' papes, plus my Fam flip cakes
While some of us rap, other fellas flip 'caine
Rock big chains, what ya'll think this a game?
Murder incorp. slash open cases with cartels
We do things that make the Mob tell
The way we go outta state and flip more cakes then Carvel
Ya'll play the cut, and watch this lil' nigga prevail
'cause I spit much hotter than Hell
So why ya'll playa hate and plot to creep on mine
I pay ya'll no mind, but violate and speak to the Nine
I'm a B.K. Son of a gun 
When I spit 16 bars ya'll rap niggas dial 911
I'm only 14, and ya'll rap dudes ready to run

Busted in twice, stuck with a knife

Put heaters to your Man and double the price
Snuffin' your lights, shake you like a couple of dice
Nothin' is nice, prepare for combat
Firearm cats with long gats, end up where you get embalmed at
Lay on the floor flat, pull the gat format
Direct beside your door mat 
Cock the Fours back, blow out your Whore's back
Leave the kids wigs tore back

Go to war rats, niggas you strapped? let me take that

And unofficials, get gun missiles clapped in your lung tissue
Me and my Dun's'll hit you, slugs not even one'll miss you
Tons of pistols

Bust a shot - you kickin raps?  Naw stop
What you don't want me to gave I already got
Property acres the lab the Ac' plus the queen spot
Once you see me drop this 100, miles and running
Blow me out the spot, not, but quite cunning
You're dumb and, young and restless, I'm makin you wait

I'm Hot like 97, the year's ninety-nine
Return like Makaveli but still hard to find
It's a conquest, so hard, but yet they still try
to defeat this black brother comin out of Bed-Stuy

If not today there'll be a bullet for you one day
The gun play used to be the forte
As a youth, bustin' shots off the roof for horseplay
But once you get a glimpse of the shots, flyin' at you
You think about the possibility of dying and that's true
You won't be stressin' the gun my son
You'll be askin' the Lord for a chance, just one
Trials and tribulations, critical situations
Read it in revelations, check the configuration
They poison our population no matter your occupation
No matter your congregation, this is a troubled nation

[Chorus x2] 

I've seen the worst of the worst, I've seen the best of the best
Seems like the weight of the world is ridin' on my chest
A universal pain, my soul has absorbed
Don't respect no phonies, don't pay attention to frauds
The Lord only knows the depths of my sorrow
And some don't follow because their brains are hollow
So swallow these words and observe the signs
Yo turbulent times, are disturbin' the minds
of the youth, and ghetto life, is the proof
The only skills that's taught, is how to cock and to shoot
Poverty crack guns, hustlers stack ones
Take money is the motto cause we all lack funds

[Chorus x2] 

Nobody owes you nuttin' so you better get yours
My desire flows like sweat, from my open pores
My sores heal, but still the scars remain
A lot of niggaz gonna feel, much more pain
But yo I guess that's life, it don't make things right
Been through a lot of fights, cause ignorance makes me uptight
And cats be thinkin', that us rappers ain't real
And other cats be thinkin' street life is all about steel
Some of this may be, but yo, look in my face
Cause can't none of why'all bitches ever stand in my place
Pop the Remi, some for L, Tah, 'Pac and Biggie
Really? Niggaz want to stop the jiggy?
Fuck a willie, still you know you gots to dig me
The city, rotten to the core, no pity
The crowds roar, scavengers are out to get me

When all the citizens retire to take their clothes off and perspire
It's one of those rules the greatest fools obey
Because the Sun is far too sultry and one must avoid its ultra-violet rays

The natives grieve when the White Men leave their huts
Because they're obviously....definitely....Nuts!

Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun
The Japanese don't care to, the Chinese wouldn't dare to
Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly from twelve till one

In the Malay States there are hats like plates which the Britishers won't wear
At twelve noon the natives swoon and no further work is done
But mad dogs and Englismen go out in the midday sun

It's such a surprise for the Eastern eyes to see
That though the English are effete, they're quite impervious to heat
When the White Man rides, every native hides in glee
Because the simple creatures hope he will impale his solar topi on a

It seems such a shame when the English claim the Earth

Those were different times.
And the poets studied rows of verse, 
And all the ladies rolled their eyes

And Jane, she is a clerk.
And the both of them are saving up their money...

The march of the wooden soldiers
And you can hear Jack say

And other people, (like us) they gotta work
And there's always some evil mothers
They'll tell you life is full of dirt.
And the women never really faint, 
And the villans always blink their eyes.
And the children are the only ones who blush.
'Cause life is just to die.

Wouldn't want to turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played the part
He wouldn't want to turn around and fake it

Jockin' the freaks clocking the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shooting some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about making that GTA

Went to the spot where my homebys chill
The fellows out there, making that dollar
I pulled up in my six four Impala
They greet me with a forty and I started drinking
And from the eight-ball my breath start stinking
Love to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped out and he started to shout

Eazy-E,"Good evening, and welcome to eazy's playhouse
You stupid muthafucka

Now that you got the album
What the fuck are you gonna do with it
Bitch

Easily I approach
The microphone because I ain't no joke
Tell your momma to get off of my tip
I have no time to give her my dick
I'm gonna hold it, and walk around the stage and
If you fuck up I'm goin' to get my gauge and
Unload the barrel and laugh
'cause I'm puttin' lead in your mothafuckin' ass
Psychopathic, but the hoes are attracted
Because when I'm on hard, my dick's at least a yard
In the days of old, I was a nut
Now I need at least 3 hoes when I fuck
'cause I do a check, nut 1 nut 2
Then I save a nut for when there's nothin' else to do
Get used to the crew, bitch, cause I would never quit
As soon as you think that's it I'm still talkin' shit

I told you that nigga was crazy
E boy, that's my boy, godamnit

I got a fable that you need to listen to
It's a funky little rhyme about a bitch or a two
One's sharon and the other one shaun
I want to nut but which one do I want?
Shaun said eazy let me fuck you blind
And sharon said e I want to blow your mind
I said fuck it, I know what should be done
Just pull your panties down and I'll fuck the biggest one
And then I get the
Other pussy put it in the freezer
So I can always have a on-hold skeezer
Yeah that's the ticket, I'll do it like that
So I told the hoes to take a big step back
Took the zipper down, eyes wide, and said
Here's what I'm gonna put inside
Grab it like a rabbit, grab it let's work it
But I won't love you when I'm done I'd still be talkin' shit ...

That boy'z good
Yeah that boy's good
That mothafucka'z talkin' all kinds of shit
I used to get pussy like eazy eric every day
You're mothafuckin' lyin'
How you know I'm mothafuckin' lyin'?
You're lyin', your dick can't get hard ..
Oh, suck my dick mothafucka
Nigga you lied
Who you're talkin' to..?

Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut that shit
Hey yo yella boy! wantcha rewind it!

Niggas don't see I'm a 100% legit
And you know it ain't about all that bullshit
It's about fuckin' this bitch and that bitch
But not the bitch with the 7 day itch, like that ho'
Just throwin' me the pussy
She says she wants to do it like a doggy
She's bad, nobody is badder
But she got more crabs than a seafood platter
Bitch on the gank move, to skeaze me
Just to say ""I got fucked by eazy""
So I slapped the ho' like a pimp
Oi might be a woman-beater but I'm not a pussy-eater
So when the shit hits the fan, it's outta my mouth
You don't like what I'm talkin' about?
All of ya'll can just suck my dick
You can quote me now cause I'm still talkin' shit

The boy's good, I told you the boy's good
The nigga has talent
You don't know a damn thing
Yeah, I like that part, bring that shit back one more time, maestro
That's that old z.z. hill, huh?
I can do the mashed potato nigga, what can you do?
I can do the bugaloo

What fuck is up? In the place to be.
Coming on the mic is Eazy Motherfucking-E.
Dre is on the beat.Yella's on the cut.
So listen right close while we rip shit up.
(Shit Up echoes while fading.)

Well I'm Eazy-E, I got bitches galore
You may have a lot of bitches but I got much more
Wit my super duper group coming out to shoot
Eazy-E, motherfuckers cold knocking the boots
'Cause I'm a hip-hop thugster, I used to be a mugster
If you heard (cash register), you think I own a drugstore
Getting stupid because I know how
And if a sucker talks shit, I give him a (POW)
8 ball sipping, the bitches are flipping
Slow down, I hit a dipping, continue my tripping
Hitting my switches, collect from my bitches
The money that I make so I can add to my riches
Fill my stash box and start rubbing my gat
Feeling good as hell because my pockets are fat
A hardcore villain cold roaming the streets
And wit a homie like Dre just supplying the beats

Because I'm a ganster having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy does it

I was knocking motherfuckers out
What's your name boy
Funky, fresh Eazy-E
Kick, kick that shit
Where you from fool, Compton, yea

Rolling through the hood, cold tearing shit up
Stick my head out the window and I say what's up
To the niggas on the corner cold bumping the box
But you know that's an alibi for slanging the rocks
A dice game started so I said what the fuck
So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck
Hard to roll wit my bitch jocking 24-7
Rolled them motherfuckers, ate 'em up, hit 11
Got another point, I made a ten a fo'
Was taking niggas money and was itching for mo'
Laughing in their faces and said you're all making me rich
Till one punk got jealous, cold slap my bitch
He pulled out his gat, I knew he wouldn't last
So I said to myself, homeboy, you better think fast
He shot (gunshots), Then I shot (gunshots)
As you can see, I cold smoked his ass (ha ha)

Because I'm a ganster having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy does it

(Wait a minute, wait a minute, who does it)
Motherfucking Eazy does it
But how does he do it
Eazy does it do it eazy
That's what I'm doing
Stop
Man what ya gonna do now

Now I'm a break it down just to tell a little story
Straight out the box from the gangsta category
About a sucker, a sucker motherfucker
He's addicted, he's a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house car and golden rings
But the cooky cooky crack took all those things
He must of been starving 'cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out
Now I wanted for a murder that I had to commit
Yea I went to jail but that wasn't shit
Got to the station about a quarter of nine
Call my bitch to get me out 'cause I was down for mine
The bitch was a trip cold hung up the phone
Now my only phone call was in the ganking zone
All the SHIT I did for her like keeping her rich
I swear when I get out, I'm gonna kill the bitch
Well by now you should know it was just my luck
The baliff of the station was a neighborhood cluck
I looked him straight in the eye and said what's up
And said let's make a deal, you know I'll do you up
Now back on the streets and my records are clean
I creeped on my bitch wit my uzi machine
Went to the house and kicked down the do'
Unloaded like hell, cold smoked the ho

Because I'm a ganster having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it
Boy you should have known by now, Eazy does it

From around the way, born in '73
Hardcore B-boy named Eazy-E

Checkin' out the sound that Eazy is throwin' down
With some help from Ren and Dre
Makin' a way with dope style
Yo Eazy, what ya gotta say

A miracle of modern creation
Eazy E's on the set
Hyped up with the bass
And a little bit of what ya love
From a brother who's smooth like a criminal
I mean subliminal
Otherwise known as a villain
Because I'm ruthless
When I spot a sucker, I kill 'em
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see

EAZ-Y

Yeah 'cause this is the way I know you like it
So you won't strike it
I took it and I hyped it
And now that it's done, I know ya pleased
At how the E just dose it with ease
Just imagine a crowd screamin', a girl dreamin'
Just to get a picture of me 'n' my B-O-Y-Z
From the H-double-O-D
N.W.A., down with me
Strong 'n' I'm ragin'
Turn the page 'n'
See I'm not a son of a gun
I'm a gauge 'n'
Nothin' can avoid this shot 'cause it's hittin'
It's so cool when you touch it, wear a mitten
I'm comin' off raw into ya speaker
Makin' the suckers on the street feel weaker
But most I think know not to deal with me
Yo, it's obvious, tell 'em who you came to see

EAZ-Y

Aw, never, I'm just too clever
So, in fact, that no one can sever
A blow from a maniac and yo, I make it clear
So a register is all I hear
Money overturned, then I jet
To make another hit, for you to go and get
Record stores sold out because you love it

Eazy-E,"Yo Ren, you're ready to go get this move?
[Believe that, boy]
You're strapped?
[Yeah, you know it]
Let's go do this, man, I got it all planned out
[Yeah, shoot any motherfucker that moves]

[""Alright everybody...""]

This is a stick-up, everybody get face-down
Ren, gag their mouths so they can't make a sound
Tie 'em up for the fact that I'm kickin' ass
I got my hand on my gat, and I'm tempted to blast
My name is Eazy, but I go the hard way out
This ain't personal, but now I'm about
To commit a crime and go through with it
You know what, no need for shakin', because I'm used to it
Take out the security guard with a slap of my hand
Yeah, he's wearin' a badge, but he's a ol ass man
Pump his ass in the head, and take his gun
So me and the punk can go one on one
Cover the lens on the TV screen
You know, so me and my gang just can't be seen
Lock the doors, and throw away the key
Close the blinds, so no motherfuckers can see
And smile, you know, cause I'm controllin' the shit
And no sucker ass nigga's gonna stop the hit
Wardrobes and locs, and a Ruthless shirt
That means I'm ready to work, and rush a fool to the dirt, so

[Repeat x4]

[Alright, anybody move and I'll blow your fuckin' head off]

Alright
Empty your pockets, but do it slow
Take everything you got and lay it on the fuckin' floor
Don't make me have to set an example today
And blow one of you crazy motherfuckers away
I'm in a bank, and it's a little bit funny
Takin all you stupid motherfuckers' money 
Peepin at a bitch cause my dick's on hard
Laughin at the dumb ass security guard
Who's tied up for the moment, not sayin' a word
I should have known it before, the motherfucker's a nerd
But back to the bitches I'm peepin
And then untie the hoe, so I can start creepin
Took her to the backroom, about to jack
Cold trailed the bitch, with a gun in the back
I said: ""Lay down, and unbutton your bra!""
There was the biggest titties that a nigga ever saw
I said: ""Damn"", then the air got thinner
Only thought in my mind, was goin' up in her
The suspense was makin' me sick
She took her panties down and the bitch had a dick!
I said: ""Damn"", dropped the gat from my hand
[What I thought was a bitch, was nothing but a man]
Put the gat to his legs, all the way up his skirt
Because this is one faggot that I had to hurt, so

[Repeat x4]
[""Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt""] 

[I said get down. I want you all face-down on the floor
Anybody moves and I shoot]

Stackin up the money and there's more to collect
Cause I don't give a fuck, I take traveler's checks
Yo, Ren, peep out the window, and tell me what you see
[Three motherfuckin police starin at me; what to do now?]
Hurry up and get on
Allright, tell me, who is the motherfuckin alarm?
I'm a give ya a chance, and count to three
Or else five of ya bitches are comin with me
[Police: Allright, Allright, come out niggaz, or we're coming in
This is the only chance to turn yourself in]
Fuck you! We got hostages, and plenty of loot
And don't give a damn and not afraid to shoot
We're sendin out the hostages, all except five
And if you don't meet our demands, they won't stay alive
We want a copter, so we can get away clean
And take some pussy along, if you know what I mean
One hostage got brave, and got off the floor
But I smoked his ass before he got to the door
[Police: They shot a hostage, they shot a hostage!]
[MC Ren: You stupid motherfucker tryin' to run
Now you're dead as fuck tryin' to race a gun]
[Police: Allright, this is the last chance to get off your ass
Or else the tear gas is about to blast]
I ran to the back and Ren followed behind
To a hell of a spot that was hard to find
The bank was fucked up, the shit was smokin
With screamin hostages, runnin and chokin
Gettin away, but I was suddenly stopped
At point blank range, by a motherfuckin cop
And I hope they don't think that a lesson was taught
Cause a nigga like the E was finally caught
My gat wouldn't fire, the shit wouldn't work
So, y'all know what time it is

Don't need no punk niggas payin me
And broke groupie-ass bitches don't faze me
I take two step back and release myself
To put platinum-ass cuts on the record shelf
I don't brag, but i tell it like it straight-up is
Before you do a record, nigga, handle your business
And don't get caught slippin on the under

The road ahead goes on and on.
The shit is getting' longer than the muther f**kin' marathon. Runnin' on but 
never runnin' out. Stayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out. 
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do. But nobody's pickin' up a nigga witta 
attitude. 
Confused. Yo, but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose. One of the few who's been 
accused and abused Of the crime of poisonin' young minds. But you don't know 
shit til you been in my shoes. And Dre is back from the c-p-t. Droppin' some 
shit that's d-o-p-e. So f**k the p-o-l-i-c-e! And any muther f**ker that 
disagrees. Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass. 'cause I'm a nigga known for 
havin' a notorious past. My mind was slick - my temper was too quick. Now the 
FBI's all over my dick.

Got us tick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock. That's 
when the e jumped off the startin' block. A 100 miles from home and, yo, it's a 
long stretch. A little sprintin' muther f**ker that they won't catch. Yeah, 
back to Compton again. Yo, it's either that or the federal pen. 'cause niggas 
been runnin' since beginning of time. Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my 
muther f**kin' mind. Runnin' like I just don't care. Compton's 50 miles but, 
yo, I'm ma get there. Archin my back and on a straight rough. Just like Carl 
Lewis I'm bailin' the f**k out. from city to city I'm a menace as I pass by. 
Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm A straight up nigga that's done 
in, gunnin' and comin' Straight at yo ass. A 100 miles and runnin' 
This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton.
You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you: ""nowhere to run 
to, baby. Nowhere to hide."" Good luck brothers.

Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose.
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused.
I know it was a set-up.
So now I'm gonna get up.
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up.
But I've got 10 000 niggas strong.
They got everybody singin' my ""f**k tha police"" song.
And while they treat my group like dirt,
Their whole f**kin' family is wearin' our t-shirts.
So I'mma run til I can't run no more.
'cause it's time for mc ren to settle the score.
I got a urge to kick down doors.
At my grave like a slave even if the ren calls.

Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'.
Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherf**ker's are ridin'
Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it.
So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it.
The number's even - now I'm leavin'.
We're never getting' took by a bitch with a weave in.
Her and the troops are right behind me.
But they're so f**kin' stupid, they'll never find me.

One more mile to go through the dark streets.
Runnin' like a mutherf**ker on my own two feet.
But you know I never stumble or lag last.
I'm almost home so I better haul ass.
Tearin' up everything in sight.
It's a little crazy mutherf**ker dodging the searchlight.
Now that chase, the shit, is done and
Four mutherf**kers goin' crazy with
A 100 miles of runnin'
Stop! stop! stop! stop!
Surprise, niggas!",100 Miles and Runnin' [DVD][*],1995

Why don't you tell 'em what ya name is

My name is eazy yeah this is true
Keepin' your attention is what I'm gonna do
Hardcore yo I could never be soft
Askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off
Fillin' up my memo with the touch of my rhyme
Suckaz stayin' with me cause they know the time
Quiet on the set because I'm about to begin
And if you didn't hear me boy I'll tell you again
My name is eazy or just call me e
But it doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I'm the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin'
I just gotta keep cursin'
This is for the radio so I better chill
They won't play it if I could get ill
But I'm like that and that's an actually fact
Because the street is where my heart is at
Yo I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope
But I'm doper than anybody who trys to cope
If the rhyme I'm dispayin'
And the beat that's playin'
Yo you could try all day
And you still won't match up with the ruthless p.o.w.
'Cause eazy's doin it compton style
That's the city and you say you could get some
Yo it's eazy-er said than dunn.

Wooooooo!
Wooooooo!

Now it's easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
I'm not a role model or a Dr. Seuss yo I'm a gangsta
And I'm about to get stupid
I guess its time for the trama
With the E-a-z-why-e comma now that's drama
So pay attention by the way I must mention
I'm comin' off hard in the third demention
With the glare
But you don't need no glasses to stare
It'll probably take you in and it's just like your there
With the e on the gangsta tip
So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip
'Cause I'm a destroyer
My homie Dre is a doctor not a lawyer
Dope MC employer on ruthless and that's my label
To get the money, the women, and co bust the fat cable's
Boy, master rhymers of toys
I mean straight while ya suckin' with the girls enjoy
You must be sick or ya lonely
How ya gonna diss me if ya don't even know me

Get the gat show 'em where it's at
And that's just the sound
And next time I'm peelin ya cap
To let ya know where I'm comin' from
Eazy said it and it shall be dunn

Wooooooo!
Wooooooo!

Radio jams are the part of the cycle
Eazy-er said than dunn yeah that's the title
Rubbin' the lady's only the fly ones ya know
(M.C. ren: but would if she's lucky)
Eazy come eazy go
Don't ask to battle me home boy what's that
You want to battle me boy ya better be strapped
'Cause where I'm from it ain't all about that playin'
Now that's what I'm sayin'
Sevy thought that I was born in '73
Now everybody want's to know the a-g-e
Girls on the tip fellaz too it seemed
Had everybody thinkin' I was only fifteen
The fellaz would annoy me
The ladyz would adore me
And what was I to do
I wishin' nothin' lady's do
'Cause the ladyz I luv 'em
Nice and then soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off
I'm the real eazy cause others be fakin'

I'ma smoke mothafuckaz...
Cause I'm the ""E""

So you can kiss my black ass
Fuck the white house, it ain't my house
So you can burn the mothafucka down for all I care
Cause t-shirts and khakies is all I wear
I'm from the city where they show no pitty
For a punk ass mark in the park
Blow his brains out, stuck him in the bushes
Take his gat, leave his ass for the rats
And let me hit that cisco, I got a 187 on my pistol
Warrant by the LAPD
Key for puttin' in work out my trade
Because the president never simp
One dumb dog to my residents
I'm goin' crazy like 1980
I need my ends, fuck you, pay me
Or I'ma have to get the strap

I make you shit in your pants
And shake like jelly

You can't check a checker

I got the strecher on stand-by
Starvin' for a nigga like you
The things is much bigger 
Than the trigger
So I can show how to put in work:
The Ruthless-network drive-by experts
Straight outta compton kickin' up dust
The place where guns don't get a change to rust
I warned them and they still approached me
Now I got two more golf-hats for my trophy
I got a brand new trend, it's killin' men
Who is that? That's my little friend...

Eazy-E,"We're sitting here with Eazy E
Believe that 
How are you doing?
All right
So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster ?

Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin' , I specialized in gankin
whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
Daily, it's all about comin' up
Makin' sure no punks are runnin' up
Because I'm a gangster havin fun)
Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin' through Compton
Terrible, I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear, and out the other
Ran my gang, sold undercover
Call a girl out a name, yo I ain't no lover
I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin' for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a six-fo' Impala
Rollin, and runnin' from the police
Brother don't you know you can't trust a thief
or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal
Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
Hard and raw, no regard for the law
(Eazy E, were you ever caught slipping?)
Hell no! Just trippin' off eight-ball
And girls ain't  nothin' but female dogs to me
Bitches! I'm sorry for that verse
It's in my nature, I gotta curse
out anybody gettin' on my nerves 
You get beat, ganked, broke and served
So you know who I am
and if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn

Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent?
Sometimes
Ok, what would be the situation when you so-called ""gank"" somebody?

Wait for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Look then all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
easily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow, cause it takes timing
Looked around, and then I climbed in
Once inside, I start takin'
Cause you know it's no time for shakin
Get what you gonna get, front and center
or get five years for breakin and enter
Move quickly, but no runnin'
Shht, I think somebody's comin'
Hear the front door key, and I flee
out the back door with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall don't fall
Wipe my sweat cause that was a close call
gettin' ganked by the E is a lesson
So is there any more questions?

Yes, as a matter of fact, there is
Have you ever been involved in, like, a armed robbery or a hold-up?
You mean a two hundred eleven ?
Yeah

There's a store, but don't point
Walk inside, case the joint
One man behind the counter, another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
Go in broke, come out with cash
(Were you slick?)
Yeah, you gotta be cunnin'
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'
Walked in, said: ""This is a robbery""
Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
I want money, beer, and a pack of zig-zags
The man in the back had a camera
so he came out to test his stamina
against Eazy E, but he took one
Fell to the floor, so I ran
back to the bucket, then I said: ""Punch it"" 
Took the gun, and then dumped it
I'm not like Robin Hood, cause I want more
Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
(Is all that true ?)
I don't lie
You see I'm not mister nice guy

Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?
Not exactly
And for your listeners, what does Eazy think of himself?

Bad and bold, you can't get with this
Those that tried, you're on my hit list
Can't be caught, sought or fought
thought, and damn so what?

Creepin through the drive through kinda slow

Not knowin I'm about to lay their ass down
Reach for them fools make my move
Leaned out my jeep and I creep kinda smooth

I knew this muthaphukka named Louie
Every day the nigga talk shit but today he tried to do me
He rolled down my block with a pistol and a stare
a black khaki suit and dooky brades in his hair
The muthaphukka think I'm slippin
But I got my gat and a 40 and I'm sippin
Waitin for the fool to get out the car
The stupid muthaphukka thinks I'm a star
But I'm not, I'm the type that kick the niggaz ass
Fast ! Eazy E's a nigga that'll blast
Hold up, wait, the nigga started to load his gat
I grabbed my bat and ran around the back yo
He's at my window, thinkin I'm playin Nintendo
But the stupid nigga don't know I'm behind him so
he dropped the gat like a stupid muthaphukka

She's butt-naked with my dick in her hand, yo

nigga behind the car, and he was duckin
So I told the bitch to hold on [Hold on]
You stupid bitch, put yo muthaphukkin clothes on
I wonder if this nigga's tryin a jack me
Coz I ain't got my gat with me
Shit, the nigga started runnin up fast
I thought he was gonna blast, so I hid behind her ass
She started howlin out ""wait"", I banked her in the face
But the punk nigga pulled out [?? mace ??]
He asked the stupid bitch did I mug her
So I bashed his head in with my Louieville slugger

I'm a muthaphukkin psycho and I don't give a fuck about'em
I kill the nigga and cut off his dick, so you know I got'em
coz [?? huh ??] ate his brain, left the nigga for dead
Now it's a gallon of blood, drippin from under his bed
[Oh, no ! What happened to my lover ???]
Bitch I bashed his head in with my Louieville slugger
Bitch tried to call the cops, fuck that
I gotta take the girl out with my muthaphukkin bat
Coz I ain't doin 10 in the pen
for a bitch and her dead-ass boyfriend
So...I gotta kill the ho
I'm reachin for my weapon slow
That's when I notice some nigga standin by the door

Verse One:

It's that man comin up from that land of tha see-P-T

Comin through with a big lick for '94
Showin alla y'all them true-ass gangsta flows
So bow-wow bow-wow the big dog's in town
and them guts is the only thing a nigga pound
Laid back as I blow a fat sack
Hittin switches for them bitches, hittin corners in a Cadillac
So take a ride on tha ruthless side
with the E to the A-Z-why
That nigga makin more off yo hits than you do
you fools, need to recognize this crew when I roll through
Tryin to speak up on tha OG, nigga you don't know me
Break em off these nuts lil want to-be
Cause I peel caps if need be
And ain't nothin you gonna bring don't see me
Just tah let you know...

Chorus: repeat 2X

One more time for the rhyme again
Comin from the see-O-M-P-T-O-N
	Just tah let you know 
	Just tah let you know

Verse Two: 

It's the E comin up from the gank
so nigga let me ride all the way to the bank
Coz ain't nuthin on my mind but the gips
Gotta have a grip, run a nigga dip
Back to the pass on the Compton streetz
Where the niggaz get beat when us gangstas meet
And fools gettin mad coz they can't ride like I ride
Front n back, dippin side to side
And it's been like that since I was a BG
""It's the E,"" that's what they scream when they see me
Mama said every day is like this
Fools screamin that I put em in a twist
Thought you had it bad, isn't really all good
If the homies only knew in the hood
That you was gettin done like a two dollar hoe
It's just a lil something from the E tah let you know...

Chorus

Verse Three:

It's still the see-P-T, nuthin more, nuthin less
On a quest to put that bomb in my chest
Coz them busta-ass niggaz can't see what I'm sayin
They think the E be playin [What ?]
But I ain't givin up nuthin but this glock in yo mouth
So recognize that and get yo punk ass knocked out
So if you want to ride nigga jump on in 
Sip a cup o' gin. Ain't no friends when it come to ends
So no hard feelings when you niggaz be dealin
with the original Compton criminal
Coz the only thing poppin is a snaps
and ain't no fun when a nigga be tap perhaps
but a nigga like the E ain't trippin though
I'm just here tah let you niggaz know...

So hit your power button, and let's go

I'll keep rockin' till I hit the peek
And your station is dope E-A-Z-why

With a clip to claw 
Wouldn't draw McGraw 
I trick a law before all and all I'm raw 
A naughty shorty, sporty with a forty 
A laddy takin' tours, just to plan an orgy 
A nasty critter, any hoe hitter 
Hated my babysitter cause she wouldn't let me hit her 
Now get up on it, on and on get on it 
And I will pump it, only if you want it.

Here's something from the ding dong cause 
I really care how long ya been strong grown 
Here comes the switch dome chrome

Out the rudder but I call for a yes y'all toots

I face ya fact throw a heck just like woody wooder

So I live when I step it's the pimp 
And I rep so make a right and get left quick

Get up on it, on and on get on it 
And I will pump it, only if you want it.

Bang when the gat sneaks, two in the back seat

Duh is a fool who don't ride to slide to a ride 
I'm shudder shakin' the place when I start hey

It's that nigga with the cool and mellow shit for your ass
Takin' niggas back through the past
All up on my nuts shit be swingin' like a fist

In a motherfuckin' candy 4, beat that ass with the switch
Then blast on the bitch who was all in my shit

They say real niggas was dead but this nigga be alive
So I'm puttin' it down with that nigga E
For all of my niggas in the C-P-T

You ready Eiht?

[MC Eiht]
Yeah, c'mon

[Mack 10]
I was born to ride, banging, pack heat
Got turned out early by them scandalous freaks
Addicted to crime so I stay in the mix
With a love for hoochie chicks and pulling jewelry licks
Moms said, ""Mack, baby watch for danger""
I said, ""Momma don't you know I'm a real gang banger?""
I can't switch over night and be good
And I'll be damned if a nigga turned his back on the hood
So I walked out the door, hopped in the Regal
Twisting triple gold with the all black eagle
Got a deuce fired at Scoob's, I need a gat
So I stopped and got the Tech from my G homie Wreck
He said, ""Mack, don't slip dog, u gotta stay heated
And here's the extra clip incase you might need it""
Get the eighty eight skate, ang get your slide on
Throw the Hoo-Bang plack in the back and your ride on

[Chorus: x2]
Ride for me, I'ma ride for you
You Hoo-Bang, I Hoo-Bang, so we all a crew
Get yo ride on, get yo slide on, who the best
Nobody rides like these killas from the west

1, 2, 3, and to the 4
Eazy motherfucking with a chrome to your dome
Cruising, in my 6-4 rag top
I got a lot of juice, a lot of fucking block
Now when I hit that switch I'm bouncing
More bounce to the ounce and I'm clowning
Keep the gat in my lap cause I'm fully strapped
For the car jackers, but no haps cause I pack a
Tech 9, plus a A-K 47
Send a one way ticket to my hell or maybe heaven
Peep, nigga I don't sleep
Bury motherfuckers in the concrete
You try to creep kinda slow in a Astro
But I'm peeping niggas out in my left window
So I blast, and I blast, so I blast no more
Yo, they call me motherfucking John Doe

[Chorus]

[MC Eiht]
Real thugs roll cause the Westside's sick
Which enemy depicts to catch the 9 clip
Slick, but not like Rick, the gang story
G's kill and ain't shit funny like Joe Corry
Don't make me laugh cause I""m on the wrong the path
Catch the blood bath, it's the aftermath
Slang strike to make money, now ain't that simple?
That silly nigga's wearing vest's but we aim for the temple
Watch my nigga's back, who sacked the yayo
Keep the calico with extra ammo
So and so gets blasted, to the casket
Never seen these west side G's face, we masked it
Y'all best be defeat and be discreet
Catch the hot heat from across the street
Take me in the dump schools that, wanna push me
Retaliation, straight better than hitting pussy

Eazy-E,"Cruising down the street in my six four
Jockin' the freaks clocking the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shooting some hoops
A car pulls up who can it be
A fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about making that GTA

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
Till I caught him in my car trying to steal my Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly cluck head pulled out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded twelve gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
Went to the spot where my homebys chill
The fellows out there, making that dollar
I pulled up in my six four Impala
They greet me with a forty and I started drinking
And from the eight-ball my breath start stinking
Love to get my girl, to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb hoe says something that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Her father jumped out and he started to shout
So I threw a right-cross cold knocked his old ass out

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control
Then wrapped my six four round the telephone poll
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walkin' home I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin' Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Kat got beaten for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
Fourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time

You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life but to be legit
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

I went to get them out but there was no bail
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
Disruption of a court, said the judge
On a six-year sentence my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out fire then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the girl but didn't hurt her

Threw up the sign I cock the 9, I cock the 9.

Well nigga pop the 9and let it holla
Test drive wit a neighborhood's scholar
Black Impaler, blue chucks on gettin outta
Sucks on hip hop thugsta get the fuck on

Show me love or peel my cap quickly

For keeps that's the rule of the streets 'uh'.

Fully loaded, Smif N Wess to protect my nest
Let you trip, disrespect, you get checked
More direct, you end up with a hole in your neck

Got turned out early by them scandalous freaks
Addicted to crime so I stay in the mix
With a love for hoochie chicks and pulling jewelry licks
Moms said, ""Mack, baby watch for danger""
I said, ""Momma don't you know I'm a real gang banger?""
I can't switch over night and be good
And I'll be damned if a nigga turned his back on the hood
So I walked out the door, hopped in the Regal
Twisting triple gold with the all black eagle
Got a deuce fired at Scoob's, I need a gat
So I stopped and got the Tech from my G homie Wreck
He said, ""Mack, don't slip dog, u gotta stay heated
And here's the extra clip incase you might need it""

Better yet ask PETA whoever
Which animal makes suede

Eberhard Schoener,"San Francisco, July 27
A 40 year-old accountant had lost his bid to collect 38 dollars in damages from a cocktail waitress
Who broke a date with him

Judge Richard Figoney ruled yesterday in small claims court against Tom Hosley
Who sought the money from Alison Cheeselet, 31
because she had backed out on a date to accompany him to the theater
Mr. Hosley said he drove 35 miles from his home in Campbell to San Francisco
To pick up Ms. Cheeslet and was upset that she had not called him before he left home to tell him the date was off

Judge, explaining his decision, said:
""The promise to engage in a social relationship for one evening in exchange for affection and all one evening at the theater
is an impossible [?]
[?] involving a contract.""

Mr. Hosley had presented the cardboard
broken heart at the theater
And Judge Figoney took note of it in his opinion

Quintilia
in the first century A.D.
observed that faint hopes are often like the dreams that waltz away
plaintiff's exhibit A for identification:
A cardboard object in the shape of a broken heart
is all that returned to the plaintiff
with the court mindful of [?]
[?] there we part

Pursued its fleeting, fluttering significance
While he suffered its seeming less meaninglessness
And lived in seeming madness

And who walked in secret the last turn of the labyrinth

The golden trail was blazed
And I was reminded
Of the eternal, of ship men and their stars
For a day I could breath once more and live
And face existence
Without the need to suffer torment,
Fear, or shame

With rags around her feet
Clutching ancient shopping bags
Destitutions beat
Burned out like a frozen matchstick
Screaming at the wall
A helpless hungry lady
With no friends to call
Chorus:
I wonder
Where she goes when the night falls
What thunder
Has made us deaf to her calls?
Bag lady...
Oh gloveless, shattered frailty
The damp wind bites her hands
She shuffles by a restaurant
Towards their garbage cans
She eats the rotten refuse
Like vermin on the dead
Screaming at the passersby
""Get it through your heads!""
Repeat chorus
Sometimes on my way to work
I give her my spare change
The Shopping Bag Lady
Looks at me like I'm strange
She never once says thank you
But I don't mind a bit

Can't make no sense of it

Well, he ain't write this verse
Some people put they money first, and don't care who they hurt
Always talkin' bout how they, finna do this and finna do that
Finna get that new Benz and finna buy they girl a Cadillac
I try to mind my business, they strike at me with a vengeance
Don't know I'm young and visicious and know how to throw them fist-es
Say I don't keep it real, (what?) say I ain't got the skill
(we) mad cause I got a deal, give a fuck bout how you feel
I represent the streets and that's the way you gotta be
And when my album drop, some people gon' be mad at me
Bitches don't wanna listen, don't wanna play position
Ain't got a pot to piss in, but they call they self dissin'
Your next move should always be your best move
Never follow what the rest do, and they'll respect you
Cause money come and go, don't front like you don't know
And when it's all spend up and gone, you ain't got shit to show

[Chorus]

Now my baby mama hate the fact, now that I'm gettin' scratch
So she go and react, hold up man, matter of a fact
Now that I'm thinkin' back, when I ain't had no scratch
No ice, or no 'lac, hold up Kwon rewind it back
Now was you gon' react?
That's when I hate the fact, I laid her on her back
(hold up man, don't say that)
Nah, let me spit the facts
Y'all know I love my son, but she only care about if he got some air force ones
Now ain't that shit dumb? Now where we both come from
Like all your life, you grew up running around spending funds
We was broke as Hammer, t-shirts for pajamas
Cribs small as llamas, eating corn flakes and bananas
Now it's vests and Hummers, we fucked the whole summer
The only reason, cause your man be tryin to take me under
So now I sit and wonder, like I ain't got no clue
And yes it's true, that the money might have moved you

Ebony Eyez,"Take me back to my dreams of G.I. Joe and make believe 
When I used to fall asleep. 
Playing army in the fort, watching Star Wars on the floor 
Looking up to so much more 
Take me back to that place where the sun shined on our face, 
Where our memories never fade 
Take me back to the day where we could always slip away 
Being cool under the shade 
Camping out under stars in the backyard with our cars 
We could stay out here for hours 
At home watching Scooby Doo in my He-Man underroos 
Telling me I have the power

Take me back, take me back, take me back to a better day",Take Me Back (Interlude),2005

What one won't do, bet the next one will
Might swoop through and holla in my Coupe Deville
But that's only if I got some time to kill

See this one name that's hip to the game
Never been the type that would stick with a man
You ain't tryna be committed, well, we one in the same
You say my attitude is shitty and at times I'm vain

I mean what else can I say I guess I'm guilty as charged
Caught a felony from the way I'm spittin' these bars
I'm from St. Louis City and I claim it with pride
Ain't no shame in my game, this is where I reside

And I done seen a lot of things
So I'm hip to how they plot and scheme, it?s not a thing
Tryna get me out the Prada jeans, yes, I'm not a lean
Girl, you gotta have a lotta green, know what I mean

If you can't walk the walk, don't talk the talk
I'm a grown ass woman, can't tell me shit
Just left from the mall, bought a new outfit

And I'm tired of these hoes runnin' off at the mouth
Thinkin' they dos knows what they talkin' about
Oh ya?ll done fucked up you don't know what your in for
The way I fuck tracks you can call me a nympho

I'm drivin' down the block now ridin' with the top down
Rollin' wit my kin folk, they smokin' that indo
My pimp juice gotta 'em actin' like a lunatic
And err city I here them yellin' out biatch

I'm the thing they be claimin' to tame
I met him but I can't remember his name
Fuck the fame, I'm in this for the change

Now I've been known to murder tracks like Roberta Flack
Give a nigga head and they don't know how to act
And I be known to get around when I'm in ya town
Call ya baby daddy, he ain't no where to be found

To hell with being lady like call me promiscuous
And yeah, it?s true they maybe right, but fuck 'em
It ain't nobody?s prerogative if I like to dress sexy
Act seductive and provocative

H-hold up...what you want me to do with that?...damn I'm at it again..
TRACK BOYS!!

[Verse 1]
This dude approached me slowly and
Told me his name was Jody and
His homies say he know me cause he used to flirt with Toni
Say, he wanna get to know me, got some things he wanna show me
Would I be his tender-roni?
Told me call him when I'm lonely
Then I took a couple pictures, feeling tipsy off the liquor
Yeah, my titties might be bigger, but my ass a little thicker
And they like 'em: my weight, my shape, my size
My height, my lips, my hips and my thighs
DROP IT

Nigga you a hoe (drop it)
Bitch you a hoe (drop it)

[Verse 2]
I see my cousin coming, he probably up to something
Look at him, with some chicken head face, know he frontin'
I ain't the one to gossip now, you ain't heard it from me
But that chick that he was mackin' is really a 'he'
And look at her, came out the house looking that crazy
Talkin' bout she got on ""Baby Phat"", that's just fat, baby
You had a cup or two, well that's enough for you
But let him buy you one more drink before you cut him loose
So, gon' flirt a little bit, and make him think you feelin' him
Then smile at him, wink your eyes and make him think he gettin some
Before he know you by the door, see you already out the door
You won't be home till after 4, won't probably stop at Calico's
Pull up on the parking lot, and by this time it's dark and hot
You circled back around the block, and take the handicap spot
And yeah you might just get a ticket, hell with it, you tryin' to kick it
More than likely if you get the digits, she gon' let you hit it
DROP IT

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
After the club you probably tryin' take somebody home
I guess you betta keep it on the low, don't want your cover blown
So you betta make it known, before they play the last song
Cause you ain't tryin' to spend the night alone, right or wrong?
Got money in your pocket, then take it out and throw it
And put your hands up in the air, if you the shit and know it
This cat up in my face, breath smelling like some shiiit
Teeth lookin' like he been bitin' a bag of bricks
He talkin' bout 'girl'.
You think I told that nigga
If you don't get your funky breath up out my face
It gon' be some shit, don't make me tick
Don't ask me for my name..
And you don't NEED to know my numba..
And don't worry if I got my big ol' booty from my mama
It's the last call for alcohol, and I'm just tryin' to have a ball
Ain't worry bout nothing at all, I almost triple play it off
The DJ spinnin' the last records, by this time they half naked
Same place, same time tomorrow they'll be back at it

Damn..my..my batteries low? (shiiit)

See I don't fuss and fight, if he ain't acting right, I just tell him
(say hello to my little friend)
See I don't bust or spit, if he ain't home yet, you better tell him
(say hello to my little friend)
See I don't give a fuck, if he packin' stuff, just let him go and say
(hello to my little friend)
See I'ma be alright, on the lonely nights, you don't believe me say

[Verse 1]
Now ladies, listen closely to the shit I'm bout to share with you
See, I'ma show you what it take to get the perfect screw
Since, ain't nobody speakin' on it, I'ma be the first to say it
And let these niggaz know, they sex is highly overrated
I ain't never been the type, to sit and wait on some nigga
Especially, when I know I can make me cum quicker
No, I ain't really interested in how much you packin'
Cause, I got something that can guarantee me satisfaction
And see my tatics, safer than using some pro-ka-lactic
Safer than using any other code of action, really though
Don't get it twisted, tryin' to think I'm on some right shit
The right dick can turn me on, faster than a light switch
Guess I got a fascination when it comes to masturbation
Nothing like the sensation, penetratin', got me shakin'
Now I caught the midas touch, give me the slightest rush
Something bout it makes me blush, the only one I trust

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now here's something that women do
That I just can't see to phatom, now why the fuck
We walkin' round faking orgasms
Ain't nobody speaking on it, ima be the first to say it
And let these niggaz know they sex is highly overrated
I ain't never been the type to waste my time with amateurs
Cause ain't nothing worser than a nigga with no stamina
And then got the nerve to go and run and tell your home boys
Well, did you tell them, I had to cum off my own toys?
Know a lot of niggaz, gon get mad and say I'm male-bashing
And yeah I know they probably hate this song with a passion
Instead of attitude, you should be showing gratitude
Tryin' to show you little dudes, an avenue you never knew
A lot of ladies walk around frustrated sexually
When it comes to fixin', they don't know how easy that could be
Follow my instructions carefully
I promise you for surely guarantee
That it will make you come faster than a speeding bullet

Broke my aging skin 'cause age was mine
Had a field day, smelt like roses
Harvesting my thoughts 'cause it was time

When you grasped the question
Did you miss the meaning?
When you met your challenge
Did you go out fighting?

We will discover
Ripeness twice over

Sing your song, worth its weight
In God gold, curse its fate

When you grasped the question
Did you miss the meaning?
When you met your challenge
Did you go out fighting?

How will we recover
Ripeness when it's over?

I lost something in a big room
Change the shape of the world for long enough

When you grasped the question
Did you miss the meaning?
When you met your challenge
Did you go out fighting?

When you climbed on top
Did you fall on shadows?
And clambering off
Did you fall on rainbows?

How will we recover
Ripeness when it's over?

Neither kinder nor the kinder
(How will we recover?)
Are you fuel for the fire?
(Ripeness when it's over)

Neither [Incomprehensible] nor the over
(How will we recover?)
Must have others to inspire
(Ripeness when it's over)

I've discovered my Nietzsche
I've discovered my Nietzsche

Death should be unleashed or something

Do tell me what's the difference?

Do tell me what's the difference?

Hard to gauge

Nice to have known you
But something went awry
And I've outgrown you

I slither awhile
Before I shed my skin
And laugh when you said
There was no such thing as sin
No, no there is no greater me
The lad inspired by total greed
'Til it breaks
'Til it bleeds

So goodbye cut and dry
Nice to have known you
But something went awry
And I've outgrown you

Has gathered dust on shelves
And all those who lent an ear
Heard no good of themselves
No market here for sound advice
And those who seek must pay the price

Blood of Christ

And I had some
I couldn't handle it
But I had some

Hold it in the light
And see right through it
For God's sake
Make a decision
Take it for a walk
And hold it hold it
Pin it on the wall
And fasten onto
Move into the bathroom
Oh yes, oh yes
Do what must be done
And don't say maybe

Dreams turn to _________
How did it get to this
I never saw it come
How do I get to miss
What I've never done?
Say the word and I will come
Burning like the golden sun
Say your will
It will be done
Your star is shining
Out at everyone
Everyone
Skin deep and sinking
You're fingerprints
Will stay with me
Always I'm thinking
Of how you left your dirt on me
On me
What was I thinking of
To give you a part of me
I can't get the stuff off
Forever inside me
Say the word and I will come
Burning like the golden sun
Say your will
It will be done
Your star is shining
Out at everyone

Say the word and I will come
Burning like the golden sun
Say your will
It will be done

Something else

Grew up a boy
Turned to a man
Is this the world you wanted?
It seems
Under the soil
Over the sand
Not quite the seed I planted

And now

Echo 7,"Rocking on a burning cinder.
I'm sifting through the ash and then,
Well I'm thrown away by inhabition.
Cynical and weak and wearing thin.

I am lost and I am bleeding.
Break the skin that covers me.
Just stumble through a tired moment.
Longing for symplicity again.

Gone away (you're lost so far away)

Falling off and climbing backward.
I'll suffocate in cellophane.
Normalcy a fine illusion.
Something that I'll never understand.

Can you hear my silent screaming?
I'm losing alll my reasoning.
Skeptical from intuition
Sinking into insantiy and swim

Far away (you're lost so far away)
Gone away (you've gone so far away)

Like the ways that might have been
They'll play inside my head.
One deciding moment;
Giving into it.
I don't know why,
But I'm feeling all inside out.
Drown in my own wishing well.

It ain't no fun if I can't reroute your hoes in this direction
Swerve in the intersection, I'm done, she restin'
No question, done session

Home wreckin', Doc motherfuckin' Dre, no guessin'
Nothin' less than, I mess when I'm sexin'
Bang on the block
Even Asian bitches like to bang cock
Draws drop, she bunny hops
On it like a pro, she comes out the clothes

But, uh, she flips the dildos
Whether in the Pumps, Nikes or the steel toes
Dre, you can spot it in the Benzos
Squawtin' real low, got me drivin' real slow, she's a real ho
And even though her parents spent the fat chip
On that private school chip
She graduated, got some thug dick and flipped
No more checkered sweater, vest and plaid skirts

She's out here naked more or less and that hurts
But she's in good hands 'cause Suga Free palmin'
He sent her to the Sheraton with Thomas
If you need 'em they at 310-629-9755
You hit 'em and they let you know when she's arrived
Oh, she okay, she just runnin' an errand
With this Portuguese dime piece named Karen

Bouncin' through the mall, spottin' 'em all
A sucker for a dick sucker ready to fall
For a daughter like yours
Got him pattin' his pocket and comin' out his drawers
Layin' his jacket on puddles, openin' the doors, all for what?
Because I promised her my name
Gave her the game and still ain't fucked

Contemplatin' the game Dre and me best do
If you feelin' froggies then leave when we test you
But I'm guaranteein' you bitches leavin' three less two
Never mind what that love and hate one pairs do
Y'all just snicker at that hooker when we all pass through
Dr. Dre and DJ Quik will probably outlast you
You're like see-through pair of boxers nigga yo ass through

Bitch, you need some good dick, I got that too
Speed bag the clit, leave it black and blue
Time of yo live, I got that boo
Creep late nights up in hotel rooms
We drank, eat shrooms
Kill something, crank the volume
Fuck in every room
You know your home girl want it, Tag team bitch
Why you being dick greedy? Tag team bitch

When she cums, she drips on mattresses
Bedroom time comes I handle shit
Wifey caught up me nigga

That's show biz, that's how hoes is

Long as you keeping it on a hush she ridin' dick
Ain't been satisfied much, she's been fakin'

I just want to know
Are you scared of the real thing
Are you searching for sympathy
Walking a wire on your own
You want it (you got it)
You want it (you got it)
You want it (you take it)
Then you're sorry
You do it all again tomorrow
No one cares and no one follows
You want it (you got it)

You want it (you take it)
Then you're sorry
Swallowing the same excuses
Falling in the same holes

An ancient race that has no ashes, not a trace
Five and one rest here, an eternal reunion

Ecki Heins,"Manchmal redest du im Schlaf
Meistens keine ganzen Sätze
Einzelne Worte oder Fetzen
Die ich kaum verstehen kann
Manchmal verdrehst du deine Augen
Unter den verschlossenen Lidern
Machst eine Geste dann und wann
Die ich nicht erwidern kann
Was sich aus deinen Träumen
In unserer beide Tage trägt
Hat keinen Ort in der Erinnerung
Nur ein stiller Schmerz

Im ersten Licht des Morgens

Von noch nie betretenen Orten
Mit noch unverwandten Worten

Wir reden manchmal wie im Schlaf
Von noch nie betret'nen Orten
Von einer Zeit in ferner Zukunft
In einer Sprache deren Worte
Wir noch lange kaum beherrschen
Der wir uns blindlings anvertrauen

Reden wir manchmal wie im Traum

And can it teach me how to dance real slow

From the canyons of the mind
We wander on and stumble blindly
Through the often tangled maze
Of starless nights and sunless days
While asking for some kind of clue
Or road to lead us to the truth
But who will answer?

Side by side two people stand
Together vowing, hand in hand
That love's imbedded in their hearts
But soon an empty feeling starts
To overwhelm their hollow lives
And when they seek the how's and why's
Who will answer?

On a strange and distant hill
A young man's lying very still
His arms will never hold his child
Because a bullet running wild
Has struck him down and now we cry
""Dear God, oh, why, oh, why?""
But who will answer?

High upon a lonely ledge
A figure teeters near the edge
And jeering crowds collect below
To egg him on with, ""Go, man, go!""
But who will ask what led him
To his private day of doom
And who will answer?

If the soul is darkened
By a fear it cannot name
If the mind is baffled
When the rules don't fit the game

The colored thoughts in muddled heads
Relining in the rumpled beds

'Neath the spreading mushroom tree
The world revolves in apathy
As overhead, a row of specks
Roars on, drowned out by discotheques
And if a secret button's pressed
Because one man has been outguessed

Is our hope in walnut shells
Worn 'round the neck with temple bells
Or deep within some cloistered walls
Where hooded figures pray in halls?
Or crumbled books on dusty shelves
Or in our stars, or in ourselves

If the soul is darkened

Try to remember when life was so tender
That no one wept except the willow
Try to remember when life was so tender
And dreams were kept beside your pillow
Try to remember when life was so tender
And love was an ember about to billow

And all my love's faces
She comes in the morning
Her cloak in her arms

She's following after
The king of all places
And your tenderest warnin'
Could bruise all her charm

But don't lose your heart
To that beautiful sinner
She walks without shining a light now

She stands in the shade
And the sun is there in her
But you'll never know till it's night

All my love's softness
And ll my love's graces
She carries all things
In her tiny white glove

She hides all her lostness
In satins and laces
And everyone says, everyone says
She's searching for sweet love

But don't try to hold on
To Satan's proud lady
She stands with her flock
All alone on the hill

Her stockings are hung
And her eyes are so shady
She's winning and you never will

That no one wept except the willow
Try to remember when life was so tender
And dreams were kept beside your pillow
Try to remember when life was so tender
And love was an ember about to billow
Try to remember and if you remember then follow follow follow

Ed Bickert,"Why do robins sing in December
Long before the Springtime is due?
And even though it's snowing, violets are growing
I know why and so do you
Why do breezes sigh every evening whispering your name as they do?
And why have I the feeling stars are on my ceiling?
I know why and so do you
When you smile at me I hear gypsy violins
When you dance with me, I'm in heaven when the music begins
I can see the sun when it's raining, hiding every cloud from my view
And why do I see rainbows when you're in my arms?
I know why and so do you

Ed Bickert,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

I dreamed a dream one day
And now that dream is here beside me
Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed

Aladdin's lamp is mine
The dream I dreamed was not denied me
Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for long ago was you

Angels composed it for us to dance to.
Our waltz is moonlight trembling with kisses,
Each note a heartbeat throbbing with love.

And our love was their inspiration!

Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone
Our waltz will play on.

Ed Bickert,"There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings,2001

And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way

Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1961
Ed Blackwell,"An early photograph
Of the young braid with the confident grin
Who is celebrating his first defeat
By clouching a haircut from his skull

In death of modern man
Like a young braid with a price on his head
Delilahs and Samsons

Stands the accused the symbol is clear
Cut from his skull
The long hair
The long hair

If this is the missing link
The threaded locks getting down to remain
Unable to avoid the sacrifice
The short back and side

The closest shave

First you must think and then you began

Seemingly retreating
The coiling spring is triggered to leave father ahead

But know they pie inside
Death before dishonor

But all awhile he don't think nothin' of you
And that's just what love do
Stab ya in the heart
Grab you in the dark
And rip families apart
Damn... we was supposed to be fam
We had plans
Now I claim to understand you
I guess life is a gamble
I shook the dice
But I betted on the peasent
Then I took a dive
Like oohhhhh.... 
How come I ain't know
I should've seen it was simply soul
Now I know.... what's loyalty
It's all clear to me
These words is for the birds
You ain't real to me
Life is a liar
Got me spinning like the tires
Hug a drunk driver, back and forth
you ain't ready and you petty
So I laugh it off
But it's a cost to be the boss
You gon' pay for not being loyal

Little Ceaser, go ask your homie how I'll leave you
Cut your trick ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil Kim, don't play around with real G's
Quick to snatch your ugly hair off the streets
You Little weave! I'll let them suckas know it's on for life

Ed Bradfield,"Way out in the island with the coconut tree
With the pearly shells and the tropical breeze
There's a hillbilly girl from Tennessee
My hillbilly hula gal

She's had enough of the hills and me
So she's taken to the lessons in Waikiki
I guess she's right where she wants to be
My hillbilly hula gal

She dances with wahini's in the islands now
She's trying to do the hula but she don't know how
She's got the poniola's in her own corral
She feeds them grits and gravy at the old luau

The Blue Grass hills and the Mountain Dew
Wait till she leaves Honolulu
She better come home like she's suppose to do
My hillbilly hula gal

Now she looks twice as good in a little grass skirt
Than overalls and a tore up shirt
But corn don't grow in lava dirt
My hillbilly hula gal

There's smiles on the faces if the island boys
Cause her southern drawl gives a big enjoy
She can't churn butter when she's dipping that poi
My hillbilly hula gal

Now she never used to give a hoot for coconuts or taro root
She's a country gal living in the islands now
She's trying to get the hula girl to show her how

When she gets through with this fantasy
Just come on back to Tennessee
Back with me where she's suppose to be
My hillbilly hula gal, my hillbilly hula gal

Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
'Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone

A cowboy ain't easy to love and he's harder to hold

And each night begins a new day
If you can't understand him and he don't die young
He'll probably just ride away

Them that don't know him won't like him and them that do
Sometimes won't know how to take him

Ed Bruce,"My first taste of Texas had blue eyes and golden hair
Beneath the Tennessee silver moon, we found a feeling we could share
And days made no difference, I'd been around and she was young
But my first taste of Texas still lingers in my heart and on my tongue

Her gentle heart was broken
In a way that a tender lady shouldn't have to know
And mine was somewhere in between
Something I should hold on to or let go

Her talking blue eyes told me
The story of the love she failed to find
And without conversation
I suppose the lines on my face told her mine

My first taste of Texas had blue eyes and golden hair
Beneath the Tennessee silver moon, we found a feeling we could share
And days made no difference, I'd been around and she was young
But my first taste of Texas still lingers in my heart and on my tongue

'Cause we're not done, we've only just begun
Begun to love, now the two of us are one
And days made no difference, we're still around and love's still young
And my first taste of Texas still lingers in my heart and on my tongue

Ed Bruce,"I feel so bad I've got a worried mind I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou
Saving nickels and saving dimes working till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou
I'm going back some day come what may to Blue Bayou
Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on Blue Bayou
Where the fishing boats with their sails afloat if I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be

Go to see my baby again wanna be with some of my friends
Maybe I feel better then on Blue Bayou
I'm going back some day gonna stay on Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on Blue Bayou
With the girl of mine by my side till the silvery moon and the evening dies
Some sweet day gonna take away this hurtin' inside",Blue Bayou,1982
Ed Bruce,"I could tell you that it don't hurt you're leavin' me
And I could say it never really matter the way you've always treated me
Baby I could lie to you some more and say I won't cry when you walk out back door
But I know better
If someone had just told me you would be like this
I'd always runnin' and lookin' and a wantin' to taste some stranger's kiss
Baby that have been good advice I took
I tell myself I'd never even givin' you a second look
But I know better
Go on and have your fun see the town and run around
I don't think you've got too much longer to run
There'll come a time when you're too tired to run

Ed Bruce,"Oh Lord if I could just go home I'd do things different from now on
There wouldn't be near the gray in my old daddy's hair
Oh Lord if I could just go home

I know it wasn't daddy's fault that mama died when I was just a kid
And the best that he could do to raise me right was all he ever did
And I know he'd love mama a lot longer than I had and he was every bit as alone
But I don't guess I'd helped too much to build a happy home
He made sure I got to church every Sunday the way mama had always done
And he was always sorry he had to work so hard and he never had much time for fun

He knew I missed mama a lot
And maybe he was easier on me than he should have been
But it sure ain't his fault that I didn't turn out to be much a man
Well I've grew on into my teens and I guess I thought I was a real hard stuff
Goin' into town hangin' around bars and actin' pretty tough

Well I'm looking out at a different set of bars now
And that little window don't let it much light
You see I got roarin' drinkin' mad one night and I killed the man in a fight
I got a letter from back home the other day

Saying dad had a stroke and he ain't doin' too good
Well if I had done right I'd be there now to help him and God you know I would
And I'd pay him back for all the years of love that he gave me
And I'd be a better man the way I was taught to be

Ed Bruce,"Did you ever say I'm lonesome and stop to wonder really what lonesome is
Lonesome is a little boy standing in a crowd a telephone ringing in an empty house
Lonesome is an autumn leave that first falls from its tree lonesome is me

Lonesome is a footstep with out of place to go
Or summer is last robin in winter's first snow
Lonesome is a little dog lost out in the street lonesome is me
Lonesome is an empty bottle a half filled glass of wine
The sound that a clock makes when all you have is time
Lonesome is a heart that breaks when love has turned to hate
The dying sun at the close of day
Lonesome is a jail of tears that won't set me free lonesome is me
Lonesome is me lonesome is me




",Lonesome Is Me,1982
Ed Bruce,"This very night the train was right on time

Her train cross the river flying now what will I do like
Sunshine helps make your day she helped in her own way
Without sunshine flowers waste away Memphis morning
Oh oh Memphis morning you're not so pretty anymore
Raise your bridges start your whistles blowing
I don't know what I'm hanging round for Memphis morning

Now you hold too many memories
Best thing I can do is leave you with 'em without me well
If I come back this way now I'll try to plan my day
So you won't see me passing through Memphis morning

Ed Bruce,"Ninety-nine years is a long long time to bust your back and the heart of mine
You sweat so much you can't cry tears when you stop to think about ninety-nine years
Ninety-nine years on a harder rock mine I work two years off of my time
Ninety-nine years go so slow when you still got ninety-seven more to go

Wrong kind woman got me in this mess wantin' pretty things and a satin red dress
What I couldn't make she said I have to take and judge said ninety-nine for just this sake
[ guitar ]
I take a rest when the guard turns his head
Hopin' he'll be nappin' maybe shoot me dead
Those days drag by and the years go slow
But thank God I only got ninety-seven more to go
Ninety-nine years on a harder rock...




",Ninety Seven More to Go,1982
Ed Bruce,"I met her sadly in the slowly falling rain
Crying softly in her loneliness and pain
Knowing no one needin' someone bad as me
And she told me as I held her trembling hand
Walking slowly how she'd never known a man
Living lonely in her cottage by the sea

When the morning came her tears had changed to laughter
And before the night her heart beat close to mine
And I thought as she lay sleeping of the secrets she was keeping
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind

In the morning as I wakened with the dawn
Without warning I could feel that she was gone
Leaving nothing but her silence next to me
And lonely footprints that I followed in the sand
Walking slowly for I knew where they would end
Disappearing in the silence of the sea
And I sometimes hear the echo of her laughter
As I search for what I know I'll never find

For the answer I was seeking was the secrets she's still keeping
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind",Shadows of Her Mind,1982
Ed Bruce,"I stole her from Emmett Fry, and now what's done is done.
Like any man I'm afraid to die, but I'm hurt too bad to run.
I ran with her to Walker's Woods with him close on my heels;
I knew he'd kill to get her back, and I know just how he feels.

Oh, the sun never shines in Walker's Woods;
I doubt if it would want to come in even if it could,
'Cause the gators and the cottonmouths, the sand that pulls you down
Makes Walker's Woods a haven for the damned.

By the quicksand over there my dream came to an end:
She said it was a big mistake, that she'd return to him,
So I gave her to the hungry sands, now all I loved is dead--
And all that's left is the scarlet rag that she wore upon her head.

Oh, the sun never shines in Walker's Woods;
I doubt if it would want to come in even it could,
'Cause the gators and the cottonmouths,the sand that pulls you down
Makes Walker's Woods a haven for the damned.

I've no regrets; I loved her; five more minutes I'll be free--
I'd have made it if that cottonmouth hadn't made his strike at me.
But I have to laugh when I think how mad old Emmett's going to be
When he finds out he never got to take one shot at me.

Oh, the sun never shines in Walker's Woods;
I doubt if it would want to come in even if it could,
'Cause the gators and the cottonmouths, the sand that pulls you down
Makes Walker's Woods a haven for the damned.

Ed Bruce,"I wish there was a way to love a lot
And only hurt a little when love lets you down
I wish there was a way to love and run
And not find the hurt behind you when you turn around
But I guess I know why love's the way it is
I think I know why love is such a game of hit and miss

If it was easy everyone would do it
If it was easy everyone would be in Clove
If it was easy I'd be the first to do it
If it was easy I'd gladly go back through it
If it was easy everyone would be in Clove

I wish love was a part that you could play
And then just walk away when the curtain falls
I wish that you could take it as it comes
And leave it when it Comes without a second thought
But I guess that's not the way it's meant to be
I try my best but love just seems to get the best of me

Voices sound sad as they're singing along another piece of America's lost

He rides a feed lot and clerks in a market on weekends selling tobacco and beer
His dreams of tomorrow surrounded by fences
But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here
He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark
And eyeball to eyeball Ol' Wyatt backed down
He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas
And rode with the Seventh when Custer went down
This is the last cowboy song

Remington showed us how he looked on canvas
And Louie L'Amore has told us his tale
And Willie and Waylon and me sing about him
And wish to God we could have ridden his trail

The Old Chisholm Trail is covered in concrete now
And they truck 'em to market in fifty foot rigs
They blow by his market never slowing to reason
Like living and dying was all he did

To get down on my knees to you and I would
But baby now that's all changed today's a brand new day
You ain't worth the price I had to stay

Just because you're the best looking woman that I've ever seen
Ain't reason enough to have to treat you like a queen
There's a harder lesson you need to learn and it might as well be today
Baby you ain't worth the price I had to stay

I'm tired of tryin' to turn the other cheek to you
And never knowin' which way to turn cause you've made up a brand new set of rules
Somewhere I picked up a little more pride than I had yesterday

Or did he say it better than me

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town",Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,2001
Ed Calle,"Strolling along country roads with my baby. 
It starts to rain, it begins to pour. 
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin. 
I feel a shiver run up my spine.
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine.

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,
Walking hand in hand with the one I love.
Oo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside. 

After a while we run under a tree. 
I turn to her and she kisses me. 
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves 
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes.
Sharing our love under stormy skies.

Oo, I hear laughter in the rain,

Please hear me now I pray.
We need you, more than ever,
In a million different ways.

There are wars on every land,
Poverty inside of man.
The earth is groaning from within.
Deliver us again.

From the evil that devours,
Consume it with your power,
We implore you now this hour;
We pray.

Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,
Right here on Earth, as it is in heaven.
Come,
Set up your throne,
And let thy,
Kingdom,
Come.

Our Father, in heaven,
So holy is your name.
The angels, they adore you,
Soon all Earth will do the same.

Where every tear that we have cried,
Will be comforted and dried.
We'll eat from the Tree of Life,
And life will never end.

And we'll worship at your throne,
Where you'll make your Glory known.
That you are God and God alone,
And we pray.

Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,
Right here on Earth, as it is in heaven.
Come,
Make us your home,
And let thy kingdom,
Let thy kingdom
Let it come!

Hello babe, what's happening, you cool?
(Ah yeah you alright? What's happening?)
Yeah I'm good, what's goin' on?
(Yeah, nothing er chillin')
Alright, what you up to later?
(Oh yeah about that, um, dya know what I'm really busy can I call you back?)
This ain't so stereotypical man, not for a stereotypical man, It should be me that wants to get rid of you instead it's you that don't give a damn (what?) It was meant to be a one night 'ting, nothing more than a little one night fling, now when I'm in need you're the one I ring I (I need you tonight)

But she's playing hard to get, brunette with such class she's hard to forget, see at first I wasn't after her heart but I couldn't stop thinking about her after I left. I'm beginning to lose my cool, it appears in love I have fallen (whoops!) I'm ready to put my all in and all she does is ignore my calls!

She's everything I want, but all that I don't need
How can she be so hot, yet be so cold to me
How can it be so wrong, and yet it feels so right
I wish I never, but I need you tonight!

This lady is driving me crazy, she blows hot and cold like the AC. I just can't figure her out next time I'm with her I'm pinning her down (Oi) I'm gonna' find out if she's on it or not (not, not) 'cos all of this shit is long (long, long) See I front like I'm okay but I'm not, I'm being played at my own game and it's long (long blud). I ain't no ediot, I'm pro I'm no intermediate so next time she phones me I ain't even gonna pick up the phone to speak in it (ring) nope, swear down, (ring) wait a minute, that's her now..

(Hello?)
(I really wanna' see you today)
(Alright, just give me a time and a place and I'm there)

She's everything I want, but all that I don't need
How can she be so hot, yet be so cold to me
How can it be so wrong, and yet it feels so right
I wish I never, but I need you tonight!

I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I want you,
Won't stop until I've got you,
There's nothing that I won't do,
I need you tonight,

Look, I ain't never been the type to be this (no) I ain't never been the type to be with, she's exposin' a side of me that, I'm tryna' fight, I'm tryna' hide! My pride, I'm tryna' find it, but ain't seen it I'm an edjit, I know I can't help it im fiending!

Ed Eastridge,"Quiet nights of quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar
Floating in the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts and quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams, and a window
looking on the mountains and the sea.
How lovely! this is where i want to be.
Here, with you so close to me, untill the final flicker of lifes ember.
I who was lost and lonely, believing life was only
A bitter tragic joke, have found with you
The meaning of existence oh, my love.",Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars),2005
Ed Eastridge,"Whenever skies look gray to me and trouble begins to brew
Whenever the winter winds become too strong
I concentrate on you

When fortune cries ""Nay, nay"" to me
And people declare ""You're through""
Whenever the blues become my only songs
I concentrate on you

On your smile, so sweet, so tender
When at first my kiss you do decline
On the light in your eyes when you surrender
And once again our arms intertwine

And so when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true
To prove that even the wise men can be wrong
I concentrate on you",I Concentrate on You,2005

Quanta gente existe por aí 
Que fala, fala e não diz nada 
Ou quase nada 
Já me utilizei de toda a escala 
E no final não deu em nada

E voltei prá minha nota

Vou cantar em uma nota
