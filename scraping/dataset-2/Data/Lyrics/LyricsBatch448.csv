But as long as we're nameless our bodies are blameless

Andy Garcia,"Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself
And softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute, seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life
And none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

I would, my friend, Fernando

I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

It's a living hell. 
  
Wherever you go, 
you live inside of me.

I see your face in the sky, 
in the moon and the stars 
but you know it ain't real.

Ah,but you never can win. 
You finish up crying tears in the

To watch you leave and let this feeling die
You alone are the living thing that keeps me alive

Andy Gibb,"The stage is set another show must go on
The spotlight's burning down into my face
The drummer sits up high upon his rostrum
Guitarists play each other face to face
And when it's over , I'll stop and wonder
And never understand
'cause leaving this was never in my plans
And when I'm playing all I see is things you'll never find
Flowing rivers passing through my mind

Deceiving and receiving was my pastime
to every girl who liked my written lines
They'd think that any moment I'd be their guy
But crying never justified my lies , oh no
And next time 'round will be the same
They never understand that hurting them was never in my plans
My songs will slow like passing clouds
Something in each line
Flowing rivers passing through my mind

I've got to go , I've finished what I came for
Playing every city , state to state
Singing every town that learned to like me
Modest payments paid for what I ate
Ah, you're standing there , tears in your eyes
You once called me a man
And loving you was never in my plans

And you're happy wherever you're at
There's a part of me that wants that summer back

We burned both ends of that beach town
Till they shut down the midway
We tried to hold on, but that warm breeze was gone
Yeah, fall changed everything

But there's nothing I'd change about those days
You're the sweetest thing about my past
There's a part of me that hopes you found your dreams
And you're happy wherever you're at
There's a part of me that wants that summer back

There's a picture of you and me I keep
It reminds me that we were real
Girl, I sure do miss that beach
And the way that you made me feel

But there's nothing I'd change about those days
You're the sweetest thing about my past
There's a part of me that hopes you found your dreams
And you're happy wherever you're at
There's a part of me that wants that summer 
There's a part of me still wants that summer
There's a part of me that wants that summer back

I want that summer back, baby",Summer Back,2015

They say I'm a man of the world
I've flown across every tide
And I've seen lots of pretty girls

I guess I've got everything I need
I would't ask for more
And there's no one I'd rather be
But I just wish that I'd never been born

And I need a good woman
To make me feel like a good man should
I don't say I'm a good man

Having one last talk with my maker
He said you're going to earth for better or worse
We'll see you back here sooner or later

So I said to him, as I spread my wings
Would you do one thing for me

Would you build me a girl from all over the world
I promise I will always adore you
Made in Japan, with style of Milan and a smile from California
Brazilian walk, hair from New York, pretty Parisian curls
Build me a girl
Build me a girl

Well the days went by
Wondering why, why it was I hadn't found her
I was staring at eyes
Smiling at smiles
Still I was none the wiser

And you know I don't
Don't mean to impose
But I thought we had a deal

You would you build me a girl from all over the world
I promise I will always adore you
Made in Japan, with style of Milan and a smile from California
Brazilian walk, hair from New York, pretty Parisian curls
Build me a girl
Build me a girl

So calling all woman who fit this description
If I'm what you're missing
Then please just listen to the wind
The clouds they're all screaming out,
They're trying to bring you to me
So please don't shut them out
Because there is a lady who is made for me
Yes, there is a lady who's been made for me

Cause I said build me a girl from all over the world
I promise I will always adore you
Made in Japan, with style of Milan and a smile from California
Brazilian walk, hair from New York and pretty Parisian curls
Build me a girl

Build me a girl from all over the world

A little hug, a little day dreaming

And we can blame it on the stars

It's all written in the constellations
Now I don't know, but neither do you
Truth is, it's a good excuse
For both our hearts to let loose

And I know that you're a Cancer
Which means you like holding hands
So show me how to do this dance
And spin me like a ceiling fan, oh

I've been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life
I've been pushing all my life
I've been pushing all my life, all my life, all my life
I've been pushing all my life

For someone to call me out when I start to run my mouth
For someone to talk me down of ledges that I have found
Someone to hold me close when I'm screaming to let go
For someone to make it past the guards of a cynical hearts
Sick, sick of singing now

Oh, I always jump ship
We are closer than I've ever been
I said we stay in the fire
And hope we can burn our way out (Oh)

I know that it's not fair to think that you'll still be there
I know that it's not fair (All my life, all my life, all my life)
But if you leave when the pattern repeats
I'm pushing you away but that's not what I mean
Oh I'm ashamed that I cannot believe
That this is what it takes just to get close to me
Is this what it takes just to get close to me?

Oh, I always jump ship
We are closer than I've ever been

Oh, I always jump ship

Andy Grammer,"I lost perspective of who I was, I hit the wall
I knew that it would take a lot but it took it all
No you don't come this far to turn around, covered too many miles
No you don't get this close to breaking down just to close your eyes

While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
I'm chasing myself in the sky
While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
I'll be up here learning to fly
When you know that you can't let go
And your heart already knows
Sure to hurt but it's worth it to be burned
'Cause one day you'll get home
Still it feels like I am always on the red eye

This time around it's not even about getting paid
I'm just an addict for the moment when the magic is made
And when you are who you are who you really are
It can put you through hell
Spend a day in the skin that you want to live in
To see how it feels

While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
I'm chasing myself in the sky
While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
I'll be up here learning to fly
When you know that you can't let go
And your heart already knows
Sure to hurt but it's worth it to be burned
'Cause one day you'll get home
Still it feels like I am always on the red
It feels like I am always on the red eye

I'm finding myself these days
Looking down from a window shade
I'm counting lies on hours
Just when I should be counting sheep
Truth is I can't complain
I do it over and over again and over again

While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
I'm chasing myself in the sky
While the world sleeps under my feet tonight
I'll be up here learning to fly

While the world sleeps under my feet tonight

And brick by brick and piece by piece
And love in both your hands

On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

Andy Griffith,"Sittin' on a bench at West Town Mall
He sat down in his overalls and asked me
You waitin' on a woman
I nodded yeah and said how 'bout you
He said son since nineteen fifty-two I've been
Waitin' on a woman

When I picked her up for our first date
I told her I'd be there at eight
And she came down the stairs at eight-thirty
She said I'm sorry that I took so long
Didn't like a thing that I tried on
But let me tell you son she sure looked pretty
Yeah she'll take her time but I don't mind
Waitin' on a woman

He said the wedding took a year to plan
You talk about an anxious man, I was nervous
Waitin' on a woman
And then he nudged my arm like old men do
And said, I'll say this about the honeymoon, it was worth it
Waitin' on a woman

And I don't guess we've been anywhere
She hasn't made us late I swear
Sometimes she does it just 'cause she can do it
Boy it's just a fact of life
It'll be the same with your young wife
Might as well go on and get used to it
She'll take her time 'cause you don't mind
Waitin' on a woman

I've read somewhere statistics show
The man's always the first to go
And that makes sense 'cause I know she won't be ready
So when it finally comes my time
And I get to the other side
I'll find myself a bench, if they've got any
I hope she takes her time, 'cause I don't mind

Andy Griggs,"Ain't no crime sittin' at the bar
Sippin' on a cold draft beer
Or makin' small talk to the blue eyed girl
When she asks, ?What brought you here?
You're just trying to unwind on a Friday night
But when you see that diamond ring
Shining on her left hand
And you don't bother to ask her why
She ain't with her man
You ain't done nothin' wrong but you
Ain't done nothin' right

The right thing to do is to turn yourself around
Point those headlights home
?Cause you know it's wrong to carry on
With a woman who ain't your own
Right now you're steppin' a razor thin line
That ain't quite black or white
Ain't done nothin' wrong
Ain't done nothin' right

Tosses back her hair, looks in your eyes (soul)
And says, ?I like your smile?
If danger were a winding road
Son, you just walked a mile
Then a trouble appears and he's got you in his sight
He grabs temptation by the arm, says, ?girl it's time to go?
You feel the heat from the fire in his eyes

I was sittin' in the glow of the dashboard lights
I'll never forget I was six years old
When I heard comin' out of my daddys radio
Came out of my seat and said, ""Son of a gun""
And daddy said, ""Now that's the Opry son""

I heard the crowd start screamin'
And I started dreamin'
Of one day runnin'
With a Hillbilly band

Bought a guitar, learned a few chords
Found a few guys and a beat up Ford
Pretty girls would come from miles around
Like bees to honey to hear that sound
All we could afford was bread and mayonnaise
Living for the moment when we'd hit that stage

I heard the crowd start screamin'
Man you ain't livin'
Till you go runnin'
With a Hillbilly band

I came to Nashville, they liked my songs
I got a bus forty-five feet long
Bought a house to put a gold record on the wall
The funny thing is I'm hardly there at all
The money, the cars, you can have that stuff
Just give me what I love

To hear the crowd start screamin'
To the song I'm singin'
The one about runnin'
With a Hillbilly band

Woo it's a Hillbilly band
You all it's a Hillbilly band

Wait too long there?re out of season, They?ll be gone to someone else.

She ask me Boy where do you come from? Are you only passing through?
I?d like to know what brings you down here, I made her smile when I said YOU.

A stolen moment too quickly faded, as she pulled away her hand.
She said I?m sorry it?s been taken, promised to another man.

Takes me back to my favorite memory, Of the Georgia girl I left behind.

Hearing your voice on my machine

And not pick up where we left off

Too many tears washed out that bridge you wanna cross
But baby, it's too late for that

But the morning sun must've done something for me '

Through the heart and soul of me
But I sip my coffee and watch the morning sun rise
Makin' its way to a bluer sky

Last night would've been a different story
But the morning sun must've done something for me
'Cause I bet I'd gone the other way
If you'd called yesterday

Last night would've been a different story
But the morning sun must've done something for me
I bet I'd gone the other way if you'd called yesterday
If you'd called yesterday, if you'd called yesterday

I'll admit it got to me hearing your voice on my machine

",If You Had Called Yesterday,2008
Andy Griggs,"Sittin' in the seat of my old Olds
Pretty city lights down far below
Sittin' there soakin' up all of the heat of the fire
You slide a little closer and whisper in my ear
Never even get around to openin' those beers
Bein' here with you girl, nothing could get me no higher

(Chorus:)
It's a long way down
Baby, hold on to me
Never let me touch the ground
It's a long way down
Scared I'm gonna fall without your lovin' arms around

Well, love for you is such a natural thing
You were born to spread those angel wings
Every time you touch me, swear I feel light as a feather
But it seems like every other corner I turn
There's another busted heart that's crashed and burned
Baby, just remember every time you take me to heaven

(Chorus)

So, tell me once again how high we're gonna go
Take me far away from the world below
We could be the few that make it all the way together
Cause I could start this car and drive back into town
Land us both safe on solid ground
But after tonight, girl, you're gonna have to love me forever

Cause it's a long way down
Baby, hold on to me
Never let me touch the ground
Yeah it's a long, long way down
Scared I'm gonna fall without your lovin' arms around
Yeah yeah yeah...

Yeah yeah, take me higher
Take me higher
Take me higher, yeah...",Long Way Down,2008
Andy Griggs,"She said, I had friend
And she was gigglin', my name is Caroline
But those who know me best call me
Tattoo Rose

And that got me wonderin'
Which pretty end she had it inked in
Forbidden, well hidden
Underneath her clothes

And I asked, where is your little secret?
She said, you know I keep it

Just a little south of my Mason-Dixon tan line
This yellow rose of Texas, that's right
Has never seen the sunshine

Since that spring break down in Key West
Oh, what a beautiful canvas
For a little tattoo rose

The way she moved it
And grooved it to the music
Was soakin' up my mind
And getting me high

And I said, I gotta know
Just how low it really goes
Hey baby, just maybe
You could show me sometime

She said, don't think so, honey
Boy, you should get so lucky

Just a little south of my Mason-Dixon tan line
This yellow rose of Texas, that's right

Andy Griggs,"Nothing I can do is gonna change
The fact you're gone away, now
God knows I've tried
And nothing I can do can stop the rain
From falling on my face, now, every night

I'm stuck here in the past
I can't move on, I can't go back
It's just not fair
I wake up in a sweat, all soaking wet
I reach out, but you're not there

So I cry
And watch the days roll by
I miss the way you love me
And I die down deep inside
But I will survive,
Just give me tears and time

Tears can wash away the emptiness
Take it like a river to the sea
Time can wrap its arms around the pain
'Til it becomes a tender memory

I'm still here all alone
The world's so dark, since you've been gone
It's just not fair
I call out your name
But there's just silence, always the same
Unanswered prayer

So I cry
And watch the days roll by
I miss the way you love me
And I die down deep inside
But I will survive
Just give me tears and time

Yeah, God, I cry
And watch the days roll by
But I will survive
Just give me tears and time

Washed my hands of all the pieces
I poured another glass and I asked myself again
What did I do to deserve this?

I started pacing back and forth
Conjured up a hundred reasons
But here I am again, running from the truth
'Cause I can't start believing

What if it's me causing this heartache
Blaming everybody else for the bad breaks
Me, fooling myself, calling it the hand I'm dealt
I'm sure that it's her, but what if it's me

What if it's me, my own worst enemy
Not giving her enough attention
Ignoring all the little things
Now I lie here all alone
Getting lost in her prediction

Blaming everybody else for the bad breaks
Me, fooling myself, calling it the hand I'm dealt
I'm sure that it's her, but what if it's me

Me, the one who needs to change
Me, who needs to take the blame
For doing this to us

Blaming everybody else for the bad breaks

It may come as some surprise 
But I can stay secret from prying eyes 
So don't worry, I'll keep it confidential

Show me you dare 
We may not venture out in public 
At least I know, you care

And give your lungs some exercise

Then get your brush
And we'll paint the town
A lighter shade of gray and brown
And it won't mean a thing

And in round two we'll fight like Ali
And by the end of the second round
We'll be singing, you and whose army
Are gonna stop us now

I didn't feel it yesterday
Tomorrow, I just couldn't say

And normal service is resumed

But they caught him and they brought him back
And they laid him down on the jailhouse ground
With an iron chain around his neck.

Old Reilly's daughter got a message
That her father was goin' to hang.
She rode by night and came by morning
With gold and silver in her hand.

When the judge he saw Reilly's daughter
His old eyes deepened in his head,
Sayin', ""Gold will never free your father,
The price, my dear, is you instead.""

""Oh I'm as good as dead,"" cried Reilly,
""It's only you that he does crave
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all.
Get on your horse and ride away.""

""Oh father you will surely die
If I don't take the chance to try
And pay the price and not take your advice.
For that reason I will have to stay.""

The gallows shadows shook the evening,
In the night a hound dog bayed,
In the night the grounds were groanin',
In the night the price was paid.

The next mornin' she had awoken
To know that the judge had never spoken.
She saw that hangin' branch a-bendin',
She saw her father's body broken.

These be seven curses on a judge so cruel:
That one doctor will not save him,
That two healers will not heal him,
That three eyes will not see him.

That five walls will not hide him,
That six diggers will not bury him

A running child in fields of clover
I was living in the grandeur
Of my father's land
mmm...

By the side of the swirling sea
I spent the days of childish wonder
And the rocks I held in my young hands
I never felt them slip away

Well the sun shone bright upon the waves
And the wind blew high as I was leaving
And I sailed so far away
Looking for adventure
mmm...

But I would not stay where the city streets
proclaimed so loudly man's endeavours
Though music is a pretty thing
in fine company
And the wilderness took my breath away
I felt I had to find my way
Where no-one ever goes
mmm...

It was in the south that my new home lay
With a dark eyed boy and wild horses
With humming birds and roses there 
in old Mexico

There the winds of change they blew so far
Of liberty and revolution
And it seemed that each man heard in his breast

You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here

Andy Kirk,"Clouds are only dewdrops that once kissed a rose
Clouds are feathers from a lady's fan
Do you remember how we watched them drifting by
Long ago when love began
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly 
A love that could never be mine
 
Once we were together and now we're apart
Did you find it easy to forget?
I keep on dreaming while the years go drifting by
Calling you my ""Sweet Regret""
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go

But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""

You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you

And all the things I've done
I've done to make her feel at home again

Oh . . . it's all part of an act
She can stay as long as I keep the pact

There's someone ringing at My front door bell
I see My Mother there
Standing with the man I wanna send to hell

Mother: ""Oh King, see who came along""

Ma, You don't understand
It's all part of the deal
There's no way I can let him inside
You see ""AMON"" belongs to ""THEM""

Doctor: ""You go ahead and have a talk with the boy My dear""
You better bring this along
Something might go wrong inside""

Come on Mother let me show You the house
Come on Mother there's a lot to discuss

Mother: ""Oh King, please let him in""

Ma, You don't understand
It's all part of the deal
Ther's no way I can let him inside
You see ""AMON"" belongs to ""THEM""

Now let Me tell You what I've seen in the house lately
I've seen Your daughter here
Coming and going when the dark is near

You must never ever tell anyone what I've told

And I'm falling, Yes I'm falling down . . .

Andy LaRocque,"I stumbled out of Grandma's room,
Down the stairs and out of the house
Once outside I felt My mind begin to
Fight a battle for control

With the tea pot broken I kind of
Realized
That ""THEIR"" power was less here,
Here on the outside

I fell to my knees in haziness
And I looked in through the window
To the cellar

Things were moving down there,
""THEY"" were searching for something
And ""THEY"" really found it,
The big axe was flying

Flying out through the cellar door
Up the stairs to the kitchen...
Then I passed out

The next thing I remember seeing was
The smoke coming from the chimney
I soon realized the smoke I saw was
Actually... Oh No!
All there was left of Missy and her
Dress, poor little girl

The spell was broken, I really felt the
Change
As my mind and body became one
Again

The moon was alive with its silvery
Eye
Staring right into My evil heart

I went back to see if My Grandma'
Was still there
Waiting for me in the attic

That bloody tea, which sent us into ecstasy
Yesterday Mother complained, feeling dizzy, all in pain

Mother's getting weaker, looking paler day by day

As morning came, she could not make it out of bed
And Grandma's spell was getting straight into her head
Not a single word, she didn't seem to be alive

Getting weaker, looking paler day by day

Then Missy came in and she led me by the hand
I didn't want to go, Oh but I should have known
Mother was barely conscious, why should I care
Just looking forward to the next ordeal

I think I heard My sister begging me to stay
She gave me the phone, so I could call someone for help
I simply let go of her hand, then I cut the wire

And as the clock strikes midnight
Only they can let us meet
Even though she's dead now

They left me lying on the floor
Heading for local church, no a trace of guilt in their eyes

And so easy to convert

Conspiracy, I'm being victimized again

Knocking at the preacher's door
none of them were ever here before
Sammael, GOD in his eyes, leads them into the silent room

""Priest, do You remember King, the loony one
the one who killed his Grandma' up on the hill?""
""Yes I do""

Conspiracy

""Now he's back, the loony one""

Talking to the preacher for a while
the Doctor turned him into a child
Sammael, GOD in his eyes, swallowed everything the Doctor said
Oh in the gloom of the night

""From what You tell Me we cannot save him
It could be Satan himselfg or some evil demon
Let us not waste any time, the demon might twist our minds
We must go and do what must be done""

So they left the church, conspiracy of the cursed

It's all but a dream

My bed is moving, I cannot see a thing
I am in total darkness, someone is calling
I can feel the chill, it's all around Me
I know it's not a dream, No no no

Someone is in My room
Standing at the end of My bed
Must be a visit from the dead
Must be a visit from the dead

Now I see her figure, it's just a little child
And there's no reflection, she's in the mirror
Could it really be, has she returned?

All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high

And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

From some enchanted land.

Why can't I let you know,

Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light

About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

Andy M. Stewart,"Where are you tonight I wonder
And where will you be tonight when I cry?
Will sleep for you come easy,
Though I alone can't slumber
Will you welcome in the morning
At another man's side?

How easy for you the years slipped under
And left me a shadow the sun can't dispel
I built for you a tower of love and admiration
But I set you so high I could not reach myself.

I look through my window at a world filled with strangers
The face in my mirror is the one face I know
You have taken all that's in me, so my heart is in no danger
My heart is in no danger, but I'd still like to know

If there is a silence then it can be broken
If there beats a pure heart to her I will go
And time will work its healing and the spirit will grow stronger
Ah, but in the meantime I'd still like to know.

I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.

all that's left is an unhappy ending.

I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.

When all god's children on this earth inherit all our plans.
These are the lies they tell us. the future's good as sold.
In all the things we do and know, we really must be told.

Andy McCluskey,"It worries me this kind of thing
How you hope to live alone
And occupy your waking hours
We're taking sides again
I just wept I couldn't understand
Why you started this again
Every day you send me more
What makes it worse is this plan of yours
To ensure I don't forget
I'd write and tell you that I've burnt them all
But you never send me your address
And I've kept them anyway
So don't ask me if I think it's true
That communication can bring hope to those
Who have gone their separate ways
It hardly touched me when it should have then
And memories are uncertain friends
When recalled by messages
Coded messages always hurt

Lives fast out in the suburbs
Goes out and gets high
In search of the divine
Higher than the sky
Blinded by reflections
In a world full of mirrors
Seeing trails of history
In the shadows of the mainstream
This is how it all begins
This is where she should check in
Get higher than the sky
Want to embrace it all
Ya this is how she struts her stuff
She's doing it with lasers
She's dancing on the stars
She's doing it with lasers
Blowing our city apart
This morning she woke up
About day glow noon
Last night she passed out
To a blood red moon

But how can they know about love that's true
They've never been in love with you
The clocks a ticking on the wall

I fear you won't come at all
But I stay waiting by your door
I just want more and more and more
The only thing I ever want to do
Is to get strung out over you
No there is nothing in the world
I'd rather do than stay strung out over you

My heart's a blaze I'm in a mist
I've never been in love like this
Your presence liquid like the sea
Embracing me eternally
So please take some time to face the truth

I am so strung out over you

You'll always see me running back

Deep inside of your heart
Keeps me strung out over you

Holy is the lamb (Holy is the Lamb)
Now we holding you to man up 'cause we were made
In his image start looking at what you came from.

Right after Adam every atom in our anatomy had to make
Adamant after what Adonai is against
Let me take you back to the tree and Eden,
If you read it you'd see that Eve was deceived,
But Adam's the one who let her eat it (Man up)

100 percent masculinity

None of them are on the scene, seems like they died off.

We chasing the prize of the King, the divine boss,
But we fell away, now we ungodly
We lose and we really got the blues like Navi,
I want to celebrate the dudes that's beside me.
Fellas let's elevate, we through with the lies man.

They lie, go ahead say boy get your shine on
If a sucker try to block you get your 9 on
And what I heard you gotta do to be a man now,
Stand up for yourself so I took it in my hands now.
And that's the problem man we busy trying to solve it
All the while we walking dead man somebody bring the coffin, boy drop
Peach fuzz now you think that your a man 'cause you feeling yourself
You need to man up!

Sex and models and tippin' bottles
Pack a pile of excuses right next to your bottle caps 
A Rolodex filled with names that you aim to please
Next to the stack of money buildin' up a heart of greed
Ice on his neck, givin' jokers the cold shoulder 
You drunk off pride plus you loving the hangover
You gotta whole lotta stuff that won't amount to gain 
Life will never make sense because you never made change

Lil' man live to stack dough, Keebler
Man up, get up out of that treehouse
Leave them cookies alone, it's time to eat meat now
Tryna show you a new way to live now
No charge, you can call it a freestyle 
Without Christ you won't know what a man is
You a boy in a man's body like Tom Hanks in Big

Being a man got nothin' to do with age
You can be a boy 'til the day you lay in your grave
None of us behave like the image of who we're made 
'Cause we fallen the ways it's better known as depraved 
Running from responsibility really we crave
The easy way out of places that call us to pull our weight
Man they blowing through every day decisions are made
Responding to the call God's giving 'em from the gate

Man up!
Let the process begin, separate the boys from the men

Humbled to the point of death
You would cry for us

No rest, you would ride for us
Took blows, you gave flesh
You were my donor

But you pitied me
Showered me with much grace
I read the good news printed on the front page
The headline read ""Christ for my lust paid,
For my sin died, now He was just raised""
And the way I knew the grace from you was real sweet
Is that you came and died while I was still weak
What compassion you showed
Displayed your great love with actions
Yeah, the facts in the scroll
Now I'm like a dirty burlap sack full of gold
You put treasure in the clay pot
I'm amped to behold

The key to life: money, power, respect
Louie this, Gucci that, two private jets
Big money, big business, watch that paper stack
Treat life like a game, it ain't pool but I'm racked
Up, big bucks, no whammys
I swear I prolly lump somebody head for a Grammy
My heart black as the Lambo Kim bought for Kanye
And I ain't fronting, I'm just telling ya'll what God say
Blood thirsty
Seek my own will since the day that Adam cursed me
The lust for power go to ya' brain if you let it
You say, ""What up dog?"" I hear ""god."" I'm so dyslectic
Sit on the throne, it's really a toilet, heart is septic
I have no power, I get handed death, I must accept it
It's hard to see the light when you never listen
Our whole life's blacked out, the power's tripping

Double-XL got me wanton to excel
They tellin' me it ain't hard to tell, I rock well
And now with every sale I'm feelin' my head swell
Well, I'm a genius in my dreams
Even if I was, it was stitched inside my genes
I'm self-inflated, self-infatuated
And somehow I convinced myself I finally made it
The truth is I was made like the mob
Geppetto put me together; my strings lead to God
Pride come befo' the fall, I seen it in the script
So if you see me fallin', prolly a power trip

Welcome to the culture where humility is not allowed
They do it big, if you don't see that, you Shallow Hal
Tryna show them how love and power, it goes together
If they call us losers, that just means we last forever
I been connected to the power, I don't have to chase it
I roll with the Trinity, this is sorta the Matrix
A hard pill to swallow: we're evil to the core
Wicked power exploits the poor, and it brings war
Power can be a field of dreams loaded with land mines
We know the ruler so you can't say these are bad lines

I know the Lord gon' catch me when I'm power trippin'

Who made the sky with they hands? What if y'all can't see?
This is kinda strange, God makes the weather change
And we braggin' up on our change like ""look how we make it rain!""
We Invictus, this sin sickness is in us
Running a muck and causing that mischief, tell me this then, ""Who could really fix us?""

Andy Mineo,"You think bein' meek is weak, huh?
You try bein' meek for a week. Ain't that right, ya?

I go by K to the second letter
But my name is a second matter
Give me a second: I'll bring you from Cain to the second Adam
For a slave boy I'm up and at 'em
For the pain boy I'm up to bat
Patient for the win 
'Cause we win-slow with these family matters
I'm so convinced
That you won't find no bolder men
Than those of them
That's going in
For holiness
God goes with them
What you know about going harder?
Walk with me through these martyrs
And fathers that barely father
For the Father boy don't get me started
Let me try to break it down
I thought I'd be doing it if I moved a couple pounds
Made a hundred-thou(sand) with the women in the house
But that ain't doing nothing but f-f-following the crowd
If everybody is doing what everybody is doing
You're cool with doing the opposite of everybody is doing
You're going hard for Yeshua
You're going hard in the truest
I promise

I'm goin' off
Goin' harder than I've ever been, I put that on everything
I'm goin' off
Goin' harder than I've ever been, I put that on everything
I'm goin' off (for the glory)

I go off off off off off off off
I go off off off off off off off

I was a hot head
Bad attitude
Woulda coulda shoulda been shot dead
Always running my mouth
I'd rather die than be soft man
I've been slammed on my back just to prove that I'm not scared
(turn the other cheek)
Stop playing
Till I met Jesus and really seen just what He's about
He endured the cross
To kill 'em all
Woulda been the easy route
When I first got saved had a dude come up to me
Talking tough to me
Wanted to duck and swing but I walked away that was the tougher thing.
See a Godly man acts different when he's been wronged
He's knows how to overlook offense (a fence) like a peeping tom
It's easy to smoke your problems away with that Cheech and Chong
It's hard to take 'em head on
He mans up before the Lord
What about the brother that discovered that his lover was under the covers with another man (that's hard)
With everything inside of him he wanna go and bother him but he giving 'em grace instead (that's hard)
What about them brothers who are wanted by multiple women but they married and they know they got to be there for their children so they wanna be living their faith and they giving their wife everything

I'm goin' off

I go off off off off off off off
I go off off off off off off off

I go off: hard for this
No holds barred the Lord is in
No arguments
Keepin' my cool
Faith on fire, no arsonist
It's hard to miss
One one six, yeah
Una-shamed
Rep His Name
Even when they disregarding this
Our culture don't go hard for this
I know it's tough
When your eyes and your mind seek lust
And your pride is a must
And your lies rise up
To disguise what's what
And you feelin' like quitting 'cause what you tried ain't enough
That's when you take heart
God got it
still God
Harder
Harder I go for the Lord
Go hard till the day I depart
I, go harder for the Father even if it means I'm martyred or slaughtered or fall
It doesn't matter He bought us
He chose to call us
Somebody planted and watered and these seeds
Increase when He's been through like trees
Breathe ah breathe
Breath in my body
Of the King I'm a product
Chance is slim, but I deem I'm sought out
But He caught us
All us
Guaranteed he got us
So I'm living this thang
Giving the reigns
Even when I know that temptation is tryna slip in this thang
It's so much easier man
To give into sinning like many of the men and women I know who caught up in chains
Steady living in vain
And they sit with no shame
And they slack in the prison
Until they meet up with saints
Who be bringing them change
Yep all in His name
Until they unashamed

Catch me underground on a train ridin' slow

All my wickedest flows
Being from New York
Or wicked at its pros
And these con Edison bills high like they smoking

Andy Mineo,"You know there's one single to root right? Hebrews 12:15 check it out
You know there's a few things in my life that cause me to be bitter and, I'm just asking God, I'm like

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, so take it all away

Anybody know the feeling of rejection?
Feels like you was kicked in your midsection,
When you feel like you simply just lost your best friend,
Everybody play the game of love you [?],
You start thinking she's chillin' with other men, and you gettin' jealous, start beefing, and harboring harsh resentment,
I'm asking Jesus to keep me from being bitter, go skeeming on twitter, get mad and post it on my statuses,
Bitterness can make a heart numb,
But hope is like a star you don't see it shine bright until the dark come,
So don't just scoop the dust, remove the rug,
If I got unforgiveness in my heart, then there really ain't no room for love,
Plus it's stupid cause, I've been so forgiven,
That if I hold a grudge, I don't show He's risen,
But I know my sins removed since Jesus came,
With no reason to forgive me but He did so I do the same

Ugh

Sometimes things just happen in life that don't make any sense, but, bitterness is a choice

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, so take it all away

Yeah, I gotta tread softly,
Don't wanna be a hypocrite plus I got some bitterness I wanna get up off me,
Where should I start, well I feel like I'd be sorta frontin',
To say that when my father calls that I don't hit ignore button,
It's probably cause we never kicked it at a younger age,
I know when he's calling but I don't have got his number saved,
I keep dodging him but I'm just being honest,
All he wanna do is talk football and how I should play in college,
I get bitter, kinda cold like the winter,
It's so hard for me to forgive him then I remember that I'm a sinner,
And Jesus forgave me and washed away my sins,
When I didn't deserve it then I could forgive him,
His power in such amazing love like when Jesus forgave the ones that pinned him up on that cross as he was hanging from it,
Holy Spirit, teach me to be just like the Son,
Remove the roots of bitterness don't stop until your work is done

God I don't wanna be bitter, teach me to forgive, let me see my own sin

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, so take it all away

Bitter, bitter, bitter

I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter
I don't wanna be bitter, so take it all away",Bitter,2013
Andy Mineo,"[Chorus]
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
And the colors seem
A burning tree speaking to me,
I'm caught dreaming.

Why waste my breath singing words of praise
That are filled with myself? Who's greater?
What love do I have that you didn't give
'Cause all that I am is a product of grace.
And what should I trust, your love for me
Or my love for you? Who's greater?

[Chorus]
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
And the colors seem
A burning tree speaking to me,
I'm caught dreaming,
Someone greater than me
Bringing liberty
The burning tree is saving me,
I'm caught dreaming.

Yeah, mouth full of praise, I love you so much
What an empty phrase, really I'm more amazed
How in spite of how I fail to do what you command to
Serve other gods like Baal, you never bail,
That's illogical devotion, could it really be
You chose to die for the sinner when nothing was good in me.
You never left me, even when the darkest days began
Nor forget me, only thing you're forgetting is my sin.
I wanna make it to the end, let me remain faithful,
All because you're faithful in me, yeah, I'm grateful.
My mistakes can never stop me, choice you make to adopt me,
The holes in your hands are the proof that you'll never drop me.

[Chorus]
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
And the colors seem
A burning tree speaking to me,
I'm caught dreaming,
Someone greater than me
Bringing liberty
The burning tree is saving me,
I'm caught dreaming.

I could sing how I love you, love you,
But your love for me is much greater.
And I could sing how I love you, love you,
But your love for me is much greater.

[Chorus]
I'm caught dreaming
Someone greater than me
And the colors seem
A burning tree speaking to me,
I'm caught dreaming,
Someone greater than me
Bringing liberty
The burning tree is saving me,
I'm caught dreaming.",Caught Dreaming,2013
Andy Mineo,"Is it corny if I admit
That i check up on you from time to time when I'm on the net
I promise I ain't no stalker it's so awkward
When i actually come across you I act like I ain't bothered a bit
And you know what that is and I know too
That's pride mixed with lies mixed with I want you's
Kinda maybe sorta or the order could be off
Often I wonder if I regret what I lost
At a later time could my state of mind make me blind
I pray it isn't if it was I wouldn't admit it
I thought that I was heading in the right direction
But maybe loneliness has got me second guessing
I got some fly women they follow me on twitter
I think I'll DM'em alright I'm trippin'
But I'm hard wired for intimecy
So why does my loneliness lead to compromise

Is it weird it's been a few years
We celebrated the ball droppin' together (cheers)
The stuff you used to wear different products in your hair
When I smell'em in the air I feel like you're somewhere near
Is it me is it you was it lie was it truth
Maybe it's just nobody's ever good enough for you
Ok I swear I'm going through asked my homie what to do
He said boy listen here cause I'm finna tell the truth
Everybody think about they ex's
Even if you got kids man we two your best friend
In them memories are easily made but hard to forget
Cause they ex'ed up in your heart the good times and regrets
It's curiosity get you in trouble
Specially if it's forbidden kind that you run to
Ah man yeah you're more sensitive then you'll ever admit
So be careful who you make memories with
The secret is to learn what it means to be content
And celebrate what God's given not the things He didn't
Our heart is always longing for more and it wanna bug out
That's why we gotta drink from that water that never run out
But sometimes
I'm still curious",Curious,2013
Andy Mineo,"It was just last week that my grandma died
It's been years since I've seen family on my fathers side
A bitter sweet, moment but tell me why
Nothing less then the sting of death brought us together
I sat and listened to the priest tell lies
To appease loved ones in their seats
When you looking at a face that's weaping
The grim truth wont bring'em no peace
So I put on, all white gloves like Mr. Jackson
Carried the casket to the Cadillac then
I realised this is the first time that me and my brothers ever did something together
Whatever, I'm grown now come on let's just put on the smiles
And take pictures, take pictures
Uh
Eat this humble pie then leave them dishes
For somebody else to clean 'em until I see ya'll again

(Breakin' down, breakin' down)
Everything here is breaking down
(Br-br-Breakin' down, breakin' down)
It's all breaking down down down
(Breakin' down, breakin' down)
Everything here is breaking down
(Breakin' down, breakin' down)
But this wont be forever no

You used to make me cry
But one day He'll wipe every tear from our eyes
He'll come make all things right
And we'll sing death has died

But until that day

Oh, until that day
Oh, oh, oh
This won't be forever
Until that day
Oh, until that day
Oh, oh, oh,

I hopped off the plane
My God, what a scene that I seen on that TV screen
People huddled round, hands on they mouth
Not again, same problem, it hit a new town
26 dead, 20 of 'em kids
Where do you begin when some lives just ended?
And everybody got the question:
If God's so good how He let this happen?
Is it mental health? Is it gun control?
Is it we make superstars out of animals?
Is it the movies we make? The video games?
I dunno, but God I want an antidote
All I know is this world is broken
Our sin is the reason it ain't like it's supposed to
Words fall short tryna comfort the grieving
But you gotta know that there's hope to believe in
One day my God gon' crack the sky
He gon' bottle up every tear that we ever cried
Bring truth to every lie, justice for ever crime
All our shame will be gone and we'll never have to hide
No more broken hearts, no more broken homes
No more lockin' doors, no more cops patrollin'
No abusive words, or abusive touches
No more cancerous cells that'll take our loved ones
No more hungry kids, no more natual disaster
No child will ever have to ask where his dad is
No funerals where we wear all black
And death will be dead and we'll lock the casket
Yes!

You used to make me cry (you used to make me cry)
But one day He'll wipe every tear from our eyes (every tear from our eyes)
He'll come make all things right (all things right)

Andy Mineo,"Come you sinners poor and needy,
Weak and wounded, sick and sore,
Jesus ready stands to save you,
Grace requires nothing more,
I will arise and go to Jesus,
He will embrace me in His arms,
In the arms of my dear Savior,
There are ten thousands charms,

Why is it every time I step up on a train, 
I see a pretty dame and I wonder what her name is,
For' I even get there the question on my brain is,
Do you love the Lord do you live to make Him famous?
Then the cart stop, she step off, it's time to refocus,
I'm questioning my heart, examining my motives,
Why I'm captivated by the brown skin mocha divas,
And I hope in my mind she's a believer,
Ok, she got all that beauty yea it's obvious, 
I can't let it take precedence over Godliness,
Now I'm getting restless, 
How I'm recognizing when I'm choosing to take pleasure in all these false treasures,
They fools gold,
Instead of looking for them sundresses,
I should be looking for the Son I confess it,
Even though my prides telling me don't let the fans know,
I am not a superhuman though,
I am a man,
So the grace that I talk about on all my records,
I need it for myself, cause really I'm just a mess,
Finding rest from the pressures of perfection,
As I stand up on this platform they expectin,
Me to be a man without flaws, that's false,
I am just another rapper that's called to point ya'll to the cross,
And that's exactly where I'm headed,
I'm just another beggar pointin ya'll to where the bread is,
Maaan..

I'm not a superhuman
I am just a man,
No, I'm not a superhuman,
I am just a man,
I'm not a superhuman,
I am just a man, but they never understand,

I'm nothing more than a man lost, dead in my sin,
So here I am alive in Your hands, 
Your hands, Your hands

We dress up in nice heels, we try to make people buy'em,
That's why when someone ask how we doin, we tell'em fine,
Knowing we hurt inside, but tell me who's really lyin,
They ain't really wanna know how you doin, that cost time,
That's way too expensive,
And if I ever get a date with a dime I'm sending my representative,
The version of Andy that's cropped and edited,
I'm killin this first impression, and I'm hidin the evidence,
Yea, photoshoppin the blemishes,
These lies of perfection are the cry of the desperate,
Men that want that acceptance,
Holdin they breath, dyin a thousand deaths,
Forgettin there's beauty inside the mess,
What else could you expect? we obsessed over twitter numbers,
Checkin ours, then comparing them to others, like,
The number of likes upon a status is somehow suppose to raise our status,
Boy, this is madness,
We want the trophy wife who's the baddest and not some average,
So we can feel like the man, Randy Savage,
Take me off the shelf, I don't wanna be for retail,
I would rather be real, let you see the details,
When we fell, it feels like we fall so far cause they put us so high,
I am not a star,
I'm just a product of grace that's still in the process,
And I don't gotta be great, because my God is,

And I don't gotta be great, because my God is,
I'm just a product of grace and guess what?
I'm still in the process, there's unfinished business

Would you love me if I told you I couldn't fly?
I got no cape on and no mask on there's no disguise,
Oh I'm no hero
There's only one,
Oh I'm no hero,
There's only one, 
And He's not for sale,

I'm not a superhuman
I am just a man,
No, I'm not a superhuman,
I am just a man,

But somehow they got a deal.
Weird
I'm riding around in this airport
Flying around on my skateboard
And my glasses on like a straight dork
Oh your money talk but he's yay short
I love the haters so I pray for em
See them hearts we aim for em
So I tell the world that we stay touring
And we do it our way, we won't change for em
This ain't no fast food (Nope, nope)
You can't order us
They looking so confused (Heh)
What's the formula?
We just really want more of God
Na we don't really want more of us
'Cause He did it we giving Him thanks
Even when they ain't awarding us
And them strip clubs money drugs
C'mon 'cause you boring us
We heard it all before
And I'm still unimpressed with that sort of stuff
We were made for more though
With them award shows and you thank Christ
That lip service don't mean nothing
If you ain't about that life

Y-O-U
Owe me nothing
No nothing

Owe me nothing

I know you will
Even when they say you won't
I know you will

I know you will
I know you will
Even when they say you can't

No there's nothing you can't do
Nothing in this world too big for you

So when they say you can't

You know the rich and famous, kill theyself to stay rich and famous
Very same thing they they built they name with
Be the same thing they they be enslaved with
So, I don't want rap you can have that
I don't want the crown yo I'm aiming past that

And I'm his son I sing ? and

Some people run their mouth, some people run their house

You couldn't even tell me what's wrong
Still think about it though it's been so long
Thought we'd be down forever, now you're gone

I remember, I remember
It wasn't many days that we didn't chill together
We was hangin' in my dorm room, we would write them rhymes
Then record 'em in my closet cause we was next to shine
Even had our own handshake, fall into that hug
And we was different colors, but we swore that we were blood
And, uh, all of a sudden you deaded everyone
I had to find out through the internet you had a son
And when I text you won't hit me
This music took me all around the world, you were s'posed to go with me
But, uh, the thug changes and love changes
And them best friends become strangers
I knew what Nas said was true
I just never thought it be about you
But, um, people come, people go
And when they leave it's like they took a piece of your soul
It's sorta like a ghost

I didn't know you could float
I didn't know you could disappear
I guess you were a ghost

We used to be so close

I pray I don't get used to this feelin'
The closer you are, deeper the cuts, longer the healin'

I do this for protection
When I feel rejected I just dead 'em first, man
Somebody bring the hearse in
My worst fear in life is that my wife would have the urge to leave
Like everybody else start desertin' me
I know we made vows, but I cannot believe when I see divorce rates
You know why I got doubts
Fear takin' control
Seein' it, now I know
To truly love a person, the bravest act of the soul
I could either get my heart again, put it in the open
Or lock it in a box where it never be broken
But there it grows cold, lifeless and old
Nobody could come close but it's safe
Protected from the ghost

I didn't know you could float
I didn't know you could disappear

Andy Mineo,"The older I get, the more I realize
Almost everything I believed in my life was a lie
It started as a child, first was Santa Claus
Then I believed that a brawl would never come between my dawgs, wrong
My sister Mary filled me in when I was seven
Told me Hulk Hogan only existed on television (what?)
The Stone Cold Stunner and the Leg Drop, all scripted?
N.W.O. and X-Pac?
Dang
I used to walk up to them automatic doors
My momma told me that my finger was the power source
So I pointed with my pointer, then, pow! It was open, then come to find out she was jokin'
Had to let it soak in, my mind as a boy didn't wanna believe that McGwire or Barry were on the 'roids
But, uh, when I was young, I thought the world was alright
It's funny, I even thought that Jesus was white, but yo

All that glitters ain't made of gold
It's the thing you've heard a million times before
It took a little time, now I realize
Now I know better, it's better late than never
Now I know

Over the years, you get more accustomed to pain
Used to believe my dad when he said he'd come to my games
Even believed my mother was a saint and could do no wrong
And then she sat me down and told me how I was born (shoot)
Mind blown, but now it all makes sense
Why she didn't spazz on me when she caught me havin' sex
I was perplexed but now I get it
I used to think America was finished with racism, how could I miss it?
I'm mad so many people don't get it
Holdin' this list of black names, but now I'm blacklisted?
Got older, it's like it got no different
I found out that these independent artists isn't independent
Cause major labels fund them quietly to keep perception
That's deception in the game, used to believe I wanted fame
Plus my name written in them lights, now I know it's so much greater cause it's written in the hand of Christ
Then, I, I used to say the radio would play what the people wanted
Now I know they playin' what's payin'
Feelin' jaded, but somehow I still believe in God
I even thought a college education got me a job, man

All that glitters ain't made of gold

Couldn't put me in a box, how I'm raisin' this brand
It's hard to stay focused with standin' in front of cameras
But they don't understand it, they don't see that from my vantage
All glory to the Most High all the praise be
Got them other rappers sweatin' like they need the AC
It ain't all 'bout who you know, Bleek knew Jay-Z
If it you ain't HOT 97, bad idea tryna play me
I know dudes with so much money that it ain't funny
Type of money make you laugh at jokes when it ain't funny
Type of money, go outside lookin' bummy
Still bag a supermodel, they don't care if he ugly
It's politics in this game, but ain't no politicians
And I ain't tryna be another one of fame's victims
Make a name for myself but never make a difference

And it just looked gloomy and dark like thunder and lightning
I didn't even think we was gonna take off
Anyways, we started to take off, the pilot was like, you know
""Brace yourself, there's gonna be some turbulence""
And we started going through the clouds and everything was shaking
I thought we was gonna die
But, when we got through the clouds, it looked like California
It was like sunny and bright and beautiful
It's like I almost had forgotten for a second that the sun like even existed
And, I had this moment where I was like
'Yo, the sun is still here'
Like, it was here the whole time, I just couldn't see it
And, I don't know, it just spoke to me, so
The thought I had was, why don't we take one of the elements
Take the arrow and have it going through a cloud
So, that half the arrow's above the cloud
Half the arrow's below the cloud

Voy de en fracaso en fracaso

Musica de Sebastian Piana
Letra de Homero Manzi

 I
Milonga pa' recordarte.
Milonga sentimental.
Otros se quejan llorando
yo canto pa' no llorar.
Tu amor se seco de golpe
nunca dijiste por que.
Yo me consuelo pensando
que fue traición de mujer.

 II
Varon, pa' quererte mucho,
varon, pa' desearte el bien,
varon, pa' olvidar agravios
porque ya te perdone.
Tal vez no lo sepas nunca,
tal vez no lo puedas creer,
tal vez te provoque risa
!verme tirao a tus pies!

 III
Es facil pegar un tajo
pa' cobrar una traición
o jugar en una daga
la suerte de una pasión.
Pero no es facil cortarse
los tientos de un metejon
cuando estan bien amarrados
al palo del corazón.

 II (bis)
Varon, pa' quererte mucho, etc.
Milonga que hizo tu ausencia.
Milonga de evocación.
Milonga para que nunca
la canten en tu balcon.
Pa' que vuelvas con la noche
why te vayas con el sol.
Pa' decirte que si, a veces,
o pa' gritarte que no.

Es la tristeza que me hace sonreír cada mañana
Es lo que llega desde el barrio al alma adentro
Lo que se filtra por el mismo corazón
Lo que en las venas se hacen locos sentimientos
Lo que me hace palpitante de emoción
Para mí todo eso es guaguancó
Para mí todo eso es guaguancó
 
Es más que la mulata que menea
La cintura como una revolución
Va mas allá del toque de un tambor
Y hasta el amor me parece un guaguancó

Porque en el alma se prendió como una luz
Es una fuerza penetrante de verdad

I took my own provision, 
But it fooled me and wasted away

Oh where are my companions?
My mother, father, lover, friend, and enemy
Where are my companions?
They're prisoners of death now, 
And taken far from me
And where are the dreams I dreamed 
In the days of my youth
They took me to illusion when they 
Promised me the truth
And what do sleepers need to make them listen,
Why do they need more proof?
This is a strange, this is a strange affair

Won't you give me an answer?
Why is your heart so hard 
Towards the one who loves you best?
When the man with the answer
Has wakened you, and warned you, 
And called you to the test
Wake up from your sleep that builds 
Like clouds upon your eyes
And win back the life you had 
That's now a dream of lies
Turn your back on yourself and if you follow,
You'll win the lover's prize
This is a strange, this is a strange affair",Strange Affair,1993

There's not a man alive that wouldn't want to hold her
And the way she moves, just the way she moves
Well, that's enough to keep me on a slow burn
Keep me on a slow burn

In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor
She's more woman than I could ever ask for
Still there's something in her eyes, in those dark eyes
That's love and that keeps me on a slow burn
Keeps me on a slow burn

When we touch this fire breaks out
And it rages out of control
And the love we made is so deep, so strong
And when it's over, even when it's over
And the flame dies down
It just dies down to a slow burn, slow burn

And the love we made is so deep, so strong
That when it's over, even when it's over

Hope you got the letter,

I dont mean a big reduction in the price of beer,

See them starving on their feet,

I cant believe in you.

Sorry to disturb you,
But I feel that I should be heard loud and clear.

See them fighting in the street,
cause they cant make opinions meet,
About god,
I cant believe in you.

Did you make disease, and the diamond blue? 
Did you make mankind after we made you? 
And the devil too!

Dear god,
Dont know if you noticed,
But your name is on a lot of quotes in this book.
Us crazy humans wrote it, you should take a look,
And all the people that you made in your image,
Still believing that junk is true.
Well I know it aint and so do you,
Dear god,
I cant believe in,
I dont believe in,

I wont believe in heaven and hell.
No saints, no sinners,
No devil as well.
No pearly gates, no thorny crown.
Youre always letting us humans down.
The wars you bring, the babes you drown.
Those lost at sea and never found,
And its the same the whole world round.
The hurt I see helps to compound,
That the father, son and holy ghost,
Is just somebodys unholy hoax,
And if youre up there youll perceive,
That my hearts here upon my sleeve.

But I saw you last night, you held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say ""Hello""
Aw you wished me well, you couldn't tell

That I'd been crying over you, crying over you
Then you said ""so long"". left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying, crying crying
It's hard to understand but the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

I thought that I was over you but it's true, so true
I love you even more than I did before but darling what can I do
For you don't love me and I'll always be

Tender nights before they fly
Send falling stars that seem to cry

It's over

It breaks your heart in two, to know she's been untrue
But oh what will you do? then she said to you
There's someone new we're through we're through
It's over it's over it's over

All the rainbows in the sky start to even say goodbye
You won't be seeing rainbows any more
Setting suns before they fall, echo to you that's all that's all

I found myself by your side
I started wanting you again
There's just no way to hide

From that old lovin' you feelin' again
It's really got me reeling again
It only seems to stop to start all over again with you

I remember how you always get that certain look in your eye
You're not easy to resist
But I just walked on by
'Cause that old lovin' you feeling again (lovin' you feelin)
It's really got me reeling again
Only seems to stop to start all over again with you
Lovin' you feelin', lovin' you feelin' with you

We were so close
We were too far apart
I gave you my love
I wanted your heart

Without yesterday haunting the way
Maybe we'd still be together
Sharing that lovin' you feelin' again
It's really got me reeling again (lovin' you)
Will it ever stop and not start over again 
That lovin' you feelin' again

No matter how much I've tried
This lovin' you feelin' inside
It's taken such a long, long, time
To say goodbye

Is so hard to do

The river too weary to flood
The storming wind cut through to my skin
But she cut through to my blood

I was looking for trouble to tangle my line
But trouble came looking for me
I knew I was standing on treacherous ground
I was sinking too fast to run free

With her scheming, idle ways
She left me poor enough
The storming wind cut through to my skin
But she cut through to my blood

I would not be asking, I would not be seen
A-beggin' on mountain or hill
But I'm ready and blind with my hands tied behind
I've neither a mind nor a will

With her scheming, idle ways
She left me poor enough
The storming wind cut through to my skin
But she cut through to my blood

It's bitter the need of the poor ditching boy
He'll always believe what they say
They tell him it's hard to be honest and true
Does he mind if he doesn't get paid?

Like my first time on the night we met
I wish I could go back there tonight, tonight
Looking in your eyes the way you held me tight
Where'd it all the wrong, when it felt so right
There's nowhere I'd rather be tonight, tonight
Tonight
Funny how you said people never change
Always be together 'til the very end
But that was then and this is now
Funny how I held onto your every word
Trusted and believed, no matter what I heard
But that was then and this is now
You and me were like a movie scene
Superstars playing in a teenage dream
There's no rewinding life tonight, tonight
Guess you could've broken someone else's heart
I'm the lucky winner because I played the part
Don't want to say goodbye tonight, tonight

Funny how you said people never change
Always be together 'til the very end
But that was then and this is now
Funny how I held onto your every word
Trusted and believed no matter what I heard
But that was then and this is now
You said ""I'll be your first, my love""
There'll never ever be another one 
Don't worry I'll tell no one
You and me together'll be so much fun
You said ""I'll be your first, my love""
There'll never ever be another one 
Don't worry I'll tell no one
You and me together'll be so much fun
Sometimes you gotta let things be
Even when the truth is that you lied to me
I want to keep these thoughts away, from me
From me
It's the little things that I dream about
That no one ever talks about
The little things I think about
That no one ever dreams about
The kisses that were promises
That were suppose to be planned

Always be together 'til the very end

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

When some silly girl had set you free

I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
Cause I'm still in love with you

They see me night and daytime
Having such a gay time
They don't know what I go through
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
Cause I'm still in love with you

No one knows it's just a pose
Pretending I'm glad we're apart
And when I cry, my eyes are dry
The tears are in my heart

My darling, can't we make up?
Ever since our breakup
Make believe is all I do
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
Cause I'm still in love

Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much and just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words

Andy Scherrer,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000
Andy Schnitzer,"This is something that I call the flow
Not many if any, 'cept for Vinnie, can say they know
In fact, detracting that is something that I rarely show
Because my tongue is actually fast but then again it's slow
See yo (Throw it bro) you say cheeka-boo
A name pertained for niggas who WHO
Who hear that name and place a trigger to the figure who
It blew through and if ya try ta rip, I throw a bigger blue shoe to you
And if you take the shoe, a nigga actor will do, ooh
Dressed to the best to impress but after they try take us in
Crook as a nigga, take a pistol, see who wants to be Naughty or nicest
Like ice is I'm priceless, plug the mic to it
Come with the D with the I with the S to the S's, see whose hype is
Test the test the Treach to Treach address, the address,
How I'll bless and blow any conflicts
Why to try to chrome, my style is just nonsense
M-my ni-ni-nigga m-m-macking so you get out of it
Any and all should fall, many are small should call
Naughty By Nature the creator of all y'all
Show hope, show no hope and can't cope, so no way
This is how we play everyday all day

Yo yo hey yo
Having a round of cadavva, gather matters is drastically
Never say never whenever whether we come on after thee
Hand to Gee the producer, me is loose off the claps ya see
That keeps you boogie'n happily
Voice ya opinion, it's the rhythm I'm lending
The message I'm sending from London to Linley
Girls are given a chance to get ya all pampered
Leave them ol' cramps in your pants then I belly dance her
God is good and if ya would, you should just
Play to the way I see em, play all day is what He'll bless
I'm leaving em evil and seeing em being a torture with dull props
I won't give up til you had 'nough of these call shots
Now let the hard floor break your fall darling
'cause on the shrift and Naughty ain't waltzing
When we dance we come full-thrust, the bum rush
Knocking and popping 'em up inside, they rocking dawn til dusk
I ain't the type to get suit-to-sike
I feel I'm better than ever before but as a rapper I'm just alright
Showing time is for clocks, knocking poppas
Pop pop ya try to shine I make your heart work proper
And that's comin from the drifter and if ya
Are-you-IN YA L-I-P, you will B-E-G-O-N-E
So let the guests getting pass-ons, be by-gones
Nevertheless is definitely hit and hits are what we strive on
We feel this way every single day all day
So make way

Was up to all you MC cub scouts
Grub scouts getting rubbed out
I'll bet'cha kept ya album froze til this came out
Hitting ideas to use, a half of us snit or two
Snatching and maxing a rap that I'm casting, how dare you!
How the hell can you yell what someone else said?
I must get on what I loan, what I own on my forehead, huh
But I doubt that, and now ya want to back out
Your career had more ins and outs than a crack house
I'm macking 'n rackin 'n capping the acts and I wax em wit-wit a smack
This scam he owes must judge me rough with a whiffle bat
And that's simply elementary Walton
So pack ya track and do 5 flat in your Dodge son
Now let my canine backtrack the copy-cat
Your night life is up, so what you had, you gotta sound track
What's all with seven thousand other rappers, groupie
The cut ya made for that movie ain't soothed me
Who said that Treach can't work when he don't curse?
Some nasty ass me, Naughty and that keep it happy
I'm all that and never go out the small way
You need a lift, we go this way everyday all day

Your little tape got more blank spots than a tank-top, think, stop
You ought to store it all, fast-forward 'fore I ring props
You sorry sight, you're a immature rhyme ho
Come rock a lil something, no we're all outta time so
From Chilltown JC to Brooklyn with A-D
I'm ripping things daily, ni if, and or maybes
At the ? and the A-V, the O-U-R-B-A-BE
Kris, the Jungle Brothers, Tribe Called Quest, yeah they be
Down with Sha-ka-ottin, pimp or, man, they swifting
Then the ruler (?all reigns?), he comes handy on the roll again
Marked the 45, kids kneels feels the reals
With the real chill, not the run-of-the-mill deals
Get poopoo dooie, producer Louie Louie
Throwing best tracks to me to me
So that sometimes they do me
I can't forget the day live, the solo need a tongue
Patrol the song, what up to the brothers from the (?Natcheo?)
We got the gatch to ya batch to rock and lock him
But now it's ??? don't even try to outrun them
The stable now cocky, Lord Ali Raski and (?trueogy?)
The sharper day with double jade is the props see
We also got the speaker Latifah, the Queen of the flavor
And nothing weaker behind is watching, kick her
The Digital Under-the-Underground, rocks with Shock and 2PAC
With Money be	, Humpty and Jimmy, the master of the charts
And on the tipple several brothers, we muskets
It's Tahid, Akeem, Cracker see and Cee Justice
Plus is the voice behind the flavor unit, all time, all early
It's that girlie, head of the head called her Shirley
And what poop last but not least, Camille
I feel you learned the way we come this deep everyday all day

Ya know what I'm saying? We got the newest member of the flavor unit
Def Jef in effect. We got the producer of this trach Kay-Gee
We got my girl Nikki-D in the house

Mercifully  mercifully  mercifully massacre  Naughty By Nature 
Through it ever time  comin at a dance 
My man Treacherous MC  go on  let the saxophone man play a little 
Make it lovely 

[Treach]
You got beef  well what we do  talk to the bunny  sunny 
He's the man  Bugs the thug wit the money 
Funny that you should mention as my family  they covered 
Wassup to my cousins and my sisters and my Warner Brothers 
Birds of a feather, flap and fold and be together 
No matter what your whatever, endeavor, find us better 
You mean he, she, them, him, those and others 
Let's kill two ducks in one, pluck, initiate the trouble 
For those who disagree, I maybe feel the need to front it 
Show me your whole entire crew, two shoes and I'ma run it 
Do you want it? Maybe so, but just know, we're rolling spreads 
You claim you want it but you need it just about as much as a hole in ya head 
This is a flow-er show, a product float a while ago 
With a new swing, I think so, bring it, sing it, act like you know 
And if ya don't, you won't by the time this track is done 
Queen Latifah the sire, give em some, come 

[Chorus: Queen Latifah]
Every time they coming at the dance, what you know 
It's time for rum, man, yeah man 
Every time they coming at the dance, what you know 
It's for jamming, g'yeah know? 
Every time they come, you know they come without the flow 
Soon we have a single, they're the quickest out the door 
The wickedest man, the wickedest man in dance hall, well ya know 
I'm out for rum, come! 

[Treach]
118th Street keeps production, conjunction junction nothin 
Huh, what's your function? 
I don't mean to be blunt or front, true or rude 
How can he diss? Your honey dip looks like a honey dude 
So keep it to yourself, greedy when you're in good health 
So before you come and try the Treach, try yourself 
'cause I ain't having it, remember act like you know 
And if ya can't act jack, you best find the door 
I hate to think a trade, I slot another, see ya gator 
A stam yada, peace!, sasalama, lick em later 
Yeah, you don't have a chance, but I see ya next 
This track is KayGee's baby and he named it ""Def"" 
I'm smoking in em, it's like chimneys, I ain't friendly 
Fuck your fendy, I'm swinging for your diet kidney 
Pimples are simple to pop, I want temple's op 
Then slop your rock wit more flopping than a waffle spot 
The wickedest man alive, I am what I am and I'm 
Damn good to be a no good, hooded by 
The wiggle in the middle, simple to party thumps 
They call me the wickedest man alive, make em jump 

[Chorus]

[Treach]
Getting it and hitting wit it a old fashion weapon when you're slipping, I got time 
Try to stand and get rammed like a Stop sign 
The bad just got worse within one verse 
Put the shitty verse and reverse and this fella's first 
Wrecking is second, so back with ya wacked disc 
For candle after candle and still couldn't wax this 
I be the wickedest while you're still the wackest 
I need wallpaper to list what your track miss 
This is a double decker from the head wrecker, neck and head checker 
Check the check and who's def? Who's left ya? 
Standing back canning ya, plan ta stay back 
I'm down wit Kay's tracks, black, this is the payback, lay back, jack 
I have you every which way but loose, blowing your sound proof 
That's happening to me, your thanks for giving a neck noose 
This comes naturally, all day and night 
I make a party of all lefty's leave screaming out ""Alright!"" 
Talking bout needing a lot more work than you had 
Twelve years, twelve hundred, twelve inches and sold one 
Who's getting done? Who's swifter? Who's badder? 
You be able to get down wit some help in a step ladder 
This is another song, we check out the style that I've 
Picked and rip, I be the wickedest man alive

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

How white the ever constant moon

When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2002

My lovers voice turned rivers wide

Flow me to her heart
I want to listen from where it starts
If I dive too deep
I pray to God my soul to keep

Like a three note melody

So hush, be still, crowd
And watch me fall to heaven
And she will sing so loud
And take us all to heaven

If you say you heard it all
I would burn the music halls
I can say I'll wait for years
To hear her son with deafening ears

She can sing a symphony
Like a three note melody

So hush, be still, crowd
And watch me fall to heaven
And she will sing so loud
And take us all to heaven

And watch me fall to heaven
And she will sing so loud

A 40 year-old accountant had lost his bid 
To collect 38 dollars in damages from a cocktail waitress
Who broke a date with him

Judge Richard Figoney ruled yesterday in small claims court against Tom Hosley
Who sought the money from Alison Cheeselet, 31
Because she had backed out on a date to accompany him to the theater
Mr. Hosley said he drove 35 miles from his home in Campbell to San Francisco
To pick up Ms. Cheeslet and was upset that 
She had not called him before he left home to tell him the date was off

Judge, explaining his decision, said,
""The promise to engage in a social relationship for one evening 
In exchange for affection 
And all one evening at the theater
Is an impossible ?
? involving a contract.""

Mr. Hosley had presented the cardboard
Broken heart at the theater
And Judge Figoney took note of it in his opinion

Observed that faint hopes are often like the dreams that waltz away

Well, please stop it
Love's in need
Of love today
Don't delay
Right away
Just give the world love.",Love's in Need of Love Today,1999
Andy Taylor,"People say I'm crazy
I'm just a fool
Well, I'm the pigeon
And baby, you're the stool

Always loved your colored hair
Always loved the clothes you wear
I can say that you turn me on
Why not stay all night long

Take it easy
On yourself
Take it easy
There ain't no one else
Don't give me reasons
And I won't ask for nothing

Rich girls may run after me
Break my heart
You know I fall in love so easily

Always loved your colored hair
Always loved the clothes you wear
I can say that you turn me on
Why not stay all night long",Take It Easy,1986
Andy Taylor,"Just as pretty as an angel
Cool as a crocodile
You got dirt on your fingers
And stars in your head

You gotta listen to the heroes
If you want to know the way it is
Everybody loves a hero
Don't you know that they care

Your heart beats once, your heart beats twice
Baby your heart will break a thousand times
Your heart beats once, your heart beats twice
Baby your heart will break a thousand times

Fly away
On the wings of love
Na, na, na, na, na, na
On the wings of love
Fly away
On the wings of love
Na, na, na, na, na, na
On the wings of love

You got to know what to fight for
Find it out for yourself
Pay no attention to the loved ones
Don't you know that they lie

Your heart beats once, your heart beats twice
Baby your heart will break a thousand times
Your heart beats once, your heart beats twice
Baby your heart will break a thousand times",Wings of Love,1986
Andy Taylor,"Fields of fire burn in my sleep
I hear screaming and thunder and cries
Devils crowd under my feet
Scream so loud

Under here lies a different face
In a hungry lonely soul
I guess it ain't easy
When you don't know which way to go

Don't let me die young
I'm begging you
Don't let me die young

I never liked the thought of pain
And time is all we have to gain
Gotta play anyway
Win or lose

Who's to say who's to blame
When everybody wants to run away
They ran by night
They can't face to in the day",Don't Let Me Die Young,1987
Andy Taylor,"Take my hand or you'll be sorry
I'm the music for your story
Walk with me
Through the lonely nights

Follow me through the darkness
Down deep, give me your kiss
Come on baby
I won't let you down

Take my hand, don't ask why
I can't wait forever
Put your hand on my heart
Swear to me when you say

I might lie
When I look into your eyes
I could love you 'til forever
When I look into your eyes
Tell me why
When I look into your eyes
I could love you 'til forever
When I look into your eyes

I don't know why I love you
When I don't even know you
Trust in you I do the best I can

Take my hand, don't ask why
I can't wait forever
Put your hand on my heart
Swear to me when you say",I Might Lie,1987
Andy Taylor,"Somebody better look out for me
Although I stand alone
I'm more dangerous than I seem
But in this smoking gun world
Our lights don't last
They're over fast

Life goes on
Goes on and on
On and on
Life goes on
Goes on and on
On and on

Although I really don't know
Your time is fading fast
I wake up in a wasted world
How long is it gonna last
Under pressure and pain
What may be right may be wrong",Life Goes On,1987
Andy Taylor,"Yesterday is far behind me
Let's forget the things we said
Now I'm waiting at the station
With different feelings in my head

And I pray she never hates me
Will she remember me this way

I'm comin' home on the night train
I'm comin' to your bed
I'm comin' home on the night train
I'll do everything I said

The train is waiting at the station
I've still got time to change my mind
An endless moment's indecision
I take it or leave it all behind

And I pray she doesn't hate me
Will she remember me this way",Night Train,1987
