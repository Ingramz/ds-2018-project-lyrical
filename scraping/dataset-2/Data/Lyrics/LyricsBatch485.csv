John Michael King,"Words Words Words
I'm so sick of words
I get words all day through
First from him, now from you
Is that all you blighters can do

Don't talk of stars
Burning above
If you're in love
Show me

Tell me no dreams
Filled with desire
If you're on fire
Show me

He we are together
In the middle of the night
Don't talk of spring
Just hold me tight

Anyone who's ever been
In love'll tell you that
This is no time
For a chat

Haven't your lips
Longed for my touch
Don't say how much
Show me, show me

Don't talk of love

Lasting through time
Make me no undying vow
Show me now

Sing me no song
Read me no rhyme
Don't waste my time
Show me

Don't talk of June
Don't talk of fall
Don't talk at all
Show me

Never do I ever
want to hear another word
There isn't one
I haven't heard

Here we are together in
What ought to be a dream
Say another word
And I'll scream

Haven't your arms
Hungered for mine
Please don't explain
Show me, show me

Don't wait until
Wrinkles and lines
Pop out of my brow
Show me now",Show Me,1996
John Michael Montgomery,"(richard fagan/robb royer)

Well I went down to the grundy county auction
Where I saw something I just had to have
My mind told me I should proceed with caution
But my heart said, ""go ahead an' make a bid on that!""

An' I said, hey, pretty lady, won'cha gi'me a sign
I'd give anything to make you mine all mine
I'll do your biddin' an' be at your beckon call
Yeah, I never seen anyone lookin' so fine
Man, I gotta have her, she's a one-of-a-kind
I'm goin' once, goin' twice,
I'm sold! on the lady in the second row
She's an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten, I know
She's got ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
An' I'm about to bid my heart good-bye!

Well, the auctioneer was goin' about a mile a minute
He was takin' bids an' callin' them out loud
An' I guess I was really gettin' in it
'cause I just shouted out above the crowd!

An' I said, hey, pretty lady, won'cha gi'me a sign
I'd give anything to make you mine all mine
I'll do your biddin' an' be at your beckon call
Yeah, I never seen anyone lookin' so fine
Man, I gotta have her, she's a one-of-a-kind
I'm goin' once, goin' twice,
I'm sold! on the lady in the long black dress
Well she won my heart it was no contest
With her ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes
Well I'm about to bid my heart good-bye!

Yeah, we found love on the auction block
An' I hauled her heart away
Now we still love to laugh about
The way we met that day

When I said, hey, pretty lady, won'cha gi'me a sign
I'd give anything to make you mine all mine
I'll do your biddin' an' be at your beckon call
Yeah, I never seen anyone lookin' so fine
Man, I gotta have her, she's a one-of-a-kind
I'm goin' once, goin' twice,
I'm sold! on the lady in the second row
She's an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten, I know
She's's got ruby red lips, blond hair blue eyes
An' I'm about to bid my heart good-bye!
",Sold,
John Michael Montgomery,"They read you Cinderella
You hoped it would come true
That one day your Prince Charming
Would come rescue you
You like romantic movies
You will never forget
The way you felt when Romeo kissed Juliet

All this time that you've been waiting
You don't have to wait no more

I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move Heaven and Earth if you were my girl
I will give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
If you give me a chance
I can love you like that

I never make a promise I don't intend to keep
So when I say forever, forever's what I mean

I'm no Casanova but I swear this much is true
I'll be holdin' nothing back when it comes to you
You dream of love that`s everlasting
Well baby open up your eyes

I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move Heaven and Earth if you were my girl
I will give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
If you give me a chance
I can love you like that

You want tenderness-I got tenderness
And I see through to the heart of you
If you want a man who understands
You don't have to look very far",I Can Love You Like That,
John Michael Montgomery,"I ain't nothin' but beer and bones
Honey since I lost you
I ain't ate a bite
Since the night

That you said we're through
I walked to that jukebox to play
A few sad country songs
I heard someone say
Hey that old boy
Ain't nothin' but beer and bones

I got to work this morning
Early this afternoon
Yeah my boss man nudged me
Said son I need to talk to you

You used to make me money
But lately I been taking a loss
Well he smelled my breath
Gave me what was left
Of the day off

Well I wish I could go home
And rest my weary head
But I know I'll just stay here
And have another beer instead

That little waitress asked me
Honey could you use some help
I said I thank you miss
I'll have to get through this
By my dang self

I ain't nothin' but beer and bones

John Michael Montgomery,"Way down in Texas
Those cowgirls get restless
As they wait for that cowboy
Who will love them for life
And though they are certain
They'll meet him tomorrow
They're alone with their dreams for tonight

So dream on Texas ladies
About cowboys and babies
Hold out for that Lonestar
Who will love you for life
Dream on Texas ladies
About sunshine and daisies
Follow your heart
Where it leads you tonight

From Houston to Dallas
Those cowgirls sing ballads
About how love everlasting
Is love at its best
And they dream of that day
When they both ride away
As the sun slowly sets in the west

So dream on Texas ladies
About cowboys and babies
Hold out for that Lonestar
Who will love you for life
Dream on Texas ladies
About sunshine and daisies
Follow your heart
Where it leads you tonight

John Michael Montgomery,"Let me tell you 'bout a lady that I know
Who stood tall and proud beside me
Down many a dead end road
Never asking more than I could give
And never once complaining
About the way we had to live

Well she never showed a sign of losing hope
Though a million dreams and promises
Have all gone up in smoke
She hides her disappointment out of love
And if I laid the whole world at her feet
It wouldn't be enough

She's the rock I lean on through it all
Every time I stumble
Every time I fall
And though she's never shown it
I've known it from the start
Every time I fall it breaks her heart
Every time I fall
It breaks her heart

Now let me tell you about the million silent tears
I've found hidden on her pillow
In the mornings through the years
Somehow I'm still a hero in her eyes
But to tell the truth
I can't give you one good reason why

She's the rock I lean on through it all
Every time I stumble
Every time I fall
And though she's never shown it
I've known it from the start
Every time I fall it breaks her heart
Every time I fall
It breaks her heart",Everytime I Fall (It Breaks Her Heart),1992
John Michael Montgomery,"I'm not one to take chances
I've always played it safe
But girl I've been out on a limb
Since I saw your smiling face
I feel like I'm walking a tightrope
When I'm out walking with you
It's a dangerous liaison
I've got my heart into

'Cause we're not a sure thing
Too soon to tell if we're the real thing
But this time it's worth taking a chance
On you and me
But if doesn't work out
Should you decide to walk out
Well that's all right with me
'Cause girl I know you'd be
A great memory

Some folks would die for this moment
But I've lived for this moment in time
The love you bring may be a fleeting thing
But oh right now it's mine
If I should wind up lonely
Well I won't mind being alone
'Cause if it works out that you leave me
Least I'll have you to look back on

'Cause we're not a sure thing
Too soon to tell if we're the real thing
But this time it's worth taking a chance
On you and me
But if doesn't work out
Should you decide to walk out
Well that's all right with me

A great memory
Yeah that's all right with me
'Cause girl I know you'd be
A great memory",A Great Memory,1992
John Michael Montgomery,"I like the feel of your name on my lips
And I like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss
The way that your fingers run through my hair
And how your scent lingers even when your not there

And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh
And how you enjoy your two hour bath
And how you convinced me to dance in the rain
With everyone watching like we were insane

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild
Slow and easy
Heart and soul
So completely
I love the way you love me

I like to imitate old Jerry Lee
And watch you roll your eyes when I'm slightly off key
And I like the innocent way that you cry
At sappy old movies you've seen hundreds of times

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild
Slow and easy
Heart and soul
So completely
I love the way you love me

And I could list a million things
I love to like about you
But they all come down to one reason
I could never live without you

I love the way you love me
Strong and wild
Slow and easy
Heart and soul

So completely
I love the way you love me
Oh baby I love the way you love me",I Love the Way You Love Me [*],1992
John Michael Montgomery,"When I was fourteen I was falling fast
For a blue eyed girl in my homeroom class
Trying to find the courage to ask her out
Was like trying to get oil from a waterspout

What she would have said I can't say
I never did ask and she moved away
But I learned something from my blue eyed girl
Sink or swim you gotta give it a whirl

Life's a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow
Don't worry about what you don't know
Life's a dance you learn as you go

The longer I live the more I believe
You do have to give if you want to receive
There's a time to listen, a time to talk
And you might have to crawl even after you walk

Had sure things blow up in my face
Seen the longshot, win the race
Been knocked down by the slamming door
Picked myself up and came back for more

Life's a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow
Don't worry about what you don't know
Life's a dance you learn as you go

Life's a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow
Don't worry about what you don't know
Life's a dance you learn as you go

Life's a dance you learn as you go
Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow
Don't worry about what you don't know
Life's a dance you learn as you go

Life's a dance
Life's a dance
Life's a dance

Take a chance on love
Life's a dance
You learn as you go",Life's a Dance,1992
John Michael Montgomery,"Packed an old cane pole
Crossed the shoulder through the woods
To the fishing hole
I tried to keep up the best I could
He answered with love
All the questions of his little man
Daddy taught me about life
In words I could understand

You gotta roll up your sleeves
Put your back into your work son
Always believe in the good Lord's way
You gotta hold your mouth right
When your going for the big one
Once you get a line on love
Don't let it get away

Driving my old car
That we worked on after school
He's a football star
And his daddy's a proud old fool
It's a brand new world
Full of girls and teenage dreams
When he asks for my advice
The answer's still the same

You gotta roll up your sleeves
Put your back into your work son
Always believe in the good Lord's way
You gotta hold your mouth right
When your going for the big one
Once you get a line on love
Don't let it get away
Once you get a line on love
Don't let it get away",Line on Love,1992
John Michael Montgomery,"Remember when pocket change was all we had
And all those calls from the corner phone booth
Collect to Mom and Dad
And that old worn out couch we called our bed
When our cuisine was pork and beans
Baloney and day old bread

Remember that damn old car that kept breaking down
And all the times it left me stranded
Thumbing all over town
And that old weekly paycheck
Just never stretched enough
Back in the times of nickels and dimes and love

Together we sure made some dreams come true
Sometimes it wasn't easy
But somehow we made it through
And when I get to thinking times are tough
I remember the times
Of nickels and dimes and love
Oh those good old times
Of nickels and dimes and love

Remember digging through your old purses in hopes we'd get
Enough change for an RC cola or a pack of cigarettes
Now we've got almost everything
That we were dreaming of
Back in the times
Of nickels and dimes and love

Together we sure made some dreams come true
Sometimes it wasn't easy
But somehow we made it through
And when I get to thinking times are tough
I remember the times
Of nickels and dimes and love
Oh those good old times
Of nickels and dimes and love
Do you remember those times
Of nickels and dimes and love",Nickels and Dimes and Love,1992
John Michael Montgomery,"I been down on my luck
I been down on my knees
Well I been downtown
And I been down on the farm
I can't be satisfied
But I'm gonna have to find
A way to kick back and
Take off the edge

Now there's a little gal I know
Just south of Tupelo
Her hair is dark and her legs are long and tan
She rubs my back just right
Till way up in the night
She knows how to
Take off the edge

I've been laid up with the flu
Laid off a time or two
I've been uptight

And I can't hardly wait till quitting time
Gonna get that big brown jug
All I need is a little slug

John Michael Montgomery," I don't recall the icebox ever humming quite so loud
That clock upon the wall, sounding like a crowd
My that dog is restless
He don't ever settle down
Now ain't it strange what occupies your mind
When your baby ain't around

When your baby ain't around
I swear the moon and stars won't shine
And nights get longer all the time

I never thought I'd ever be this down
That's all my body's got a mind to do
Now that my baby ain't around

And look in your eyes
For that old familiar flame
That love that burns
Makes my world turn
Two hearts beating the same
Is it all in my mind
Or is it harder to find

I thought it was real
But I'm starting to feel
Like it must be all in my heart

I'm a fool for believing
But I just keep dreaming
While we just keep drifting apart
Trying to make something
Where there's really nothing
I guess it's all in my heart

I ran into an old flame today
You wouldn't like the way our conversation

Since honesty is one thing we believe in
Let me tell you something you should know

Oh how she shines
Shines a light on you
And in that light I see
Just how much you mean to me
Oh how she shines

There was a time when she was all that mattered
Long before I gave my heart to you
But standing there only inches from her
She touched my hand and suddenly I knew
If there was a time I ever doubted
What I'd do if she walked through my door
Could I turn around and leave without her
With all my heart now I can say for sure

If you look at what I own
Still she's always telling me

To hold on to my dreams
Even when my hope is gone
Some may say that dreaming's just for fools
And there are times I thought that might be true

But she thinks I could rope the moon
In her eyes there is nothing I can't do
When I think it's out of reach
She's the reason I still try
She thinks I could rope the moon

When I look at the sky
But can't see through the clouds
She shows me the brightest stars
If I think of coming back

'Cause I'm having my doubts
She tells me I've come so far
Nothing in this world comes easily
But I can't lose with her right next to me

'Cause she thinks I could rope the moon
In her eyes there is nothing I can't do

And says things with fancy frills

Lord I wish I could afford

We make such pretty music
That you can tell at just a glance
When I take the notion
She seconds that emotion
She don't need a band to dance

She didn't say a thing
When we had to pawn the ring
To pay the rent
What I make in overtime
Stacked against the bills
Don't make a dent
Just when I think I let her down
And failed to be the man I oughta be
She still sees the bright side
Of everything including me

I was playing the blues instead of playing with toys
Listening to the Opry and dreaming of the neon lights
So it was late to bed and early to rise
I worked the field all day and the crowd all night
My finger on the trigger and Nashville in my sights
I'm the real thing and I sing songs about real life

And I never heard a fiddle called a violin
Never really worried if I fit in
Country ain't what I sing it's what I am
This hat ain't something I wear for style
These boots have been around a while
Country ain't what I sing it's what I am

I learned to drive on a dirt road
Cruised the strip on rock and roll
And drove around on ""Miles and Miles of Texas""
And as I grew Daddy showed me now
To earn a living by the sweat of my brow
But he never made me follow in his steps
He said work hard and let the good Lord do the rest

Tossed upon the waves

Hey pretty lady why don't you give me a sign
I'd give anything to make you mine o' mine
I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call
I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine
Man I got to have her she's a one of a kind
I'm going once, I'm goin' twice, I'm sold

To the lady in the second row
She's an eight, she's  a nine, she's a ten I know
She's got ruby red lips, blonde hair, blue eyes
And I'm about to bid my heart goodbye.

Seems like I've been on it everyday for years now
Does it ever end
On my way to another show
Where I'll end up, I don't even know where I'm going
Or where I've been

Chorus
Don't know why, don't know how
But I keep comin' back for more
It's my life, there's no doubt
Guess I'll never know for sure
But when I stand on that stage, and the curtain falls
I love it all

It's getting late, I think I'll lay it down
Then I'll wake up in some other town and I'll wander
To my hotel room
I'll walk around just a-wastin' time
Lookin' for a little peace of mind I bet I'll find it
On an ole barstool

Chorus

Don't know why, don't know how
But I keep comin' back for more
It's my life, there's no doubt
Guess I'll never know for sure
But when I stand on that stage and the curtain falls
And the crowd wants to stay for one more song
I love it all

Another night on this interstate
Seems like I've been on it everyday for years now
I hope it never ends

John Michael Montgomery,"Her parents never took the young girl to church
Never spoke of his name never read her his word
Two non believers walking lost in this world
Took their baby with them what a sad little girl
Her daddy drank all day and mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play or give kisses and hugs
She'd watched the TV and sit there on the couch
While her mom fell asleep and her daddy went out
And the drinking and the fighting
Just got worse every night
Behind their couch she'd be hiding
Oh what a sad little life

And like it always does the bad just got worse
With every slap and every curse
Until her daddy in a drunk rage one night
Used a gun on her mom and then took his life
And some people from the city took the girl far away
To a new Mom and a new Dad
Kisses and hugs every day!

Her first day at Sunday school
The teacher walked in
And a small little girl stared at a picture of him
She said I know that man
There on that cross I don't know his name
But I know he got off
'Cause he was there in my old house
Held me close to his side
As I hid there behind our couch the night my parents died",The Little Girl,2000
John Michael Montgomery,"I don't take your breath away
My tongue don't get tied when you walk in a room
Every single minute of every day
You don't dream about me, I don't think of you
I'm not sayin' it can't happen that way
Our life ain't no cliche

We got real love

You weren't lookin' for a man
Funny how your independence really turned me on
Just the opposite of what we planned
Everything that's so right was supposed to be wrong
In all likelihood we shouldn't be together
But now it's forever

We got real love
We fuss and fight
Make love so right
We're up all night
We got real love

This ain't no Hollywood movie scene, romance novelty
Based on a story 'bout you and me, no

We got real love

A thousand miles of highway between your heart and mine

John Michael Montgomery,"The ending of December 1943
Somewhere in the forest
The snow was three feet deep
Two allied soldiers walking
Trying not to freeze
Far from home on Christmas Eve

A cabin with the light on
Brought them to its door
A woman said, ""In my home
You can't bring in your war
So leave your rifles outside
Up against a tree
There's peace on Earth on Christmas Eve""

And they sat by the fire and they talked all night long
Sang Christmas hymns and showed pictures of home
In the middle of a great war it's so hard to believe
There's peace on Earth on Christmas Eve

Later in the evening, footsteps in the night
Two German soldiers freezing
The woman went outside
""You're welcome here in my home
But your guns will never be
There's peace on Earth on Christmas Eve""

The soldiers all were frightened
When they stood face to face
The woman said, ""You're brothers
Part of the human race
Tonight we're all just family
And we'll get down on our knees
And praise His name on Christmas Eve""

And they sat by the fire and the talked all night long
Sang Christmas hymns and showed pictures of home

Here come the wise men from Orient land
The King of kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend

Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You might even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Play in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say,
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight""

Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

It was hard to believe he called those people stars
They'd sing through their noses like they all had colds

There's a doctor I've heard of who fixes mistakes""

An' I thought he was workin', an' I was alone
But he was standin' behind me when I hung up the phone
He said, ""Son, there's a few things you don't know about
If you listen real close, we can figure this out""

Well I was just a kid maybe 2 or 3,

had a bad nightmare scared the life outa me,

momma came in to calm my fears,

when nothing she could do to would stop those tears,

she carried me down the stairs

to that living room and sat down in that chair,


[CHORUS]

and it rocked,

it made me feel better,

don't know why but it really doesn't matter,

it rocked,

that's all I know,

something about the rhythm of it soothed my soul,

and that's a feeling that I never forgot,

and it rocked

[CHORUS]


I was 17 and I fell for this girl,

as far as I could tell she was my only world,

I was confused about life,

in the dark about love,

I heard a lot of stories but I didn't know much,

we took a drive down to the river one night,

she told me when to stop then she kissed me just right,


[CHORUS]

and it rocked,

it made me feel better,

don't know why but it really doesn't matter,

it rocked,

that's all I know,

something about the rhythm of it soothed my soul,

that old chevy had brand new shocks,

but it rocked

[CHORUS]


After graduation I was workin odd jobs, changed a lot of oil in my uncles garage,

some friend of mine they were startin up a band,

I would sing for free so I was their man,

we were'nt that good and we seldom got paid,

but everbody knew when we took the stage,


[CHORUS]

it rocked,

it made us feel better,

don't know why but it really doesn't matter,

it rocked,

that's all I know,

something about the rhythm of it soothed our soul,

and that's a feeling that we never forgot,

and it rocked

I hope this letter catches up with you
And finds you well
It's been dry
But they're callin' for rain
And everything's the same old same
In Johnsonville
Your stubborn old daddy
Ain't said too much
But I'm sure you know
He sends his love

And she goes on
In a letter from home

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared
And our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh
Like there's something funny

Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on

I've been lyin' here all night long
Wonderin' where you might be
I saw your mamma
And I showed her the ring
Man on the television
Said something
So I couldn't sleep
But I'll be alright,
I'm just missin' you
And this is me kissin' you

Like we ain't scared
And our boots ain't muddy

'Cause I don't read the good parts

Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on

I'm Sittin' here tonight alone in the kitchen
It occurs to me
I might not have said it
So I'll say it now
""Son, You make me proud""

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared
And our boots ain't muddy
But no one laughs
'Cause there's ain't nothin' funny

We was dirt road poor, and cane switched raised
I've been came a long way since back in the day
Been round the world twice seen all fifty states
Ate on thousand dollar china, but love some paper plates
There ain't nuthin' wrong with them big city lights
But me, I prefer them slow country nights
Where I can see the darkness come in and then go

Most folks is honest, and they all speak slow
You can leave your door open, ain't nuttin' gunna happen

Got on a white t-shirt, no nothin' but work
Daylight til dark, that's how I was bred
And I'll keep bein' country til the day I'm dead

See, country folks eat biscuits called cat heads
Bar-b-q, baked beans, sweet tea, and white bread
We like to fish and hunt, ain't scared of a fight
Love the good Lord and believe in doin' right,

Got four-wheel drives, some got mud on 'em
You can keep your Rolls Royce, 'cause baby

Those bright lights blind me
And make it hard for me to see
But when I need to be reminded
I take a ride through the country

Them country boys head down to the local saloon
You welcome to stop in and have a cold bottle
Big city boys and stuck up super models

Came here to give y'all fair warnin'

And there's some of us livin' in every town

Nobody owe you nothin' supposed to earn your keep

To talk in riddles 'round the end
It took me a lot more livin'
To understand what he meant, when he said

I was born at daylight walkin' tall by seven
Graduated ten a.m. got saved by eleven
I took her hand it was straight up noon
Had three kids before two
They all grew and left in the afternoon

Time flies these eyes
Have seen the glory of the morning
Turn into a silent night
I've lived a million moments in the time
It takes the sun to fade
And it feels like it all happened in a day

His eyes glistened as he talked
About his autumn afternoon
How they held each other in the chill of a silver moon
He got all chocked up when midnight fell
She squeezed his hand the clock struck twelve
She let go and he was all by himself

Time flies these eyes
Have seen the glory of the morning
Turn into a silent night
I've lived a million moments in the time
It takes the sun to fade
And it feels like it all happened in a day

But oh, what a great day it was
We lived, we loved
And it all just sped up around the end

Time flies these eyes
Have seen the glory of the morning
Turn into a silent night

And I feel like I lived my life in a day

But those sticks would turn
To switches if you made her mad

They handed down the genes we were born to wear
That's how me and brother Edrow learned to sing
We caught that fever to go off and chase that dream
Barely old enough to sneak into the bars
We were the local weekend country music stars

We were rocked in the same old rocker
Fought over nothin' but it was somethin' back then
Don't always see eye to eye
But let's face it, we'll take it for each other on the chin
We were brothers when we started
We'll be brothers 'til the end

When we hit the road we went our separate ways
Singin' songs about the way that we were raised
Chasin' each other up and down those charts
We're still the local weekend country music stars

We were rocked in the same old rocker

I say, I'm sorry for all the things I'm not
I mean every word I say
And I promise I can change
When I get drunk and talk to God

When I talk to God, I tell Him why we're through
I tell Him all the things I did and didn't do
I'll say I can't be alone, He'll say son you're on your own
'Cause when I talk to God, I tell Him why we're through

I wish that I could go to church but I'm too ashamed of me
I hate the fact it takes a bottle to get me on my knees
And I hope He'll forgive the things you ain't forgot
When I get drunk and talk to God

When I talk to God I thank Him for the time
All those precious years that you were mine all mine
I know He's a busy man, He'll help me if He can
So when I talk to God, I thank Him for the time

So think about what you're doing here
If you're anything less than sincere tell me now
And let yourself out the door

Yeah, my knees started shakin', I was breakin' out a sweat
Tryin' to memorize her number 'cause my hand was gettin' wet
I was showing the symptoms looking for a remedy

You're living in your own world, where love is all synthetic

To ever cause so much pain

Crown pressed upon His head
It should have been the royal one
Made of jewels and gold instead

It had to be a crown of thorns
Because in this life that we live
For all who seek to love
A thorn is all the world has to give

And why did it have to be
A heavy cross He was made to bare
And why did they nail His feet and hands

You are the light of the world
But if that light's under a bushel
It's lost something kind of crucial
You got to stay bright to be the light of the world

You are the salt of the earth
You are the salt of the earth
But if that salt has lost its flavor
It ain't got much in its favor
You can't have that fault and be the salt of the earth

So let your light, so shine before men
Let your light so shine
So that they might know some kindness again
We all need help to feel fine, let's have some wine

You are the city of God
You are the city of God
But if that city's on a hill
It's kind of hard to hide it well
You gotta stay pretty in the city of God

So let your light, so shine before men
Let your light so shine
So that they might know some kindness again
We all need help to feel fine, let's have some wine

You are the light of the world
You are the light of the world
But the tallest candle stick
Ain't much good without a wick
You got to live right to be the light of the world

Rain hiding tears without traces.
I know that deep down no reason or rhyme,
Even the smile on our faces.
Time goes so slowly, day after day,
Time goes, love grows.
Only the fears as you go through the years,
Till the last sand of time blows away,
The last sand of time blows away.

Locked up with freedom you don't want at all,
In crowds there is no-one to turn to.
Down when you're high is a long way to fall,
And all the mistakes you won't learn through.
Time is for ever and no-one can say,
Time shows, love goes.
Only the fears as you go through the years,
Till the last sand of time blows away.
The last sand of time blows away!

And those who lose must pay their dues
While heroes take the glory

Breaking every rule.

When he'll be all alone.

So those you didn't need were pushed aside.

This can't be, I expected to see, I am human after all.
Can't believe that you were fooling, always sounded so sincere,
I can't look back, as a matter of fact, I'm still sad that you're not here.
Someone scream, it's a terrible dream, it's all a big mistake.
Now I lost that thread deep inside of my head, it's so hard to never break,
Hard to never break.

I was blinded, yes I was blinded
And the tender touch that said so much doesn't need me now.
I was blinded, how I was blinded,
When I think about how far I've got to fall
It won't help that I was blinded by it all.

Walked in with my eyes wide open, seeing what I want to see,
And I'm not so strong so I did it all wrong, now the one that hurts is me.
Can I learn to live without you, someone better tell me how.
It's understood, we were always so good, but it doesn't help me now.
Every one's there all pretending to care with a different point of view,
If a love's that real, then they'll know how it feels, and there's nothing I can do,
Nothing I can do.

When you feel it comin' round,
There's only one way you can go.

It's such a bad education,
But when it's gone and she's saying so long
It's just a short conversation.

Bye bye I'll really miss you honey,
Bye bye I'll see your next sunny day"".

Satisfied, you should be satisfied.

What can you say when it's slipping away
And there is no explanation?
You say ""My my where is all the money,
My my can I see you honey
My my I've had my last sunny day"".

ThereÂ´s consequences IÂ´m scared to taste
Cold hard truths I canÂ´t face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass

And everywhere I look thereÂ´s something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
DonÂ´t answer the question of where we belong

How come birds
DonÂ´t fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
CanÂ´t explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

I felt a true love
She was everything
I'd ever been dreaming of

But she was bad, I didn't know it
Her pretty smile never did show it
All I knew is what I could see
And I knew I wanted her for me

Took her home to mama
Mama, wanna see my future bride
Well she looked at us both
Then she called me to her side

She said son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight thing
Take time to know her
Please don't go rushin to do your thing

But I didn't listen to my mama
I went straight to the church
I just couldn't wait for that little girl of mine
When I got off from work
The preacher was there
So was my future bride
He looked at us both and he called me to his side

Take time to know her
Not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Don't go rushin to do your thing

But it looks like every thing's gonna turn out all right
But then I came home from work a little early one night
And there she was kissin on another man
Now I know what mama meant when she took me by the hand

She said, take time to know her
Not an overnight fling

The breezes joined in their sighs, the blossoms started to fall

John Newman,"A hundred years, two thousand miles
To you I’d run through day and night
We’ve got to finish what we started
We’ve got a lot to rescue darling

My shirt is torn, the shoes are worn
My birth’s been drawn but still I’m strong
I feel like I’m a force of nature
But guess who made you my creator

Trying stop a river when it wants to rise
Trying to stop a blaze off a burning fire
I’m a hurricane, it ain’t stopping
No no no

[Chorus]
And I keep… keep running
I keep keep running
I keep keep coming back for more, no no
Keep running
I keep keep running
I keep keep coming back for more, no

I’ve got to tell you know I’ve crossed the time
I’ve crossed through time
And giving up never crossed my mind
I feel like I’m a force of nature
But guess who made you my creator

Trying stop a river when it wants to rise
Trying to stop a blaze off a burning fire
I’m a hurricane, it ain’t stopping
No no no

And I keep… keep running
I keep keep running
I keep keep coming back for more, no no
Keep running

I keep keep coming back for more, no

I'll make you stronger, stronger

And now they had to learn
There was no place to return
Nowhere they could turn.

I knew that you were waiting
For me to share your life
Cause I told you when I left, that
When I come back you'll be my wife.

But someone was waiting
In the shadows of the night
Someone was waiting
It just didn't feel right.

Danger on the track
Something told me there were
Strangers on my back
And I was so right.

Maybe I should surrender
Maybe I should give it up
But the strength I had inside
Told me you can never stop.

The men wanted to break me
Steal and bring me down
But I fought for you and later
They were lying on the ground. 
",Danger On the Track,1986
John Norum,"We're leaving together,
But still it's farewell
And maybe we'll come back,
To earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame
We're leaving ground
Will things ever be the same again?

It's the final countdown,
We're heading for Venus and still we stand tall
Cause maybe they've seen us and welcome us all
With so many light years to go and things to be found
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so.",The Final Countdown [Live][*],1986
John Norum,"I've told you once and I've told you twice
Wait for that day, when our love will rise
To that song that brought our hearts together.

Even though you're mistreating me
I know the girl that you used to be
For me those days were meant to last forever.

Time after time I'm wondering why
Am I to be all alone
Day after day I pray that you'll stay
Cause you've got a heart of stone.

I walk the streets like a broken man
Oh I wish that you would understand
Even though you're still the one I wait for.

I guess in love there's no guarantee
Sometimes it's not what it seems to be
Even though you're still the one I care for. 
",Heart of Stone,1986
John Norum,"Someone's at your door tonight
Someone wants your love
Is it real or just imagination
You decide to wait inside 'til the break of dawn
In dreams you see yourself seeking affection.

He'll know just who you are
He'll know just where you've been
He'll know just what to do.

Love chaser - If you look deep in his eyes
Then you're in for a big surprise
He can take your breath away
There's nothing you can do or say.

You can feel that someone's at your back
You can hear his pounding heart
But something tells you not to be afraid
Cause even in the darkest night
Someone's at your side
But when morning comes it all starts to fade away. 
",Love Chaser,1986
John Norum,"Tell me the story, tell me the legend
Tell me the tales of war
Tell me just one time,
What it was like before
Bring me the feeling, right in that moment
When a heart for battle cries
Find me the treasure where the legend lies.

If I were a noble ancient knight
I'd stand by jour side to rule and fight
It will always feel the same
When I call out your name.

Ninja survive, in dreams I walk by your side
Ninja survive, with you there's no need to hide.

A handful of sayings are more than a reason
For me to feel this way
I'd like to be near you
Maybe for just one day
So tell me the legend, tell me the story
Tell me the tales of war
Tell me just one time
What it was like before. 
",Ninja,1986
John Norum,"Running out on the streets
He lives from day to day
Looking for something to do
He needs to get away.

Hoping that maybe one day
He could be someone
Praying that maybe someday
He could be number one.

In his world of make believe
He always tends to be

On the loose, so young, so tough, so wild

On the loose, again.

Dreaming, dreaming about
All the things he'd like to do
Trying, trying so hard
To make it all up to you. 
",On The Loose,1986
John Norum,"I've gone through changes
I've gone through pain
But there's not enough reason for me to go insane
I know the feeling, when it grows
I'm in a rage up from my head down to my toes.

You know it ain't easy
Running out of thrills
You know it ain't easy
When you don't know what you want.

Rock now, rock the night
'Til early in the morning light
Rock now, rock the night
You'd better believe it's right.

I know my limit
Just what it takes
When things ain't good enough
I just pull the brake
Sometimes it's easy
Sometimes so tough
But just have one thing clear
I can't get enough.",Rock The Night,1986
John Norum,"Long for the sailor, beneath the skies
Long for the white dove, no matter where she flies
Long for the stranger you know so well.

Pray for the soldier, who's wounded bad
Pray for the dreamer, he's still so sad
Pray for the stranger you know so well.

Cause I'm coming home.

Now the time has come

For me to come back home.

Long for the eagle, on wings so strong
Long for the hunter, he won't be long
Long for the stranger you know so well.

John O'Dreams,"ThereÂ´s some things I donÂ´t have now
Some things I donÂ´t talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides

ThereÂ´s consequences IÂ´m scared to taste
Cold hard truths I canÂ´t face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass

And everywhere I look thereÂ´s something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
DonÂ´t answer the question of where we belong

How come birds
DonÂ´t fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
CanÂ´t explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark

And everything I hear never makes any sense

A cupful of pencils and a self help guru

John Oates,"There's a thunder storm 'a brewin'
And the day is turning gray
There ain't much to say about the weather
The shower stall is leakin'
And the ceiling's fallin' in

And I'm getting twenty bills to every letter
I've got to move myself out to the country
I'm lookin' out for any place at all
I'm gonna spend another Fall In Philadelphia
A roving band of youths beat up on Johnny
Everybody's gettin' richer sellin' that dope
Say, the stolen bikes are gathering by the thousands
Along with seven million people without a hope
I guess I have to face the fact as real
I think I feel my back up against the wall
I'm gonna spend another Fall In Philadelphia",Fall in Philadelphia,1972
John Oates,"Georgie was a skinny kid
Fond of angling, fonder of dangling his feet in the cool brook water
While the Reverend's daughter
Sat at his side and fluttered his face with the fuzz of a dandelion.
Long about noontime
Floating 'cross the field, Georgie heard the peel of a bell being rung by the parson
Time for his lesson

As much as he hated it, the preacher was teachin' him to play the accordion.
""Don't go Georgie!"" said the Reverend's daughter
""When Daddy comes lookin' we can duck in the water.""

They both went out and dipped down to hide
But the girl caught her locket on an underwater branch
And the next thing she knew, she died

Preacher was a sorry mess
He was cryin', shoutin' 'bout her dyin' and livin' the eternal life
Should 'a seen his wife
Sobbin' on the ground as the wind rustled round and tickled the keys
Made Georgie's accordion give an awful dyin' wheeze",Georgie,1972
John Oates,"Funny how the times can change as fast as we can run
Sad to say we had to part when the fun had just begun
Now he night is over
And I`m waiting for the day we can be together
And we can say Goodnight and Goodmorning
From the Dark to the Dawning

I can't believe that I`m in love and you`re the one
I can't hear a song of love and our song has just begun
When the music`s over and we finally walk away
We can walk together
And we can say Goodnight and Goodmorning

John Oates,"Would you work for a reason, Lazyman
Do your thoughts have expression, Lazyman
Does life pass you by while you don't even try
To grab hold of a minute and use all the time that's in it, Lazyman
What's your latest excuse Lazyman
Is your neck botherin' you, Lazyman
You're content to rely on the talented guy
Then you make a short edit
And take all of the credit for the song
 
Lazyman, you really bring me down
Lazyman how can you lie around
Won't you stop what you're doing
And start doing something

John Oates,"Lilly, laughing lady, does your smile disguise the tears inside?
Lilly, lonely lady, only silhouette your happy side.
You give yourself to men who take your love.
Then smile and watch them walk away...

Are you tired of giving Lilly?
Are you really happy?

Lilly, laughing lady, are you satisfied to live a lie?
Lilly, lonely lady, is it in the stars for you to try?
Do you fulfill yourself with lies and dreams?
You seem contented with your life?

Does it only gild the lilly
Or does it make you happy?",Lilly (Are You Happy),1972
John Oates,"Riding out along the river stopping by the pines
It's nice for someone speaking, to be heard, by heart and mind
Lying on the needle floor the city seems so far
Moving with your eyes and smile, your words told who you are
Sunday grey, one window brings the morning

And your words, like dawn, have opened up my eyes
I've been on a sleepy ride without much time for thinking
'Til I spent one evening by your Southeast City Window side
Baby hair a blowin' in the Sunday morning air

Dreaming on another place and time, wish we were there
In your dreams you're far away and I'm right behind
You know, it's nice for someone speaking.

John Oates,"I hear you call me, Waterwheel
Spin round, round in a circle
Gracing my child dreams on fantasy hill
Spin round, round in a circle
Flash! paddles sending a spray to the air
Lately, my thoughts are still
With you there as you spin round,
Round in a boyhood daydream
Spin round

My thoughts are drifting to a quieter time
(Spin round, round in a circle)
Green covered slippery water-rocks I used to climb

John Oates,"He's the star on the stage, but he screams all night
'Cause he can't get to sleep at all
And his favorite book, by the T.V. Light
Can't stop this matinee, he's played it over and over

And he can't stop the music
Or remember the ending to his song
He played it much too long

All those hard earned words, that he's fought from his pen
Have been forgotten in some empty hall
And those wide eyed looks, on those wiped out faces
Make some dreams of their places over and over

And he can't stop the music
Or remember the ending to his song
He played it much too long

Wouldn't believe in years
If he told you what the papers use to say
But that was in his hey day

Get back in his prime he had the fans in line
You should have seen him then
Now look at him

His hair is getting thin
There's one last show before the glory ends
There in the wings, waits his only friend
The record that he's prayed to over and over

And he can't stop the music
Or remember the ending to his song
He played it much too long

Now, he can't stop the music, oh no

When I met you I should've been warned
Ooh I could see you change from day to day
But you kept me guessing
Playing for fun
What'll you do what would you say
Strange moods and jealous anger
A kind of passion that I can't explain
You're high strung, that's attraction
But your act is driving me away

Please don't make me play'em no

You gotta give me something to hold
That cute routine you got is wearing thin
So baby can you do it for yourself and for me
I don't wanna lose you, I want us to win

You're high strung that's a fact
But don't you let it drive me away

Afternoon in the homeroom, they're about to let you go
And the locker slam on the plan you had tonight
You've been messing around with your boyfriend, maybe better left alone
There's a wise guy that you know could put you right

In the lot, the boy that's idling by doesn't rev your heart
'Cause it's only lonely spots he shares with you
And the long halls and the gray walls are gonna split apart

What they need is adult education
go back to school, it's a bad situation (oh yeah, oh yeah)
What you want is an adult education

And the underclassmen are flashing hot and cool
but your girlfriends care about the watch you wear and talkin' about it

You're nothing but a number, number

And a lot of dedication
But you want a little night school
Maybe some of it will rub off on you

Trying to imitate their heroes
You make it with a false surrender
More memories you won't remember

I wonder what the junior wishes
That she could graduate to adult
That she could graduate to adult kisses

To fill the space inside of yourself
Money love or power
When you want to have the number one first run anyone
You're crazy 'til you own them

You ought to know better than that
The more that you buy the less you get back
It's a case of possession obsession
Gimme Gimme

The compulsion to count the percentage of time
Spent between two lovers
Can turn an hour into a crime
And all the good times suffer
Though you know it's only jealousy
You can't help but be
Haunted by your passion

The more that you take the less you give back
Just a taste of possession obsession
Brings a case of possession obsession

We had that adventure in our eyes
But something got away I guess
In the everyday of our lives
 
And I don't know what keeps us here
Let's disappear and start all over again
 
[Chorus]
We can run away
Baby come as you are
You can look at my heart
As your Getaway Car
We can drive all night
It'll be alright
Love can take us so far in my Getaway Car
 
All we need is the open road
More fuel for the fire inside us
Steer us onto lands unknown
We can leave this world behind us

My intuition's telling me so
Just the beginning
A seed you planted deep in my soul

And I never knew this love before
Didn't have a clue that there was more
So I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be
Going down with me, going up this street

No matter what it takes, no matter what they say
Gonna use my intuition
No matter how tough, I'm never givin' up
Gonna use my intuition

This voice inside me
Is screaming don't put fear in the way
Let your spirit guide me
Like a shining light that's calling my name

And I never knew one love so strong
Didn't have a clue where I belong
Now I'm like a kid in a candy store
Always wanting more, coming back for sure
And you gotta believe

No matter what it takes, no matter what they say
Gonna use my intuition
No matter how tough, I'm never givin' up
Gonna use my intuition

No matter what it takes, no matter what they say
Gonna use my intuition
No matter how tough, I'm never givin' up
Gonna use my intuition

I know we can make it
My intuition tells me
Ain't no one else for me
Ain't no one else, ain't no one else

I know we can make it
My intuition tells me
Don't tell me no, don't tell me no
Don't tell me no, baby

I know we can make it

Never knew where I belong
I'll never give it up, give it up
Oh, I'll never give it up

Show me your heart
'Cause I will always be here by your side
Don't be mistaken there's still some work to do
Gotta get up every single day

Face the judge and jury
No one will notice they've got their own lives
We've got something they all want
It'll be their surprise

And if you think there is no place to run
Just hold onto my hand
And face whatever comes

One more chance to find the higher ground
One more chance before the curtain's down
One more night to turn your life around again

But we're gonna make it

It set us back a thousand years

Let the truth and sun shine in
One day, one day, one day you'll understand
You'll grow up and you'll see
There's a truth between friends and enemies

And I should have listened to my intuition of the way
When your moves and your moods were saying
They were sayin' no more, no more, no more, no more
Can't stick around until you take me down
And I'm alone and dealing
With the confusion that I'm feeling

I made the greatest mistake of my life
When I let you get away baby
And I, I made the greatest mistake
And still am, still am, still am

I can see clearly
That there's no love lost between us
Misguided, lost child I pray, I pray for you
I hope that your lies can keep you warm

Oh if I, I could rewind the time
And keep those records playin', playin', playin'
I say play on, play on, play on, play on
About the love we never left behind
Forget about the broken hearted
We got to pick up where we started

I made the greatest mistake of my life
When I let you get away baby
And I, I made the greatest mistake
And still am, still am, still am

Wish I read the writing on the wall we made around us now baby
Mistakes can turn your world go round and build it up and tear it down baby

I made the greatest mistake of my life
When I let you get away baby
I made the greatest mistake of my life
Make the greatest mistake
And it's still there, still there, still there

I made the greatest mistake of my life
I never should have let you get away baby

Make the greatest mistake
And you're the real thing, the real thing

Still am

Everybody's trying to tell me what's right for me

I'm worn as her tooth brush hanging in the stand 
My face ain't looking any younger 
Now I can see love's taken her toll on me 

She's Gone 
Think I'll spend eternity in the city 
Let the carbon and monoxide choke my thoughts away 
And pretty bodies help dissolve the memories 
But they can never be what she was to me

He keeps sending me angels to teach me to fly
He keeps sending me angels so sweet and true
Sending me angels just like you

As I stand on this mountain face to the wind
Amazed by the number of times we've all sinned
And the countless enemies that should've been friends, oh
Hero he comes again he keeps sending me angels
Here they come a flying

He keeps sending me angels to keep me from crying
He keeps sending me angels so I'll never be blue

Sipping imaginary cola and drawing faces in the tabletop dust

He was the dishwasher, busy in the back, his hands covered with
Gravy
Hair black and wavy
Brilliantine slick, a pot - cleaning dandy,
He was young and randy

Day to day, to day... today
Then they were old, their lives wasted away
Month to month, year to year
They all run together
Time measured by the peeling of paint on the luncheonette wall

Barefoot blues watch and wait till supper time

Static lightning sky daring me to take a chance

You and I have separate lives girl
You and I go different ways on roads that cross
When love and loss is ruled by fate
People have a tragic habit
Of letting love get in the way
They tend to lose their overviews and overplay

Something I wanna say
Something I've got to do
Feels like you're drifting away
And I don't wanna lose you

I'll try to find a way to encourage you
It's easy to convince myself
Cause I can't believe you'd wanna be with somebody else
People have a tragic habit
Of letting love get in the way
They tend to lose their overviews and overplay

Something I wanna say
Something I've got to do
Feels like you're drifting away
And I don't wanna lose you

And what did I do? I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And then I peeped through the crack
And looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do? I thought about you",I Thought About You,1986
John Oddo,"Imagination is funny
It makes the cloudy day sunny
Makes the bee think of honey
Just as I think of you

Imagination is crazy
Your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy
What to do, what to do

Have you ever felt the gentle touch
And then a kiss, and then, and then
Find it's only your imagination again
Oh, well

Imagination is silly
You go around willy-nilly
For example, I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too

So what happens now

Where am I going to

Time and time again

That I'm immune to gloom
That I'm hard through and through

But every time it matters
All my words desert me
So anyone can hurt me
And they do

So what happens now

So what happens now
(Take your picture off another wall)
Where am I going to
(You'll get by you always have before)
Where am I going to

Call in three months time
And I'll be fine I know
Well maybe not that fine
But I'll survive anyhow

I won't recall the names and places
Of the sad occasions
But that's no consolation
Here and now

A rich beautiful thing of all the talents, a cross between 
A fantasy of the bedroom and a saint 
You were just a back street girl 
Hustling and fighting 
Scratching and biting 
High flying, adored, did you believe in your wildest moments 
All this would be yours, that you'd become the lady of them all? 
Were there stars in your eyes when you crawled in at night 
From the bars, from the sidewalks
From the gutter theatrical? 
Don't look down, it's a long, long way to fall
High flying, adored, what happens now, where do you go from here? 
For someone on top of the world, the view is not exactly clear 
A shame you did it all at twenty-six
There are no mysteries now 
Nothing can thrill you 
No-one fulfill you 
High flying, adored, I hope you come to terms with boredom 
So famous, so easily, so soon, is not the wisest thing to be
You won't care if they love you, it's been done before 
You'll despair if they hate you 
You'll be drained of all energy 
All the young who've made it would agree 

High flying, adored, that's good to hear, but unimportant 
My story's quite usual, local girl makes good, weds famous man

John Owen Edwards,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory [From Cats],2004

Stayed beneath my feet before.

In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,

And when I was twelve years old
My daddy took me to the circus
The greatest show on earth
And there were clowns 
And elephants
Dancing bears,
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads
And as I sat there watching
I had the feeling that something was missing
I don't know what
But when it was all over
I said to myself
Is that all there is to the circus

Is that all there is?
If that's all there is, my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is

And then I fell in love
With the most wonderful boy in the world
We'd take long walks down by the river
Or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes
We were so very much in love
And then one day
He went away
And I'd thought I'd die
But I didn't
And when I didn't 
I said to myself
Is that all there is to love

Is that all there is?
If that's all there is, my friends, then let's keep

I know what you must be saying to yourselves
If that's the way she feels about it
Then why doesn't she just end it all
Oh no. not me. I'm not ready for the final disappointment
Cause I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you
That when that final moment comes
And I'm breathing my last breath
I know what I'll be saying to myself
Is that all there is?

Is that all there is?
If that's all there is, my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is",Is That All There Is?,1996
John Parish,"My naked cousin.
I see him running
All over headland,
Scared as his shit as he's running.

His naked skin fries,
Fries in the sun, oh my.
My naked cousin can cook till he's good,
Good and done.
I hate his smell and I hate his company.
But, but most of all I hate that he looks just, just like me.
His naked skin fries,
Fries in the sun, my, my.
But my naked cousin can cook till he's
Good and done.
He's running.
He run from burning bushes.
He run from bank of senate.
He run from everything that upsets his master plan.
And if he flips.
And I am as good as done.
My, my naked cousin.
He'll just keep, keep a running.
He's running...
Running naked through the trees,
Scared the shit right out of me.
Bought my ticket, take my ride,
Take me to the sunny side.
Running naked through the trees,
Scared the shit right out of me.
Bought my ticket, take my ride.
Begging all to.
Please.

John Parish,"And I remember everything
Sunrise on a blue horizon
You, your hand in mine
I remember the things you said

Said, ""I'll be a lady, wait through it all,
Be there to catch you, after the fall
Run through the red light, out of my hair
Run from the darkness into the dare

And I dream of running
And in the dream I, myself could run
And I feel the ground beneath my feet
And I move like music, 
You move me, like music

Head out of my way
Head out to red light
""Hold on"" the dream says
Head out of my life
You said ""I'd be there""

Now I'm treading very carefully
And I hope that I don't scream
And I hope that I don't fall
Off your bridge, crossing over
Sunny mountain, swollen riverfall

You said ""I'd be there""
You said ""I'd be there""
Through it all

Head out of my way
Head of to red light
""Hold on"" the dream says
Head out of my life

All over my way
Head out to red light
""Hold on"" the dream says
Head out of my life
You said ""I'd be there""",City of No Sun,1996
John Parish,"Words leave my heart dry
Words can't save life
Love has no place here
No joy, no tears

Darling, time's changed
Time leaves, time fades
Please see through my eyes
Save your tears for the next who dies

I shout but he don't hear
I put down on a page
Darling spare me your tears
Just send me the light of day

I shout but he don't hear
Just put down on the page
Darling spare me your tears
