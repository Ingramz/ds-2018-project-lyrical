Wiz Khalifa,"Yeah, it's Young, ya know?
Crack that shit down, roll that shit up, light that shit, pass it
Nah, fuck that, face this one, yeah, this for all my true weed smokers
Yeah, nigga ask me what's wrong with me

I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)
Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)
Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low

I said I'm gone, off that pound of dank
Ridin' in my ride, so blowed, don't know how to think
But I'm stayin' high

I'ma roll me a nice, long Swisher, filled with light green
Oh, I think they like me, let me get a light, B (and then I'm gone)
Off that Cali bud, what the fuck you chokin' on?

Mr. Bud by the Zone, O's like Omarion
And we ain't tuckin' nothin' cousin, what's the hold up?
Keep 'em comin' back to back to back, we roll up ('til it's all gone)

Get a pound, break it down, I ain't stingy, it's enough to go around
And I'm blazin' right now, niggas tellin' me to hold on
Crank it, twist it, light it, take a pull, and hold on (and then, I'm gone)

I gotta have it, gotta have it, that's unheard about
Rollin' up another blunt, before I put the first one out
My eyes low, have me chiefin' 'til I choke
Niggas askin' me what's wrong,
Blew some smoke up out my nose, and said I'm gone

I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)
Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)
Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low

I said I'm gone, off that brownish drank
Niggas know how I roll, it look like my eyes closed
Hennesey and Hydro, rhyme slow

Nigga, I'm on a different type of a vibe
This a different type of weed,
And I'm a different type a high (my nigga, I'm gone)
To a place that you probably never been in life

Smokin' Purple Kryptonite, make sure you curl that Swisher right
'Cause I ain't tryna have this home-grown runnin',
Homie thinkin' he gon' smoke for free,
I duck 'em, roll somethin' (then, I'm gone)

In my ride, doin' 80 in a 45 Zone, half a zone
Got me blown, I get more than high

Fresh off of the plane
Head straight into my hotel
Weed man in every city, yeah I smoke well (even when I'm gone)

I ain't the only one, all my niggas puff pounds
Swingin' blunts 'round, sun up 'till sun down
My eyes low, and my words are getting slow
Niggas askin' me whats wrong,
I blew some smoke up out my nose, and said I'm gone

I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)
Purple, purple in my pocket, and my jeans sag low
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank (that sticky, that icky)

Wiz Khalifa,"[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, We gettin paid so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissing my girl with both eyes closed
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me, now I'm

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And the same ones that I ride with
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with
If you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crown with
My new broad, thats a fine chick
And the wonder squad, I'm down with
Ain't no way around it
What you say, tell me what you say
Working hard, reppin for my dogs, do this every day
Takin' off, looking out for all, makin sure we ball
Like the mob all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(I ride or die for love)
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin like a killer inside
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin with the plug so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin off set
I look better on your girl than her outfit

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin out on anybody who try to say some one thing about it
Got a problem, I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plently clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars dont even lose control

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]",I Own It!,2007
Wiz Khalifa,"It's a new year, new day, 
The hardest regardless of what you dudes say truthfully
Who we glue to me, money talks was taught to speak fluently
Its nothin' new to me, sometimes it takes three blunts to get through to me
It only took me months to get through the streets, 
But when you got beats and your lyrics are dumb hard, 
Nobody gotta let you in the game you just bombard
Yeah but niggas are gon hate though, 
No matter who you are there's another wantin' your place bro
Mind on cash roll the grass and fade slow, learn fast to ?
A look past the love some niggas aint sure, 
Made me my own man now I do my grown man
More advanced a young'n nearly in the game, 
Shit lookin' better now but I remember the rain

Rain,
I still remember the rain
I still remember the rain 
I still remember the rain 
I still remember the rain 
I still remember

Feelin' slept on knowin' I'm the best 
Songwriter or freestyle ill bite a niggas head off
The flow was ill before I inked the deal I signed 
'cause a flow like mine needs a mill
I grind for real and that's no days off 
You work hard for it and its gon pay off
You can rap you can work a j-o-b or duckin' 
The policeman cars tryna pump weight off
See I was taught to get it how you live 
Niggas know wiz' has been about his bread
In the ? I'm a beast I can speak to em all day 
In high school have what u need in the hallways
Stuff long benches with raw haze attention is nothing 
New its true I've been that nigga always
So what you sayin'
Remain the same with fame I gained its good now 
But I remember the rain

Rain, 
I still remember the rain
I still remember the rain 
I still remember the rain 
I still remember the rain

Half ounce what I got to smoke up in some days

If I'm in here I gotta smoke somethin' nigga

Crack a swishy if I'm rollin' up that good
And we roll it by the O, yeah I know you wish you could

Niggas know about what young Khalifa into
Love to smoke out, a lot of reefer in him
Get you skunked out, you know I'm street official
When boys gotta problem, you should keep your issue
I'm from Pistolvania, where them heaters hit you
Out in California, where the weed official
And you could tell that I'm a boss
Don't really gotta tell you that I'm smokin good,
You smell it through the wall

Crack a swishy if I'm rollin' up that good
And we roll it by the O, yeah I know you wish you could
Ain't nothin' funny gettin' money like I should

You see I'm here now, that's right you not the man
They say I spit coke, supply the block with grams
And I ain't with waiting, I'm taking lots of grands
'Cause I ain't got patience, I'm not a doctor fam
My niggas get it crunk, chump rep what side you from
Smokin' somethin nigga, light your blunt
Ain't got your gun, you better find you one (why?)
'Cause this is Pistolvania, where them apes crawl
Bunch of shorties on the the corner, pocket full of 8 ball
And you never gonna see one of my niggas sleep until they cake long
Aye whatchu mean man? Something like the Great Wall
As far as rap go, yeah its in the bag
Of course the haters wanna do me bad
Probably mad 'cause of the shit I have
I never let 'em slow me down dawg I'm living fast
Niggas on swole 'cause they chick wanna get with the youngin' that's all about makin' this cash

You niggas mad at me, this cash I have to see
And you chumps can amount out for them ones
And I'm 'bout done with you punks and you clowns wanting to come for the crown
I hear a lot of talk, I gotta let 'em know
I put the business on a nigga, really thinking or be feeling that he wanna come and test the flow
'Cause I'm not for the game, ahk you will not do a thing
See I was smart you gotta walk it to talk if you sane
And its 4-1-2 'til I fall to the grave
They don't know what to do with the boy to this day
'Cause I'm always pimpin' if I put my voice on track the whole world gon' listen
Some niggas player hate but you can say I get away with murder like OJ Simpson
I'm into all day grinding, don't nothing come easy, I'm puttin' the time in

Wit no metal to waist
I flow great
And that'll level ya face
But I'll still let a nigga have it
You talk greasy but you still a fagot
I front on cowards cause you niggas backwards
I got my money right
Game on top
And it's been said that I'm the key to put this game on lock
I'm from the city
Of the triflin' hoods
But when you see me
Gotta smile on my face
Nothin' sweet, it's just that life is good
Yea, I dodged the hood
Slums came up out that
Rap game about that
To gain pay wit out crack
See Imma youngin' wit' too much on my plate
To let some small change have a youngin' dumped in a cage
I seen niggas make sells
Niggas get knocked and make bail
And take lives, they worries ain't jail
Wit no regards for life cause they livin' ain't well
Who gotta make it to heaven cause they livin' in hell
But me I don't do much just keep to myself
And stop these cock-suckin' motha-fuckas seekin' my wealth
I was told the world's cold but I see for my self
And I'm too hot to take the back seat or the shelf
So I'm here
For sum reason though they hate it to death
The love's gone only hatred is left
Only achin' and stress
A king not be mistaken for less
And this here is for the taking
This is history in the making

Where I'm from it's kinda hard to trust
Cause the hate's from most of your own people
They're fake and they're all see through
Hate to see a nigga when he's stackin' his bucks
Rather him be down in the dumps
And out on his luck
But I'll be damned if my grind stop
My mind tickin' like the time watch
And I'm gon be spittin' 'till the time's not
Presently there
I touch minds everywhere
And I'll ride hopin' heaven is near
See the pain in your eyes young wit every stare
I seek peace, but these streets will never be fair
Cause somebody went and took Greg's life
Son reached
Deceased
No time to blink or think twice damn
Wonder when it gonna be my time
To meet death
I'm stressed need to ease my mind
And unless one of y'all try to see whats mine
Then I'll eat through your flesh, bones and leave that spine
U see I did the right thing
I stayed up out the gun and knife game
I knew about the pain it might bring
And we all got problems
I chose to smoke blunts just to drown 'em
The top, but I rose from the bottom
And I'm here now
Ain't no body harming young
My screw's loose they say somethings wrong wit young
Ya time's up I'm just warning young
Cause this here's for the taking,
This is history in the making",History in the Making,2007

Ain't nothin' change, this is what the game told me

Listen close here youngin'
See Ive been doing this here the most fed coming chea
And not a dude that a post here frontin'
See niggas pay attention to mine
You listen and find, you gone hear something
I know
Niggas wanna know how I came up
He only eighteen, they see him stacking his change up
And a lot of niggas chose to get in the game
But difference from you damn pricks
The prince was hand picked
The young guy is about as fly as it can get
They want I, cause I supply and demand quick
I'm C-4 explosive is how ya man spit
And I got a seat for anyone who can't stand it
I ain't chose the game, the game chose me
A lil' fame from the rap, but still the same O.G.
Cause when I came in it, cats said I stayed lowkey
But always making sure they know me
That's when the game told me

I oh, I choose you baby
See I ain't choose the game, the game choose me
A lil' fame, but still the same O.G.
That when the game told me

Cause when I came in it, cats said I stayed low key
But always making sure they know me,
That's when the game told me

And you know
I cant get enough, its like I got a fetish for it
Too many wack MC's for me to just ignore it
I get on track simply to flood the state with heat
Stack my cake and eat, preaching more then they the streets
Seen them teens drop out the bumping the corner
Money and order, so they dont even want their diploma
Me, I'm tryna make a company owner
So while that may be tempting, this rap shit is bringing the ends in
And some say that (what?) there will be no one greater than him
One day that (what?) non believers, I'll convince em
I'm more of a leader and eating like I'm supposed to
Talk by the older dude, stand on my own two (yes)
And I'm deep in the game, not like I toasted be
I get somewhere if a lane, they took over me
Somewhere down the line, the grind molded me
Its so sick and this what the game told to me

I oh, I choose you baby
That's what the game told me
Ain't nothin' change, still the same man
The game chose me, sing
Oh, I choose you baby
You know the game chose me
Ain't nothin' change, this is what the game told me

Now I'ma take you back to ninety seven
I put in work to grind better
I was now with a rhyme fetish
Aged quicker, and seeing things in a different way
Was fourteen when I figured I had some shit to say
So I let it be known
That the tighter with top spitter
I'm coming for em, ready to own
And if somebody better let em be shown
I'm a competitive dude, plus I'm ten steps ahead of you fools, they say

I oh, I choose you baby
See I ain't choose the game, the game choose me
A lil' fame, but still the same O.G.
That when the game told me
Oh, I choose you baby
Cause when I came in it, cats said I stayed low key
But always making sure they know me,
That's when the game told me",I Choose You,2007

I move with dudes that be dishing weight smooth with
The uz' that will hit your face came in the game 
And I'm changing the game with a flow that will
Run around the crews the hate this guy is a pimp 
And you know his fan I don't hold the grams
I'm a colder man and I do it for the youngers 
And the older fans niggas whippin' in the kitchen
Tryin' to hold there grams I don't play around
Lay 'em down for the lil' homie wanna play the clown
I'm casing pounds spraying rounds follow the Khalifa 
'Cause it's going down money in the rubber band
Slang crack rock try and find the man in the flat top 
Ask anyone in the streets everyone around
Knows where he beast and I'm killing the beef 
You can chill in the team but a steel of at least
I'm up in your brain you better be taking the lord 
You better be keeping your chain see this guy
Here is a nousense you talk fire and you can't prove it 
You just lie up in your music send my guys
To come and shoot shit duke I ride 
And this is true as you would die if niggas pulling I don't
Know what you fucking see 
When you know as well you've been fucking me.

Cause I'm moving with a gang of I'll guys 
Looking like the last of the day 
But why you say 
'cause my nigga I could die today lock down 
And never see the light
Of day kidnapped trapped in a hide away 
So I never get the cat to ride away fire inside of
May the kid move with da fools 
That try to take the game back to the rhyming days payback
For the fact that your guys a fake 
And I can't even believe you can spit shit to the people
Like it. chips and just leaves you 
With kids that leaves you see through you pricks
Hand my shit an overdose so you wrote 
And sold some coke move some crack how true is that
Front on my cats and you'll lose shit back haters 
Get back when I'm through with rap
And I'm feeling my tracks with truth 
And fact kill em on wax and I'm moving cats
When they crew in all black yeah I'm doing that 
I gotta flavor that will flow and taste
And I'm doing it till I'm blue in the face

Got my picture on the wall from when I popped in the news

Lot a chicks thought I was nothin'
All of a sudden, wanting me know
Doing research and hunting me down
But never mind the stuntin'
Trying to see what's on your mind and something
Got a place to unwind, it's nothing

Never see myself loving a chick, you might change that
And if not, I'm happy being the same cat you
Think it's a shame that, that's how it has to be
But you with another dude, that'd be sad to see
You still mad at me, some high school tragedy
Seeing how I played your home girl who had it bad for me
I'm like whoa, slow down baby, and
Kick it with your man itta go down crazy
I wanna get to know ya

Drop the top, let your hair go, free in the wind
Now we can go and get a room on the other side of town

Grind to get my paper up
In the studio writin' rhymes til the paper crunch
I'm not the type that you would call em a thug
But I'm a hustler its all in my blood
So if its all for the cheese then I'm in it
My screws kinda loose so I ease to the finish
I hop up in the coupe feel the breeze while I'm in it
Blowin' smoke up out the roof from the trees that I'm spliffin'

Lovin' this shit, come fuck with the prince,

Gats spot, you cats shot, but not from cameras,
Back glock, cause snap shots'll stop your plan up,
Stuck in my ways, the haze taste like Tropicana,
Thinkin' the days of way back, people will say that,

Now the people listenin' play back, I got it made
Obligated to gettin' passin' grades and blaze tracks,
You'll be amazed at how I make units move
Self-made, twelfth grade, boy I'll take you to school
I'm through the streets of pistolvania where my goonies move,

And you know that this your chance, don't blow it like birthday candles

Dare a nigga try and take it

Just from blocking out you haters

Swear they're in my way

If a nigga act stupid
I'ma let him get his issue

Everything designer
And my back seat's reclining
Got a thing for looking good
And blowing money like it's tissue

But niggas see you eating
Get to starving for a plate
Well, you don't give it when they hate
That's why my niggas keep a biscuit

It's no gimmick
I talk it how I live it
So when a nigga cross the finish
Gotta push it to the limit

Got a mom and little sister
I plan on taking care of
Lost my uncle this year
Couple niggas in the system

So I roll
No telling where I'm landing
But I know something
That I'm going towards the money

Going hard is not an option

Now these niggas acting jealous
'Cause they feel like they ain't shining
And they little shit stop
When it's big shit popping

?
Gotta keep it in my system
60 box of Cigarellos
'Cause I blow it by the onion

Pack up some dollar bills
Send some paper to my younging
'Cause he just like Steve Francis
He be playing with them rockets

Whipping on the wheel
Got my peddle to the medal
'Bout to hit another city
Ain't no point of getting settled

Straight onto the plane
Ain't been home in so long
You think it's my cologne
But it's money that you smelling

Eyes like my father
Can't stand my older brother
Got some niggas doing years
'Cause of funny niggas telling

Nigga, I'ma be grinding
Till the day that I expire
I've been running through the batch
Till I'm the last man standing

Her friends don't even smoke, but they diggin' the smell
Ex-boyfriend ringin' ya cell
But every effort to save you's to no avail
Nothin' but starter's on my team nigga coach fail
And all we do is get high and watch the dough swim
Relatively fly like a meteor or spaceship
Party every night, and early morning get wasted
All the way 100 you others niggas are make-shift
Roll that rapper weed, you smoke and don't wanna taste it, lets face it
She wanna fly where the planes is
Got her testin' out all of my trees, mint-flavors
She ? the paper

[Chorus: x2]

We stay smokin' that la-la-la
Easy rider, joint roller, my 9-5
You can prolly smell it in the car when we ridin' by
More like all the way up, we ain't kinda high
We more than fly, introduce you to the gang members
That's Taylor, like blood, no gang members
No names enter, and now you on champagne land
I'm on an island of hard liquor
It be fans, joint lit, and guitar pickers
Goin' nowhere for awhile, I got good snickers
Now you wanna mingle, heard young single
Big face chips baby, stack my Pringles
You call it tight, I say well-fit
And we ain't takin' no prisoners, now you jealous
In ya state please make sure the weed great
Fresh produce, purple and green crates
Groove, crisp bills in my jean pants
Telly room prolly doin' the Uncle Snoop dance, yea

I could hit you with that baseline

I'll have you sounding good

Beating in your drum

From the front look in your eyes
Then I turn you like some pables
No you fiendin' for this (loving)
That's what you gon' get
And I cant sing,but I see you
And know I'm gon' hit, yea

Worry about the beat later
Heard you be going off that head
You don't need paper
Play you an e-major, a-minor
Girl your rhythm straight
And I say you got great timing
Feel your heart rate climbing
Like when my speakers quake
More than a qruayer straight
You got that 8-o-a
You say you cant

Deal or No Deal

You know
I'm
Screaming fuck them niggas who hated, I'm money affiliated
Speculating me landing, must have got me mistaken with lame niggas
Know you gone get high as fuck as long as the planes with you
Left that major situation alone and became richer
People talking down but see me I'm the same nigga
Leave your bitch around we gone drink the champagne with her
We don't touch the ground, see a cloud with my name it
Only ez-widers, please no cigars for me and my gang
Fool, I'm a legend in these streets 'cause how I do my thang
And don't wear the fitted, I got the city on my chain
Oh man, still they hate and talk smack, knowing if I was gone
There'd be no throne to throw your rocks at
Cruise at maximum altitudes I'm tryna top that
So in touch with the real them suckas tryna stop that
But I, live or let die, party get high
And tell them lames to deplane or let fly

Don't know what they hatin' for, I'm just gettin' my paper
Well, maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone
I don't wanna leave, but I need to, it's such a shame

Got one foot on the gas, there's never a need for brakes
Smoke ez-wider's with hash, fuck bitches from out of state
Valet bringing my cars, a waiter to bring me plates
Shrimp and fillet Mignon, we celebrate buying drinks
With a couple of broads, my nigga's and who got love for me
It's lonely at the top, I'm tired of having company
Uh, so while you busy trying to fit in, I'mma stand out
And view my life through this lens to see how it pans out
Substitute teacher ass niggas, need a handout
Middle finger screaming fuck them niggas who hated, I'm money affiliated
Pop another bottle, that chronic smoke integrated
Speculating me landing must've got me mistaken
I'm speaking as the captain of the plane
You'se a runner on the jet way

Got some friends that playing football
And some friends that playing cricket
And a mistress that is fine like a fucking parking ticket
Ha ha
I said I'm in it, I'm in it til the finish
I keep them bottles coming til there ain't nothing in it

We gon' keep it coming till I no speaka no English

But now you're gone
And I'm forced to deal with your absence
All alone in this madness
All alone on my mattress
Don't know how the hell did this happen
You knew loving me was a hazard
Outcome of my actions
I wish we could go backwards
Go back a couple chapters
Back when there was laughter
Back when we first met
Before we came such a disaster
Before your heart got shattered
Before I forgot how much you mattered
Crazy we don't realize what we have until after
We no longer have her
Uh eh

Don't you ever leave
Don't you ever go away

Can't take no more
You know the game
And tried to play it time and time before
Told me you don't got time to waste so hey you gotta go
You gotta go
Can't help but think of you when I'm alone
Try and fell I call your cell
You don't pick up your phone
Guess that really means
You mean just what you said said just what you mean
Getting all this bread but it don't mean shit
Fuck the dough I get plus the dough I spend
Darling just,
Don't you ever leave
Don't you ever go away
And throw it away

There's a raincloud above my heart
And it's only because of you
I knew it from the very start
Running out of complaints
No no and the least of my problems today but,
(I'm running, I'm gone)
Looking at my heart I'll give it away babe
And I'm a honor and cherish our play time

So we ride and we smoke til we can't anymore
And keep floatin'
Pass it to your man, roll another one and (keep floatin')
When it's almost done
Why don't you go and break down enough for another one
And roll me some

Hey, then you can pass that, the kid who rock a snap back
Steady blow this hash back until my thoughts are abstract
How to get by, that's how we livin' in this day and age
I bring some color to a world that's filled with shades of gray
Throwin' this cake away to blaze and sip some Tanqueray
Remember spectatin' til they picked the kid to play the game
Now I'm an all-star, blasted out the ballpark
In my Lamborghini speedin', you a golf cart
California dreams, Amsterdam reality
Life ain't what it seems, these the thoughts that weed pull outta me
Blow through a thousand trees, the whole entire crowd get skeed
Livin' in what seems to be fiction, I'm on a balcony
I light one up, this for those who ever doubted me
Then light another, this for those who hold it down for me
Passin' around the weed, no problems at all
And you haters keep on hatin', I ain't talkin' to y'all

So much smoke we got the words high wrote in the song
Girl I try to come and make you smile, I'm gone so will you wait a while
As soon as I come home we gon' smoke and then I'll stay a while
Some people hate my style, some people love it though
And all these kids who wanna clone me, they ain't comin' close
Politicin' joints, we countin' none of your votes
I'm gettin' everybody high so you can puff on ya roach
Shorty used to all these players, tell her fuck with a coach
I just want you to come over, roll me somethin' to smoke
Hey my mind be cookin' rhymes up, live until my times up
Hate me then they love me, tell them try to make they minds up
Barbers and they line me up, ID was on the beat
It's best to shout the people out that help you get your cheese
Smokin' weed, we got no problems at all
All you haters keep on hatin', I ain't talkin' to y'all

Got no problems, my weed lit, got nowhere to go

Wiz Khalifa,"I wake up early in the morning and it feels so good
Smoking on some shit that you wish you could
Jealousy, envy please don't feel bad
This weed is mine get your own bag
A sack full of OG under lock and key
None for the homies this is all for me
Got a blunt looking like a Kelly palm tree
Police roll by I got nothing on me
'Cause the smoke's already in the air
I am looked up with two braids in my hair
All start with the kaki suit
I'm gonna fuck around and take it back to classic Snoop
On the east side standing on the D-I-P
Back then my only wed was my E-Y-E
Use my P-Y-T and you're looking so fine
I am sorry baby girl but tonight

Back to the episode sacks full of chronic 
Out of this world, Cooper Black's on the comic
This is church music listen to the choir
To burn my kush you must use fire
D-O, double G like never heard before
Smoking that bomb like THC4
West coast worldwide, sea shore to sea shore
When's the last time you seen the G in the G4
Don't worry I'll wait
Time's ticking I'm tripping
I'm slipping, I'll wait
Into the zone where these hoes hold my dog bones
I dog whistle and they download my ring tone
And she's so hypnotized by this pimp's poem
What I got here is mine go and get your own
I put peace to rhymes get piece of mind
O-Z to die 'cause this weed is mine

[Chorus]

I hear niggas talking about what they rollin' up
Smell what I smoke 'fore the back open up
Good chance you can see me there, I'm smoking one
License to get a fundamental road of shit
Real nigger blowing weed for hours, rolled it up
If I am in a building it's hard not to notice it
Hitta Billy said, ""Dogg I got some hoes to fuck""
I am gonna fuck you with an ounce of that potent shit
Don't trip bitch we gonna all sip, blow the hoes dip
Let you have mine plus you supplyin' your own little bit
My nigger get high and let the hoes twist
Say you don't fuck with twist look how you rolled it
They ain't smoking like 'cause I'm rollin' enough paper 
They've be burning for hours
And if it's fire I am smocking the whole thing inside

I got a roll for you
Do you wanna smoke with me
I wanna smoke with you
Do you wanna smoke with me

I got a roll for you

You know a nigga don't wanna go to school today
Let me call this bitch, and get my shit together

We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us

Uh, this one's for the G's, all black chucks on the cuffs of my jeans
King size papes stuffed full of trees,
I be with the boss dog, y'all fuck niggas fleas
Now they say I'm hot hundred something degrees
Taking pictures with a young nigga, cheese
Remember days homie, I ain't have a thing
Now I'm hoping off a plane putting roaches on the wing
And my hoes like queens, but we smoke like kings
Jewelry froze like bling
Money comes fast yours slow like ?
Rolling up grass, so weed to have to style, so I know I'm gonna pass
Third period, showing up last
With a late note blowin' green smoke

When I pull up people so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy

Keep stunting just cause I can

Wiz say Dogg put the middle of the jay
Hey, why not? Not why?
We fly, we ride, she high, he high, we high
Fuck it, everybody to the library
Got a new batch, some blue, booberry
Stuck in the hallway, with a pass, say dog he just smoke all day
It's a mind game, like the ream I seem to keep migraines
Richie Valens ?
I'm so lifted, like a parachuter
My grass day off day off like Ferris Bueller
Slip away, dip away, almost had to throw a wholezip away
But fuck that, this the Taylor gang, what you on dog
Shit I'm on everythang

I said you niggas never have and you never will
You niggas never have and never will
You niggas never have and never will
Big Snoop and young Wiz smokin' kill kill kill kill
You niggas still in junior high-school, elementary ass niggas
Holler at me when you graduate
We'll be posted right by the four hundred building,
Room four twenty, follow your nose

Roll up so we can all

Killer Cali is what we blow 
OG nigga from way down low 
Known for banging the blue C rag 
Started off smoking nothing but Zags 
Popping P's, chopping trees 
501's, all of these 
All y'all invited, ignite it, light it, now follow me 
Laid out, plush couch, flat screen television 
Table full of vegetation so you just might stun a nigga 
That's what it is, that's what it's gon' be 
East Side Long Beach where I'm from 
Bring your girls, all y'all come 
Give me some, now give her some 
It's big Mac, I love to have fun 
You are, you are the one 
If you get it or do it, then it'll be just like 2 on 1 
Break it down, lay it down 
Baby work that body like 
At the pad, acting bad 
Baby what that party like? 
Moving so schizophrenic 
Baby pull down your panties 
Let the Doggy Dog ram it 
I cram to undertsand it 
Back room that's my bedroom 
Make her right up in it 
Close the door, slow ?
I'm 'bout to slide up in it 
Smoke something 

[Chorus: x2]

Having money and blowing hella' chronic 
Smoke I'm stunting 
Cutlass on them chrome spokes with the engine running 
Sounding like a dinosaur if the stomach rumbling 
Your bitch at the window cause she know I'm coming 
She tell you that she 'bout to go jogging and on the corner 
She jump in, take her to the honeycomb 
Stuffing kush ?, playing Megaman 3 
Your Wonderwoman giving dome out Miami 
Said she never leave me 'lone, She wan' have a family 
She just high, tomorrow night, she'll be titties out, dancing 
Trying to leave with the next nigga in a Aston 
So why get caught up 
I'm too swift up on my toes to have my name brought up 
In sewing circles with them hoes 
I rather be a straight G rolling up a whole 
O-Z of that OG have them KO'ed

Wiz Khalifa,"Bet you get high but I ain’t smoking with the rest though
Cause if it’s in my joint, believe that it’s the best smoke
I’m talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one bit will burn your chest, though

Cut those cameras on cause my camos on
And my niggas backin' me riding around town
With a big old bag of weed
Taylor Gang, we ain’t in your faculty
Me and Snoop Dogg, we created a masterpiece
Smoke all day and I'm makin' this cash, and we
Bout it bout it like Master P
Go hard, stack ya cheese, roll a joint, pass the trees
TGOD, he’s the OG, real G shit what it has to be
My real nigga gon' pop tags for me
Fake niggas gon' get bags for me
Say you just wanna shake hands with me?
Same fuck niggas used to laugh at me
Now I’m riding around town in the car that you can’t even pronounce
And you can’t go fast as me
Smoking marijuana, and she know that I’m a player
So she wanna come up here and spend this cash on me
That pimp shit come naturally
That fuck shit is whack to me
My kush grown organically
My ballin' is actually

Let me turn you on and turn you out
To make you feel like you really wanna feel
For real, sho will, nigga I got that kill
You know what I got Captain Crunch, soda pop
Light green kush cut from a bush
Mix it together, get it together
Hypo grow with the hydro flow
Smoking on some shit called I don’t know
This is the shit that was caught
From my niggas on the block with a .44 Glock, oh no!
Cuttin it up, button it up
Homie don’t speak at all
You might escape, you might be most likely like shark bait
I might hate, nigga you smoking that lightweight
Wrong class, featherweight, levitate
Set it straight, let me break it down for you
Clip it, zip it, let it fly
If it’s good, it’s gonna get you high
Drop it, stop it, that ain’t the one
We don’t even smoke that shit for fun!

Bet you get high but I ain’t smoking with the rest though
Cause if it’s in my joint, believe that it’s the best smoke

You like to smoke but you ain’t smokin' what we smokin' on
You like to smoke but you ain’t smokin' what we smokin' on

Yea nigga, I’m rolling up that high-grade
Chillin' on the porch, smoking like it’s Friday
Every day of the week to Juicy J’s a high day
Niggas think I’m Chinese cause my eyes straight
I threw up a six into a twenty ounce
Smoked a half ounce of kush, felt like twenty ounces
Fucked around and popped a molly now I’m high as fuck
Every Jacob seeing, Juicy screamin' out 'let’s fuck!'
I dun popped a pill and hit the lean behind it
Where my mind? Somebody help me find it
Got a black and white bitch, they my mixed bitch
They keep my double cup full, OG in my Swisher

Bet you get high but I ain’t smoking with the rest though

Smokin' tree and  not to mention hustlin' tryna mount my business

Yeah I hear what they sayin', just be too high to listen
Got my money trippin' if I even fold it wrong
You ain't smokin' this good, if it's fire I tell you I sold it all
Or wait 'til one of my hoes come 'round and roll it all
Or say fuck it, and cuff it till I roll with dog

And blow circles 'round you suckers like a marathon
My gym teacher told, but I didn't listen
My bitch did my homework, and now I'm in detention
It sure beats suspension, this is my audition
So play your position, get the picture I envision
Did she mention? Snoop Dogg was made for kissing
A barracuda fishin', she on a mission for me
Pleasure, pain, and glory, and my inventory
My SAT's, my lil' bitch she did 'em for me
And now we prancin' on stage at the talent show
We flossin' my clothes my chains and my knapsack
Full of that, hand me that, can't you see my telescope?
Principal said she wanna see me 'cause she smell my smoke
'Bout my money trippin' even if I fold it wrong
Blowin' zones with Wiz 'cause this is the protocol

Telling everyone you made it

There's nothing like my insulated walls around you
It’s so warm
Don’t you want to celebrate it
You can find me, somewhere in the middle of you
Somewhere in the middle of you
When I’m looking for the truth
I find it in the middle of you

You know I keep that weed lit
Met her once and let me hit
You asking for the remix, calling me cause this ain't what she want
She say, she need this, g-shit
Rolling Papers, told the neighbours
I be tryna keep you quiet, once we grown we sure to wake 'em
Roll this weed, before you leave, be sure to bake one
Got a man, but when he gone the boy replace him
Smoking OG Kush, that's Californication
On the phone you fussing, while we fornicating

Well, I'mma let you roll one
Let you light it
Nice car, let you drive it
Let you have the time of your life
Go on and get excited
Yup, all your friends invited
My jewellery the brightest
Loud weed, I’m smoking Leonidas
On my team, only cause we the tightest
Shopping spree’s, shit I should be your stylist
Them niggas try to beat
When you with me I pound it
Get you so high you gone need a pilot

Got you ready for the world to see it, all
3am in the morning, I’m the one you call
Got the car keys, pedal to the floor, I’m on my way flow
I ain't on no kid shit but I stay with some play dough
Keep it Taylored, everyday she notice that
Roll it up, light with my homies, sit and hold it in
That's a fact you chilling too much
You need excitement

I'm getting money, probably something you don't know about
I stunt hard, you would swear that I was showing out
Don't tell me get them, I got them and I'ma throw them out
And back door on these hoes that I was warning out
While I'm in this machine, convert the top
Tell them that the sky is the limit

Got your bitch panties Niagara falling
Dollars come like I fuck in the bank
I told them I could, they tell me I can't
They want me to trip when I'm ducking the paint

Shining hard, boy, these niggas got to see me

I did my thing and figured it out
Security trippin’ I ain’t puttin’ it out

And the niggas that’s next to me it’s all the niggas that stress with me
I done made it from the bottom and they say I did it on my own
So to me that’s destiny
If anybody got a problem I just tell ‘em to get on their grind
Try to to see as much checks as me
And my wife is a goddess my tree is the finest
A click full of real niggas that's just the one thing about us
They showin’ us love, but I remember back then the niggas would doubt us
We used to go out but now when we go out all the people surround us
They screaming my name, I’m repping my city it’s me who they proud of
So fuck what the lames about wouldn't me no game without us no game without us

Man I’m so blessed (I’m so blessed)
I got the Lord on my shoulders
I’m alright (I’m alright)
I’m alright (I’m alright)
Ain’t got no stress (Ain’t got no stress)
My people with me they celebratin’ the life
We livin’ life (We livin’ life)
Now sing it with me
If you’ve been working hard
If you believe in God
Sing it with me
Can nothing stop me now

Been hated on, I been doubted
Been talked about and mistreated
Still put in the work that I needed
Now I’m living the things that I’m dreaming
Got my mama straight and my daughter good
And my team right ’cause we eating
Been broke before and now its open doors
I got the dopest flow and they seen it
God keep away all them demons
Been patient dog I’ve been lenient
Been holding out I’ve been fiending
Long as God with me don’t need ‘em
When you winning everybody want a dap up
Gettin' money now your friends wanna act up
I don’t really give a fuck I’ma go hard
No stress, couple cars in the front yard
We the best be the logo, getting money with a mogul
Upgrade from the 2 to the 4 door
Top down so blast it, its yolo
One time form the XO
Ace Hood got these rap niggas petro
Fied No lie nigga day know
From the bottom to the top only Lord knows

Man I’m so blessed (I’m so blessed)
I got the Lord on my shoulders
I’m alright (I’m alright)
I’m alright (I’m alright)
Ain’t got no stress (Ain’t got no stress)
My people with me they celebratin’ the life
We livin’ life (We livin’ life)
Now sing it with me
If you’ve been working hard
If you believe in God
Sing it with me
Can nothing stop me now",I'm So Blessed,2012

Go girl, a go girl
A top notch thoroughbred, pro girl
She go-go live, she go-go silly
If I tell her bring it back, she'll go-go get it

An all night putting on a show girl
She go live, she go silly
If I tell her bring it back, she'll go-go get it

I got this girl that’s on some ?
She call and say she miss me
I tell her I’ma visit next time I’m in her city
I turn your world to Gotti World, shorty bring your ticket
Jimmy Choo and Red Bottoms, shorty we can kick it
I take her on trips, her boyfriend be tripping
Text her phone a million times, but she ain’t trying to hear it
Tattoos and piercings, Gucci shoes for chirren
Kids just as fresh as she be, She serious
All I do is ball, and all she fuck is winners
Take her to the mall, she don’t want to go to dinner
She a go girl, and I’m trying to get with her
Have you looking right, I had to follow her on Twitter
She’s a go girl

[Chorus]

Go, go, keep on going
I be somewhere throwing money, blowing on that potent
Money in my bank account, pockets hella swollen
And a model girlfriend, so for them cameras we be posing
We just go–go anywhere we wanna
Got a weed connect from Tennessee to California
Twenty grand in Pari, blowing on that Mary
Your bitch on my Johnson cause I’m balling like I’m Larry
And I play my part
I’m out here with them bosses, and she notice from the start
Get thirty K to show, so we both be going hard
Don’t smoke or roll the weed up
If she broke she get her cheese up
Ever slow, she’ll up the speed
Cause she a go girl

[Chorus]

OK now whoa there, keep going, throwing
That big booty, dong in
She wear her heart on her sleeve
Now she just Comme des Garconing
I wake up and show you what this cock-a-doodle-do in the morning
I swear that pussy so good, I wish I could clone it
Go girl, go girl
My new bitch, your old girl
She bust it open for my like a showgirl
Call me king, then tell me that it’s your world
Body Jamaican, but the vagina is Asian
I swear that’s hourglass shape and
That reminds me time wasting
Fuck around, I might taste it
And if I throw it back at her, then she probably gonna chase it
Because she’s a go girl

I know you see me with your looking ass

Did you understand I'm down to ride with my niggas
Just a double M, you can't fuck with them
Unless you're certified to ride with us
Keep the broads far up out my business and my mind following the ditches
And I ain't tripping off of potential, that's another word for ""ain't did shit""

See y'all niggas be some peons, talking about y'all be gone

I know why they trusting me, 'cause I got all these funds around 'em
My fan base consist of niggas with drugs around 'em
Educated sisters to bitches dancing with ones around 'em
I know you think all we do is have fun around here
But I'm from a city where young niggas carry guns
Don't single out any corner, its popping on every one
They talking bout what they gon do, its probably already done
I'm running through cake, running through states
Take your one to the face every one or two cakes
Just bought a new crib, that's a wonderful space
Ask me how I feel I got it so my nigga

I know you see me, yeah, I be putting on

I be cooler than a motherfucker
Wanna hit the fans, selling work on the Internet, call it Instagram
And you know I do it for my city, you know I'm putting on
Hundred racks on this clothes a nigga putting on
Self made, self paid, forty on my belt waist
Hundred round lobster feast, get a shell face
I be twisted off of molly doe, chopped bricks karate doe

My flows they verge in tide I do not give a fuck
It's about to jump tonight my crib is filling up
Is filling up, is filling up full of bitches I have never met
And they ain't left like these bitches here on house arrest

If it's shining then I'm near it
It's designer then I wear it, uh
Look at these diamonds spend some time on my appearance
You too busy saving hoes you ain't gonna find a dime on clearance
You know me bitch I get straight down to the point

We don't sleep until we get sick we gon' blaze till we get licked

My prediction came here tripping, you won't be living long
Wait, I said that wrong, now let's negotiate
I wait my banner a piece, won't you take the paper
Pussy nigga, you fake, can't wait for the face to face
Hit you with the cage, back in place
Rip another page off the book of life

Do you, do you?
Whatever the fuck you think you gotta do
Because when I bring it to the whole court
Putting up a play of stats
While you're hanging with the roaches and rats
We're way above that
Now how you're loving that?
Beat the breaks off the back of that bitch
I can't breathe, can't make it your bitch
Can't believe how deep in your shit

The greatest trip that devil ever put together
Was that self destruction is better than striving for perfection
I see the down could crawl, quickly spreading like gun infection
And miss it after live, use your common sense as a weapon
If you only knew half of this shit that I've been through
Shoul've been a screen play when I get to
More niggas away, IET, quit playing games in the middle of the street
Fuck y'all niggas gonna say to me?
We don't play the games, just play for keeps and now
Back for the forth fly, back to the back who was back with a tour bus
Get it round the world for a few months
Down dead, way niggas gotta dumb trunk
Before tonight we gonna celebrate and smoke 'till we elevate
My motive for motivating my niggas, come on

Hey man, green is for the money, gold is for the honeys
Step up your game or step down
Whenever a problem troubles us all
If you trust in the Lord there will be a brighter tomorrow
For there's nothing too much for the great God to do
And all that he asks and expects of you
Is faith that's unshaken by tribulation and yield
Confidence and knowledge that God knows best
And trouble and sorrow, they are only a test
But without God testin' of our soul
It never could reach the ultimate goal
So keep on knowing and believing

Already changed the game once I done told you But now I'm gonna do it another one do it again
Tell the club owners we need more sections

You get the venue, you gon' need more bouncers
And tell the weed man we gon' need more ounces

Living my life about peace
Sharing this money and trying to all of niggas up and off them streets
Used to look up some niggas, but now it all seem that it come down to me
Make sure my family gon' eat
Grinding from up underneath
Now they just say I'm a now they just say I'm a beast
And now all these haters looking at me pitifully
'Cause I'm the shit, literally
And I be stuntin' when I ride past my old school

Uh, it don't stop here nigga
Yea, uh

Back when I was young I had dreams of getting richer
Then my homie Breeze set me down schooled me to the picture
I was with some wild niggas put me on the game
Told me if you tryin' to make your move you gotta know your lane homie
All you got's your name and your words will never break
For this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it
'Cause most niggas never make it they stranded where I'm from
Ain't no conversation all they understand is get a gun
I was riding in my Bonneville hoping I could make it out
Selling peas and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street
Way back in the day before I had all of this paper
Before I had all of these diamonds, before I had all of these haters

Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't needed or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name 'cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it
Say I fucked the ones who hate it rolling up and celebrate now let's get medicated

Man, let's get medicated

Man I'm hella faded

Rolling weed up and smoke it
Take your bitch home and poke it
Juicy begin so faded
Thank God I got a chauffeur
Only good Cali' bud
Pulling hoes bad as fuck
Just like a youngin' my nigga
Juicy do all them drugs
Niggas smoking that babbage weed
I be on that light green
Pop molly in the after hours
A member of no sleep team
Get a whole pound smoke it by myself
Or maybe after Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps

You know I'm fresh up out that corner, twistin' marijuana
They copy us, they clone us
Yeah we so fly we on us
Got acting like they been before
But they ain't never been at all
8 balls I was in no hole
Ain't have time to fuck with y'all
Champagne when we celebrate
Keen sense so I smell the hate
Middle finger we getting paid
It cost much but don't press that eight
That dotted line it ain't like that day
Comic book let me illustrate
Like power bang when they lift that cane
My cousin died wish I can get that day
Back like it's a vertebrae
Bring that nigga on front street
Talk about and never be about it
They don't wanna beef 'cause that's lunch meat
So anything you need you know that's on me
And that's OG, I swear homie

Riding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique
My city holding on to me so niggas holding on their heat
Throwing up their side, rolling up that leaf
On-doers get high, all we want is peace
Always on the grind that's every day so police looking
I'm just rapping killing beats and tryin' to stay away from booking
Yeah my niggas dirty crooked I just had to make it known
And let me hit the studio to show they happy to be home

Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'

I got a bad bitch riding shotgun with the shotgun
Pocket full of money and some condoms
I'mma drop your bitch back off when I'm done
Hope you make your bitch get in the shower
That's your bitch, she my bitch, too
She let the homie in, too
Niggas be cuffin' while their bitches be fuckin'
My nigga, that ain't nothing new
I'm the nigga that your bitch come to
When she wanna cheat on you
I hella be tripping, too, but I got my bitches in you

I wake up and roll some dank up with my niggas
I got on the phone and caught up with some bitches
I got dressed, I mixed the Tisa with Versace
I smoked a joint and took a BR, now I'm irie

It’s Taylor Gang, I get so high that it's irrational
When I pull up in first class, it's international
I know some ratchet bitches and they rep the North side
We ain't smoking on that pack unless it's certified
Glowing by the zone, nigga, worth the grown
Smoking on that strong, give me dome while I'm on the phone
Take you to my home where we zip it up and pack it
Roll them joints up big as fuck, they tell me smell my '
This young boy gonna live it up
Pass the loud, you'd think that I smoke flavors
No bitches in the hood that don't smoke papers
Ain't tryina heard 'bout what you mean because I got it
It's on the plane cause I can't leave a trip without it
Claim you smoke more weed than me, I really doubt it
If she wake up and roll a joint that mean she 'bout it
And rest in peace, go to my nigga right
Now we call it KK and we smoke it all day
Straight to the face, fuck what the police say

I wake up and roll some dank up with my niggas
I got on the phone and caught up with some bitches
I got dressed, I mixed the Tisa with Versace

We so loud it's distorted
Got champagne and we pourin' it
She poppin' it and she snortin' it
My iPhone recordin' it, if I want it, I can afford it
Bitch I'm Young Khalifa, fillin' my lungs with reefer
Somewhere in the clouds, gotta press up to see us
I gotta whip so fast that I caught a ticket speedin'
And my bitch so bad that I'm never ever cheatin'
I might pull up in some shit that you've never ever seen
And if I said how much I made, then you won't even believe it
Me and T-Y gettin' gnarly when we pull up to the party
Brought a whole pound of Mary

[Chorus]

Put it in my drink, put it in my drink
Put it in my drink, you already know
Put it in my drink, put it in my drink
Put it in my drink, you already know
She had me smokin', had me smokin'
Smokin' on my reefer
She had me smokin', had me smokin'
Smokin' on my reefer

Wiz Khalifa,"Bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin', racked up, no wallet
Keep a bad bitch in my team, I should join the league
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
'Cause bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin
I fuck her once, don't call her
My niggas gettin' that green, we in a different league
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again

Got so much money I got racks on racks on racks on racks on racks
Bitch so much money my shit stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks
You see me smokin' and you know I got that pack, I got that sack
I got that O, I hit the club I lose control
I smoke that loud, I know the grower
Ball like the owner
Hit this gin make things move slower
I'm never sober
Roll some weed our eyes gets lower
I'm in my old school
Ride it sound just like a newer motor
They're wondering how I get these mills and still live like a stoner
No other way, I get a 100k from each promoter
Or more than that, hold up
Money long it don't fold up
Let me get some gin pour up
Got some bomb weed roll up
Niggas got their gang thrown' up
These niggas got their game, they got it from us
I'm with my gang and my niggas go nuts
You talkin' money, best believe I show up
And all the real niggas know us

Bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin', racked up, no wallet
Keep a bad bitch in my team, I should join the league

I fuck her once, don't call her
My niggas gettin' that green, we in a different league
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again

Talkin' money but walkin' funny
Is it any reason why y'all starvin'
I smell bull and by smelling force
Do I really need to beg your pardon?
My jersey say James I don't play games
Like 'Bron when he in that Garden
Now wait, I said that all wrong
She don't need to rock when I put my hard in
My new nickname is just watch
Might not join might just watch
New yacht master just a watch
Doubtin' me I tell 'em just watch
Them diamonds yellow them beams are red
And them hands tucked, they don't show
Plus them shooters with me got the green light
So why the fuck you don't think they won't go?
Hold up, your chick traded post game
And it's no shame she felt your man
She probably on Joe Johnson
'Cause I don't never be on that Elton Brand
It's YSL, she's fly as hell
Tell the come to go to my ride
You can't blame hoes ain't Peter Rose
Now she a thorn in my side, grow up
P-R-P-S is over my Timbs
Way shorty blew me out, it was only right I showed her my bench
Let my mans hit, when the fan hit
We spendin' all these bills on liquor
Figured Jersey love his teams
But still we got the realest niggas, Joey.

Bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin', racked up, no wallet
Keep a bad bitch in my team, I should join the league

I fuck her once, don't call her
My niggas gettin' that green, we in a different league
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again

Keep a bad bitch on my team
Got 'bout 5 ounce of that lean
My chain blue-ray on that screen
I spent two days countin' that cream
Got bout five acres on my doorway
Your main bitch is my throw away
Got bout eight whips they brainless
My main bitch like shorty
Got my top down her hair out
Isolation and she clear out
Fast break my bread straight
One hand shake and I bail out
Hit streets corner bitches callin' tell 'em bring a friend
Derrick Rose ballin bitch never goin' broke again
Deuces fade on my shades
Clear ice they skate
LeBron James on that break
Real estate with that lake
Shootin' from half court got you by a long shot
Montana, that nigga from the Bronx block

Bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin', racked up, no wallet
Keep a bad bitch in my team, I should join the league
NBA, never broke again, never going broke again

Came to spend money, who's countin' it?
I'm the realest in the drop, just left the dealer
In this outfit I'm a killer, tell the coppers I ain't innocent

Own it all, you probably rent it

Turn me up a little bit more, Ben, so I can rock this the right way, brother
If you got 20/20 vision
You can see me now handling this music with precision
If not, then it's fine with me
Just know this movement is vivid enough for the blind to see, Yates

How in the hell can you miss me
When I'm counting my mil' making hist'ry
Trip the splits be that 50/50
So we rip the script swiftly and zip through chips quickly
When the trash, mail and pizza man see me
They get a fever and cheesy when they see the man Neezy
I'm easily beast and my hand is in my belt
What? I'm independent and I'm feeling myself
A flunk I won't be
I bumps the trunks see
The ladies pop the monkey and drop the donkey
They want to flaunt me
My songs be funky
Steady getting that cheddar forever
But some people acting like they don't see

I'm top dog, something like a CEO
I'm calling shots, call it Don Julio
But they don't really see me though

With contact lenses say he don't smoke
I'm rolling up and let the contact get him
He even choked
My approach was to never to be broke
Kept my real niggas close

I hear people saying why so many changes?
Why so many watches? Why so many chains?

Riding in my Porsche listening to Purple Rain
So much knowledge I came up on you as a Hollywood insider
The inside of my crib look like a gym
Speaking of gym, I'm in the game, you're just a bench rider
You ride the bench that mean you ain't playing
You understand, hella fans
Bunching hands, hundred grands that's the plan

I do request for all of you people to listen
I do see checks and movie sets
And never been a stranger to vixens
Pick up the pen, its in my gut to win
I got a motive and I’m in it with a mission
You know what I'mma get it when I dip into it
I've been through it, I've been a fighter with a vision
You can cover your eye, brother but why?
Cause your lady just discovered that my
Big rubber defies your lover blubber
So you utter replies with a tougher disguise
'Cause my payday just caught the nose of your lady
I'm at the beginning of my hay-day
Y'all better recognize like ¡Mayday!
I don't know why jokers just won't let their eyes notice
Deep in my vocals they keep yelling that I'm doper
And I choke ya if you lift the Nine's flow so

Dat boy had it hard, no fasad it's da truth,
So now when I menage and get massaged it's da proof.
Proof's in da pudding and dat bakin soda taken,

Trunk full of white, car smell like bleu cheese.

1996, kilos was the shit,
But dat were better den roofin dat shit be bad for ya skin.
Niggas was ruthless, lord knows dat I sinned,
But I thought about my future and the loops I could pin.
Walked out on a gig and I turned to da streets,
Kept my name low key, I ain't heard from in weeks.
I came up with a strategy to come up mathematically,
I did it for da city but now everybody mad at me.
Mothafuck em all, they sweat from my balls,
If I drop anotha album I did dat fo my dawgs.
10 Maybachs, everybody ridin big,
I just sit back like: Look what I did.
Den I bow my head and beg for forgiveness,
Once I said my prayer, everybody back to business.

Smokin on a blunt in my own restaurant,
People lookin from a distance think I'm Big Daddy Kunk,
Reincarnated, spirit of a G.
Beef? I'll make you dinner, take a seat so we could eat.
A Farrakhan aura, paws on the Port,
You eat from da bowl while ya dog need a fork.
Niggas ain't loyal, snakes slithered in dey coil,
I'm laughin at you 'cause, kill you niggas when I'm bored.

Burn the house down, we gotta buy another,
Don't forget the gas can, jealous, stupid muthafucka.
To anotha chapter, paper dat I captured,
Caught up in da rapture of gunshots and laughter.
Homicide is human and nigga you lookin funny,
Women love to stare cause dey know dey see da money.
I open up a mind by openin bank accounts,
Deposit a 100 stacks, break up or take it out.
Baby dats a gift, maybe you could live,
I knew it wouldn't work, but I just like to give.
Used to run da street- young nigga, bare feet,
Now I'm in da suites and I'm eatin crab meats.

Was destiny to many, was just hard work for you
As you were brought into this world
You tried to find out about your surroundings
The people, the feeling of being alive and breathing the air
The smiles you see at that point are the ones you should always remember
Authentic is due to the choices you make for yourself
It'll be a bunch of fake smiles so easy to forget
But some although not healthy for them
Will create an understanding of what the word real means
Us and never eyes one of your greatest attributes
Others before thyself as long as thyself is taken care of is well being
And money, well, I know you know how to get money
I'm gonna say this and say this one time only, live young man, you deserve it

Used to turn on the TV, see what I want
And now the same one I dreamed about, the same one I'm stuntin' in
In the 6-2, almost 26
And every nigga that I'm with got a zip
I look at this shit as one big table and best believe every nigga I'm with got a sit
They try to hold us back, paint a picture of us, then sell it straight to the public
You young, black, then you thuggin'
What they don't talk about the kid that came from nothin'
Who stuck to what he believed in and turned himself into something great
They should use that story to motivate
But instead they'd rather focus on the fact that he's a pothead
Not the fact there's not a lot where I lived
25 and not dead

We started small to them houses in the hills
To them houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
To them houses in them hills

You make a little money, take care and right yourself
And people start coming up with they hand out
People take their stresses and make them yours
Well that's just what comes with being a man
I try to do all that I can to make sure that
My son grow up without having to see half of the stuff I've been through
But in life we all got our own path
Don't understand that by now you won't begin to
Cop another Rolex or Porsche try and get even with me
Pulled up to the club, swear it looked like the dealer with me
Cause we had so many cars it was stupid
So I don't see a reason to try and reason with me
Made a couple million and fast too
They ain't teach a young nigga that in the classroom
Or how to make your people better by taking knowledge and spreadin' it
Instead of being in the game being ahead of it

I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real
When you work hard to get it that's how you feel
The man that start what they knew and they ain't away
We started small to them houses in the hills
To them houses in the hills
Houses in the hills

No matter how high the stakes, niggas never outta place
Now I'm high, Empire State
Drunk stumblin', never will I tumble far from grace
I'm one of them under-celebrated greats
Under the influence of what Uncle Snoop threw me
Soon as I stepped off the plane
Switchin' four lanes like Jay and Jermaine
Killin' beats, visitin' grave sites and pissin' champagne
I been in the crib enjoying my hobbies
Suckers figured this'll be the perfect time to try me
Try me
Assumptions that I'm lunchin', gettin' sloppy
I'm just gettin' better, seasoned veteran
Eagle eye perspective, scope before I go in
Come out with the whole hen
A dollar and a dream
Have a house on the hill and the world on a screen

I ain't there, but if I can I'mma try to be perfect
And for those that's ridin' with me, I'mma try to make it worth it
I drink too much, I pray for weed, cause it's better for the stress
I just woke up, I don't get sleep, boy my schedule's a mess

Man I work hard, man I work hard, man I work hard, man I work hard

Man I work hard

Just left another one
Just wrote another one
Just got another check
'Bout to thumb through another one
Fallin' asleep on the plane, no pet the flight come with one
Young nigga holdin' it down, don't care if it make you uncomfortable
Hardly spend nights at the crib, homie that's just how I live
Don't even go hard for myself, I got a wife and a kid
I don't ever question the biz, nigga it is what it is
You niggas ain't killin shit, no you niggas ain't killin shit
What they doin'? They say, ""Nothin'!""
Where they goin'? They say, ""Nothin'!""
Call my phone, it ain't nothin'
I smoke a lot but don't judge me
Probably wake up earlier than all of you niggas
Mafuckas always hated the squad,
But all the hatin' mafuckas always hatin' and I get paid

Man I work hard, man I work hard, man I work hard, man I work hard

It look good don't it? Throw wood on it, with the golden vogue
Love potion on my mind, my pimpin' is an antidote
Cooley High, signing booming sign, knocking butters down
Crack the curb, like my ship emerged, from the underground
One more time, for them folks that know I be shinin'
Whippin' wind and reclining, pressin' diamonds
While I'm

Riding round so clean I let the bass beat out my speakers
Searching for a freak that's kink and bound to let me tweak her
Mind, her mind, her mind, her mind, her mind

I got (?) on my tongue, I talk slick
Catch a chick without using my hands, master (?)
Sliding in my SLAB, slapping Big KRIT
Woofers in the back, tweeters in my (?)
Push button secret stash box for my yammer
Yammer me, yes a pistol, a hammer
Blowing 50's, broccoli in the air
That's that Cali weed, I know that smell anywhere
Mind control, get in the female's head like a Tylenol
(?) yourself, be about your bread, increase your bankroll
Drink and cheefin', my and my heathens bustin' power moves
In the hood, like a mechanic, stickin' to the rims

Riding round so clean I let the bass beat out my speakers
Searching for a freak that's kink and bound to let me tweak her
Mind, her mind, her mind, her mind, her mind

On a mission, just me and Vincent
Your bitch might just come up missin' like a (?)
Known to talk that player shit mama, that's just how I do
My old school look powder blue
We pulled up to the Papadeaux poundin'
Sat down, ordered the clam chowder
I had the lobster bisque
I'm what they talkin' 'bout if the topic is
Money, clothes, hoes, weed smoke
Take your panties off, you don't need those
Real niggas stay stuck to the G code
Never cheat, never off my feet
Never let these niggas see your weakness
If I eat then my niggas eat
Hit the weed then we hit the sheets
That be our little secret

Round and round we go
Unlock and unload
Our remote control
Her mind, her mind

Round and round we go
Unlock and unload
Our remote control

Staying out, sleeping when we can

Going hard, wake up in the morning

Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds

Every time I hit the club
I take my money, I spend it all
Standing on the couch just showing love
Don't give a damn
Don't give a fuck
Float me and take me away
High up in the clouds, never coming down
Somewhere out the space, never on the ground
Always turning up, never turning down
Another hundred grands
As soon as I turn around
Take me up to where I wanna be
Tired as fuck, but we don't wanna sleep

Got me up all night
Just to start a fight
You don't wanna think about it
You drink about it
You smoke about it
Don't talk about it
Every nights the same
Who's the one to blame?
You don't wanna think about it
You drink about it
You smoke about it
Don't talk about it
Don't make it easy for yourself

13's on my Impala, raw cone filled with chronic smoke
Homie, I got game like the Shuttlesworth fam
Milk these lames for what they worth
HUF socks, ashes on my shirt, three wheel motion all you motherfuckers
The Porsche in the garage then got a life for my dogs
I had nothing at all but now I take trips to Vegas
Rolling up, playing songs on my oldies playlist
Diamonds on my fist, Rollie on my wrist, my life's the shit

Got me up all night
Just to start a fight
You don't wanna think about it
You drink about it
You smoke about it
Don't talk about it
Every nights the same
Who's the one to blame?
You don't wanna think about it
You drink about it
You smoke about it
Don't talk about it
Don't make it easy for yourself

Standing over the terrace, made so much last year
These lil' niggas should be embarrassed
Claim we the same, but the difference is apparent
Copy my style so much they got me like 'where the fuck is their parents?'
Smoking so much that the public think it's scary
But I don't give a fuck, I'm rolling another one up
And giving middle fingers to you little fucks
Who get online and say I suck, long time you rolling papers and wearing chucks
And I ain't even had my best year, ten cars, 20 million, fuck I'mma do next year?

Got me up all night
Just to start a fight
You don't wanna think about it
You drink about it
You smoke about it
Don't talk about it

Who's the one to blame?
You don't wanna think about it

We stay up, no bail outs
Give it all, all for the family, family, family, fa-fa-family

Five, four, three, two, I got one shot
You lose the love and respect, that’s where the trust stop
New work, top drop
I roll up every fifteen minutes like a bus stop
And you can smell just how I’m smokin’ when I burn out
And you can catch me ridin’ dirty, but my car not
It’s love and loyalty until my heart lock
Never turn your back, won’t know how it turned out
I said it once, I’ll do it again
I’m playin’ the game, I do it to win
With you and your friend, that’s thick and thin
That’s me and my team, you know we gon’ win

Swingin’ on the green like I’m tryna get a par four
You ain’t sittin’ at my table, hope you starve
Ho, don’t be pushin’ my buttons 'less you startin' up my car
Pressure make a diamond, that pressure make me a star
Got a method to my madness, to bring me down by the bar
People always askin’ me how I got this far
My response is just to keep it honest and be who you are
Now they call me Mrs. Money like I’m married to the mula
Just to measure my success I need at least a hundred rulers
Glory, hallelujah, I’ma take that ass to church
I’ma finish like I started, Iggy still got that work

I'm pullin' small faced hundreds out a dirty mattress
And the grow game got my in my own lane
Baking soda in the pot, light the stove flame

We do the touch down dance when the money lands
Two girls both strip and they hella fine
New watch, new car from a friend of mine
I get it, bag it up, and move it quicker every time
I still really get it down
Why it sound like drop talk

Someday they all got some steal in the field
Always stay down, yeah I'm gon' keep it real

This may half a ticket
Just all for one deal

One done, made a quick five-hundred
White ghost right behind me like, I'm haunted
Never drop the bag off and heard, I don't want it
See the Benz and the six crib bedroom, I bought it
It's good, come to Cali, get a sweet price
Put her on a cheap flight
Hit me when she lands, I'mma wrap it up three times
Tripple seal, each one

Bitches talkin' crazy, but they give me mine
I got a twenty-pack knock on my other line
Two girls, both drunk and they hella fine
Fresh picked, new smell, you can tell it's mine
Send another box out, I hope it touch down

Before anybody knew who the fuck I was
It's like I had to give them that energy 
So they understood and they knew the song
And they knew how to move to it by the time it was over

I'm tired as a mo' fucker

Uh
It was 2009
And I was just gettin' home off tour
Doin' hella shows for my fans
And I could tell that everybody want more
Ain't ever wait for nobody
We kicked through that front door
And always did our own thing
Can't tell you what niggas wanna front for
We bought cones and stuffed more
Passed girls, you cuffed yours
Spent nights on the airplane goin' too hard, like what for?
And all I did was make time
But I ain't take enough for myself
Just doin' shit for everybody else
I ain't hardly even by myself
Family time is slowed down
'Cause they want me to burn out
Seen the end of this movie
They all know how it turns out
Say they all gon' still love me if I don't make another hit song
If I don't take time to embrace it, what's the point of doin' this for?
I'm packin' up my bags
Book a night, another hotel
It's a lot that could go down
So I'm hopin' everything goes well
Came in to this game
Givin' rules to you lames
Be the one that's holding you down
Tryna count you out, it's a shame

It was 2014
And I was 'bout to go world tourin'
You was all up in my face
Sayin' that you want more
And I was gettin' tired
Of frontin' for the public
Sayin' I could do without it
But you seem like you love it
I remember all of the subjects
That we would argue 'bout day and night
Do the best that I can
No matter what, I can make it right
When you said you felt single
I remember it like it was yesterday
Had to fuck you hold me down
When you ain't take my last name
I tried hard to move past things
Came home, made shit change
Had to make a hard decision, let you go, it's time to do what's best for me
We went to Colorado, we was there for your friends' wedding
I was tryin' to hold it together
But I felt like we were ending
I remember the beginning
But this ain't nowhere close to that
Seen some shit you didn't like
Said some shit that wasn't facts
Never thought 'bout gettin' back
By puttin' your business out
But in the end you made it seem like I ain't the one who held you down

And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas everything'll be okay

It was 2017
The day before my son birthday
The week before my mom birthday
That's the day you passed away
Can't feel too bad 'cause I know I'll see you again one day
But right now I can't help but feel this pain

So I can hear myself a little more in the headphones, uh

Came from the bottom, started this out with nothing
Turned the fam in my squad, and turn this thing into something
I grab a cone and I stuff it, never gonna get enough
Depending on how its going, we only gonna get tougher
I done seen people suffers, hate turned into love
Lost some people to get here
But they watching us from up above
On the road, hardly ever home
And money caught one in the dome
Now its hard to even pick up my phone
Leave me alone, I'll be in my zone
I'm getting grown but not too grown to let my family shown
Anything you want, you can get, you gotta build it tho
I blew up quick and lost some shit
But now I'm dealing those
There's consequences to every decisions

Yeah, all of the fame just comes with the game
It's a gift and the curse when everybody know your name
How do you make a million dollars and still stay same
How do you make a hundred millions and still stay sane
You got the money, the clothes, the cars, the girls
Trying to do better, but all the shits in the world
Something regulars would you prefer?
But it's cool, it's too much pressure, you think you should curve
On the verge, packing up and going back to where I come from
Tired of these rappers, I only run in the lane once
Tired of all these girls, we all fucking the same one
I ain't giving chances no more, I already gave one
Getting money, you better save some
Don't be afraid to make mistakes 'cause you gotta make some
It takes time, but a man gon be a man and do what he gotta do

No turning back, I'm learning that
If you ever show someone love, you deseves it back
If you got a ounces of paper, you should burn it back
And if you ever do takes a loss, you can earn it back
Never slack, never overreact, let your money stack
Look at where you're going and where you at
You gon get there if you work hard
When you make it, you'll get exactly what you work for
I want more, couple cars in my garage
And mansions with marble floors
Above it all, open my doors
Couple plaques on the wall
Hoop court where my friends could ball
It may sounds strange but I'mma need it all

Got some family members that I don't see at all

Chicks on set, drinks on deck
Hickeys on my neck, but they don't care
Got they hands up
Put put em in the air
Spot this fly chick, ask her name

Took to my crib we can catch a train
Ain't got no whip cause my cash ain't straight

Walked to the club, forgot my swag

Wizards Of Twiddly,"When the angostura runs a little low
And your gin has lost that soft and roosy glow
And time is rushing by, but it seems slow
Just live dangerously once before you go

If you take the bite right out of Mr. Snake
He'll assume the reputation of a fake
Until someone comes along, someone fearless someone strong
And gives that Mr. Snake a mighty shake

But who wants to shake with a snake?
Who wants to shake with a snake?
Who would help a simple adder to be happy to be gladder?
Who wants to shake with a snake?
Who wants to shake with a snake?

Wizards Of Twiddly,"Woke up this morning
I went out on the street
Sniffed a few flowers then I went back to sleep
My head was cloudy but the sky was blue
And I didn't feel lonely till I thought of you

Later that evening I knocked on your door
Asked how you're feeling
You said you weren't sure
Took off your costume and you lay on the bed
And I came down beside you with the moon in my head

I whispered nothing sweetly in your ear
I played the music that you like to hear
I held you tightly but you slipped right through
And I was left holding someone but I didn't know who

Maybe I'm crazy and I'm lost in a dream
Brothers and sisters you know what I mean
You leave things open and get lost in the space
And you have to keep running to keep out of this race",Didn't Feel Lonely till I Thought of You,2000
Wizards Of Twiddly,"It's late in the evening
And the weather is cold
I'm beginning to miss you
But that story's so old
I know I've been knocking
My head on the wall
And I must have been crazy
To leave 
Oh yeah, yeah
Strange kind of blues colored moon
Shines in the middle of my room.

Sometimes I'm burning
With a vision so bright
That it brings on the sunshine
In the middle of the night
And all those musical ladies
And the crazed young men
They are trying to make music
Together again? 0h no no
And a strange kind of blues colored moon
Shines in the middle of my room.",Everybody's Sometime and Some People's All the Time Blues,2000

Wizards Of Twiddly,"I just came in off the street
Looking for somewhere to eat
I find a small cafe
I see a girl and then I say

May I sit and stare at you for a while?
I'd like the company of your smile'

You don't have to say a thing

When you can't see me now?

Wizards Of Twiddly,"I walked into this bar
And the man refused;
He said, ""We don't serve strangers
In blue suede shoes; 
We don't give credit, and
We don't give way 
We have to think about what the people might say..
Uh, you know what I mean ""
I said, ""Sure, man""

Oh, he gave me a smile that was sickly and wet, 
And I offered him one of my cigarettes.
He took it, afraid that he might appear rude,
Then proceeded to sell me some second class food.
Nice guy   meet 'em everywhere

He said, ""My oh my, I have suffered too long, 
And this cigarette seems to be very strong; 
I don't make the rules 
I just get what I take
And I guess every rule was made to break. 
You can take what you like, it won't hurt me
Cause I'm just working for the company.""
From the green cigarette, He took a long drag, 
And said, ""I think I'll pick my traveling bag.

I'm tired of cheating, and wasting my head 
And filling the boss's bags with bread. 
I want to get out in the sun and rain, 
And feel the wind on on skin again;
The world is large, and I've got time yet. 
And, by the way, thanks for that cigarette. 
Thank you very much.""

Why, why, why, why are we sleeping!

People who stare; 
Waiting for something
That's already there.

Bitting my nails, breaking my stride
I put my faith into your desolate life
Happened so fast that I should be afraid, I won't be afraid
Three year blessed, I gave it my best
It's time to put it to rest
Your present is my past

Through my eyes I've seen nothing but time
Forty four thousand lies
Straight for your putrid mind
High tides drag you through decades of nights
Loved ones who turn out your lights, seem like they care

I am an island, and you are the tides that pull at my feet 
But now she's sinking in this void

Aging, forcing my nerves
Cut your chords, count your chores, stop using yourself
For fruitless scars
Just cut your chords

And your back will keep breaking
From this glass house
That you have created
Hear me out
Your heart is to heavy, to heavy for trust
So build me a promise and take my advice
A word from the wise 
A fault confessed, I have redressed
She feels such unrest
So pray, so fucking pray

I thought I had your word
That a father dies before his son
Now the reaper and his men are marching your way straight to hell

All that you taught me to be
Was a moper, a dreamer that only refused to dream.
Oh save it please
My voice is peaking through your speakers
And I'm speaking just to show you the way.
How could you
Shelter me out
I'm much older now
You're a chemical fiend you shatter like a beaker
When I only want to show you the way

The architect, the creator
I'll build my way out of your demise
These dreams are my castles
Not the walls you built up around me

Oh when I look at my watch and I know
Time is gold
It can't be pawned and it can't be sold
Now you're running out of time, 
Better relapse and rewind
Crucify your addiction so you can cross this line
Nothing can save you from the fate that awaits you

Disregard the signals
Disregard the smoke
Father don't believe them
Just let them fucking choke

Now we lay you down to sleep
I pray his hands, your soul to reap
And if I die before you wake
Then I've lost a bet and for fucks sake
When all your cards are on the table
Pray the floor is still and stable and dance your life away

Your true colors are starting to get loud
(So loud that it hurts my ears)
Have fun praying to your gray god now
This war don't determine who's right
This war just determines who's left Standing tonight
Stop handing me lights
I can see what you are in the dark just fine
I'm not blind I'm bending the blinds
Peaking through to get a glimpse of your anguishing life
You're hiding like a vampire here comes the strife
This won't hurt me cause I get a thrill from the bite.

Place your bets

There's a song we sang all summer in the bars in Dublin town
I can here it on the factory radio
And the feeling I remember when I here that simple tune
Make me wonder if it really happened so

And some nights when im drinking and my friends have gathered 'round
And just for fun someone calls out your name
Well I smile there with the rest of them but I cant here a sound
I love you but to them it's all the same
And nights when im alone my love you come into my mind
And visions flash across the Emerald Isle
Well I watch the moon there up above I'll leave this earth behind

Wolfe Tones,"I was born on a Dublin street where the royal drums did beat,
And those loving English feet they tramped all over us,
And each and every night when me father came home tight
He'd invite the neighbors outside with this chorus:

Come out ye Black and Tans, come out and fight me like a man,
Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders,
Tell them how the IRA made you run like hell away
From the green and lovely lanes of Killashandra.

Come tell us how you slew them poor Arabs two by two,
Like the Zulus they had spears and bows and arrows,
How you bravely faced each one with your 16-pounder gun,
And you frightened them poor natives to their marrow.

Come out ye Black and Tans, come out and fight me like a man,
Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders,
Tell them how the IRA made you run like hell away
From the green and lovely lanes of Killashandra.

Come let us hear you tell how you slandered great Parnell,
When you thought him well and truly persecuted,
Where are the sneers and jeers that you bravely let us hear
When our heroes of '16 were executed?

Come out ye Black and Tans, come out and fight me like a man,
Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders,
Tell them how the IRA made you run like hell away
From the green and lovely lanes of Killashandra.

Well the day is coming fast and the time is here at last,
When each yeoman will be cut aside before us,
And if there be a need, sure me kids would sing, ""Godspeed,""

No foreign lands to seize
So the greedy eye of England
I stirring towards the seas
Two hundred miles from Donegal
There's a place that's called Rockall
And the groping hands of Whitehall
Are grabbing at it's walls. 

[Chorus]
Oh rock on Rockall you'll never fall
For Britains greedy hands
Oh you'll meet the same resistance
Like you did in many lands
May the Seagulls rise and pluck your eyes
And the water crush your shell
And the natural gas will burn your ass
And blow you all to hell 

This rock is part of Ireland
For it's written in folklore
When Finn McCool took a sod of grass
He threw it to the fore
When he tossed a pebble across the sea
Where ever did it fall
For the sod became the Isle of Man
Now the pebble's called Rockall

[Chorus]

Oh the seas will not be silent
While Britannia grabs the waves
And remember that the Irish
Will no longer be your slaves
And remember that Britannia well
She rules the waves no more

Wolfe Tones,"Were apples still grow in November
 where blossoms still bloom from each tree
 where leaves are still green in November
 its then that our land will be free
 I wander her hills and her valleys
 and still through my sorrows I see
 a land that has never known freedom
 and only her rivers run free
 I drink to the death of her manhood

 than to live in the cold chains of bondage
 to bring back there rights were denied
 oh were are you now when we need you
 what burns were the flame used to be
 are you gone like the snow of last winter
 and will only our rivers run free
 how sweet is the life but we're crying
 how mellow the wine but its dry
 how fragrent the rose but its dying
 how gentle the breeze but it sighs

 what joy is in eyes that can't see
 when there's sorrow in sunshine and flowers
 and still only our rivers run free",Only Our Rivers Run Free,1964
Wolfe Tones,"I was eighteen years old 
When I went down to Dublin,
With a fistfull of money
And a cartload of dreams,
Take your time
Said me father,
Stop rushing like hell,
And remember all is not
What it seems to be,
For there's fellas would cut ye
For the coat on yer back,
Or the watch that ye got
From yer mother,
So take care me young buck-o
And mind yourself well,
And will ye give this wee note
To me brother.

At the time Uncle Benjy
Was a policeman in Brooklyn,
And me father the youngest
Looked after the farm,
When a phonecall from America
Said 'Send the lad over',
Well the old fella said
'It wouldn't do any harm',
For I spent me life working
This dirty old ground,
For a few pints of porter
And the smell of a pound,
And sure maybe there's something
You learn loyalty,
And you can bring it back home,
Make a duty on me .

So I landed at Kennedy,
And a big yellow taxi
Carried me and me bags
Through the streets and the rain,
Well me poor heart was thumpin'
Around with excitement,
And I hardly ever heard 
What the driver was saying,
We came in the Shore Parkway
To the Flatlands of Brooklyn,
To my Uncles apartment
On East 53rd,
I was fellin' so happy
I was hummin' a song,
And I sang,
You're as free as a bird'.

Well to shorten the story
What I found out that day,
Was that Benjy got shot down
In an uptown foray,
And while I was flyin' 
My way to New York,
Poor Benjy was lying
In a cold city morgue,
Well I phoned up the old fella
Told him the news,
I could tell he could hardly
Stand up in his shoes,
And he wept as he said
'Go ahead with the plan',
And not to forget
Be a proud Irishman.

So I went up to Nellies
Beside Fordham Road,
And I started to learn
About lifting the load,
But the heaviest thing
I carried that year,
Was the bittersweet thoughts
Of my hometown so dear,
I went home that December
'Cause the old fella died,
Had to borrow some money
From a Phil on the side,
And all the bright flowers
And brass couldn't hide,
The poor wasted face
Of me father.

I sold up the old farmyard 
For what it was worth,
And into me bag
Stuck a handful of earth,
Then I boarded a train
And I caught me a plane,
And I found myself back
In the US again,
Its been twenty two years
Since I set foot in Dublin,
Me kids know to use 
The correct knife and fork,
But I never will forget
The green grass and the rivers,
As I keep law and order
On the streets of New York.",Streets of New York,1964
Wolfe Tones,"High upon the gallows tree

By the vengeful tyrant stricken in their bloom

With the courage of their race
And they went with souls undaunted to their doom

Chorus:
God save Ireland, said the heroes
God save Ireland, said they all
Whether on the scaffold high
Or the battlefield we die
Oh what matter when for Erin dear we fall?

When they're up the rugged stair
Rang their voices out in prayer
Then with England's fatal cord around them cast
Close beside the gallows tree
Kissed like brothers lovingly
True to home and faith and freedom to the last

Never till the latest day
Shall the memory pass away?
Oh, the gallant lives thus given for our land
But on the cause must go
Amid joy and weal and woe
Till we make our Isle a nation free and grand

Wolfe Tones,"The man was all shot through that came to day into the Barrack Square
And a soldier I, I am not proud to say that we killed him there
They brought him from the prison hospital and to see him in that chair
I swear his smile would, would far more quickly call a man to prayer

Maybe, maybe I don't understand this thing that makes these rebels die
Yet all men love freedom and the spring clear in the sky
I wouldn't do this deed again for all that I hold by
As I gazed down my rifle at his breast but then, then a soldier I.

They say he was different, kindly too apart from all the rest.
A lover of the poor-his wounds ill dressed.
He faced us like a man who knew a greater pain
Than blows or bullets ere the world began: died he in vain

Ready, Present, and him just smiling, Christ I felt my rifle shake
His wounds all open and around his chair a pool of blood
And I swear his lips said, ""fire"" before my rifle shot that cursed lead
And I, I was picked to kill a man like that, James Connolly

A great crowd had gathered outside of Kilmainham
Their heads all uncovered, they knelt to the ground.
For inside that grim prison
Lay a great Irish soldier

His life for his country about to lay down.
He went to his death like a true son of Ireland
The firing party he bravely did face
Then the order rang out: Present arms and fire

James Connolly fell into a ready-made grave
The black flag was hoisted, the cruel deed was over
Gone was the man who loved Ireland so well
There was many a sad heart in Dublin that morning

When they murdered James Connolly. The Irish rebel",James Connolly,1986
Wolfe Tones,"
When boyhood's fire was in my blood 
I read of ancient freemen, 
For Greece and Rome who bravely stood, 
Three hundred men and three men; 
And then I prayed I yet might see 
Our fetters rent in twain, 
And Ireland, long a province, be. 
A Nation once again! 

A Nation once again, 
A Nation once again, 
And lreland, long a province, be 
A Nation once again! 

And from that time, through wildest woe, 
That hope has shone a far light, 
Nor could love's brightest summer glow 
Outshine that solemn starlight; 
It seemed to watch above my head 
In forum, field and fane, 
Its angel voice sang round my bed, 
A Nation once again! 

It whisper'd too, that freedom's ark 
And service high and holy, 
Would be profaned by feelings dark 
And passions vain or lowly; 
For, Freedom comes from God's right hand, 
And needs a Godly train; 
And righteous men must make our land 
A Nation once again! 

So, as I grew from boy to man, 
I bent me to that bidding 
My spirit of each selfish plan 
And cruel passion ridding; 
For, thus I hoped some day to aid, 
Oh, can such hope be vain ? 
When my dear country shall be made 
A Nation once again! 
",A Nation Once Again,1986
Wolfe Tones,"Sad are the homes round Garryowen
Since they lost their joy and pride
And the banshee cry links every vale
Around the Shannon side that city of the ancient walls
the broken treaty stone, undying fame surrounds your name, Sean South from Garryowen

T'was on a dreary New Years Eve
As the shades of night came down
A lorry load of volunteers approached the border town
There were men from Dublin and from Cork, Fermanagh and Tyrone
And the leader was a Limerick man - Sean South from Garryowen

As they moved along the street up to the barracks door
They scorned the danger they might face
Their fate that lay instore
They were fighting for old Ireland to claim their very own
And the foremost of that gallant band
Was South from Garryowen

But the seargent spied their daring plan
He spied them trough the door
The Sten guns and the rifles a hail of death did pour
And when that awful night had passed
Two men lay cold a stone
There was one from near the border and one from Garryowen

No more wil he hear the seagull's cry
Over the murmurring Shannon tide
For he fell beneath a Northern sky brave Hanlon by his side

Of Plunkett, Pearse and Tone
A martyr for old Ireland

Wolfe Tones,"In the East End of London, I met an old man.
He kept a bar called the Horses and Tram.
""My parents were Irish. They loved that dear land,""
The Cockney, he smiled, then he shook my old hand.
""My heart is in Ireland, it's there I long to be.
Her hills and her valleys are calling to me.
Though born here in this land, my heart is in Ireland.
The land of the old folks is calling to me.""
Near a coal mine in Wales, by a roadside cafe,
A young girl came smiling, and to me did say,
""Well, my folks are from Ireland. My Da', he hopes one day
When he leaves the mines, sure we'll go back to stay.""
""My heart is in Ireland, it's there I long to be.
Her hills and her valleys are calling to me.
Though born here in this land, my heart is in Ireland.
The land of the old folks is calling to me.""
Then I went through the Midlands, through each city and town.
I found there were Irish in each place I roamed.
And I drank and I sang at a pub they call the Crown.
With the Birmingham irish, we sang songs of home.
""My heart is in Ireland, it's there I long to be.
Her hills and her valleys are calling to me.
Though born here in this land, my heart is in Ireland.
The land of the old folks is calling to me.""
Then I went north to Scotland, to Glasgow on the Clyde.
I met with some young lads. They said, ""Celtic's our side.
All our folks are from Ireland, the island of the green.
A country we love, but a place we've not seen.""
""My heart is in Ireland, it's there I long to be.

No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true",When You Wish Upon a Star,2004

Wolfgang Muthspiel,"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love

When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet

The minute you let her under your skin

For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

You have found her, now go and get her

Hör' die Band aus Lili's Diskothek
Und am Flipperautomat
Da gewinn' ich sogar ein Spiel
Doch das ist es nicht
Was ich suche und was ich will.

Warten auf die Nacht
Und ich geh' dorthin
Wo sie alle sind
Wo die Musicbox mir die Langeweile nimmt.
Sommer in der Stadt
Ich hab' es so satt
Gibt's nicht irgendwo in dem Riesenhäusermeer
Das Mädchen
Dessen Freund ich gerne wär'.
Wir seh'n uns flüchtig an durch blauen Rauch
Doch zum Reden ist es leider viel zu laut
Deine Augen sagen scheu:
Was will der denn bloá vol
Und so kommt es
Daá ich's gar nicht erst probier!

Auf dein Wohl, du weißt doch, dass ich dich brauch
Warum lässt du mich hier in Asche und Rauch

Der Himmel brennt, die Engel fliehen
Und ich ersticke in schwarzen Wolken
Mein Fehler war, ich hab geglaubt
Du wirst mir ins Feuer folgen
Doch der Himmel, den wir wollten
Der Himmel brennt

Der Himmel brennt, die Engel fliehen
Wir sind durch Rauch und Feuer getrennt
Der Himmel brennt, die Engel fliehen

Sharing every inch of me, 
Every inch a woman,
Everything a woman could be. 

Totally Nude, 
Totally Nude - on a midnight breeze, 
Her and me,
Breakin' all the rules.

I need her love just like I need to breathe.
She poured her love all over me.
A night can be a lifetime,
When you're on your own.
Crazy, bad down to the bone.

Kathy Wilson  

Twilight ebbs and slowly, 
Heaven sparkles light.
From pin pricks in nights curtain,
Something comes to life.
A star is falling, tearing though the dark. 
In the morning,
Darkness fills my fathers heart. 

A distraught David calls at Kathy's house.
""Mrs Wilson something's wrong with Kathy."" 
""Don't be silly David Kathy's OK""
At the police station a concerned sergeant is on the phone. 
""Hey Doc, I've got little David here, 
Would you come over and take a look,
He seems pretty upset.""
Scared, alone and huddled in the corner of a cell is David. The Doctor enters and asks softly, 
""Now David what's the matter?"" 
He hesitates
""First Doctor can I see the back of your neck?"" 

When I asked Dad about his neck he said he caught it on Barbed wire in the dunes, 
But there's no barbed wire over there, 
And he hit me and Dad never does that.
I called for my best friend Kathy on the way to school.
She acted like she didn't even know me
And she had the same mark on her neck.

The police chief is possessed she put a probe inside his head.
Mom and Dad are acting strange I think they want me dead. 
Stuart Kelso will believe me, 
I know that they are here. 
I saw them from my window, 
Into the ground they disappeared.

Could be a mother ship on Mars, 
And mutants all around. 
Better tell the General, 
War is waiting underground. 

A few billion miles away, 
They came from outer space. 
Now all hell's breaking loose, 
Down at little Kathy Wilson's Place!

All Hells Breaking Loose Down at Little Kathy Wilson's Place! Was inspired by the 1953 sci-fi movie ""Invaders from Mars""",Steel,1990
Wolfsbane,"I pour my brain into a can 
And beer swamps my mind 
Turning me from a man 
Into something less defined 
An open wound 
With raw emotions bleeding forth 
The night becomes a swamp 
As the brew takes its course 

I'm falling down into 
A black lagoon 
Pour me a pint of my best friend 
And set them up again. 

A melancholy anger weeps 
In shadows of lost hope 
The mutant climbs inside my eyes 
And sanity is soaked. 
The taste is sweet and satisfies 
A midnight afternoon 
I am sinking slowly 
In the potion's black lagoon 

I'm falling down into 
A black lagoon 
Pour me a pint of my best friend 
And set them up again. 

Pour me a glass of cold dark beer 
And don't ask me to smile at you, my dear 
There's no answer in the bottle 
However hard I look 
There's no wisdom in that cocktail 
However hard it's shook",Black Lagoon,1991
Wolfsbane,"Didn't it seem to good,
Just as everything was as it should be,
What was time, somewhere, some place we had to be,
Mom says you can't go back, you can't turn back the clock,
Isn't it good to be in love,
This room and just the two of us,
One night, the full moon woke us up,
That moon and just the two of us,
We took the moment by the horns,
And the hours seemed to get lost.

Confused by it all,
I sit and wonder,
Bemused and enthralled,
Why are we apart?.

Wolfsbane,"Knock the door and then descend,
Down the stairs and down again,
Into the Temple of Rock,
Tattooed backs and beer thighs,
Shadows laugh and make up lies,
In the Temple of Rock.

Tell me anything, I'll do it, she said,
As I passed in the hall,
Don't I know that good things,
Nearly always come packaged small.

I want the hard core.

Don't I know that I look cool,
'Cause I'm drinking rocket fuel,
In the Temple of Rock.

Smashed and blind but I feel fine,
Watered at that sacred shrine,
It's the Temple of Rock.

No one really wants to know

Was it shame or was it fear
When his devil's face appeared?

And the wall between them grows
The wall between them grows
Tonight, velvet night

He met her on the school yard
Funny man behind the fence
Started with a real deception
He didn't try in vain
Who has failed this, who once more?
A tall man offering sweets
No one wants to think about it
And evil sows its seeds

He tries to hold her in his arms
He always tries to keep her warm
Blue-eyed girl, grown up to fast
Lost her innocence at last
Cruel revenge hurt in her heart
Breaks dependences apart
And now he's begging on his knees
Lay your guilty hands on me!

And the wall between them grows
The wall between them grows
Tonight, velvet night

So my heart could carry on

In silent storms of entropy
