3LW,"Uh oh (Kiely) 3-L-Dub baby
We got another one
Nine lives
It was the wrong day, the wrong month, the wrong year
I wasn't ready
For all the pain all and the tears
Baby you crushed me
Now I have to deal in the worst piece
You had to go and take it there

[Chorus:]
Now I'm all alone
Knew I should've took my ass home
Times when you was putting it on me
You was putting it on me
I just hate you for it
Hate you for making me fall in love
And there's nothing I can do about it
So blue about it
Don't want to be in love
I just hate you for it
Hate you for making me fall in love
And there's nothing I can do about it
So blue about it
Don't want to be in love

Thought I could change you
And turn you into a good man
Thought my love was born
And things would go as I planned
But what a fool I was
You was still was hitting your ex-girlfriend (That's right)
I had be out you understand

[Chorus:]

(Wish that) Wish that things was different babe
Wish that you would love me
The way that I love you boy (Way that I love you)
Can't believe (Can't believe) you hurt me babe
Hurt me this way
I hate to love you can't let go

3LW,"Everyday she walk by
See me on the same block
Same crew, like she never seen rocks
Chain watch, rims blue
Different color boots on, park Yukon
You predicates ex-cons, rip arms, bettin' chips
Puff medicine play my gangsta beats
Tunnel bangers, Flex, Clue tapes bang in the streets
I'm just a fly, thuggish baller shorty anxious to meet
Till I die keep wanting to head mink to the feet
But shorty jailbait, might get me five-to-life
Maybe in time you can be Nas's wife
Place school, study law
I'ma pay your tuition
Come on campus, buy you books
Do your babysitting
My unusual style make your future unwild
When you get older I'ma bless you with a child
See now you was unaware that this thug had affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection

It's either you will
Either you won't
Sometimes you do
Sometimes you don't
Sometimes it's yes
Other times it's no
But I can't take it no more
Take your wrong and make it right
Just say you can make up your mind
Is it serious or isn't it?
'Cause I can't take it no more

Make 'em clap to this
Baby, baby you keep
Putting things before me
But I was there for you when you had nothing
So baby, baby
Basically it's them or me
Now or never
Give me all or nothing

You keep telling me you're changing
You promise you will be a better man
But no soon as you see your peeps
There you go switching out on me
And we're back at square one again

Don 3, can't get with me
Why y'all just a child-child
Maybe I can get you with little Sammie and Bow Wow
Please girls try to understand me now-now
Like my little sisters I'ma hold you down-down
Got the whole world in your hands
Three little women got these young boys tryna be their man
Do your thing shorty, but if they get disrespectful
Get on your cellphone, call big brother Esco
Now let's go

'Cause all this back and forth
In and out, ups and downs

I got my gun cocked tight and I'm ready to blow,

Without leaving my fingerprints out,

There's an army of women tryin'a rip it apart
I could really use a getaway right away
So they could watch the tail lights fade in the dark.

I don't care if they talking tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, uh uh uh, oh 
That I give you everything
Music knockin' 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party 

Set the scene, three thousand degrees
Ain't worried about them fuck niggas over there 
But they worried 'bout me
I got a homeboy named Butta and another homeboy
That nigga named Cheese, fuck wit' me baby,
I make it milk till it drip down yo' knees
Spit this shit fo' rillo, brain brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court, eating our gyro
Yesterday, that's the way, every single mornin' 
I try to pray grandmom 'n them, they never forgot
And nothin' else really mean nuttin' to me
I ain't stuntin' to beat, talkin' to me?
Girl, why you fickin' wit' me? 
Move on, ain't nuttin' to see
Pssh, always somethin' to salt, 
I'm the raw, off the rip
'Cause of him, all of them, will remember the men
And that they fell in love with rap,
Black like havin' your cousin back
Blue like when that rent is due, 
Cream like when I'm lovin' you, yeah 

So in love
I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, uh uh uh, oh 
That I give you everything
Music knockin' 'til the morning light

'Cause we like to party, hey hey hey hey hey hey
'Cause we like to party, hey hey hey hey hey hey

Black zone darkness, void as snakepit
So I'ma spit a lyric at the packed lip
Sit stunned I drum lyrics in your egg case
Space filled, darkness a blank face
Recognize unknown throne at deep depths
A Prime Minister incites a slow death
of a rational thought through the physical
Triple Stage Darkness, first stage lyrical
Sight to see, a piece of the Serch-light
Truth is loose, lips slips to Twilight Zones
Prone to blow revision
I'm 20/20 and your in-tune is in prison
Switchin from this track, move back in motion
Unaware of your own evolution
Regress through the tunnels and flee light
Illumination, the first stage, my birthright

Deaf, dumb and blind, the 3rd Bass find
you move further away from the swine
As I rhyme and effects your slide into tape decks
Light black in your face, what do you do next?
The question posed -- you're livin in delerium
Serch speakin in a spasm, can't you see him?
But you can't see the light's dim, it's growin darker
Cut off from the knowledge, un-smarter
Depart from the norm, completing a born to born
from opportunity, comes a thunderstorm
that sets in, tricked by the trickster
The only way out is DJ, Night, or Prime Minister
You follow, but attention span is minimal be	
Now you're lost, never thought of intellectually
The 3rd's word, guide you as we spark this
Cause you're blind in the second stage of darkness

Not professor of hype, ask why

Not takin, but remain invisible
Men judge by passin a mountain
called Caucus, and ignorants are mouthin

[MC Serch]
Fallacy, the great fall, fell in disgrace
How can hatred uplift a race?
Not a dribbler or watermelon picker
Givin you the Gas Face, as I'm dickin ya

Brilliance in difference, tracin true sight
Third stage knowledge, brought forth a new light

Little baby boy, hooooh!

I was blessed with soul.. *more laughter as the beat stops*

This is def, hoooooh!
Mmmmmmmm..
This goes, this goes back
This takes me back to 1940's, when I was a little baby
new ? sittin on Kevin Renald's lap
And he said to me, ""SON you've got so much soul..
You've.. hooooh you've got, soul comin out your ass"" *laughter*
Now peep this, see..
You've gotta take this back down South
Oh I'm buggin, I'm flippin

Little white boy, down South

Tight fit, dim lit spot, is where I'm movin to
Sweaty but these slow tracks start soothin you
Light-skinned, steps into the picture
Program is fixed, the mix will let you get your
Hand around waist, space drippin from moisture
Strokin the neck, you suspect that she'll voice her
Approval, whippin and flippin your pelvis
Brothers step in, step off, you get selfish
Yours for the take-home, so she can take up space
At your place, but then you start to wake up
Groove goes to fade, introductions are made
Love my name is Serch, now step for some shade
In the dancehall

""3rd place is everything""
""3rd place is everything""

Soulfully smooth, she slithered to a solo
Spot to drop her bass and I'll follow
Fiend on a focus, I spoke this figure of speech
Supposed to sway those who seek
Such wisdom, wildly workin towards a woman
Therefore she's drawn, to the other man's
Intentions of a G, tryin to stump me
Announced presence in the house of Mr. Puffy
Smoke filled the tight-packed system
A rack of skirt, kit for a victim
A three-stage pleasure on a principle
As I step and drop a syllable (yyyyo!)
A syllabus spoken by the 3rd on sss-swooin
A female, to impale, push-up, smooth and
Turn to spurn desire, that all?
Another episode in the dancehall

""3rd place is everything""

Step to the A.M., playin a song that's slow
Low tempo kicks lyrics to those who show
A need to step to a def 3rd Bassment
A wink of eye, the smile of a face and I'm
D-O-W-N to send shockwaves
Up the spine, while the clock saves
Just enough ticks to lick neck to your lips
Mouth to mouth, palm upon hips
Sigh in pleasure, measures the heat up
Nibble my neck, the affection I eat up
Dine like a diner, hot enough to simmer
Jam comes to a close, come give a
Number of seven in regard to the residents
Told the mob that I slobbed and showed evidence
Lipstick on the quill, a digit to call
Another lovestruck, stuck to the wall
Of the dancehall

""3rd place is everything""
""3rd place is everything""

Steppin over heads that swayed
You move over and the record's played
Swayed over smoothly, soothin a listener
Undergoes wanted death of a dancer
To twist over you rises your liquor
Slight panic on a dancehall picture
Motion flows, scene gets hectic
Freakin bones like an epileptic
Melody moves scenario to chaos
Pursue principles and then you shoot livest
So-called, it's boots that rise and fall

Door is opened, to office summoned

Mockneck or cactus?

She attacked us!
With a treaty for disarmament
We signed
Figured there's no harm in it (""Oh alright alright alright.."")
So I disarmed
And I poured the Scotch
And asked the Prime Minister, mind if I watch?
(""Oh my goodness!"")
Yeah, I reckon
You keep minutes, I'll let you get second
Then the summit rose, I get vetoed
Presidential pardon, let me G yo!
Lunch became filet of soul/sole with tongue

Never done!

Close to close, but Pete freaked it anyway

Prime, let's do the three the hard way!
And knockin like we're knockin
BOOTS!
The office flooded with the sex check suits
Deploy missiles of the MX variety
Spoken spasm of invasion inside of me
I release my rebels, the onslaught ceased

And in the Oval Office
Finally peace!
Motions carried out, played it like Presidents
What's the Oval Office?
Our permanent residence!
Meeting of the mind, as well as the pelvis

3rd Bass,"Here's my advice to all amateurs planning to give a performance
Speak up, and keep the act moving

Servin' the role, a sole step-child
Talk of C-C or keep sleepin'
While wakin' up to noise of third B-A-S-S, Bass
Success is butter for Serch's space
Spoken slang gets played like the lottery
Your lyrics are incorrect, so you step to me
Lookin' for the key to release that first piece
Three times two is six, Pete is one-three
I'm the other half, known as the other trey
Tourin' to wild screams, the Third Son's born
Swarm to the lyrics 'cause Serch is your father
Screaming ""Hey Ladies,"" why bother?

How can you be so stupid?

Sons, slim ones flee from the third
Words, spoken, a silver spoon stuck in the throat
Young useless, lyrically careless
Rhyme revolves around modes of mindless
If everyone spoke of stick-up, it's pick of a Beast'
Prone to a lick of a waste
Taste the flav' of the original
Orphaned trio, abandoned by lyrical
Through us, the echelon exposed with the roll with no soul
Counterfeit style, born sworn and sold
Out with high voice distorted
If a Beast' to wish play fetus, I'd have him aborted

How can you be so stupid?

Put to bed, three kids to a third track
Cap the front and grip, when they heard that
The crew from the L.Q. stepped to the Club Mars
Shook the Beast' and soon to be dubbed stars
Starring roles stone-faced from the brothers
Ludicrous whining, meaning when the others
Stand by em, while they take the fall
The Beast' now lives in the Capitol
Record wrecks sets, Def Jam a true wrecker
The label is nothing but MC Black 'n' Decker
Three boys buggin' to the A.M.
You step to the Serch and I slam!

How can you be so stupid?

Negative mind, paid as snakes who can't rhyme
Play the dude? It's sucker time
I stand I take a bust in my nut
And gave birth to three bastard sons
A record label, a King to 4th letter
Passin' phases, non-legitimate trendsetters
Pop figures, who figured they'd get paid
Exploitin' art the black man made
Played out hardcore flaws, step to stage
Your biggest fan, nine years of age
Broke out cause the swindler took your ducat
No talent on the tune, you might as well suck it

How can you be so stupid?

Yo Serch, you know about that slum I'm speakin' on?
Word is bond Pete, school 'em!
You know about that silver spoon havin'
Buckshot acne showin', L.A. weak-ass sellout
Non-legitimate, tip doggin', Jethro pseudo intellectual
Dust smokin', pretty boy playwright posin'
Folks wiggin', whinin' annoyin' Def Jam reject devil
White bread no money havin' slum village people clonin'

Hearin' and fearin', the momentum of the stutter step
Shook to the left, because the brother slept

Crept into his ego, so he caught a bad one
Switched my next flip, he thought he had some grip
But my grip, is when my fingers curl around the mic
I know what it's like, a dog eat dog world

But I'm a carnivore, out on the parquet floor
Whether ballin', or callin' out a sucker who is lookin' for
Static, me grab it every chance I get
One on one I'll never run and shoot the high off the net

Why are you freezin' me out?
Yo man, 'cause you can't play, you ain't got no handle

Step to wayside, ain't no weak side
Bassline I'm never givin', on the flipside

Grass to a mic like a hand palm rubber
Roll off a finger, you're gum, I rubbed ya
Sweep like a Knickerbocker, the 3rd stops ya
And after dark, I play the part of boot knocker

Twenty-four seven, always out to get some
Slap her on the concrete, bleed til the hand's numb
A way of life found, a rim stuck to a pole
An asphalt jungle, soul in the hole

Yo man, I got next!
Next? You ain't got next man
You go over there in the corner, with Michael Raines
And take a couple of tokes of the pipes man
You know what I'm sayin'?

Point is in effect, callin' for a play out
Lay out the plan, but your scammin' for a way out
Figure of speech, spoken wise for a drum, three on one
Tchk! You know the outcome!

Point up the joints up, straight up for an uproar soarin'
Then you execute the score, then you fade away
This fade has been played
Gave the gift swift, you just got self-made

Execute performance, the 3rd step upon this
Me and Pete, complete, like sex endurance
Tip on the rim you reverse and rehearse
Coachin' but you're slouchin', you can't be first

You want the rock? But you don't got the handle
I drop the French, cause Serch grilled your mantle
Face intense, you're sellin' your soul
Just for the action of soul in the hole

Pavement bounce off metal meets human flesh
Slum onside stagnate you got next
Each day evident, parks brothers throw down
One on one, it boils down to showdown

Spins reverb, soothe he goes a rip slip
By his larceny, or petty theft
Spectators move, lips into motion
Pop shit, get hit, the sewer then becomes an ocean

Water runs, springs and I let it fly
Slide a weak side, into vein
Try to terminate silk textures, of the fingertips
Three bases covered, as I dip

Deeper into repoitoire, the Minister an innovator
Take a sphere and a mic and I'll step later
Under lamps of the Serch, cold
Shootin' lava in the soul in the hole",Soul in the Soul,1989

Ask not, ""What your country can do for you?""
Ask what you can do for your country?""

Avante Garder, not a heretic
Figure out a right rhyme, stick it in my cranium
Pete Nice, elemental like uranium
Throwin' joints, blowin' like a cool breeze
Swimmin' in, I lift on juice, I wax M.C.'s
These hoes go frontin' on my Jimmy
I smack 'em on the back, sit 'em down, say

Gimme some rhythm baby loosen up my collar
(Rhythm)
I'll lay you out, like a funeral parlor
Ready willin', fillin', killin' for a billin', top
I never stop, with search and Sam drillin' it
Soul in the hole, M.C.'s workin'
Kickin' it, vickin', the suckers who be jerkin'
Me and my posse are hardcore, you want some more
Reason that I'm squeezin' your girl
(You never please her)

So I pleased, then I threw her in the gutter
Cut her off, my wisdom wiser so I muster
Rows of all opposed, lows conquer all
Those who pose as dope I say nope, I wear def clothes
Dapper like Dan from, three the hard one
Never stigmatize as a rapper or I'll slap ya
You're stung from my tongue as you run from the drum

Three the hard way, wordz of wisdom

This time there was three
One two three the hard way
This time there was three
One two three the hard way

A branch of the hip-hop tip grills your dome
You're toe ingrown low showin' you ain't got nobody home
Prone to the microphone, light up, and take out
Make out your will Bill, three is gonna break out
The stylee, me and P E T E
Embark on a mission that's deadly, break out the ammo
Aiyyo Sammo, hook up the beat
And I'll lay the plan oh man

You just got taken, I took a head out
Attack on the back of the six of the Guinness stout
Usin' abusin', those of the past tense
Funning gunning, but I'm summing up the nonsense
Three, the hard way, cards laid are okay
Gettin' up and settin' up, just for a payday
The minister, sinister
(I ain't no devil)
Ten snakes circle and scoundrel Sam level

This track to smack, the smile off a doubter
The brother's, another M.C. who's about
Frontin' like he's buntin', deceivin' the delinquent
Rappers on track, bustin' out a medium
For those opposed, who manifest a diss
Pete tell 'em, manifest this
Not righteous, but might just, make you wanna listen
Yo I'm Elvis with the wordz of wisdom

This time there was three
One two three the hard way
This time there was three
One two three the hard way

A Ludacris Buddhist, boo this when I do this
So true to this, perpetrators view this
Style, empirical, lyrical, it's critical
Three the hard way, boy you need medical attention
I'm like a surgeon in my left hand
Hold a microphone like a scalpel so you understand
Wordz of wisdom, woven like a spider
Bitch on my tip, I get busy and I ride her

Uptown, then I drown her like a psycho-pathic
'Cause I'm graphic on the mic I never let go
Light skinner eat dinner like a soul man
Prove with the rhyme I'm down, Sam's hands
Transform strong as a good pitch
(Too strong)
Switch up the wisdom, into word which
Kicks out the benzi in a frenzy it sends me
Up the Bronx river back to Brooklyn apprehends me

Like a D-tech bustin' my man in the projects
I'll send you up north, I ain't givin' respect
Prejudicial, your style artificial
As live as limb that's attached to a criple
It's simple eliminate you like Gotti
(So simple)
I chill in bed-stuy and drive a Mazzeratti
With the body of a freak on my side, how am I livin'?
(How ya livin'?)
Larger than large, with the wordz of wisdom

Hyper-selective, search is attracting
Females who focus on the future, not slacking
Rhythmic it's too quick, feel it, I let it flow
Sam sever seas'll submerge, so let it go
Throughout, or put out, lyrics like a D-valve
Speak up, a deeper meaning as I leak out
And seek out, a three the hard way endeavor
Pete Nice, search, produced by Sam Sever

Livin' in my shoes boy, this is not shoe town
A showdown for Motown, it's a new sound
Lyrics that lick, the tick off a timepiece
Foamin' at the mouth punk, you need a leash
What are you sick? I'm a slick stupid scientist
Rhymin' that you can't comprehend
(But you're buyin' this)
Record I'm wreckin', my homeboys are breakin'
Hopin' that you're copin', no slopin', I'm not takin' no shorts

'Cause I'm playin' the high post
Ask any girl in the place, who's the fly most
Brother with a cover, shootin' to my cribbo
The tease wants a please, girl screamin' ditto
So I did this, I needed the bed rest
Hangin' with the bangin' on the strength, there's no contest
Physically or lyrically, it's my kingdom
Stingin' 'em and bringin' 'em the wordz of wisdom

This time there was three
One two three the hard way
This time there was three
One two three the hard way

Ahh, ahh
All but three of the defendants were found guilty
All but three of the defendants were found guilty
See-ya
Yo yo, that's ridiculous

Cars on the avenue create gridlock
And there's girls like MAD at the bus stop
Not waitin' on the bus, but waitin' on the cash flow
Fellas are laughin', gassin' the past hoe
Girl steps to me and pushes issue
That knot you got, is that money or tissue?
Feelin' on the bulge, thinkin' it's her own
I tell her that it's money and she should move on
She says she's pure from legs to her thighs
And we should talk over some Chinese and fries
I tell her to step, but hey that's the scene

'Cause you're downtown and you're simply too fabulous
But get this, ain't this a humdinger?
She stepped to a retard sportin' a four-finger ring
Somewhere in the skin tight jeans
I'm gonna scoop the best of the Brooklyn-Queens

[Chorus]

Last exit to Brooklyn I enter
Carefully the Queen holds my scepter
Gettin' numb like a Derelict on scotch
I'm Dick Lewis, cause baby I'm watchin' you
scheme on a brother for a knot
To choose between the have and the have-not
Do you doubt the shade of vanilla?
I'll play Elvis and you play Priscilla
Oh he's no hero, better yet Billy Dee
Advertise cheap liquor for a fee
A Brooklyn Queen, rushes Russell Simmons
That's like Tyson rushin' Givens

Brooklyn!

3rd Bass,"Verse 1
3rd bass deals with the first place
of where your mind is
the kind of stuff that you want to smoke blunts with
take pictures, like allen funt would.
snapshots get the crack hot
good to get it, but don't sweat it
cause if you pursue she'll chalk the cue
and boom, stroke the 8 ball
stick and run and were having fun
prickin my cactus like I'm shooting my gun
quickly til it explodes and I unload
the cactus

Verse 2
I stand for lust of quenchin,
G sit on cactus and rotate
enough time to clock a digit
ass so large it won't quit
so I step to kick to
the oval office in my intro
throwin low bass to the third line
a girl on mines a prop
so I found loops to hold
and then a boomin butt to go
to go lo solo readily
it's the cactus behind door 3

Verse 3
The smart villain, chillin like Gilligan
out on an island
fishin with my string and bamboo
caught somethin in a see thru nighty
might be a little tasty A 300 pound white girl
no on to see this, boom I dropped my fluid like a chemist
shes contained and I'm a lame brain
but doing the wild thing
kicked the fat thing off of my swing
larger than Jim Backus it's the cactus

Verse 4
No boots your money spent
last call for toxicants
one move to reach a throttle
eyesight is through a goggle
I trips to the hype type
good looking in the dark light
it's appetizing to conversate 
to a fossil pushing 58 
all bags and her butt sags
in the desert no price tag
a household tool and a stank ho

",The Cactus,1990
3rd Bass,"Alright coming up now another request (this one)
This time from the boys down at Anna's Pizza Paradise
A new arrangement of a great oldie in rhythm and blues

Verse One: Pete Nice (Prime Minister)

In the heart of the city you was born and bred
You grew up smart or you wound up dead
Things moved fast, but you knew the scoop
And your savior was a rhyme and a beat and a rap group
A modern day production of the city street
You said I didn't have it that I couldn't compete
So the sleeper did sleep but the sleeper shoulda woke up
Now you're in my sight, the buddha sess you smoke up
That's the element you carry your rhymes on
That style of rhyme won't let you live long
Cause a strong song to you is what I sent
Cause I'm a product, of the environment

Chorus:

There it is, black and white (2X)

Verse Two: MC Serch

On the streets of far Rockaway Queens
Seagram Boulevard, be	-17
Redfern houses where no MC would ever go
Is where I did my very first show
Had the crowd had the rhymes going, I never fess
(His reward, was almost a bullet in his chest)
And on that stage, is where I first learned
Stick out my chest to be a kid and get burned
You're so foolish, but I think you knew this
That on the the microphone punk I can do this
And doing this, is what life meant
Cause I'm a product, of the environment

Chorus

Verse Three: MC Serch, Pete Nice

Back in the days when kids were mack daddies
Striped Lee jeans, playboys and Caddies
Long Beach, the M.O.K. center
  He almost caught a bad one when he tried to enter
  our way
Bang!
  Bum rush the back door
  Then scatter, onto the dance floor
Me and my boys, skeezin the cuties
Never had static, 'cause everybody knew me
  Local DJ's, tearin up the wax
  And out the corner, some kid gets taxed
After the party, crack open a forty
Vicked it from the store yo the man never caught me
  Went up to the arcade, cranked the bass
  And then the five-oh chased us from the place
Hop on the railroad, play the conductor
Everywhere I went, I always tucked a
marker in my jacket to tag where I went
Cause we were just products, of the environment

Chorus

Verse Four: MC Serch, Pete Nice

I want to tell you something that gets me kind of mad
...it's about my dear old dad
He's tired, and worn, and works a nine to five
Clockin thirty G's a year to survive
  But I know kids who in a month or so
  Make that money sellin ya-yo
Pushin a drug, I can't understand
Destroyin a life with a buck in the hand
  Play rotten slum chain, local street hero
But if you ask Serch, you're just a bunch of zeroes
Too bad cause when you're older, you won't have a cent
Cause you're a product, of the environment

Chorus

Verse Five: Pete Nice

You hear it in the strength of my voice and in my rhythm
Now you know, how I was livin
It happened to me, like it happened to Serch
Prime Minister Pete Nice'll kick the verse
in Bed-Stuy with my boy, Kiwai Height
The K to A Kingston, Wednesday night
To the Empire, show slammin
Open for Dana, crew flammin
Mouth open wide, or listening
Dumb dope with a forty in my system
Unprotected but respected for my own self
Cause of talent, no shade, or nothin else
A time of tension, racially fenced in
I came off (and all the brothers blessed him)
I left more than a mark, I left a dent
Cause I'm a product, of the environment

Outro: K.M.D. and Serch

  Aiyyo Serch, skin is just a color of the mind and the soul
And a brother ain't a brother if his heart is cold, youknwhatI'msayin fellas?
  Word
  And I think we need a positive Kause in a Much Damaged society
  Word up man nubians killin nubians, brothers just don't understand
  Word maybe it's some of that crime that's stoppin the growin
  the drug pollution and all needs to calm down
Word man, cause that's what we need, we need Griff Productions
We need a K.M.D. man to uplift the race and bring Kause in the beginning
  And a Posse called Get Yours
There it is, to all y'all bigots who want us to bend
We're just products of the environment, peace!!
Hopefully...

[Pete Nice]
Dialect spoken, in sectional lesson
The less you know, the more you gotta guess on
I press on point, some sweat my jizznoint
Playin themselves with the fingers the point
I speak slow, I carry a fat stick
Get your kneepads and reapply your chapstick
Step to this, as the Derelict reanimates
No jim hat as my mouth ejaculates
I stays mumble, I speaks jumble
Phonetics on phonograph'll prime your petrol
Retroactive, my knot scale is tipped off
I rip the head off, the Derelict stepped off
and left to show this, to those who typecast
Ill the rhyme-ass trickster or outcast
of intellect, I wreck shit with my own sect
The ace in the hole, I'm the Derelict of Dialect

3rd Bass, but not a bass for slidin
Foundation, for a nation who's mind is 
in motion, goin in fluid
Who did you just distrust? It's Serch and I crush this
mental need for oppression
Oppressed and all vexed and just placed a suggestion
Lesson or loss enforce those in
a spot who got your head frozen
Defrost the eye and spy on the serpent
On act two, he tried to close curtain
But intermission I glimpsed and I clock more
Derelicts watch act three and the encore

Slave drivers on your dollar bills that builds upon your ignorance
Significant, you never beat one-two one-two semblence
Since I ain't supposed, no boastin
I'm keepin soaps in my mouth like coke stem
For the silence of the swine, sittin slick on my slim chews
Liquor on the lamp, sippin booze as a cow moves
Lose my head over speak of a censor
Morse code but Three had no family credenza
Friends of mine align swine on the backstab
Grabbin greedy, now it's Rikers or rehab
My walkin stick just flips, it's a stick up
Misdirected like Charlie Babbitt, mixed up
Three-fifths, three-fifths, like this
He used to roll, a man with three-fifths, a man without his soul
So is this equal or blowin up your ass
smoke sticks who got your vote and rather slit your throat

No no no, green eggs and swine
But they keep edgin to my plate, I step back and say,
""Thanks, cause I just ate,"" not that I would eat it
even if I was hungry -- all the ills of the streets
that could have done me in I stay clear of all the evil all the envy
And ex-homeboys who used to be friendly
Pretend to be down, but changin real fast
So heed the word, heed the word of my FOOT up your ass
Kickin a bone out, castin a stone out
Makin water ripple but got nothin the middle
So now you sit there, makin big waves
Talkin about my ancestors used to be from caves
It's time to wake up, bake the cake, and turn the page
For now is the birth, the birth of the mind age
We you and me -- all in a new time zone
and give you somethin much better to dine on

My loops and loops and rhymes you never censor
I'm scramblin eggs on your family credenza
Attend to your owns or you're blown to bits
You're eatin green eggs while I'm swallowin the grits
You sits on your bony ass I'm passin on the rhythm, I give em
Gassin me, you try to geez I'll SWING em
Like a 40 ounce the choice is constitutional solutions
arrest in domes of ignorannce full
I'm dickin down swine, I stick my neck out
Give a slap here, and shorty'll put your head out
Five G's explicitly you see the story tells
You put a sticker on my record and my record sells
Sam I am not, with the not but Sam Sever is
So the critics all think they know what clever is
I never seen you 40'd up at the corners Pops
So what a Senator knowin about hip-hop?

Branded for educated street credentials
And can't talk about life's bare essentials
Put it to plate, cause the plate they won't deny it
But won't give you a chance, or even a place to buy it
Cry for freedom, but music's not free, it's choking
Could never could ever could say what needs to be spoken

Set to decide, who's on the inside track
but you slack and so another dive
and you lounge - but who's shoes would you be in?
Wake up, it's time to respect the Nubian
flag of a people, fightin every day
for their own say, so children can go out to play
And stray from the tyranny, while blood is drippin be	
I ain't no flapjack, don't bother flippin me
I stick to this, so say this while you're grazin
Original man's a black man, said by a caucasian
Watchin a culture be stolen from Asia
Whether minor or major, science I swayed y'all
with lingo, some people don't think so
When do you stop sayin - that's the way things go?
Time to manifest the quest that's hard to digest
The companies are frontin Pete, why don't they divest
and invest in freedom, but they scheme on a brother
Stealin trunk jewelry that's MILES undercover
So discover as a people, we have to take our place
There is no master plan because there is no master race

Science for seasons, years and days
A preacher follows his prejudice, the drummer plays
off the evils of men, love bones and flesh
A brother's keeper keeps puttin peace to rest
Question props and the prophets agreed, ya heed
Dust to dust, herbs yieldin seeds of
creation of cultures to street sound
You get run around but I run the booty down
No master plan, the masses all struggle
Slug movements bungle, our serpent is subtle
Hatred born in diversity of culture spoke
Ignorance got the last straw, the camel's broke
Change up wisdom wise and stick to tools
One called slavemaster's son by a poor fool
I ain't the hypocrite fit with the two-face

into that all-about-me frame of mind
And keep the truth away from the blind
You gotta find out who is who and who built this place
I play spy and try to destroy the race
We go the wrong way, the wrong play master
The same people that got the +Gas Face+ last year
Tears shed as another head gets put to bed
Paradise is a paradox, the devil's ridin sleds
over skulls, that dulls all the truth
It's the reason why we need to raise the roof
to look to the heavens as the master's one plan
We stand to help the birth, of just one man
The master's plan, the master's race shackled to a shelf
in a book that you need to find for yourself

So why you tryin to play one as inferior
Fears in hearts of the ignorant belligerents
Ever since those convinced of lost innocence
Got off the tip slippin sticks and stones
Homes are broken or fractured like bones
Who holds your soul as the master your dollar spent
Evidence of dictators gone hellbent
In times of old the races vicked power many places
separate races in segregated spaces
Back in the day you turned your backs on
Deals in doom, so now the deally lays the cracks on
Sold more then sold forth from South to North
Swingin low on supremacy's corpse
Of course not steppin out of place is in place

Begin to get slim as he's sexin you in
He moves deeper, asleep is what you thought he was
But he went bolo, so low you felt and that's because
the minute he got in and violated you and became ill;
treated you just like a Flush'n'Fill

Dismiss the myth, that evil is not black 
But opposite spectrum, this done by red man 
With horns on his head, laid down the ill plan 
Got all his helpers, said, ""Make it snappy! 
Tell all the people that their hair can't be nappy!"" 
Blonde and blue-eyed, or dark-skinned half a G 
A disease, created by leprosy 
Don't speak of bleach, bend them to right 
Say, ""It was night WAY before the light"" 
Put aside spooks, Serch leaves a trace 
I've set 'em correct with the effect of the Gas Face 

Next up Don 

A Gas Face, can either be a smile or a smirk 
When appears, a monkey wrench to work one's clockwork 
Perkin his brim to the rim of my cup 
Don't tempt me, you're empty, so fill'er up! 
Is I'm talkin' coffee or cocoa, is you loco? 
Cash or credit for unleaded at Sunoco 
KMD and 3rd Bass is just ace in the hole 
I mean soul, so make the Gas Face (ha) 
Damn, if looks could kill 
You look like host was a ghost from your grill 
But still, what's the new fed, to recollect 
To our passing phase to facades to Eddie Decker 
For my label reads Hood, street might have a tattoo 
Don't pick any card or no rabbit from my hat 
Never a magician if I ever tricked 'em 
""Oh shit!"" Another Gas Face victim 

There it is, yo fellas man 
Why don't you step to the mic man? 

That's how I kicks it, for Eddie Decker 

Ey yo, good lookin' out Don man peace 
Punji, yo who gets the Gas Face? 
Little Vic for the Gas Face 
Tony Dick, gets the Gas Face 
No Gas Faces for Plugs One Two and Three 
No Gas Face for Professor Prince Pa-paul!

No Gas Face for DJ Subroc 
No Gas Face for KMD

3rd Coast String Quartet,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone 
This bird had flown 
So I lit a fire

And this old world will keep on turning

There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

A little high, little low

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me

Gallileo, Gallileo
Gallileo Figaro, magnifico

I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me

Bismillah! We will not let you go, let him go

Will not let you go, let me go (never)
Never, never, never, never, never let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

3rd Storee,"Ever since we were kids the love we had was real
Everything that we did we let each other know the deal
When we would walk to school we had each others back
We were inseparable and strength where we would lack

On that day when they called and let me know the news
I began to cry tears for you
Even though the time we shared is a time that I will miss
But there's an emptiness of the bliss that once existed

How can I tell her that I love her if she doesn't know me
How can I tell her what she means if she cannot dream
How can I show her that she's beautiful if she cannot see me
How does she know she makes me cry if she's not alive

I remember people saying give them their flowers
While they yet live so they can see them
But you never think that day could ever come to hit you
Because the love you had was strong and invincible

But remember God is the creator
And he has the power to shake her and take her
Even though the time we shared is a time that I will miss
There's an emptiness of the bliss that once existed

On that day when they called and let me know the news
I began to cry tears for you
Even though the time we shared is a time that I will miss

How can I tell her that I love her if she doesn't know me
How can I tell her what she means if she cannot dream
How can I show her that she's beautiful if she cannot see me
How does she know she makes me cry if she's not alive

Though I get lonely I know she's with me
'Cause death can't take my special lady from me
God guide me along in Your will
'Cause I know Heaven is real

How can I tell her that I love her if she doesn't know me
How can I tell her what she means if she cannot dream
How can I show her that she's beautiful if she cannot see me
How does she know she makes me cry if she's not alive

3rd Storee,"Walking inside of a dream
Where love is highly esteemed
Taking a chance with my heart
Praying it travels far

Then she says to me, ""Why do you fear?
Why would you dream if you could not live?
Open your eyes, see what is real
I'll take it from there, now breathe if you will""

You've ignited the flame in my life
Now I can see again
I celebrate that you are in my life
Now I can breathe again

Roses are smiling at me
As if to say they share my glee
Violets then sigh as they gaze
As if they know that my day has been made

There she goes again tear in her eye
Whispering songs that make us cry
She says three words that make me feel
That I'm not in a dream and she's all so real

You've ignited the flame in my life
Now I can see again
I celebrate that you are in my life
Now I can breathe again

Thinking of love you is fantasy
Knowing I love you is destiny
Finding that someone creates harmony
Keeping the same is matrimony

You've ignited the flame in my life
Now I can see again
I celebrate that you are in my life
Now I can breathe again

You've ignited the flame in my life
Now I can see again
I celebrate that you are in my life

I couldn't live a day without you
Well I tried to write a special song

To explain the way you make you feel inside
Thought the meaning may be simple
And the words may not be new
I couldn't make it clearer if I tried

And I couldn't live a day without you

More than anyone I ever know
I need you
And I want to build my world around you
I need you
I need you
Well I sang the words and realized
It had all been said before
So I tried a different rhyme that meant the same
But it didn't have the feeling
And the first one said much more
So I guess I'll have to say it once again

And I couldn't live a day without you

Highside to the fullest, creepin up out tha house wit my mug on me
Lexus kinda clean crease in my jeans
Ready ta hit dis, want everybody to get wit dis
It's goin down tonight, up in the town tonight
Rollin vegas on omega wit tha chronic sin
Rolex on my wrist because I produce hits
Got them groupies havin fits when I'm ridin past
Tank full of gas, pocket full of cash
Sideshow's goin down tonight, made a right on 73rd

Crack that hen, I'm worldwide like a fifth of gin
Plus I'm in it to win, (realize), check it I'm checkin yo' chin

On my collar, as I took another swallow
told tha trick to follow, let's kick flow a matic sky
ridin hard then Helen, and they forgot that they was trailin
there wadn't no getaway
But now, at the club, smooth sailin wit my eb's bailin
Freakin it, all in the door worked up a sweat

Krazy juice to show it be highside when we ride

[Verse Three]
Fresh out the club with a dub
On the smelly ever and ready ta hit the hot tub or the telly
Got my groove on, a twist of lime blended right
Remy XO wit my lexo at the light

Trick a nickle bag I need a 20 sack and the lime
On time when prop a position, a pimp livin
Kenneth Coles wit my bank roll, knee deep in my linen
Right befidery times puttin down fo' the 96 bumpin hoes

So ride this, West Coast till ya croak

An if you come back from that stompin
Lay low

but if they don't ride paasss me
Lil voice in my head sayin hit the gas G, go fastly
Through the back streets through the cuts n trucks of East Oakland
You see pimpin and ho-in L-E-O got the dank smokin'
These pigs on the back of my lex ain't knowin
The way my dollars and flex is flowin, I guess they came up Charlie
'cause the rode right pass, and I kept ridin' bumpin Bob Marley
To the shop to get my top dropped, pine and stereo incredible knock
You could here me comin all the way up the block
Cocaine like sittin on thangs with shocks
with a glock, bet I'll be hittin yo block
Packin heat like ground beef roasted channels, strapped with a gat
Juss packed with ammo, neva pretend on breakdown indo
Throw the 'bacco out the window, flowamatically countin see-notes
Automatically countin people, hit 'em up, get 'em up, bumpers dig 'em up
Hit 'em up wid a hollow tip till they can't feel shit man I'm so sick

Toke and get thrown, before you get smoked by my Fo' Fo'

Had it been my, 4 percent as I loc one in, provoking ya whole set with mess
So scandalous that ya homies didn't do shit
blow his candle, look can ya handle this
Nigga at 145 miracle dipped with chemicals and bury ya minerals half alive
Energized by naked lies, douse that between fuse these niggaz be payin they dues
But some niggaz roll 'em and cruise, so I stack 'em and stick 'em in twos
Like bullets ??? let the bodies refuse so they ??? pick and choose
At the house with a strap and a bottle of booze, intention to get my cash on

[Verse 1:]
Now see it was Monday afternoon
Very first day of school
Back of the class makin' girls laugh
Teacher's mad 'cause I'm cuttin' a fool
I'm just doin' what I usually do
Errything's cool, chillin' with the crew
Sayin' ""finally, the bell's bouta ring""
That's when this new student walked in the room
My jaw dropped, I felt my heart stop
She's flaw to flaw
This girl's so raw
So this girl got me hooked like a bra
Like climax, man I paused
See this girl is sick like the flu
Wish I knew who she was
She's hot like curry, my vision is blurry
But why should I worry

[Chorus 2x:]
'Cause I'm a G
Can't let her get to me
But her voice sounds sweeter than a symphony
But I know, know that eventually
She'll find someone else and forget of me

[Hook:]
But I'm a G
(I'm a G)
I'm a G
(I'm a G)
So what could it be
(What could it be)

[Verse 2:]
Now later on got home set down my bags
Got homework, chores: need to take out trash
But see this girl's got me all off task
My hearts beaten fast who could I ask?
Got the phone called Tez
He said ""Lloyd what's crackin'?""
I said ""Dawg you won't e'en believe what happened.""
""I'm chillin' and this girl walked up in the class and
Swear she look just like Janet Jackson
So should I write a letter to her
Or should I send a messenger
I tried to vibe and connect with her
But I didn't have enough guts to step to her
And I really want the best of her
But can I get the rest of her?""
So he told me ""Lloyd don't sweat it.""
And I said ""You're right. Forget it.""

[Chorus 2x:]
Because I'm a G
Can't let her get to me
But her voice sounds sweeter than a symphony
But I know, know that eventually
She'll find someone else and forget of me

4 Non Blondes,"What a wonderful hesitation 
Who would bear to feel sorry for me 
Dropped another pill just to calm me 
Collapsed to my knees and fell fast into sleep 

There I was drifting 
Way out into the sunshine 
Expecting to crash but I'm tied to a string 

Look at me I'm a tangled puppet 
I might be a mess but I'm sure can survive 
Find myself awake counting sad days 

One, two, three that's too many for me 
Dropped another pill just to find me 
Reached for my hand but it was already there 

Then I started believin'
That I fell out of a tiny raindrop 

That lost its way when I decided to roam 
Chasing me was a hungry dweller 
But I had escaped it by pretending to die 

Come follow me you won't expect the illusion 
You'll see it's my imagination 
Hand me your eyes 

I will put them in front of mine 
You'll see a little better 
You'll see a little better 

What a wonderful destination 
Where I am now 
I can no longer see

My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers

In restless dreams I walked alone

When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light

People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share

Take my arms that I might reach you""

Sobbing with narrowed eyes.
He knows that stones will hurt but anyway
He's fixed on the other side.

To fight the other gang.
Their cheers suddenly filled the air
And a stone left my hand.

The clash of the both sides.
All the fighthing boys all the noise
And no place to hide.

Strolling down the backstreets, 
Football in the rain.
I would give anything to do this again.

Well I remember my first kiss, 
A dark room and a stolen lipstick.
One first little touch of love
Although it disappeared so quick.
First beer, first cigarettes in the yard behind the
Home
Of the old man in the wheelchair who lived there alone.

Playing hide-and-seek every single week
We had time and we were free.
Never had no sorrow for tomorrow
No worries for you and me.

Staring at real women fully naked,

I'm in love, yeah, with a gangster, yeah

Hey, now my wife she won't stop blowin' my phone up
Every bitch conversation they keep throwin' tha Jones up
It makes it hard I'm tryna show her I've grown up
But deep down inside she know I will never give them ho's up

She talk marriage but ya boy froze up, cold feet
Man she knows I'm in love wit' these cold streets
So I'm flowin' threw tha night, just left my bitch house
I'm going home to my wife as I live this double life

It started as a crush for years wishin' I could fuck her
Next thing I got caught up, she had me trippin' like a mushroom
Shit became fucked up 'cause we both became love-struck
I be out commitin' crimes, she be still up on my mind

Now I'm tryna shake it off, she still drippin' through tha brain
You know I fean for her like a hit of that Cocain
She say my thug is like drugs and she need her a rehab
And she strung out over love when she see me see relapse

Even if his pants hang low or some times he'll even rock corn rows
Lord knows my everything and I gotta gotta let' em let 'em know

Now that we argue every night, tha most horrible of fights
If I get caught cheatin', you gon' carve me wit' a knife
But let's take it back when we use to party every night
I thought you of all people would know it's hard to live my life

I say I'm in tha studio, you say you wit' some groupie hoes
We going back and forth, goddamn, this ain't a movie, yo
I'm not tha one for complainin', be mentally drainin'

Know it might seem I'm sellin' y'all a pipe dream

Got 'em on a triple beam takin' trips with the bricks

Or watch niggas with weight with cake in they wallet
Raping they pockets and taking they projects

You gotta go triple to say that it's my shit

40 Miles Out,"Rain, such a simple thang
Every drop, a different stop
But they all come from the same
God is the cloud
And we are the rain
That's why I sometimes feel
That somehow we are the same
 
Whenever I lay my head to sleep
There's a strong thought that keeps haunting my mind
Careless whispers of a nation
That somehow was caught trapped in the dark
And nowhere to go
I know my thoughts are tellin' me

Gotta be a part of me
I can feel it
Gotta be a part of me
In my heart, in my soul
Gotta be a part of me
The world must be callin' me
And my world comes from within

Life has no guarantees
That you'll keep what you have
Even though you're blessed with then
That's why I'm feeling
Some fear for the world
With all the grief and misery
How much real time is there

The sooner I take more responsibilities
I can truly say
I am grateful for my world
The irony of tryin' to do the right thing
Is whatever you do, some will undo
And sometimes destroy
And there's someone still left in darkness
And you say

Gotta be a part of me
I can feel it
Gotta be a part of me
In my heart, in my soul
Gotta be a part of me
The world must be callin' me
And my world comes from within

The world is what we make it
What we see today
Are the results of the mistakes they made yesterday
And what we see tomorrow
Will be the results of what we do today
It's a shame that peace and respect
Has been replaced with money and power
The children, they are the futures
So teach them how to love themselves
And they will love others
Don't you see, love - that's the key

Gotta be a part of me
I can feel it

And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny

A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster

No matter your rag color, deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time, somebody up there still love us

Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryna stack
And keep up with the Joneses, takin' advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut 'til it's right
When there's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if your're poor and righteous
I know times seem strife, and problems seem endless
But at the times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together
And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it
'Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother

Chorus: Malika, P.S. 

All I want to do is spend some time with you. 

And all I want to do is bump 'n grind with you. 

Can we get together when the time is cool? 

It's alright with me, if it's alright with you. 

Verse 1: P.S. 

When I first met you, wasn't lookin' for a wife 

just somebody, to keep a nigga warm in the night. 

Since you was down, freakin', we can do some meetin', 

parlayin', I got half on the boom in the trunk. 

But you gotta understand girl, I'm a man girl, 

don't go gettin' yourself mixed up in somethin' you can't handle. 

So, if it's good to you, like it's good to me 

then we can kick it, but I ain't tryin' to be in no commitment. 

I got too much stress dealin' with the system 

and tryin' to provide a house and home for my children. 

Cause women be trippin', when they don't get no attention, 

and I ain't in the position, 

so you can't take care the loot, it's yo decision.

It's alright with me, if it's alright with you. 

Verse 2: Malika 

Talk for a minute, but don't wear my ears out, 

I want some time, you want to grind, we gon have to work this out. 

I never said I love you, I'm just not your hoe, 

and you gon have to show, you got some somethin' for a sister grow. 

I want to post up twenty foreplay, Bombay, 

bump the O.J. sixty-nine ways. 

Gotta keep it real cause there ain't no future in this. 

I want to talk, you want to stick, 

kiss the lips, hit it quick. 

I got news for you, we bout to compromise, 

boo, you even see the thighs, you gon have to spend 

a lotta time tryin' to paperchase. 

But you gon have to break me off 

for that tryin' to play me off, 

don't mistake me to be soft.

All I want to do is spend some time with you.

It's alright with me, if it's alright with you.

We can bump 'n grind but not for free. 

Well, you better get a hustle or a j-o-b. 

Verse 3: P.S. 

All of a sudden want to play me like Willie Lumplover. 

Ain't nothin' like a thief, I saw the game comin'. 

Say you got one, 

three months in the oven, 

and you need a nigga to break you off somethin'. 

But Mrs. Butterworth, tell me what it's worth, 

want me to play like I played in a church, 

but I ain't even got it, if I did I wouldn't do it. 

It was cool, but let's call it a truce, and come anew. 

Cause I know you ain't pregnant, that's just a weapon women sometimes 

use to keep their nigga from steppin'. 

Take the good with the bad and the bad with the good, 

I thought you understood you was fuckin' wit a nigga from the hood. 

I'm a type of man that understand your needs, 

but I can't pay you cause I got too many mouths to feed. 

So what you want to do, you gotta let me know, 

cause females come quicker than the metro.

You ain't never lyin'. I knew she wasn't right cause

Ooh la la doo-wa-diddy (Woo-woo!)
Can I get close to the kitty?

Are you sure that we alone, all alone? (Yeah!)
Lock the door and unplug the telephone (Telephone!)
Light some candles let me get a look at your handles (Ooh-wee!)
You got a body like a sex scandal
So, I puts the cotton ball in the Q-Tip patch
Turn around and let me see you from the back, ah shat! (Damn!)
You know you bring out the freak in me
I go deep in the peak, I hope you think of me
Whenever you need some sexual healing 
We like two in a million
Don't fight the feelin
You ain't dealin with no rookie
Yes I got a lot of nuts in my Tollhouse cookie
Call up your bookie, put your money on the cement
I'm puttin in work like a tag team free man
I spark through the woods like a Recon
And we can do it all night with the lights on

What's up on some lovin, babay?
We can roll in my sixty-three
And drink Hennessy
What's up on some lovin, babay?
Don't you want to roll with me?
You and me can cream

We can put it on a platter, girl, it don't matter
I make it hot and you can pop it like a firecracker
In the bedroom, bathroom, livin room
Outside in the yard, it's a full moon
In the car, in the front seat, back seat
On the trunk, on the hood, and it's all good
I'll be the piece and you can be the booty
And I'll work extra duty to please your coochie
You can lay me on the bed and cuff me up
Spread honey on my chest, but don't rough me up
Dig your nails in my back, girl, play yo game
You never come the same if we say yo name
Is it real or a dream
You make me scream
When you rub my body with shaving cream
Stick your tongue down my throat and give me a kiss (Mmm-waah!)
'Cause you know it don't get no better than this (That's right!)

[Chorus:]

What's up on some lovin, babay?

Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
and shake your ass on the carpet like the old school
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to 
and give a loc a little dap when he walks through

Verse 1:
If there be a dope beat then all y'all see
Get up out your seat and let me see yo technique
Freak yo physique and you betta not compete
Make it hot and sweaty like twenty deep in a jeep
Never comin' cheap, forty creep
And I hope you don't mind if I borrow a few things while you go to sleep
I steal money from the rich 
And give it to the poor, it's
Coolio loco and ghetto witch doctor super, you are
Bring it from the back and bring it to the front
Cause you gotta give the people what they want
Now hump, do the stomp to the butt
Big homie shake your gut
As long as you get your ass up
It's a party over here
and let me make it clear
40 Thevz is the crew 
So you better come anew
Ain't a damn thing change since the first one
And if you didn't hear the album go get one (One)

Are you ready to throwdown?

Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
and give a loc a little dap when he walks through.

Verse 2:
Here come the thief on the old school beat
And I never knew the meaning of the word ""defeat""
The master of disguise want to see the people's eyes
Yet, fools try to deny that the ?man? can fly
Just cook 'em all up like gumbo
And block their ass like Mutumbo
Cause your album dropped off the charts like Dumbo
We are new and improved to make you put on your boogie shoes
Like K.C. and the Sunshine Band, or the Wu-Tang Clan
I go way back like Vegas, Nixon, Noreaga
It's the tennis shoe players fat box on the quiet station
Now what if hip hop was like Humpty Dumpty sittin' on the wall
And what if hip hop had to take a great fall
And what if rhyme was a crime   
And each and every time
That you spit a dope line
You might have to do some time
Most of these clowns will be tryin' to skip town
But Coolio will be ready for the showdown

Chorus:
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to
and shake your ass on the carpet like the old school
Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down' like your 'posed to
and pass a joint to the loc when he roll through

Verse 3:
If the shoe fit, put it on and stick
And if your ass uncash don't let your mouth write no check
Fools be in the bars unadvanced with a switch
Uppercuts and fight kicks with Weird Al Yankovich
From Tokyo to Sojo, rollin wit the 4-0
This hip hop that I'm holdin' I'll make it move your hoe
It's the Vandino, everything but rhyme's broken
Breakin' a nigga with first position at the open
You can't understand how I do it
I'm just true to it
I let my pen flow across the paper like it was made affluent
Uh, let it ring, let it rip
Everybody holler like Marvin Gaye, but don't you let the record skip
Synchronize the watch, cause the party don't stop
Till the neighborhood watch call the cops
It's the wild ass festival, coast line veteran
Once again droppin' bombs on yo section (On yo section)

Well, get on down like your 'posed to

Are you ready to throwdown?

Are you ready to throwdown?
Yes we are!
Well, get on down like your 'posed to

Are you ready to throwdown?

40 Thieves,"Now I've seen places and faces
And things you ain't never thought about thinkin'
If you ain't peeped then you must be drinkin' and smokin'
Pretending that you're loc'in but you're broken, let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life
And Tamika 'round the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy, 'cause, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya, I know I can't trust ya
'Cause my crew is rollin' Hummers and your crew is rollin' dusters
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more
I guess that's just the way it goes
I ain't tryin' to preach, I believe I can reach
But your mind ain't prepared, I'll see you when you get there

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

More temptation than faith, I guess we livin' for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet, by a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin' lifted
I'm just tryin' to take care of my kids and handle my business
'Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught slippin' when they come and do all the gettin'
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Some of us gotta run a little faster 'cause we gotta later start
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
If everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter your rag color, deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time, somebody up there still love us
I'ma scuffle and struggle until I'm breathless and weak
I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there waitin' with the sounds bumpin'

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

You need to loosen up and live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin'
For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryna stack
And keep up with the Joneses, takin' advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut 'til it's right
When there's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if your're poor and righteous
I know times seem strife, and problems seem endless
But at the times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together
And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it
'Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lie down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big
I guess I'll see you when you see me

I'll (I'll) see (see) you (you) when you get there (when you get there)

How could I forget you smiled and looked at me 
The soft of your lips, they captured me 
The whole ride down we kept our eyes on each other 
And then we sat, down together

I thought I wouldn't call at all

You wanted me to be faithful, I told you I could be it

Asked you who was on the phone, put the horn down

Uh, come on, it ain't your birthday, it ain't your birthday
Uh, come on, it ain't your birthday, it ain't your birthday

Most things you own, don't mean to moan but it's not OK, boy
Don't think I don't know boy

You had your chance with me

When there's nowhere to go?
Life must be a living hell to you
Only time will show

There with no clothes or food to eat
So filled with shame
Each tear that sits upon your face
I know them by name

When will you stop to hear that voice inside
That you tried to hide
No one can save you but you

Hope you find your way home
'Cause my heart is beating
Waiting for your safe return

China girl
Everybody loves you
All those hearts are breaking
It's not the same since you've been gone

Each night you feel the need to hold
Someone you don't know
To replace the emptiness inside
Start heading home

Your place was never on the street
You ignored your call
Did you know that pride was in the way
Before you'd fall?

When will you stop to hear that voice inside
That you tried to hide?
No one can save you but you

Hope you find your way home
'Cause my heart is beating
Waiting for your safe return

It's not the same since you've been gone

I'm asking you if I could find
Just where you had to sleep tonight
I wonder did you eat today
Did you get on your knees and pray?

To free you from this misery
That's not how life's supposed to be
No need for you to carry shame
There's no one person here to blame

411,"Her eyes, they glisten in the sun
As she watches the day become night
As the dark draws in
And then she takes a flute and plays a song
Melodies from days that have gone by

And as she looks in the water
He's smiling back at her
And in her heart she knows the time is close
For her soul to move on from this earth

It's been a long time waiting
To see his face and to feel his love again
No more crying, soon you'll be flying
To a place where forever begins

Flying to forever, forever
To a place where forever begins

She remembers a time when he was there
They were blissfully unaware
That their time was near
For the man that she loved was to go away
He'd been called to a better place
Far, far away from here

And as she looks in the water
He's smiling back at her
And in her heart she knows, her eyes they show
The dreams of the way things once were

It's been a long time waiting
To see his face and to feel his love again
No more crying, soon you'll be flying
To a place where forever begins

Two lovers pray they'll meet again
On the other side
She feels no pain, she's strong again
Where the angels fly

And as she looks in the water
He's smiling back at her
And in her heart she knows, her eyes they show
The dreams of the way things once were

It's been a long time waiting
To see his face and to feel his love again
No more crying, soon you'll be flying
To a place where forever begins

Been a long time waiting
To see his face and to feel his love again
No more crying, soon you'll be flying

To forever, forever

She's got a man who doesn't love her

Now he hits her and he beats her

And now she's lying in a hospital bed

Squeeze yourself, kiss yourself

On all your tears and all your tension

I never ever thought the day would come
When I would be the lucky one

To see you hurt, to see you cry
Gives my soul a natural high
Think about the times you walked on me
The teardrops came to set me free

You seem to bring the pain, no more to gain
I'm out this situation
You were the rock to hold me down
You were the cause of my frustration

Now I see you cry, you wipe your eyes
You promised me you've changed
But in the end you're still the same
How can a player change his game?

In his eyes there is no light

Selling her body just to make ends meet
Everyday is the same sad story
She prays but no one answers back
Her soul never had a chance
Don't you laugh at her misfortune
Anyone can take a fall
If you were walking in those footsteps
You wouldn't laugh at all

[Chorus]
What if it was you standing on the street
What if it was you without enough to eat
What if it was you with nothing else to lose
What if it was you standing in those shoes
What if it was you all alone out there
Didn't have a choice, didn't a prayer
What if it was you down on your luck
What if it was you and no one gave a fuck

He's there everyday
Asking hey Mister can you spare some change
Why don't you get a job
Is all they say
You live with no such thing as pride
You're fighting just to stay alive
Don't you laugh as his misfortune
Anyone could take his place
If you were walking in those footsteps
Would you feel the same

[Repeat Chorus]

What if everyday you woke up without knowin' how you gon' eat
Where you gon' sleep
What if hard times hit you
Would you be so quick to judge another
Judge your brother
Or would you feel how it would be in their shoes
Don't you laugh at her misfortune
Anyone can take a fall
If you were walking in those footsteps
You wouldn't laugh at all

Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me

You'll find another
And I'll be here

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland

In a phrase how I feel

Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Ay!Ay! cariño.
Apaga y vamonos que es lo mismo.

Qué hacemos con la conciencia del entendido?

Ya vi el cascanueces, con su pas de deux.
El mismo escenario, la misma función.
Nos sobra la clave, bailemos un son.

Apaga y vámonos, ¡Ay hombre!
Que los maderos son del monte.
Apaga y vámonos, ¡Ay hombre!
Con tanta necedad dan ganas de llorar, ¡si hombre!

Ay! Ay! cariño,
Qué hacemos con los que ofrecen villa y castillo?
Ay! Ay! cariño,
Apaga y vámonos que es lo mismo.

Lo mismo otra vez!

La misma mentira y el mismo café.
El mismo discurso y el mismo cliché.

Cuando menos lo pensaba
Caí redondo, como una guanábana, sobre la alcantarilla
Será la presión o me ha subido la bilirrubina

Y me entró la calentura
Y me fui poniendo blanco como bola de naftalina
Me llevaron a un hospital de gente (supuestamente)
En la Emergencia, el recepcionista escuchaba la lotería
(treinta mil pesos!)

Alguien se apiade de mi!
Grité perdiendo el sentido
Y una enfermera se acercó a mi oreja y me dijo
""Tranquilo, Bobby, tranquilo""

Me acarició con sus manos de Ben Gay y me dijo
""Qué le pasa, atleta?""
Y le conté con lujo de detalles lo que me había sucedido

Hay que chequearte la presión
Pero la sala está ocupada y, mi querido
En este hospital no hay luz para un electrocardiograma

Abrí los ojos como luna llena y me agarré la cabeza
Porque es muy duro
Pasar el Niágara en bicicleta

No me digan que los médicos se fueron
No me digan que no tienen anestesia
No me digan que el alcohol se lo bebieron
Y que el hilo de coser
Fue bordado en un mantel

No me digan que las pinzas se perdieron
Que el estetoscopio está de fiesta
Que los rayos X se fundieron
Y que el suero ya se usó
Para endulzar el café

Me apoyé de sus hombros como un cojo a su muleta
Y le dije ""Qué hago, princesa?""
Y en un papel de receta me escribió muy dulcemente
(mi princesa, qué va a ser de mí?, uh)
""Lo siento, atleta""

Me acarició con sus manos de Ben Gay y siguió su destino
Y oí claramente cuando dijo a otro paciente
""Tranquilo, Bobby, tranquilo""

Bajé los ojos a media asta y me agarré la cabeza
Porque es muy duro
Pasar el Niágara en bicicleta

No me digan que los médicos se fueron
No me digan que no tienen anestesia
No me digan que el alcohol se lo bebieron
Y que el hilo de coser
Fue bordado en un mantel

Un conuco, un gallo y un lucero

Y la luz de la mañana
Que entra por mi ventana, cielo
Y los ríos y la montaña
Y el viento que peina tu pelo
Yo quisiera ofrecerte el mundo y no puedo

Nada me tienes que ofrecer
Tu mirada es lo único que quiero
Dormiremos cuando el día
Se acueste encima del potrero

Y los grillos harán su canto
Entre yerba y pasto soñaremos
Y de tanto amor tu cuerpo
Hará de mi vientre lo que espero
Un retrato de tu cariño, te quiero",Amor Conuco,1987
4:40,"Yo era de un barrio pobre

yo estudiante de la UASD
ella Suma Cum Laude
yo Suma Dificultad

de lino y de franela

yo me enamoro de ella, ay oye

yo a veces juego billar
ella almuerza en El Lina
yo en un comedor social

Tiene en su residencia
un sauna, una piscina
en mi pensión dos cubetas
para mojarme la vida

Ella en bienes raíces
hereda la Capital
yo tengo que hacer magia
para trabajar

Pero el amor se anida
y no sabe de cuentas
y cada día que pasa
yo me enamoro de ella, ay oye

Me enamoro de ella
me enamoro de ella
de sus ojos claros

sin principio ni final

de lino y de franela

yo me enamoro de ella

Me enamoro de ella
me enamoro de ella
de sus ojos claros

Si ella cediera un poco
mi vida fuera ideal
bájate de esa nube
y deja de soñar

Es que el amor se viste
de lino y de franela

yo me enamoro de ella, ay oye

It only lasts a season then it's gone

Depending on a strength beyond my own

For even through my weakness
I am learning to believe
That through my silent faith
Somebody will see

When I am gone what will they say
When I am gone
Will I leave behind a witness
That will carry on

When all the works and deeds that I have done
Quickly fade into the past
Lord, let Your fire burn steadfast
When I am gone

I look around me and see the darkness
Within a world where few are set apart
And then I wonder, have I been faithful
To share the hope that lives within my heart

For when I tell another
What the Savior's love can do
They just might be the one
To reach out to You

Remains so strong and sure

Still Your healing mercies flow

You always know

And Lord I wouldn't second guess
Your mighty plan
For I know You have a purpose
That's beyond the scope of man

If You look inside my heart You will find
That I have always been the trusting kind
Oh, but still I wonder

Why do the rainy days have to come?
When the storm clouds hide the sun
I wanna know why?

Why when the reasons aren't clear to me
When it all is a mystery
I want to know why?

And though down here I may not understand
I won't let go of the unseen hand
For it holds the reasons why

The Lord has never been afraid of honest prayers
And He won't allow the burden
To be more than you can bear

And I admit that even sometimes
I've imagined I was Paul
On the road to Damascus

I hear Him speak unspoken words of life

I hear His voice
Every time I hear a newborn baby cry
When I hear the sparrow singing
At the dawn of morning light

I hear His voice
When I hear the thunder echo through the sky
When I hear the wind come whistlin' through a forest full of pines
Then I know, yes, I know, I have heard the voice of God

In this faithless generation
Some refuse to just believe
In a God they cannot see

But I have had a revelation
And I'm as sure as I can be
That the God of all creation
Came to live inside of me

And though I have never heard His audible reply
I hear Him speak unspoken words of life

Just the thing they need to make it through

Would heal a nation's bleeding heart

Shed tears about the economy
He said that the balance of the deficity
Would set us free

And I still believe there is hope for the lost And I know the rock of all ages will stand Through changes of time

Seems the thing to do is to keep second guessing
The One who made the earth and sky
Well I guess it's okay just to wonder why

But I know the truth, and I know I'm certain
It's not a mystery, it's not behind a curtain
The veil was torn many years ago
And the Spirit stayed just to let us know

That the answer is not in the stars way up high
But the answer is found in believing in Christ

So I am walking by faith and not by sight
I am trusting in invisible things
For I have felt in my heart, what I can't see with my eyes
'Cause the proof is living inside of me
I've been set free and this is all the evidence I need

There are pyramids in the land of Egypt
There are those who say, that they contain the secrets
To where we're from and why we're here
But I think God's Word makes it crystal clear

That the ancient tombs in the barren desert
Do not hold the clues, they do not hold the answers
The truth has already been revealed
For it's moving in me and I know that it's real

'Cause it's not in the grave for the skeptics to see
But He lives in the hearts of the ones who believe

So I am walking by faith and not by sight
I am trusting in invisible things
For I have felt in my heart, what I can't see with my eyes

4Him,"A solitary picture hanging on my wall
The same familiar scenery we all have seen before
And I can't help but wonder staring at Your face
Just what You must have been like as You visited this place
God come to earth as man to save us all

But I, I'm longing for the day
When my mysteries of You will be erased
But until then I must go on living
(Until then)
This world will keep on spinning until then I'll live by faith

Oh the mystery of grace
(Will someday be erased)
When I see You face to face
(In Heaven some sweet day)

Now I've got all Your letters, I read them every day
I'm finding more and more
I hang on to every word You say
I've often called You Friend and I can't forget

That You, You are making me a place
Far beyond this present madness that I face
But until then I must go on living
(Until then)
This world will keep on spinning
I'll keep hanging from day to day until then I'll live by faith

Oh the mystery of grace

The fullness of Your mercy in my hand

The only One who loves me as I am 
The only thing I need I already have

When there's nothing I can see worth fighting for

4Him,"We only get so many times
To ride around this sun
And so many times to see a full moon shine
When day is done if anything's worth doing
Then it's worth doing right
So I looked for wisdom on how to
Best live this brief life I have found

Blessed is he who fears the Lord
Who finds delight in His commands
Blessed is he who fears the Lord
Who finds delight in His commands

I guess that we all gamble on some
Truth to guide our days
And we trust that it will bring us joy and meaning
On the way
I've got friends who feel betrayed by all the things
They once believed
So with everything I've seen I've gotta say
It seems to me

Blessed is he who fears the Lord
Who finds delight in His commands
Blessed is he who fears the Lord
Who finds delight in His commands

Please hear this from a humble heart
But I feel like Exhibit A
In the evidence that God is good to those
Who live by faith, that's why I believe

Blessed is he who fears the Lord
Who finds delight in His commands
Blessed is he who fears the Lord
Who finds delight in His commands

He will not be shaken
He will have no fear
He will then remember

Oh Lord, let your spirit rise within me
Until the world cannot deny that you exist
This is my only passion
The very reason why I live

To make you known and to make you seen
To be your hands and to be your feet
Oh I want to be a revelation of love
Oh I, I want to make the invisible God visible

May my life be an offering
So completely given 'til there's nothing left but you alone
This is my prayer, my destiny
That my life reveals your glory so that you remain long after I am gone

Oh Lord, you have made me for this purpose
And all I have is just one life to give my all

To make you known and to make you seen
To be your hands and to be your feet
Oh I want to be a revelation of love
Oh I, I want to make the invisible God visible

Make it clear to see who you are revealed in me
A sacrifice
The beauty of the life you gave, unending love, amazing grace
My one desire, my one desire

To make you known and to make you seen
To be your hands and to be your feet
Oh I want to be a revelation of love
Oh I, I want to make the invisible God visible

I want to make the invisible God visible
(I want to make you visible)

4Him,"Everyday you hear the people talkin'
They say they're takin’ a stand
They're lookin' for a cause they can believe in
For the welfare of man

But all I see are soldiers in a circle
Marching no place fast
Isn't it time the children of God
Take a stand that will last
Oh, it makes me want to ask

Couldn't we stand
To kneel a little longer
The time is never spent in vain
In the light of all we stand to gain

Finding the faith that only makes us stronger
Touching what we cannot see
Reaching to heaven from our knees
Couldn't we stand

I know men so blinded by ambition
The joy is slippin' away but they're no worse
Than the people who are livin'
Like there's only today

And I can't help but shake my head and wonder
What's it comin' to
Lord, give me the strength to lift them in prayer
'Cause it's all I can do
Just to give them back to you

Couldn't we stand
To kneel a little longer
The time is never spent in vain
In the light of all we stand to gain

Finding the faith that only makes us stronger
Touching what we cannot see
Reaching to heaven from our knees
Couldn't we stand

언제나 네 맘은 보일듯 말듯
내게 좀 표현해 줄래
사랑한단 말 한 마디
언제까지 망설이고 있을 거니
오늘부터는 내게 좀 말해줘
One 손 잡을 때 깍지 끼기
Two 짜증 낼 때 웃어주기
몰라 몰라 몰라 몰라 몰라 몰라
말해도 너는 몰라

4Tay,"When you make the Kool-Aid
You put your own amount of sugar in it
Sweet, sweet love to your taste
To your own specifications
Now tell Kool-Aid, how much you want
How much can you flaunt (Tell em' bitch)
One scoop or two (Yeah)
Sweet, sweet love
When your rolling down the street (Errr!)
On them twenty inches and you ask her how much she want
(How much you want bitch) And you got a beat that goes with it

Sweet, sweet love
And she says I want it all
And you know it's cool-Aid in her tank
And your fixing to ride the stripes away
To sweet, sweet love
Take that thong off (Take it off)
And let me touch your thighs (Touch the pussy)
While we roll, I promise to keep my eyes on the road
While I'm touching that sweet, sweet love
To your specifications, to your gratifications
Yeah Kool-Aid is like an aphrodisiac
Your pleasure is mine
Like when a whore goes out to whore
And bring you back all the money
That's sweet, sweet love
Don't try it and even put some strychnine 
Listen to the pronunciation of strychnine in this cool-Aid
This ain't no Jim Jones thing
This is just sweet, sweet, love

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I met her back in the day
Knew how much the bitch weighed and payed
It was sort of like a masquerade
Fake suede boots and Cadillac coupes swoop the boulevard (Err!)
In hot pursuit and we ain't afraid to shoot
From hotel to motel, for the highest clientele
You and you, I give a fuck how the pussy smell
Heads to tails, the bitch bail with limp
With a hell of a limp, see on that gangsta tip
See-notes, fifties and tens we cashed in
Bought a brand new Benz on gold Lorenzos rims
Anything I want my bitch gon' go out and get it
Hustle round and swear that a real pimp is his business
Who got the floss and ball to rise and fall
If a bitch want to do it she gon' fuck em' all
Dog, dog what up, Kool-Aid pimpin' keep on dippin'
Sippin' yac with a yamp, puttin' hoes on they back
It's like that

Everyone want to know how a pimp can do his thing
 
Ridin' sly, gettin' high
Bitches on the corner sellin' pussy tonight hey!
Everyone want to know how a pimp can do his thing
Ridin' sly, gettin' high
Got plenty of my bitches sellin' pussy tonight hey!

Tapped in with this baller I met, pushin' the Vette
He moved to California said he ain't got searched yet
Ah, she gon' blow ya socks off
And peal them rocks off
Bring em' home to daddy, so saddy
Pimp in the Caddy
Keep my hand on the gun
Cause they got me on the run
Menage trois in the telly
Anaconda all in the belly
She gon' serve four tricks
And suck some more dick
Homie this a bad bitch
Better than average
King Bing, Don Bishop, and White tie Gotti
Feel more slim than the Max to skip and dump the body
P-i-m-p, young G's, O.G.s

Fleetwood bronze, mobile phones and O-Zs nigga
Daz Dillinger feelin' ya every time you bust

They sellin' it, motherfucker are inhalin' this
Here pimpin'


Me and my homies we pimp the same ho
Pimp the same ho, ridin' through slow
Blaze through third and first and do what ya do
I done, done I done, done
Pull up and wrap the shotgun
They know me Gotti, she know we pimpin' and never slippin'
I pimp hoes on the side, side
Side, ride, slide provide applied
Upped the supplied supply
Swats, I gave it my own try
Improvise, be saddled up pimpin' hoes worldwide
Smack the bitch, smack the bitch
Take the bitch money, money
That's my grip the bitch get
Shakin' that lil' limp skinny ass body the bitch got
Turnin' the Gotti on the cock
And make the bitch hit the block, I'm tired of these hoes
Now a days fallin' crawlin' ah bitch come on
Bitches reconcile, ball and gobble and gargle

Verse One: Charli Baltimore

I don't know if it's the pretty face or the expensive taste
That got everybody wantin' to touch me like Case
Feels So Good like Mase, to pull over
Anywhere I want, diplomats on the Rover
The way I put it on a nigga sober
I have 'em comin' back, knockin' on my door like Johovas
Ya'll already know that Charli's in charge
Weekly massage, platnuim and gold cars
Money stashed in NY to Witchitaw
And I stay with my niggas cause you know how bitches are
Aggy, cause they baby daddy want to bag me
That's why I never leave home without the 44
Ya'll hoes can't do nothin' to me
I got this game wrapped like a dubee
Pinned up in what?
Charli rappin' about, I really got
And it ain't that I'm stuck on myself, I'm really hot

Yo yo yo, gimme the money
Rich bitch be swimmin' in money
I need Jet Ski's in mind, can't tease a dime
Lookin' in the mirror, feeling pleased with the shine

Wear the ice on the bra of my chest
When the money ain't right I go far to the left
Niggas want to play games then Charli direct
want to Long Kiss Goodnight, don't hold ya breath
Bitches know I'm the shit with my MAC lipstick
Crushin' the player haters with a purple navigator
Shoes alligator, my bag is too
If I was broke like you, I would be mad like you
But you can come work for Charli, a boss with a body
Ask anybody, I could take over Gotti
Poo by the poo while you just another hottie
Niggas roll bricks that'll stay if it's notty

Uh huh, yo when you look you see the slim waist leavin' no trace
Cause shit for no Charli will be in the breifcase
Yeah Long Kiss Goodnight, Baltimore get it right
For the cash, pop out the window and shoot through the ice
Ain't no love here, just the black gloves here
Check it, and I don't get by with nothin' I can't leave in 30 seconds
But my kids, they think mommy a teacher
They don't know, for the love of this
I make the whole world tre' dough
Bingo, get 'em ready for school like nothing happen
Here's a apple for the teacher, tell 'em mommy said ""Hi""
Bet he won't fail you no more, one more ""F"" and he die
Even with my nails done, I can take guns apart son
So when they come lookin' for this reporter broke Un
Dealt with birds, but I had to move on
But for none of these I tatto the little P-pac on my arm
Ask Un how the ones be when he advance me dough
So I put out mines and tell dawg keep yours yo

4th Disciple,"""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Hell Razah, Get Large Productions
Revolution music, Rebel Music, baby

[Chorus]
It's Rebel Music, put your mind into it
Right hand in the air, before you solemly sware it's
(rebel music)
The next rap level to music, step your paint game up
And if not, then keep moving
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 

Rebel Music free the pain inside, until this day in my ghetto
I hear echoes, where anger cry, feel me?
I bring tears to the angel eye, and paint pictures
With a pen, for the saints that die
Why you happy go lucky, off of record label lies
I make, rebel music, verse the devil's illusion
This time, they can't pacify the revolution
Even if they plan to pay us back, retrobution
I revoke to be part of their couch, 'cause we don't own
Enough boats, to be shipping in no bundles of coke
I can't advertise, on killin' my folks, who dead broke
While I'm thinkin' of my ancestors, hung on ropes
Black queens havin' seeds while she's strung on dope
I resurrected Nat Turner with this song that I wrote wrote

[Chorus]

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music on my side always, this be the theme for the UBP's
O.G.'s, and they young seeds
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music on my side always, I rebel against the true system
A young man givin' old wisdom, over soul witness

I try to stay out of drama, give my life to the heavenly father
'92 had a fetish for them heavy revolvers
We die as martyrs, underground, call me Osama
Plant seeds like a farmer, off of positive karma
Spiritual armor, bring me more medals of honor
I'm not your average M.C., son, my level is sharper
The ghetto is smarter, children of them biblical authors
Abraham, lost sheep, must continue the saga
Revelations, 2 and 9 prove that Christ was darker
Than the paintings on your walls, and your living room halls
Tatooed on your arms, and you chains and charms
Tell moms that I love her, God, for singing me songs

[Chorus]

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music, Rebel Music's on my side always (it's what I keep by my side)
Live in the ghetto, and I die in the ghetto, ghetto
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
My mind be crumb, the revolutionary seven needs
They raised up in the eighties, with these crack babies

Rest in peace on my project walls, a young drug lord
It's either rap now, or basketball
Everybody gotta jersey on, thinkin' they be murdering songs
Same hoes that put burberry on
You only learn when your hustle is wrong, you stepped your game
Shooters miss, when they aim up, Bush applied and they blamed us
Do a coke bust, hit the crib, say Bin Laden blew it up
Locked up, half of my raise, until we wise up
Rise up, and master our faith, word up, son
I'm a true black brother, ask Angie Stone
Papa was a rolling stone, Razah be the heir to the throne
Now I got check writers, ears to the phone
Meetings with big businessmen in other timezones
Chrome registered guns, two educated sons
Goons ready to ill when the revolution comes

[Chorus]

""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride"" 
Rebel Music on my side always
You'll be back like young black geronimo jacks
With a calico, trenchcoats and godfather hats
""I'm lettin' the music on the side, and waitin'
Forward, to lettin' the music, will let me ride""
Afro picks, black leather gloves and Cadillac's
Marvin Gaye tracks, straps like Ron O'Neal

Rest in peace, Bobby Seals, Bobby Seals
Lived to die, for revolutionary music, rest in peace
Tupac Ashata Shakur, get up, stand up
Lived to die, for revolution music
Rest in peace to all the brothers in the ghetto
Didn't make it, get up stand up, don't give up the fight
Lived to die, for revolution music
Said get up, stand up, revolution to the only black
Sun of Man, the son of god
Get up, stand up, rest in peace, to all my brothers Tard and Clint
Cousin Jason, Ghetto Government Officials, died for rebel music
Signed, sealed and delivered

Lettin' the music, will let me ride""",Rebel Music,2014

And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

No neutral sides

Please, don't ask me why

5.56 on my chips man
Read it across the label

stable then a tree
But I call it a mag
And double down on anything
Because my hand ain't that bad

they want me surveillance and tagged
'Cause I know that they scared of me
What I'm dealt is always killer
So every round they change dealers on me

break 'em down for the loot

Because they made it that way

We only place bigger bets
Cause we can feel 13 comin

Our lifes out of our hands
Adrenalines pumpin
And though our cards tell us fold
We know we can bluffem

We got too much on the line here
To lay down and not do nothing
So we commit and hope we are
Never forced to cut our losses

Split 2 bitches wishin 2 niggaz
Ed hop up on em
Playin our hand so dirty
That we cannot washem

Got the house ready to fold

Everytime them dice roll they will not watchem

Force the odds in my favor
Variables become constant
And I will not lose
That's just how bad I want it

So I put everything I own on it
Even my life
Cause I ain't leavin here not knowing
Whether or not I really tried to breakem

The look in the eyes
Though they trying to hide it they shakin
And they don't wanna deal no more
I got they confidence waivering

But its too late
And though I know the dice are loaded still playem

Where my face used to be 
Then I realize that he was about my age 
When he started his own family 
Then my radicalism, all my college Marxism 
Starts drifting on out to deep sea 
When I look in the mirror and I see my dad's face 
Where my face used to be 

When I was a kid I used to look at my dad 
And I'd say, ""This is who I am not"" 
He used Bryl Creem, I used hair spray 
He was fat, I was skinny 
He drank beer, I smoked pot 
But now my feet are disappearing beneath an ocean of beer 
And not so mysteriously 
When I look at my face I see in its place 
My dad's physiognomy 

I used to look at my friends, they looked fifty years older 
Some nights when I'd get too stoned 
That's when I believed time was a visible line 
With its end and beginning both shown 
Now I know that's not true 
But I've still got an idea pretty much of what I can expect 
When I look in the mirror and I see my dad's mug 
Sitting there right on top of my neck 

Well, my dad had it rough, he couldn't keep his true love 
He never reached his sought-after perfection 
So as I headed down my own life's road 
I headed straight in the other direction

I didn't have to work or buy food or do anything like that

Night 
How my parents fought, how I never even dated the girl next door 

How I was just a lonely mixed-up kid in Baltimore 
Looking back now, you know I do believe 
When I lived in Baltimore, I couldn't wait to leave 
Go somewhere else and get a brand-new start

She's Daddy's favourite
He's saved for Harvard
He knows she'll make it
She's good at school
She's never truant
She can speak French
I think she's fluent

'Cause every night she studies hard in her room
At least that's what her parents assume
But she sneaks out the window to meet with her boyfriend
Here's what she told me the time that I caught 'em

She said to me:
""Forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
So just turn around and forget what you saw
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught""
Woah oh oh oh- oh woah oh
Good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught
Woah oh oh oh- oh woah oh
Good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught

She's a good girl
A straight A student
She's really into
All that self-improvement
I swear she lives in that library
But if you ask her she'll say
""That's where you'll find me!""

But if you look then you won't find her there
She may be clever but she just likes to square
'Cause in the back of the room where nobody looks
She'll be with her boyfriend
She's not reading books!

She said to me:
""Forget what you thought
'Cause good girls are bad girls that haven't been caught

Felt somebody looking at me
With a powder white complexion, feeling the connection

Before I knew it, it was serious

Got a high rise and a bachelor pad, rims tumble like acrobats
A buck sixty where the dash is at, platinum card no maxing that

Balling is a habit baby
Chinchilla, makes my jackets baby
I don't want to get cash, from rapping crazy
I'm gutter I grind, stop acting crazy
Capping on wax, ain't really me
Ten G's a day, that's a brilliant week
Big faces breeder thee
Caugh nine packs, I sneeze a ki
Roll through Panama, floss the Benz
Wipe my Timberland's, off with ten's
50/50, the Lil' Twin
Leave the rap game, with a flawless win
Take a flight, in a G-4-7
Spend the night, in a East Coast setting
I'm so hot dog, I need more relish
2004, watch B.C. fetish

I'm like Tarzan, swanging through trees
It's so much, ice in my mouth
When I take a deep breath, I get brain freeze
Millionaires want to hang with me
R&B girls keep singing to me
The FEDs think, I'm exchanging ki's
Everyday new car, I'm exchanging keys
Boys riding in 7-45's, that was cool last year
But I'm V-12 in a 7-60, Kenyon passing me beer
I step in the club cameras flashing, girls want to take my pic
Which girls am I taking home, I can take my pick
50/50 in fur coats, so please no finger prints on his mink
I tip the bar tender more money, than I spend on the drinks
Lil' mama keep skipping and wink, she give me glances
I'ma make a move, on them sexual advances
And by the end of the night, I can garuntee I'ma be up in them panties
I ain't never slept in the same room, twice in my house
Frosty the Snowman can build a house, with the ice in my mouth

Sunday morning I was so sharp, all did up
It was welfare hustlin', they killed her for that

Nigga you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that fagot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
When my junk get to pumping in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate
Watch the money pile up

50 Cent,"Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out My Melody""
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's 'll take your daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homey, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats, been banging
Since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'mma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

From the beginning to the end, losers lose
Winners win this is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starving
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know ""What's Going On"" like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think what if Marie Baker got that abortion?

Motorbikes and grams of fishscale

I start spitting G at a bitch like a pimp man
Tell her meet me at the ???? so we can do our thing
She can bring the lingerie with her I suppose
And we can go from fully dressed to just having no clothes
She can run and tell her best friend bout my sex game
Her best friend could potentially be next man
Listen man, shit changed
I came up from doing my thang
Homey I'm holing, holing, holing
shit man, the store owner watching you
For something get stolen, stolen, stolen

Ja you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Jada you's a window shopper
In the jewelery store, looking at shit you can't buy
Joe you's a window shopper
In the dealership, trying to get a test-drive
Nas you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by",Window Shopper [Reggaaton],

I drink that hoe, her head so good
She gon' have you there like, ""oh lawd""
All this time you ain't on
I done bought her shit you can't afford

The art of getting robbed
This is how we do Brooklyn style boy you know what I'm sayin?

[50 Cent]
R.I.P B.I.G, R.I.P P-A-see, R.I.P enough of that shit niggas that want to OD
Aiyyo the bottom line is I'ma crook with a deal
If my record don't sell I'ma rob and steal
You better recognize nigga I'm straight from the street
These industry niggaz is startin to look like somethin to eat
I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, ""You want to see her again?""
Dance your ass down to the nearest ATM
I have dreams of fuckin an R&B bitch
But I wake up early and bounce with all her shit
When I apply pressure,son it ain't even funny
I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
Brian McKnight, I can get that nigga anytime
Have Keith sweatin starin down the barrel of my nine
Since these Harlem World niggaz seem to all be fam
I put the gun to Cardan tell him, ""Tell your man
Mason Betha, haha, come up of that watch now
I mean right now""
The only excuse for being broke is bein in jail
An entertainer can't make bail he broke as hell
I'd rob ODB but that'd be a waste of time
Probably have to clap him run and toss the nine
I'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks
Plottin to juice her for that rock Kurupt copped
What Jigga just sold like 4 mil? He got somethin to live for
Don't want a nigga puttin four through that Bentley Coupe door
I'll man handle Case like ""Dude get on the ground
You ain't with Mary no more where you getting chips from now??
I been skeamin on Tone and Poke since they found me
Steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me
I'm a klepto nah for real son I'm sick
I'm bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school shit
Right now I'm bent and when I get like this I don't think
About to make Stevie J take off that tight ass mink
I'll rob Pun without a gun snatch his piece then run
This nigga weigh 400 pounds, how he gon catch me son?

[50 Cents]
Ill catch P and Silk The Shocker right after the Grammies
And Will Smith and Jada ass down in Miami
Run up on Timberland and Missy w/the pound
Like you gimme the cash and you put the hot dog down
I figured it out 
Niggas been robbin Joe before that's why his ass 
don't want to be a playa no more
Mad at you I'm robbin J.D., FUCK YOU!! PAY ME!!
Had Da Brat with em, shoulda had his gat with him
DMX want to get down or will you tell on me
I'm on that Treach shit, I do my +Dirt All By My Lonely+
I should rob Clue man his shit did well
I want to stick TQ but his shit ain't sell
I hit the studios take niggas shoes and leave
Catch Rae Ghost and RZA for them funny ass rings
Tell Sticky gimme the cash before I empty three
Ill beat your ass like that white boy on MTV
Cannibus want to battle while I'm stickin them up
Fuck a cab the coroners pickin em up
Heavy tried to hide his shit, hey nigga I saw ya
He said ""Why you robbin me I got _Nuttin But Love_ for ya!""
Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
Told him I want it all he said, ""Even my gold teeth?""
I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black jeep
One at a time get out and take off your shine
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that I'd flash the nine?
And walk off with your shit like it's mine?
I'ma keep stickin niggas until I'm livin
I'll rob Boys II Men like I'm Michael Bivins
Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robyn Givens
I'm hungry for real I'm bout to stick Mister see
That nigga still eatin off Big's first LP
I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor
He asked me if I had enuff I told him ""Gimme Some More""
Is you feelin this? Then wait for the sequel
I gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbin Gods People

Son I ain't even rock him to sleep, the nigga dozed 
The bitch could have helped you get rich, but she sold 
Now you heartbroke, that's what you get for lovin' them hoes 
An ill flow with no beat, is incomplete, it's like a stickup kid 
Runnin' round without no heat, it like a fifth with no kick 
A fiend with no hit, a willie with no wit 
A bad bitch that won't blow dick 
It's like a rollie with no ice, a gamblin spot with no dice 
Like fuckin' supermodel bitches and not bustin' off twice 
I murda' any mic device, for the right price, I'm nice 
I only say things once, never twice, don't fuck with me 

St. Louis niggas is rowdy rowdy 
Cleveland niggas is bout it bout it 
50 Cent ain't gonna kill ya nigga, don't get doubted 
Got your gun, well don't leave home without it 
The Memphis niggas is rowdy rowdy 
Them Shytown niggas is bout it bout it 
They'll kill you and act like they don't know shit about it 
Leave your body somewhere where no one can find it 

Now if I pull out the gat and just push your wig back 
I bet niggaz will stand around sayin' ""damn who did that?"" 
I'm the type nigga to dare you to touch the? 
I'm the type to borrow your gat and won't give the shit back 
I'm F to the I - F -T - why - see - E - N - T 
Caress the ass gently, and back up Bentleys 
You thought she was pimpin', son I was in the Hamptons 
In a heart shaped hot tub with the bitch flappin' 
I plan to take over New York and start expandin'
Was Bob Marley singin' about tex when he sung ""I'm jammin'"" 
Nigga fuck with my cash and I'ma blast yo' ass 
Smash the glock out the stash in the dash in? 
Flee in a flash, lay low, let time go past 
If you survive the shots I'ma find yo' ass 
Put the gat to your head and remind your ass 
I ain't playin' with you, I want my money motherfucker 

Yo, some nigga just shot the block up dog, word? 
He had the same shit you got on dog, word? 
I know you done did it so get the fuck up outta hear, ya heard? 
I run with niggas that spray and strip and say that shit 
You won't let us pump on your block, fuck it, we makin' it hot 
I'm that nigga that call the shots, with the iced out watch 
From the cordless cell phone, and the baby blue drop 
I got a lot of hungry niggas with me straight from the street 
'Cause these three niggas are startin' to look like something to eat 
They got watches on they wrist that cost like 60 thousand 
My niggas live in section eight of public housing 
They murder you and keep shit low cause niggas heard of you

Took you from being a nine to being a dime
You complain that we don't spend time
When I'm OT on the grind going hard for mine
Yo, when shorty say she hate me you know she mean she love me
When she play me close at the bar that mean she want some Bubbly
See my polying with another chick and shit get ugly
She wanna flip, threaten to run keys across my whip
Try to burn a nigga with some hominy grits
That's how she on it, when I met her she was lowkey
Now she wanna OD
You know me, I let her do her thing, son

Smile for me
And if you see them niggas that wet me, wile' for me
Remember the good times, the chips we stacked
The clips we packed 
And all the bricks we cooked from coke to crack
Let my tombstone read ""I Tried"" and from the start everything I wrote
Was from my heart

If you got somethin' to doubt me, shut the fuck up
Why do niggas act like they hard when they know they butt?
And gettin' robbed ain't a good time to press ya luck
Duke listen, if you move I'm'a hurt you
You'll get your turn to shine later, patience is a virtue
Right now what you need to do is gimme the cash
Forget about your Boss bein' mad, just save ya ass
Be a good Boy now, go and get your stash
I seen you throw it next to the garbage can like it was trash
Alright run along before I shoot ya ass
I hate to do this to you but I really need this cash.

Call him now before I drop for real 'cause after I drop

You're a generous guy

I'm convinced, man, something really wrong with these ho's
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fucking with her nose
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats
That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shots 'll help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big been taught Charli B'More to deep throat (yea)

Now here's a list of MC's that can kill you in eight bars:
50, Jay-Z and Nas
I'ma say this shit now and never again
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
The games you playing, you get killed like that
Acting like you all hard, you ain't built like that
See me when you see me nigga, one

Scream murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder! (Fuck around and leave you!)
Murder! (I don't believe you!)
Murder, murder! (Your life's on the line!)

50 Cent,"I'm on parole, I used to be on probation
I'm with my gun, I get full coporation
I tell you ""Take it off"" no hesitation
Nigga you play around, I lay you down, that's how it's going down
Don't play with me, I don't have patience
My head aching, and I need my medication
Niggas be hating, they don't know what they facing
Nigga you play around, I lay you down, that's how it's going down
I be in court throwing signs like I'm a mason
Nigga witness against me, I'mma erase 'em
If they try an runaway, I'mma chase 'em
Now with the pound, and I'mma lay 'em down, that's how it's going down

Better watch how you talk, better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York, that's how we get down
22's on the jeep, something deep in the seat
When we creep with the heat, that's how we get down

Wise men listen and laugh while fools talk
Stick up kids don't live long in New York
Fuck around and catch the wrong jukes on the street
Get caught slipping, then get hit with like three
In every hood in the US, I'm that nigga they feeling
Rap full of good guys, 50 Cent is the villain
I play the bar with eight bottles all night getting right
Teaching the hoodrats what Cristal taste like
I put 60 on wrist, 12 on my fist, 100 on my neck
We in the hood nigga scheming, what you expect?
My S on 22's leave ya hoes confused
On the track ready to choose, like ""Daddy, we want you""
My love live ain't change, the shorties still hug me
Bullet wound in my face, and bitches still love me

I came to teach you how we put it down in New York, that's how we get down

In the city, a young buck'll tell you how the mac spit
O.G. give 'em the word, you gonna get your ass hit
I don't know why niggas like to talk bad about me
I'm the richest nigga they know without a G.E.D
Man it could be the money, it could be the ice
It could be they'd like to be me and can't live my life
You should hear they be saying man ""50 be flipping""
""Shot my man over seven grams, that nigga be tripping""
I know death is promised, I don't fear getting murked
It's when a nigga half-way killa ya homie, it hurts
Now we can hit the club and get it crunked
Or you could start some shit, and I could hit you with the pump
You can have it how you want, but I know you like my style
Uh-huh, you like how I break it down
Wanna get rich? I'll show you how
Take this pack, pump these pieces, that's how we get down

Un cured, ain't no vaccine

It's Con Air style, real twisted, I disappear on some Blair Witch shit
Comin' back I'm rich kid

Everybodies in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
Ain't trying to use nobody as a steppin' stone

But don't compare me I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what what up keep steppin' and just rep D12

Keep my nose clean stay away from weapons jail
And livin' wreckless, but if you would check my belt
You may see soemthing else I use to protect myself
A vest to stop a ruger and deflect the shells and

Send em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more I don't got to
Got under cover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people crossed the line

But this motherfucker Ja mustve lost his mind
That X has got him thinkin' that he was DMX 
Then he switched to Pac now his tryin' to be him next
So which one are you X Luther Pac or Michael ?

Just keep singing the same song recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and hailey dance to your songs we like you
And you don't really want to step inside on my group

Come on now you know the white boy will bite you
I'll hurt your pride dog and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to 
With syllable after syllable ill just slap ya

Killin' you faster 
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of
That shit you on but if you want it you got it 
You'd bump this shit too if we didn't diss you on it

But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants ta
So what's the deal where was all of the tough talk
When I walked up to ya like Ja what up dog

How come you didn't say you had a problem then
When you was standin' there with all you men
We could've solved it then I'm a grown man dogg come holla
All you did was slap hands smile and swallow

And tell me 50 Cent was everything you want to be (Cmon)

You better watch where you heading

I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)

Don't go against me I'll hurt your feelings
Stones in my cross the size of your earrings
My confidence level's high nigga can't tell
Lickin my lips at ya bitch like I'm LL
I smile like a nigga in jail receiving mail
Better yet like a nigga in the bookings that made bail
From day one I came in the game they said I was hot
They got scared, ""Cent got money,"" and I got shot
You put pressure on me when you compare me to 'Pac
I'm just a new kid, I can't help that I'm hot
What little niggas say to 50 cent don't matter
I'll fire shots at the shepherd and watch the sheep scatter
My enemies never turn into friends, my friends turn into enemies
You scared then get the fuck around me
Record execs, know not to play wit my check
I come through and put my knife on that vein in ya neck (YEAH!)

I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me

There's only one God sonny, and there ain't no replacement
And anybody thinking different just get locked in the basement
You know we had to touch the beat cause the track is dope, nigga
And throw some bullet's at you the size of cantaloupes, nigga
A lot of niggas rolling around like they can't get touched
Even the pope know to stay in bullet proof Benz trucks
Flipmode up in this bitch, ya niggas know we on fire

Her broke ass wanna fight, Missy know how to treat me
She sitting on cash, she got money out the ass
Gave her them back shots and got money out her ass
Now you can see me in the coupe like what!
Next time I'll hit her in that G5 truck!
I've got the magic stick, I can go for hours
From the bed to the floor, to the sink to the shower
With her back to the bed and her legs to the sky
I can go hard, know why, big girls don't cry
I had visions of Missy with her money by the tub
Ching! Ching! Jackpot, I think I'm in love
I'm looking for Missy now so I can get my back rubbed
This the shit she hollered in my ear before we left the club

You are now rapping, with 50 Cent
You gotta love it,
I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch suns in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe

Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?

If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century,
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz, would you poof and disappear like
Some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?

Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm loving?
Are you mad 'cause I'm asking you 21 questions?
Are you my soul mate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes, to make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

50 Cent,"Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth, I don't care
But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day (Obie Trice go!)

Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna look
Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and
Let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn niggaz' moms
Shoot up clubs and destroy niggaz' vibes
Everybody running for their motherfucking lives
Tough club niggaz, we leave early, cock back surely
Open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z
Ho's in animal skirts get mirked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard
Trust in ""God""? It's 'cause you're about to catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from, who you be with
Keep this a secret, right by the nuts
A 4-5 that'll light niggaz up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck

Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth, I don't care
But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day (Obie Trice go!)

But as long as I'm here, I'm gonna grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty will make your ass bet on words
Touch niggaz in jail make them wanna finish their last set
They say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun
If that's the case, then get a bigger one
You don't think I'm packed to pump cause I'm out of the hood
That's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump
I'm in a white mink, the fabric is done
Cop rings like Mike, Larry, Magic and them
Out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm the clouds, you don't see me in the train
I travel first class, you ain't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name, cause I ain't going back and forth
Your boss and your captain's soft (Bitch)

Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth, I don't care
But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day (Obie Trice go!)

We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? you gon' get it
Name 'em we gon' hit em, chew em up and spit em out
HRRK-PTT
Too much venom, and if you roll with 'em
We gonna fuck you up with 'em
I got too much momentum moving in my direction to lose
My shoes will explode, soon as you go to step in 'em (BOOM)
You know how we do it, when we do, how we do it, when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie, we all move like assassins
Ski masks and gloves Consider this as a warning
Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
But we are fizast, fuck your little bitch ass up
We are not killers my vato will have you shot though
Drag through the barrio and fucked like Kim Osario
Little sorry hoe ass, go ask be Real
We burn source covers like fuckin' Cypress Hill
Did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still
Shady Records, ""you better believe the hype is real""
This is no joke, I don't smoke
But I toke enough second hand to make my fuckin ""P.O."" choke
I'm an OG you fuckin with a GI Joe
Bia Bia, mia meo a Vida loco
I'm a psycho, Mariah ain't got shit on me
When I retire I'll be spitting baby food on people
At San Ysidro Ranch, huddled up next to her
With Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
You ever had your cap peeled back, or your shit pushed in?
I put my blade in you like a fucking pin cushion
Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and indo
I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
Nobody told you that I'm loco, esse?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm Slim Sha ""D"" in the ""Dy"" is for ""deez nuts""
And you can get each one for free so feast up
I pee in a cup for three months I'm having an E party for Easter, please come squeeze guns

We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
You want it? you gon' get it
You name 'em, we gon' hit em, chew 'em up and spit em out
Too much venom and if you role with 'em
We gonna fuck you up with 'em
You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a 12 gauge Mossberg to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear God cause I bring death
Silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest around you know how I get down
I watch gangster flicks and root for the bad guy
And turn it off before the end cause the bad guy die
If you trying to buy guns, I'm the nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new
You can raise your voice like you fiendin' to touch something
When I raise my knife, shit, I'm fiendin' to cut something
See I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie
If the bitch think I love her, then the bitch don't know me
(50 Cent Ha-ha, Sorry Kim, ha-ha)
(Eminem oh, sorry oh)

Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn 'cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth, I don't care
But if you get too close, I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared

They like me better when I'm fucked up and ashy

So the stash box big enough to squeeze the mack in
Yeah, I'm fairly new but I demand some respect
'cause I already wear your advance on my neck
I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches
Blue Yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers
I already figured out what to do with all my features
Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers
When it comes to stuntin' there's nothing you can teach us
We're in a different time zone, your records don't reach us
No, I ain't here to save the world, just roll up a blunt
Come with me out front, I'll tech you how to stunt

In a throwback jersey, with the throwback Nikes

The only thing changed is the numbers on the range
I bought me an old school and blew out the brains
The Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain
My sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing
And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game
Come on now, we all know gold is getting old
The ice in my teeth keep the crystal cold

Look, I can't even walk through the mall no more
I just pull up, get out, and get all the hoes

I got more foreign shooters than the Sacramento Kings 
It's 8 class karats in the border 
I poke holes in plastic, to avoid a vaginal disorder 
I'm a savage on your daughter 
She ain't in the college dorm 
Then I guess I'm squirtin' on the cabin that you bought her

Of watching my Mama's tears
Got me heated, heavily weeded

Smoking that bomb 'cause I need it
These n****s don't want me balling, they want me bury
Thrown in the dirt, from shots flurry
Laying with bugs under my shirt

I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
'Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gon' call my number
Under, my chest is a heart of a lion

I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching
What I'm clutching, to give you more then a concussion

This is s*** that I solved with my balls, my ears
This is me who's gotta be, what you see on TV
What you hear on C.D., what appears easy

Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags, living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games
Till they shoot 'em up bang

Then you see brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bully my way in this game, man I'm done playing
Man I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'm a start laying any of these motherf***ing c***suckers

There's no way I'mma back down, like a goddamn coward
I can't, how would I look as man bowing to his knees
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please

Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me
Not Marshall, you wanna see Marshall?
I'll show you Marshall, I try to show you art
Put you just pick it apart, so I see I have to start

Showing you f***in' old farts a whole other side
I wanted to not show you, so you know you're not dealing with
Some f***in' marshmallow, little soft yellow

Spray on Suzuki's eleven hundred cc's
More plate on the back, straight squeezing a Mak
In the hood they identify niggas by they cars
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar
I ain't gotta be around to make shit hot
I send Yayo to dump 30 shots on ya block
So spray that Tec nigga if I say get it done
An make it wet niggas if you round me son

When I come through the hood, I don't stop the rapping niggaz
Get close enough to smack, get it clapping nigga
Pac tried to front so I waved the chrome on his ass
Point blank range I span put a bone on his ass
Two weeks later niggas came through with Maks to lay me down
Then sprayed I played dead and got the fuck off the ground
Out the blue I get a phone call, 50 what up?
You send a bitch at me I send the bitch back cut up
I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you boy
Front on me, you gon meet one of my soldiers boy
Cause Entwain shot up his mamma crib an now he in Jail
Trippin on Fliks an bogger trail, pussy in black tail
Pack mamma moved, but she don't talk to him no more
The shells from twains 4-4, blew the hinge off her do'
Without that Tec every month how she gon pay for the crib
Man social service finis' come and take them kids

To change the things I can, but wisdom to know the difference

That's the credit put in your head when you a case act
Man I might talk to you while we up in the Penz
But when we come home, that don't mean we goin' fuck an be friends
Shells smash ya head close enough to hear 'em whistling
Thank god they missed you, an go grab ya pistol

Buying little air Jordan's for maybe babies
See it might be his, an it might be yours

So they'll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind, I'm down to ride 'till the sun burn out
If I die today I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts that I've been in I'm by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter fin'nin to get shot, it won't do him no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fucking hurt when it rain
Oh, you a pro at playing battleship? Well, this ain't the same
Little homie this is a whole different type of war game
See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains

We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall

She got on Payless; me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shopping for chinchillas in the summer, they cheaper
Man, this ho you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimping know
You saying it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose with me, I'll have you stripping in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six

Catch a date, suck a dick, shit, trick

I owe you for this one

I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stun if you want and your ass will get rolled on
It feels like my flows been hot for so long
If you thinking I'm fucking fall off your so wrong

Innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from nine eleven
The lords blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I ain't even gotta try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fears no man, warrior swing swords like Conan
Picture me pen in hand write lines knowing the source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone will stop ringing again
These industry niggaz ain't friends, they know how to pretend

Patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you could even weather the storm.
Just lay on the table they operating to save you
Its like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above

They just playing sick, they ain't shit They ain't saying shit, spray 'em Fifty
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message am I getting through to you?
You know whats coming you motherfuckers don't even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, and what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this, nothing like surviving the shot
Y'all know what time it is as soon as Fifty signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children - nuclear shower
There's nothing spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin Fifty

You shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth

Mumbling to the Jake, you going against me dog you making a mistake
Ill split you have you looking like the Michael Jackson's jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch, a regular bitch, you calling her wifey
I fucked her, I feed her fast food, you keeping her icy
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in 94' ""We don't love them hoes""
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenty's spinning looking mean on the six
Niggas wearing flags, 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and get filled up with holes (motherfucker).

And if I'm dreamin' please do
And if I'm dreamin' please don't wake me up
So what's the deal, should I save my love for you?
'Cause no one makes me feel the way that you do

If you should leave I'm waiting patiently
'Cause boy I know that you're the one for me (ooh)

But then it changed suddenly man you came and took my breath away
I was caught in a vine at a time in the night where my life wasn't right babe
But then again suddenly suddenly you came and i was swept away

Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you somethin' that we already had
But once you're gone you don't come back
Too bad, you're off the map now, radar can't even find you

You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'

I don't gotta promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges
We ain't showin' off, we're just goin' off, popular contentions
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all
Washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin'
Doctor's this, Doctor's that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So D-J take the needle and just drop it on the record, what?
We goin' have this motherfucker hoppin in a second (pump pump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
'Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers whom if it
Wasn't for rap to bridge the gap maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages, broke down barriers
Of language and races, just call on the caped crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game that's why we came to

We make the club jump, everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
And plenty hunnies involved, the sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, every day is just another party from the valleys
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker

Along with G-Unit Records, presents the return of
The, The Doc (and Shady) no one can do it better

People think I'm a little bit crazy 
I get it from all angles, even occasionaly
Doc Drezy'll have to step in every once in a while to save me 
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things 
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think 
A lot of rappers finally wouldn't know how to take me 
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me 
I maybe a little too fast paced and racy 
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times 
'Cause I say so many rhymes, it may seem 
like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing 
And I could give a fuck what category you place me 
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone 
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats 
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z 
For every single die hard fan who embraced me 
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me 
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me 
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me 
In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me 
It only made me what I am today, see 
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me 
You ain't gonna make or break me 
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G 
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening 
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me 
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me 
You had all this time to think about it 
Now don't pussy out and try to wimp out, face me

My spot my talk, it blaze a direct hit 
Graze it, your peace talk, save it 
Your shit sounds dated, you're overrated 
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you motherfuckers 
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse 
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy? 
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it 
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic 
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it

50 Cent,"If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say
For all the fools
Who fell for the first
Girl who comes their way
I been down that road, and now I'm back
Sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up,
Where I started from

I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though, my penis was deep down in your hoe
You should know between us we was like mates
Nothing could intervene us especially no hoes
You was more so the shalon type I chose
To more shows, haunted you nights
I suppose that's how it goes,
With time spent emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire

Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me

I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you re-call I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelery off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'd even knew that, who would of even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them god-damned darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's to hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dudes car parked
And reach up under your seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you haul and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing almost haunting
That taunting ring

Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me

(Yeah right bitch, Spend time with my dick)
In most cases Stats attitude is fuck a bitch
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in public
We suffering because of this
Shorty on some whole 'nother other shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'm gonna trick off rip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix dyin' to commit
Feed you the best of me I should have fed you piss
We started off closer than close,
But who could have predicted to know your triflin' ways
Would of stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I ask myself do I love these hos? Nope!
Em introduced us
Fifty this is Tanya, Tanya this is fifty
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said you had very nice lips
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like a opportunist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Says she's an inspiring actress she do videos for practice
Yeah, Yeah, now how many times I heard that shit

Spend some time with me
I never thought that I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me",Spend Some Time,2004

Sh-sh-sh-shady
Aftermath, haha
G-G-G-G-G-Unit!, haha

[Chorus]
Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
'Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Eminem]
Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down

[Dr. Dre]
Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

[Eminem]
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
When dr. dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump

[Dr. Dre]
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches

[Eminem]
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus

[Dr. Dre]
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, 'cause Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

[Eminem]
'cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
50 cent, come on!

[50 Cent]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved

[Dr. Dre]
And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally

[Eminem]
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

[Dr. Dre]
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker

[Eminem]
So never say never 'cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Yeah, haha
Still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry about that Detox album
It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, haha
50 cent, G-unit, Obie Trice, D-twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre
We ain't leavin', let's go! haha

50 Cent,"I know I ain't supposed to smoke in here 
But Mr. Bouncer man don't put your motherfuckin' hands on me
Can I get high without you botherin' me?
Everybody you see in here tonight 
Doin' the same thing so why you keep playa hatin' on me
Can I get high without you botherin' me?

[Chorus: x2]
La la la la. I be smokin'
It hitten me right I'll be loakin'
Them bullshit trees you be rollin'
Barely give you a buzz, me I get high

I admit I got a problem, I keep comin' back for these
Dodo bags there not your yak or your sack o' seeds
I chill sit back on the sofa and relax my knees
And roll one up loose enough to make the backwards breathe
I blow a heavy load, you kids attract some G's.
Cause I'm a smoker, too much o' this would choke ya'
I don't mean to provoke ya, but I'm a bad influence
The musician can't operate without his instruments
My recent success gradually got your bitch convinced
Haters mad they can't look inside cause I pitched the tints
I enter the club with baggies of that chocolate
Second-hand smoke will make a nigga wanna start shit.
Sometimes I wonder where the niggas from the start went
Raise up a lighter and fuck up the whole apartment.
It's just one of the things I do in my spare time
My bad habits ain't private so I'm gon' share mine.

[Chorus: x2]

See they put their hands out cause of the way shit been
I say you niggas ain't smokin' if you don't chip in.
Listen. I waited long for these rocks to glisten
From that one-room pad without a pot to piss in
Although betrayal is not forgiven
I do this for my niggas locked up that's comin' home to lobster livin'
Hopin' the cops forbiddin'
I'm bout to buy momma her own mansion
Just so I could see her pop the ribbon.
That Cali bud's special, so special I held the blunt so long
Snoop had to tell me ""Pass the weed, Nephew""
Fuck rap I'm the wrong one to get pissed off
Cause the pope'll make you jump like criss cross.
My nigga dead and it's hard to let go,
So I'm blowin' on that wet dough, same color as Gecko
Follow hood codes and everybody in the Sentinel
We gas 'em Fuck 'em and Pass 'em what you expect hoe?

[Chorus: x2]

Said you want to blow with the best of them
Yes yes I bested them
Blazed up the purple palm tree
I told you don't mess with them
I warned them new testament
Do you wanna smoke with me? (do you wanna)

Weed rollin', G-strollin', bad-mouthin', mofucker
Law breakin' Pimp, slappin niggas for the fuck of it
Hip-hop an zip lock an rip rockin' gang banger
Thought you was an actor, thought I was a singer
Thought about ridin' but you say you wanna hang tough
D-P-G-Unit sounds like danger
You might wanna manage your anger
Hang with us and stop smokin' on the same stuff
Now lay back on the loft
This new weed that I got I call it face-off
Cause it'll blow your face off and that's a figure of speech,
My niggas a beast, on me from the west to the east, preach

You can eat hollow tip shells or you can work for me

I either don't eat this week or snatch this purse
Clip hangin' out the side of my Karl Kani
My eyes blood shot red I'm High But Let's Ride!
I ain't scared if I die it was meant to be
He might send for y'all before he send for me
Gun butt you with the back of the Beretta
The 357 or the black mac 11!
We drive bullet proof coupes nigga g'on take ya shots
We use to shoot hoops nigga now we shoot up blocks
Got them shells with them green tips just for y'all
You can run but they coming through them concrete walls
Bank$ drop me off show me where he live at
Think he tough I'ma put 6 in this 6 pack
When you here that click clack bitch
Betta get back quick
One to the chest make niggas do back flips 

If some shots may happen to go off tonight
Don't worry about me I be aight
Niggas could waste ammo firin' at me
Because I'm God's child there's angels around me 

If some shots may happen to go off tonight
Don't worry about me I be aight
Niggas could waste ammo firin' at me
Because I'm God's child there's angels around me  

Yeah I know you niggas want me to get murked
Get lowered in the dirt
In an all black button down shirt
Cold wit 3 to the dome
Lil' niggas don't get to see Disney Land
They settle for a funeral home
You don't need  hoes to know that the leads hot
I'm prepared for anything tonight as long as it's not a head shot
The bigger the rim the bigger the tire
Hollow tips'll make it feel like a nigga on fire
Everybody got to go it's the truth
So I figure while I'm waitin' on my turn I'ma blow up the booth
I seen niggas in wheel chairs, eye patches and crutches
Arm slings that came home to have and dutches
We can go there but need I shoot
Put some holes in your Fila suit
You'll probably 'url when you see my crew
I play the hood all the time because I don't give a fuck!
You can shoot me down as long as I keep gettin' up what! 

If some shots may happen to go off tonight
Don't worry about me I be aight
Niggas could waste ammo firin' at me
Because I'm God's child there's angels around me 

If some shots may happen to go off tonight
Don't worry about me I be aight
Niggas could waste ammo firin' at me
Because I'm God's child there's angels around me 

Shootout shots ricochet, doc says that nigga dead
When your time's up, your time's up, this is real shit
On my balls 'til my number calls, say a prayer
Hopin' God hear - look, I don't fear man
Wanna bang out let's bang out, I don't care man
A eye for an eye, my perfect to perfections
They have me sprayin' automatics in every direction
Call me Louie Loco, nut case, oh no
I'm more like the kid that put the game in a choke hold
You stunt and I stop it, I'm makin' a profit
Every time you hear my vocals comin' out them lolo's
From LA to NY, on the red-eye
Teflon in my luggage, you gotta love it, I'm thuggin'
My street slang, my penitentiary posture
Got me out sellin' niggas whole fuckin' rosters
I'm big in New York, like B-I-G
Plus I runs with D-R-E

If some shots may happen to go off tonight
Don't worry about me I be aight
Niggas could waste ammo firin' at me
Because I'm God's child there's angels around me

50 Cent,"Remix, Lloyd banks, ha ha

It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down, give him a crown, he just throws it around
It's like a joke, he's like a king, but he don't rule a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold, don't want the jewelery

He don't want the fame, don't want the loot, he's in it for the sport
Runnin' circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't beggin' for it
And you can love it, you can hate it but you can't ignore it

You can't be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm frontin' then you better come confront me for it

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred twenty on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain, yeah
Money, power and respect in this rap game

He's straight out of a neighborhood where niggaz hate
They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Your stomach's ache while he's loungin' at the big estate
And he hops in a hundred thousand with a nigga's skate

House's with just a bigger gate, houndin' him is a big mistake
He won't surrender, he'd rather give up a rib to break
'Cuz he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helpin' hand
So he was sittin' on green like a Celtic fan

Created a buzz so that you gotta mention his name
When you discussin' the illest playa that's in the game
And he's ridin' with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and them
G Unit records ain't no motherfuckin' stoppin' them

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit you're corner with my weapon, I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred twenty on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

He's no magician man, he can't make sometin' outta nuttin'
So now niggaz from his hood act like he owe 'em somethin'
They talk crazy 'til he send niggaz to where they buck 'em
Ask 'em if it's a problem and he'll say na it's nothin'

He's was gonna help 'em out, but since they fronted, fuck 'em
He don't care how they feel they can hate 'em or love 'em
He hold his own on his own the kid is really thuggin'
He's rich now, he ain't changed so niggaz think he buggin'

He bulletproof everything 'cuz niggaz try to buck him
Keep two pistols on his hip, I'll show you where he tuck 'em
Niggaz say they gon' get at him but they can't touch him
Try to catch 'em slippin', they creepin' and start bustin'

This is the story of a warrior and now you know it
True warriors go ahead make some noise
It ain't healthy to be makin' niggaz paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon, I don't need my boyz

I'm doin' a hundred on the fast lane
Kick back, just relax, let me do my thang
Don't give a fuck about you sucka's gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game

I can give you niggaz somethin' you can talk about
I can turn you're smile upside down
You ain't no G, you're a fuckin' clown
I can take your girl a turn and turn her out

Don't hold it in, let it all out
I can give you fuckas somethin' to be mad about
Invite her in, send her back out
With my DNA all in her mouth

10 years
Yo the sun don't shine forever
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together
Better now than never business before pleasure
P-Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better?
Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight
So when you hear somethin, make sure you hear it right
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin
My music keeps you movin, what are you provin?
You know that I'm two levels above you baby
Hug me baby, I'ma make you love me baby

[P.Diddy](Biggie)
It's 10 years and we still runnin this motherfucker - yeah!
(one) As we proceed
to give you what you need (one two)
it's all fucked up now
what the fuck yall gon do now

[50 Cent]
Yo 
Yo we can't stay alive forever
So if shit hit the fan then we might as well die together
I'm high as ever - more hoes and mo cheddar
G-Unit move around with them pounds and berettas
yeah faggot, if I want it i'm gon have it
regardless if its handed to me or i gotta grab it
Don't make a ass outta yaself tryin to stop me
I'm cocky, rap's Rocky, nigga you sloppy
You know that i'm 8 levels above you nigga
I plug you nigga
I never heard of you nigga, ugly nigga
I'm the wrong one to provoke
n rattin on niggas is only gon leave ya smoked
so the only thing left now is toast for these cowards
I got no friends, fuck most of these cowards
They pop shit til we start approachin these cowards
while we lay around dollas, they lay around flowas

[Biggie]
In a Commision, you ask for permission to hit em
He don't like me, hit him and wild wifey was wit em
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me
The son of satan
They say my killin's too blatant
You hesitatin, I'm in your mama crib waitin
Duct tapin, your fam destiny
lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the iz-H phenominal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I can buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone -- Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
militant, y'all faggots ain't killin shit
Ooops Cristal keep spillin shit, you overdid it homes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The most shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin to make dough, like Jurassic
Parked in quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me
The Underboss of this holocaust
Truly yours, Frank White 

Chorus:
[Busta Rhymes]
We got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggaz is at? (2X)
Where the fuck my bitches at?
Where my bitches is at? 

[P.Diddy]
(over chorus: Hey yo, I got somethin new I wanna say, check this out

Hey Yo it can't stay dark for long
They say it's darkest before the dawn
Calm's before the storm
I'm happy Mason Betha's now preachin the psalms
And I can see B-I rockin the Sean John
Yeah right, this is what life after's like
B-I Frank white, you're Bad Boy For Life
No matter what the public say we gon prove
it aint another emcee that can fill ya shoes cuz
biggie smalls is the illest, realist
my stones the chillaz, got homes n villas
Overseas and woe is me I found out
Other emcees been tryin ta find ya route
it's ill when emcees used ta be on other shit
took home life after death and they studied it
listened to the double disc
now they all spit - like they all legit
frank tell em how we hit

[Biggie]
We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heat-as in the two-seat-as, with two midas
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P-Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank the crook from the Brook'
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the kiss, 
Peniro, sheek loops
Black Rob joined the mob, it ain't no replacin him
Niggaz step up, we just macin them
placin them in funerals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P-Diddy
Business rise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men
You screamin, Our position, competition
Nother day in the life of the Comission

[P. Diddy]
Oh it ain't over, aiyyo Banks talk to 'em

[Lloyd Banks]
I got a industry gangstress that argues and steams the reefer
And flip when I call her bitch like she Queen Latifah
Now all the vehicles is long enough to stash the streetsweeper
This shit gon' get uglier than the Master P sneaker
I'm slidin through the Ruckers, with Prada on the Chuckers
So the spring break hoes, home from college wanna fuck us
I ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckers
I'll sick rottweiler's on you fuckers, cops followin to cuff us
Top dollars to discuss this, whole lotta zeros
When it comes to paper I blow the soul outta hero
I'ma break 'fore I lay on the floor buried
besides, every rapper ain't a star, and every plaid ain't Burberry
You can't tame Lloyd, I'm smokin by the big screen
And changin the channel looks like I'm playin the game boy
I know the watch botherin ya vision
But reach and I'll put a dot on ya head like it's part of ya religion

Stand alone squeezing my pistol, I'm sure that I gotta
Now Peter Piper picked peppers and Run rocked rhymes
I'm 50 Cent, I write a little bit, but I pop 9's
Tell niggas get they money right, ‘cause I got mine
And I'm around, quit playing, nigga, you can't shine
You gon' be that next chump to end up in the trunk
After being hit by the pump – is that what you want?
Be easy, nigga, I'll lay your ass out
Believe me, nigga, that's what I'm about, gangsta
You could find a nigga sitting on chrome
Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone

If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'mma let the champagne bottle pop
I'mma take it to the top
For sure I'mma make it hot, baby

I'm down for the action, he smart wit' his mouth so smack him
You holding a strap, he might come back, so clap him
React like a gangsta, die like a gangsta for actin'
‘Cause you'll get hit and homicide'll be asking what happened
Oh no, look who clapped 'em with the .44
20 inch rims sitting on Low-pro’s
Eastside, Westside, niggas know, yo, I’m loco
Even my mama said something really wrong with my brain
Niggas don't rob me, they know I'm down to die for my chain
G-Unit – we get it popping in the hood
G-Unit – motherfucker, what's good?
I'm waiting on niggas to act like they don't know how to act
I had a sip of too much Jack, I'll blow 'em off the map
With the MAC, thinking it's all rap, 'til that ass get clapped and Doc say,
""It's a wrap"" (It's a wrap, nigga!)

If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'mma let the champagne bottle pop

I invented how to teach lessons to slow learners
Go 'head, act up, get smacked in the head with the burner
I don't fight fair, I'm dirty-dirty
I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga, ya heard me?
When streetlights come on niggas blast the 9's
Get locked up, they read books to pass the time
In the game there's ups and downs so I stay on the grind
Niggas on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
There ain't nothing they could do to stop my shine
This is God's plan, homie, this ain't mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma who always gotta throw in her two cents
I'm the drop-out who made more money than these teachers
Roofless like the Coupe, but I come with more features
I am what I am, you could like it or love it
It feels good to blow 50 grand and think nothing of it, fuck it!

If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'mma let the champagne bottle pop

Would you still have love for me girl?

If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century,
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz, would you poof and disappear like 
Some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Are you my soul mate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes, to make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

50 Cent,"Intro]
Yeah! It's 50!

[Chorus]
She got a habit man she powder her nose
And you can see she was a freak I suppose
She in the telly she use all three holes
Man you know me I just go with the flow
Just a touch, a blow, a lil' bit

[Verse 1]
And it's on, up and down she like to ride on top
Fast, prayin that the condom pop
That's foul, but fuck it it's all hood to me
Now Hollywood's been real real good to me
Now who gives a fuck if a bitch just ain't shit
In the whip she gives CPR to my dick
You losin 'em baby, get 'em up quick
This role play I'm really gettin into this shit
In the telly om all fours I'm ridin that horse
Screamin WOO HA!!! till my voice is lost
Call me 50 call me daddy you can call me the boss
My dick XXL you can call me The Source
You can lie 'bout my performance and give bad reviews
A quickie suppose to be quick bitch I kept on my shoes
Oh you thought we had a love thing girl you confused
Don't listen to the gossip it's never ever true
They say I do things that I never ever do
On the radio, they say me and you a item
Nas fall in love with hoes me I just like 'em
I can't be your man Paris head game great
And Eve's usin dildos on her sex tape
Ashanti's lil' ass butt naked in the truck
These bitches is poppin off why would I tie myself up
At the Super Bowl Janet Jackson showed me a tit
Other niggaz saw it but I felt she showed me it
Times is hard in the yard baby this is real shit
My record sales slow, I'm a show you my dick

Bridge:
Wait a minute baby hold on, I'm just tryin to fix the camera
You know, relax, ha ha h, I'm comin, yeah
It's on you got the water in the tub
Wanna get in the tub, ha ha ha ha

Chorus:
She got a habit man she powder her nose
And you can see she was a freak I suppose
She in the telly she use all three holes
Man you know me I just go with the flow

First we get the talkin, then we get the touchin
If we get pass the phone games we'll be fuckin
I kiss like the french therefore my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just mean a different position
In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love
But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back I see this pussy is mine
If you ain't sure when I'm talkin I don't tell you no lies
But there's things that you say that have me wonderin why
When I don't say what I'm thinkin it don't mean that I'm shy
Got on that shit you picked out for me that's why I'm so fly

If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)

Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!) please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
There's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets
'Fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit
I get closer to you, I mean closer than close
I get into you, after I take off my clothes
Girl I been into you, mentally long before

If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)

Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!) please say he's just a friend

You heard about the kid, you know how I rock
Went from pumpin bags on the block, straight to the top
So the money ain't a thing now, yeah that's right
Mansion after mansion, next stop the Hamptons
I splurge with it, I'm so absurd with it
Got the hunger to go get it, cause I wan' go spend it
You know how a boss player play, nigga I'm ballin
If there's money to be made, I'm all in
Catch me in a cherry red Porsche, beige seats, red pipin
You want me to teach you how to stunt, aight then
Tattoos on the arm, 30 karats on the charm
Cause the flow be the bomb, learn to respect the Don
First night if I don't hit, second night I want some shit
Third night we call it quits, I ain't fuckin with the bitch
Success is my drug of choice, I'm high off life
Another move another mill', let's get right - aight?

Hey! Go 'head and touch your body like you want to

You could, catch me cockin the fifth, got me rockin with Fif'
Now that's why you see the keys to the Bent'
Got my niggas movin the bricks, it don't stop
And a million dollar deal, homey get that gwap
See dudes get comfy, money ain't long enough
Come spit one verse, my whole crib's coughed up
Ma I got a fetish, fuckin in them Porsche trucks
Curtis got one so when I finished I tossed her
Y'all into wifin, we don't condone lifin
Only fuck with bitches that, got they liquor license
Shop high prices, shook all vices
Infamous nigga got the game in a vice grip
Chain hundred K but the flow, is priceless
Anything less? We rollin them dices
Nuts in the sand if you ain't bumpin my shit
Shorty wanna rip to my sound and my likeness

Now now now now c'mon
Hey! Go 'head and touch your body like you want to
Now now now now c'mon

Listen - you can call me Gambino P or V.I.P
My wrists could buy a bitch a Ph.D
My rings alone could pay for you to eat
For the next few years I'm so icy kid
My flow is long money, my face is Hollywood
My tattoos gon' keep me with a thug part though
My attitude is universal, get harmed - call money
When we get back to Queens we gon' hurt you
Can't afford to ride, you gettin stomped out
I got a team of dimes, they all thonged out
Ready to line you up and take you out
My girls is hot man, they hard to turn down
You pee in your drawers lookin like you're Mexican
After lil' shorty wop wop break you off a lil' bit
You so stupid, we so much rich
And who braggin? I'm just tryin holla at the chicks like

(I won't burn unless your there)

Yea, I need you,I need you to hate
So I can use you for your energy
you know, its real shit, feel this!

America's got a thing for this gangsta's shit, they love me
Black Chucks, black skullies, leather Pelle-Pelle
I take spills over raymo shit, I'ma fan
Got through the silver duck tape on my trait old handle
The women on my life bring confusion shit
SO like Nino from New Jack, I'll have to cancel that bitch
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggaz around me so cold, man my heart dun froze up
I build an empire on the low the narc's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that coco leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the door
O after O, you know, homey I'm just triple beam, dreamin
Niggaz be schemin, I'm fiendin to live a good life
The fiends just fiendin
Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me

[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga you get in my way when while I'm tryin to get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga fuck you (fuck you)
I want to find the thing thats in my life
So I hustle (hustle)

Yea, I don't know shit about gymnastics I summersault bricks
Black talents start flyin, when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggaz can't fuck with me
Man my cold days, they called me chef boy are 50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed shit
Send me them seeds i'll grow 'em what they need
Them ain't chia pet plants in the crib thats chronic
And I'm sellin them 500 a pop god damn it
I sold everythin I'ma hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes put in water and tell you its wine
If you analyze me, what you'll find is the DNA recrock

What goes in my mind, its contagious
Hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If the rap was the block or spider, I'll be poke and butter
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me where ever that dope be, gettin money man

[Chorus]

Its a hustler's ambition, close your eyes listen, see my vision
Mossberg pumpin, shotgun dumpin and drama means nothin
It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin lanes
In the jewels with your chains
I upgrade from 30 BS to clean VS
Rocks that I copped procedes from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Played it perf and get nauseous, watchin the spinner spin
I make plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate
Them holi tip bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Crystal in the blender and make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he don't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey they can't stop me
Racist, pointin at me look at the nigga ratchi

Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

Nowadays niggaz snitchin so much in the street
But you gotta talk to them like they the police
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout poppin the heat
I don't know nothin 'bout sellin no beef in the streets
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout baggin the grams
I ain't never had no spot or went hand to hand
Me, I don't know nothin 'bout takin the stand
I ain't never got a nigga ass stuck in the can
Nah, I don't know nothin 'bout dro or hash
Coke, dope, ex, dust or crystal meth
Nah, I'm just tryin to rap to get some cash
Keep the Hip Hop Police off my ass

Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

Aiyyo, that's my word on the stack of bibles
I don't know who did it I don't know who responsible
All I know who spittin all I know who givin
Me all this cash, just to put down twelve to get in yo' ass
Listen, keep it far away from me
I ain't got time for sittin in the penitentuary
All I know is I'm rich, all I know is that G-Unit work
When theb album drop they go bezerk
Mad video play, crazy radio spins
Number one all the time, our reign never ends
Don't point the finger at us somebody's hangin
They had a beef with us, plus we don't know nathin

Nah nigga I don't know, I don't know who got you
I don't know who stabbed you, I don't know who shot you
I don't know who cut you, I don't know who robbed you
But you think I know cause you know how my squad do

I don't know nothin 'bout jumpin out splittin homeboy head
But for real that's fucked up they say that homeboy dead
I can't even think, who 'gon want him dead
Have no idea what type of gun they done him with
You see I hear no evil and I see no evil
Ain't tryin to talk to or hear from or see those people
And I ain't had them little homies burn up no regal
I've been tryin to do this music thang and just go legal
I don't know why my name in your female's phone
But you really startin to sound like a females homes
Don't know why they told you that we sell stones

Nah nigga I don't know who sent them young boys through
To air the strip, shit just be happenin out the blue
I don't be around here, I ain't hip to the news
I don't know why that man clutchin on that shit when you move
I don't know why that other rapper got stripped for his jewels
You know how easy it is to get shit confused
I wasn't even in New York, I was just in the cruise
Somewhere way out in the islands woth your bitch in the cruise
Who's my bitch in the cruise, dudes get hit when they snooze
Lose they hit from the Uz, Uz all over the street
I don't know why they said what's up I don't know who's in that jeep
He talk about me all day but I ain't losin no sleep

I don't know why my charm 'bout as big as your palm
And why the diamond chain I wear as 'bout as long as your arm
You tell me, how many diamonds in my bezel
There's one for everytime I had to grind up in the ghetto
I could show you how to do it, you tired of ridin Buicks
I don't know why niggaz rap for years and can't make hotter music
Even when, I don't do it chicks release body fluid
Body drop, shotty pop, and niggaz wanna tie me to it
I don't know why Loon and Fabby won't just say I'm they daddy
Why they solve them CB4 niggaz just keep comin at me
Got as many beefs as 50 and a nigga go to church
Could you imagine if my hands was on work, I don't know
