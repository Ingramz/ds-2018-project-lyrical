Nas,"This bitter land
Watered with my soul
The fruit it bears
Leaves me so cold
This bitter land
Does nothing for love
This bitter land
Brings pain from above, oh-oh

Yeah, running on the concrete, cross the train tracks
The devil is behind me
In the ghetto where's you'll find me, it's where I stays at
Cop shot us up, he get a medal then retire
But it never will define me
Write a letter to the president, whoever in control of the society
Tell 'em stop riding me, stop driving us into a suicidal ideology
Tryna feed my seeds
Getting high on weed, study my degrees
Stay fly, getting paper
With some dead white people faces in the circle of spaces around the green
I'mma lean, taking Percs as a bit of Earth
Is a nigga cursed? Am I blessed? See what I mean
It's a test, life is a test
Life is like a hood, hard
Trying not to fall between the cracks
In the cracks it's so dark, and the dark
Seems more appealing than the light in the land
Where you gotta fight
Catch a body in the night, we need a plan
To survive, to survive the land
Survive the storm, when it comes through
Either you're busy living or busy dying, look what it's come to
Look what it's come to, so what you're gonna do?

This bitter land is far too real
This bitter land, it does not heal
'Cause in the land skies are grey
But we fight the storms that come our way
A boy who strives to be a man
Must push to lead with all he can
Oh, this bitter land
Oh, bitter land
Oh, oh, oh, oooh
This bitter land can't stop my fight
This bitter land

Look what it's come to 
So what you gonna do?

Nas,"I wouldn't marry a black woman here's the reason why (why)
Black women's evil, do things on the sly (no)
You look for your supper to be good and hot (hot)
She never put the neck bone in the pot

She's on the road again (sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman (on the road again)
She's on the road again (sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman (on the road again)

I went to my window, my window was propped
I went to my door, my door was locked
I stepped right back, I shook my head
A big black nigga's in my folding bed
I shot through the window, I broke the glass
I never seen a little nigga run so fast

He's on the road again (sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman (on the road again)
He's on the road again (sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman (on the road again)

Your friend at your house just to rest his hat
Next thing he wanna know where your husband's at
She says ""I don't know he's on his way to the pen""
Come on mama, let's get on the road again

She's on the road again (sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman (on the road again)
She's on the road again (sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman (on the road again)

I'm with my black woman let me tell you (why)
Black women's evil, do things on the sly (no)
You look for your supper to be good and hot (hot)
She never put the neck bone in the pot

She's on the road again (sure as you're born)

No disrespect to them, but I never needed them older niggas
Or so we thought speedin' through life like
The speed of sound, what's your life like?
Momma stressin', seen the ratchets in the dresser
She not asking questions, seen the vests
Seen other kids in the caskets restin'
Life ill, 'cause most of my niggas in jail
For them it was hustle or death, I reshuffled my deck

Watch out for insecure niggas
They take your soul out your body
They not secure
I pray the Lord stop a opp before I go backwards
Resort to violent reactions, that's childish
My life's a dream to rappers
Afraid they moments have past 'em
It's all different hustle (straight up)
Niggas movin' bricks
Young niggas rappin', doin' shows, hittin' they licks
Everybody hold this money in thicks
Don't get robbed, boy, is you dumb?
All them swipers gettin' it how it come (Yep)
43, morally ambiguous, you serious?
Gettin' it, lyricist, idiots, you ain't nearin' this
Out of New York's biggest and richest
I'm the template, low-key the busiest
The game chose me, deal with it
So I'm the quiet type, Mr. One Mic
But silent listen, use the same letters to spell it right, so hear me

Nas,"We gotta get it
They hated Esco
They hated Escobar
I'm still here
Dave East talk that talk
Streets need that
NYC, L.A., Chicago, Detroit, the whole world
Lets get it

I had a basic plan, get out the projects and never look back
Could still smell the aroma from when my uncle would cook crack
One conversation between homies, better yet brothers
That used to spend the night with each other
They moms was best friends
One name was Anthony, the hood called 'em Ant Live
Kept his pistol on 'em, so he bought a bigger pant size
He got a little colder the moment he watched his man die
That was ten years ago
Baby-face, wishing that his beard would grow
Now he throw a set up anywhere he go
He just a product of his environment
Told me he'd rather die than ever go to Rikers again
Did a bid, his celly was blood, he studied five percent
Came home, like let niggas see me, I'll never ride with tint
Cory was his right-hand man, his mother up North
She was busting checks with the wrong nigga
He popped Xannys and he just want him some strong liquor
Lose the attitude, he miserable
For years he tried to get a lick or two
Moms begging he finish school, but non-sense he get into
Ant' met Cory when they was kids with innocence
Ant' hated his dad around 'cause that nigga was militant
Cory found a hoe to pass, some cash, they could triple it
Double it, stack it up, Cory ain't never want to spend
Ant' was blowing money fast, big Meeching when he shopped
Flashy nigga, body wrapped in diamonds, necklace, and the watch

They hated Jesus, hated Malcolm, hated Martin
(They gon' hate) Eight niggas living in a two-bedroom apartment
No lights up in the crib, I guess I came up out the darkness
Mood change when I spark it, new Range, now I park it
They hated Jesus, hated Malcolm, hated Martin
(They gon' hate) Eight niggas living in a two-bedroom apartment
No lights up in the crib, I guess I came up out the darkness
Mood change when I spark it, new Range, now I park it

Ant' and Cory set up a trap, fiends in and out of that
No mask, stocking cap, they robbed him, but he got it back
Six in the morning with baggies on him was a way of life
Streets will teach you quick, ain't nothing free, pay the price
Eviction notice in the kitchen, your bitch will stay the night
Cory had the sour with him, Ant' fuck with 'yola
Got kicked out his moms crib, she found a couple boulders
Locked up with killers up North, he rubbed a couple shoulders
Cory told Ant' on the V I the block was changing
Ant' told Cory be grateful, freedoms' amazing
Three and half light bid, Ant' stayed in drama
He was light skinned, outside before you niggas was typing
No MySpace
Cory and Ant' had butter rockin'
The other younger niggas from the block, just loved to watch him
Couple haters, but nothing major, they knew the streets
Niggas caught Cory, made him take off that new Philippe
Cory took it on the chin, he wasn't new to beef
Killers kill you for talking, all you gotta do is speak
Thats a man down, Ant' told Cory have the fam 'round
And keep on shitting on niggas until your pants brown
They hustle low, so much evidence that can't found
Cory got nervous whenever they spun that Van 'round
They snatched him and he talked about the way he got it
Broke the code, that was snitchin', it ain't no way around it

They hated Jesus, hated Malcolm, hated Martin
(They gon' hate) Eight niggas living in a two-bedroom apartment
No lights up in the crib, I guess I came up out the darkness
Mood change when I spark it, new Range, now I park it
They hated Jesus, hated Malcolm, hated Martin
(They gon' hate) Eight niggas living in a two-bedroom apartment
No lights up in the crib, I guess I came up out the darkness
Mood change when I spark it, new Range, now I park it

Nas,"The system will defeat itself
Nothing stays in a steady state, it overheats and melts
It only feeds itself, the system
Yo, I think it exists just because, like a pit eats its pups
Eats its own litter up
The system's fucked, it's corrupt
It's poison, survival is genocidal
No place or origin, no beginning cycle
Let's occupy all streets
It's crazy to think in the '80s
I wanted minks, and a Benz to listen to Michael
And Grand Puba Maxwell and get cash
While I'm sippin' on drinks
In Nike sweatsuits and Gucci links
I'm like a Russian mob figure, I'm mad low
In the shadows, big up to Shadow
DJ Shadow arose to throw blows
Can't see me but Nas moving the fastest
I'm a 3D movie, no need of glasses
I'm a 3D movie, no need of glasses

Systematic

I wish I was an arms dealer to sell illegal arms in the hood
No backup check, put cash in my palms and we good
Lack of respect get you to fall where you stood
Mathematics is God’s language, it’s in my blood
Art, music, letters and numbers
I'm a vessel, I'm humble
Meeting start ups, I invest if I want to
Transforming global markets with all of my partners
Methodical corporate culture, straight out the projects
What's the ingredients to the realest?
Place two cups of cranberry in the skillet
A half a cup of water, add some Henny
Let it cook for eight minutes, but you ain't finished
Let it simmer 'til the cranberry pop a little
Keep stirring, sip it, it's art like Keith Haring
It gets in your blood, you start to feel what I'm feeling
Don't listen, just try to feel what I'm feeling

Hold your breath for fifteen seconds
Close your eyes, cover your ears, do not listen
Try to feel what I'm saying

Oh my God, they speak venomous on the boy
Oh my Lord, my enemy is fear, and I'm sure
Oh my God, they want the end of me 'cause I'm pure
Oh my Lord, discipline for the win, I just go for it
It's a trend for these men to die on their own sword
Journey far, learn who you can be
But you can learn who you are when you around family
Chip off their shoulders and soldiers, on they grizzle
My granddaddy Mac Little married Dandy Little
They passed down wisdom, blessings were given
Pray my sins don't get passed to my children
I made a killin', I'm alive like the morning star

Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree

The ghosts of gangsters dance
Chinchillas shake on the hanger, the force of this banger
Yeah, my language advance, my cadence amazin'
The voice triggers somethin'
What is this conundrum?
The clouds scurry, your spirit rumble, a boyish smile
Still puff the loud, it's nothin' less than a quarter pound
Savage narrative, every verse that I write bursts light
Brings awareness to my personal life
After my morning walk, Havana cigar, the ganja spark
See my doctor more, sweatin' the sauna or the spa
Spendin' fifty large at the Bellagio
Spent twenty on a bad bitch I hardly know
New girl every night, two girls was every other night
Sexual addiction, gangster tradition
They wanna fuck me, have me under they belt, slightly offended
Yeah, that's how I felt, that's how it ended
I'm just good at existin', existed in my truth

What come first, peace or the paper?
Before I had a piece of paper, peace was in my favor
Before I sat to eat at the table it had leeches and traitors
Cut the fat from the meat, extract the weak, bon appetit
No bacon, brothers is swine
It's so hard to trust 'em 'cause my hustle is mine
It's evident they all the same
With gray hair and still mean muggin'
Gray hairs of wisdom, that means you seen somethin'
Say somethin', you stay frontin'
But these clowns got false crowns, fictional kings
You broke my heart, Fredo
You bring this thing of ours down to a fable
Be advised my guys dryin', enterprisin' at the boss's table
There's always room at my table
Insecurities is keepin' you disabled
All this money to get, is it less time?
They ain't stopped printin' money, 'cause they made mine
I learned to stretch time, these are the best times
I'm in my neighborhood in stadiums, the Mets' kind
With restaurants and Carbone, spicy rigatoni
Go hard, a red Bordeaux, oh God!

To my life, your life pales in comparison
So go write whatever blog, messiness is not ever the god
Do what's necessary, I'm never worried
Listen vultures, I've been shackled by Western culture
You convinced most of my people to live off emotion
That's why we competitin'
Death by the chrome barrel, forgot the secrets
My killer be Gerald, bone marrow's the deepest
You can peep at the comments, but don't fall for that
We want freedom, I'm a scholar and almanac

Inclusion is a hell of a drug

From the birth of a child, the world is foul
Excursions of a certain child
Should learn not to take nothin' personal
A parent hates to watch his baby's face
Takin' his first immunization shots, but this is great
The child's introduction to suffering and pain
Understands without words
Nothin' is explained or rushed to the brain
Lookin' up at his parents' face
Like, ""I thought you would protect me from this scary place?""
""Why'd you let them inject me?""
""Who's gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me?""
Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me?
If Starbucks is bought by Nestlé, please don't arrest me
I need to use your restroom and I ain't buy no espresso
Soon enough, assume the cuffs, the position
Not new to us, since back on the bus sittin'

In Italy, I'm Eduardo Wiccari
But Nasty the hustler, nasty like mustard gas, sulfur
And I could sell Alaska to Russia, no pressure
My first house, 11.000-square-feet mansion
It was a haunted by dead bitch whites
Mad a nigga bought his crib, to hang up pictures of black Christ
Circular driveways, black cars and black ice
My second house, still in my twenties, illin' with money
Chilled through my spine, spillin' wine, it's funny
Did good for a staircase loiterer, euphoria
What you saw when you seen a teen turn to a warrior
Did every Fourth of July, bustin' in the sky
It was important to a guy who was mob-minded
Future Murcielago driver, 'til Lambos got average on me
I started likin' the look like I ain't had no money
Yellow taxi seats over Maybach seats
Just to remind me, just to inspire me
To stay focused, it's a real sick society
Just 'cause I got your support don't mean you're buyin' me
I'm buyin' back the land owned by the slave masters
Where my ancestors lived, just to say a rapper
Made a change, the pants-sagga put plans in action
Til they claim the Pan-African made it happen

Your love and your heart
See 'cause you've never been the same anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
Your love and your heart
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

Dark boy, don't you cry, there's too much life left in those eyes
Don't you let that face go waterfall
Until they learn to love you, scars and all
Dark boy, don't you die
They're just human, let them lie
You just know your world and speak your truth
And let them come to you
For your love and your heart

And that's all!

Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus
Nasty Nas is a rebel to America
Police murderer, I'm causing hysteria
My troops roll up with a strange force
I was trapped in a cage and let out by the Main Source
Swimming in women like a lifeguard
Put on a bulletproof nigga I strike hard
Kidnap the President's wife without a plan
And hanging niggas like the Ku Klux Klan
I melt mics till the sound wave's over
Before stepping to me you'd rather step to Jehovah
Slamming MC's on cement
Cause verbally, I'm iller than a AIDS patient
I move swift and uplift your mind
Shoot the gif when I riff in rhyme
Rapping sniper, speaking real words
My thoughts react, like Steven Spielberg's
Poetry attacks, paragraphs punch hard
My brain is insane, I'm out to lunch, God
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic
My voicebox locks and excels like a rocket

Fatal is merciful and they curse me
When I grip the mic I show no mercy
I got heart, I rip the party apart
From the seams and hem up like bell-bottom jeans
But you get done, you get blues like 501
Brothers are live but I bet ya I'm liver son
So let me get upon the scene and redeem
The dream of a team, and knock 'em out like Mitch Green
Smoke some thai weed, flow at a high speed
Rap on off breaks stomping like Northlakes
Cause I'm living larger than the founders of Fendi
An Asiatic brother that many rappers envy
So round up your crew and entourage
And let the God Merciful just take charge

Some of them said (said what?) that the Ak should quit
But I don't sweat it, cause I'm too big for that small shit
Like pigs when it comes to a showdown
Huff and puff but the Ak won't get blown down
Cause I come strong, rather than come at all and not be ready
That's what separates me from the petty
MC's gas themselves by drinking too much Getty
And get torn the fuck up like confetti
I'm rich and thick, your lyrics like Aunt Jemima
It doesn't take Keenan Ivory Wayans to know that I'mma
Get you sucker if you bite like a piranha
So save them preschool rhymes for the kids at Wonderama
Point blank, period, with no comma
Rhymes so dangerous, call for the homicide
Cause I knock 'em dead even when I'm at my worst
The only future that lies ahead of them is the lights from the hearse
Got game like a crackhead
But don't be misled, I keep rappers on lock like a dread
Knots in the head from the words that I said
So get a shovel and dig your grave cause the shit you talk is dead

Add 'em on like tax, and I'm over like Hot Trax
As far as brothers are concerned a pressure cooker from start
To finish I diminish like a Cuisinart
Secondly, I'm sick of critics, who's necking me
(Ooh he got an afro) yo, but I got dough
Why's my name the Large Professor?
Cause I milked your cow in other words I hit your heifer
Don't talk about how you can break Rambo
That's just a bunch of mamba-ja-hambo
Propaganda, save it for Savanda
Joe and Amanda, Zach and Alexandra
Don't let the folks around your way puff your head

Goin to school not for nuttin they teachin lies and assumptions
And they tell us keep comin, comin to school now for what? When
Comin back to a system that's whack and really not runnin
Oh I'm sorry it's runnin, it's not PROPERLY runnin
It's a conspiracy hear me man it's got to be somethin
I can get guns faster than I can get an english muffin
And the black church ain't sayin nuttin
We on our own cousin, I'm stickin to this

[Chorus]

I'm livin for this hip-hop, I'm spittin for this hip-hop
I'm givin to this hip-hop, my life is hip-hop
Culture, and y'all know that
Hip-Hop in the media, y'all know it's whack
But just like them dopefiends who keep comin back
Like the mayor of D.C., buyin Joey's crack
No disrespect to either one of them but look at that
Study the metaphors in this rap
We bigger than crack, but we keep buyin it
We bigger than rap, but we keep denyin it
Justice, equality, keep cryin it
But the only way to get it is to start applyin it
Fat Joe that's my bro shows 'nuff respect
Talib, that's my bro, shows 'nuff respect
50 Cent that's my bro he shows 'nuff respect
Common! That's my bro he shows 'nuff respect
Snoop Dogg is my bro showed 'nuff respect
Dead Prez that's my peeps yo 'nuff respect
Cassidy's an MC who shows 'nuff respect
Hip-Hop is one, don't forget
I'm stickin with this

[Chorus]

I'm livin for that hip-hop culture, shape it like a sculpture
Touch it why don'tcha, touch it why don'tcha
Hip-Hop is yours and mine and that's fine
But hip-hop's culture ain't about just crime
You caught up in the image and, don't know they rhymes
You caught up in they bodies and don't know they minds
So I'm, here to bring the truth in the place
Like don't think Common won't punch you in your face~!
And don't think Talib won't hold the heat
To stop the violence you gotta know your street
You gotta know who Tanga Reed is
Fat Joe's a leader, Busta Rhymes a preacher
KRS-One's a teacher
But through Cassidy my lessons are quicker to reach ya
We one community
I'm talkin about unity, in other words you and me
I'm with this

North America
South America
N.A.S.A. is unity

N.A.S.A. is a unique cooperative effort
With our counterparts all over the world.
We create together breaking boundaries
And borders set for us by society.

We tend to bring elements that maybe were
Built 2000 miles apart, and the first time
They see each other is on record.

Our aim is to transcend preconceived divisions
That are in place to keep us divided.
Music and art have tremendous power of bringing
People together, and this is our goal, to show
Through these mediums that we are all one race of human beings",Intro,2009
NASA 2000,"In some way when those two Americans
Stepped on the Moon
The people of this world were brought closer together
That it is that spirit, the spirit of Apollo

Which America can now help
To bring to our relations with other nations
The spirit of Apollo transcends
Geographical barriers and political differences
It can bring the people of the world together

To our friends, all our friends
Let's begin to ascend
As we go through the whole universe
We ascend

To vital organs, forming your brain and tiny heart
The fetus, date of birth; until puberty finally starts
Adolescence, adult, then your elderly body rots
It was divine decree that begun the plan
But is diseased by the greed of the sons of man
Don't try to leave with the guns in hand
Understand: God's the one in command

Did we climb out of the sea?
Where did we come from, you and me?
Two legs to walk, and as you see
I'm not a man I want to be
People growing, my backyard (I'm growing in your backyard)
In my garden, in my heart (I'm in your garden, I'm in your heart)
Pink and purple, red and blue (See all the colors?)
On this sunny afternoon (It's a sunny afternoon)

Back before time was time and space was space
The ever-present eye divine so laced with grace
Decided it was time to try to chase, to chase
But what it would design, now life is taking place
Within itself, divided; now it takes some space
And it can't be found alive, the mind creates the state
Of ego, now what's mine is mine
OK, now hate will reign until the blind have eyes and lay awake in wait

How are the seeds in the ground?
How is my garden growing now?
A tender kiss, a little smile
The way a mother holds its child
Tasty little human beings (Tasty little human beings)
I grow them on the people tree (I grow them on the people tree)
I will eat them one by one (Eat them one by one)
If there's enough for everyone (Like you and you)

Born in the ever-flowing life beyond the dirt
Tell me what the purpose is for creating the earth
(Maybe we created the planet as man's habitat
Be fruitful and multiply across the planet's back)
Well, why does hate exist?
The war and AIDS and shit?
If we're to be fruitful, why can't poor people pay they rent?
('Cause love and hate, both sides are conjoined
Physical forms have to deal with both sides of the coin)
Why do we die? (So you can live!)
Why do we strive? (So you can win!
But why did you defy every truthful word I recommend?)
My question back, why do you recommend an ode temptationing
(So I can test your patience and tolerance in the face of sin)
But why attest when you hold all the answers to the state we in?
(For you to bear witness of imperfections of mortal men)
So it's a lesson? (And a blessing
Journey back to where you been
'Cause before the tree can flourish seeds must first be planted in)

I remember when the Cubans was first on Broadway.
With dark and yellow gold,
I was 11 years old.
The inspiration was spread out like a blanket, ask em'.
My discovery was beyond the pick, the Lee suit, and the afro.
Now from the flair jeans on 169th and College.
Watching the dude lean on one-seven-o
With a Kangol 'cross America,
I saw the hippies cross.
By Herc on Technique needles syncopated time was on time,
The same time as the Beatles.
I was up there watching James Brown's pockets, stuffed withJolly
Ranchers.
when the NFL had the Rams in Los Angeles,
Charles Finley in Oakland,
And my kindergarten moment was the beginning.
'Til the Caribbean people came to New York and sheepskin
was bought,

they crush us up in they grind,
The meat and bone of the mind.
We gather here on the block (spacious thoughts)
They key broke off in the lock.
I'll meet you down by the well
I'll meet you down by the well (spacious thoughts)

The balloon drops down at midnight
Stranglin' the monkey with the hands of a clock
Good can't help but do a little evil
Evil can't help but,
do a little Good.

All aboard for the night train!
They say the moon, it smells just like a cherry bomb.
Come on home,
All is forgiven.
Everything costs.
Deliver us from evil,
And carry your own cross.

Breaking out in a cold sweat.

Let's come off the line now at Sunset and Vine
But I'll go you one better, if you've got the nerve
Let's race all the way -- to Dead Man's Curve""

(Dead Man's Curve) is no place to play
(Dead Man's Curve) you'd best keep away
(Dead Man's Curve) I can hear 'em say
""Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve""

The street was deserted late Friday night
We were buggin' each other while we sat out the light
We both popped the clutch when the light turned green
You shoulda heard the whine from my screamin' machine!

I flew past La Brea, Schwab's and Crescent Heights
And all the Jag could see were my six taillights
He passed me at Doheny then I started to swerve
But I pulled her out and there we were - at Dead Man's Curve

(Dead Man's Curve) is no place to play
(Dead Man's Curve...  )

""Well, the last thing I remember, Doc
I started to swerve
And then I saw the Jag slide into the curve
I know I'll never forget that horrible sight
I guess I found out for myself that everyone was right""

Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve

But girl there are ways to make certain things pay
Though I'm dressed in these rags, I'll wear sable some day

Hear what I say
I'm gonna ride the serpent
No more time spent sweatin' rent
Hear my command
I'm breakin' loose, it ain't no use
Holdin' me down, stick around

But baby (baby)
Remember (remember)
It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But some day I'll treat you real fine

There'll be women and their fortunes
Who just want to mother orphans
Are you gonna cry, when I'm squeezin' the rye
Takin' all I can get, no regrets
When I, openly lie
And leave only money
Believe me honey, that money
Can you believe, I ain't no saint
No complaints
So girl go out
Hand it out

And baby (baby)
Remember (remember)
It's my life and I'll do what I want

Fuck shooting legs
Cock back put his brains on the pave
Nigga how bout that
Close range with the gadge get payed
First rapper to shoot off stage
Turn the front page the next day my life is like a book
A twenty four hour song without no hook
Millennium Thug computer chips up in my slug
Turn quarters when you turn quarters know who to plug
Thugs around me outside its grimmy outside
Better slide before you get bodied outside

I'ma prison cell six by nine
Living hell stone wall metal bars for the gods in jail
My nickname the can, the slammer, the big house
I'm the place many fear cause there's no way out
I take the sun away put misery instead
When you wit me most folks consider you dead
I saw too many inmates falling apart
Call for the gods and let them out when it's dark
Convicts think they alone but if they listen close
They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse
All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin
I hear ya prayers (even when ya whispering)
I make it hotter in the summer colder in the winter
If the court paroal ya then another con enters
No remorse for your tears I seen em too often
When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin
Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep
Make you dream that you free then make you wake up to me
Face to face with a cage no matter your age
I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage
Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out
Cause only you and I know what sufferings about
Yo it's stunning when bed sheets become your woman
And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is coming
Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you
You'll always be my property nigga stay legal

Nasheet Waits,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2007

How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy darkness shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary,
And fathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God, the King,
And peace to men on earth

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous Gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in

O holy Child of Bethlehem,
Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin and enter in,
Be born in us today.

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly

Nashville Mandolin Trio,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1999
Nashville Pianos,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000

To blow 'em all away

He got a last minute sponsor
From the Catfish Cafe
Got drunk and hauled it down
To Kentucky Motor Speedway

To wait for the starting flag

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the Riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

Yippie yi Ohhhhh
Yippie yi yaaaaay
Ghost Riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

Nashville Rhythm Section,"It was seven months since 9/11
And the work was almost done
It was seven months since 9/11
And the work had just begun
Ground Zero lit the evening sky
Like a beacon through the heart
The searchlights drove through Heaven's doors
And blew them far apart
A few miles north on the Hudson River
We had gathered for a sort of wake
Nobody felt like celebrating
But the Firemen needed some kind of break
They'd been to so many funerals
And seen so many God-awful sights
They'd been to Ground Zero from dawn to dusk
And round the clock some nights

To Kingdom come, to hell and gone
To somewhere far away
Where murder doesn't break the heart
On a sunny day

I was all dressed up like the rest of the crowd
At the Roxy Club that night
The men and women in Uniform
Tried hard to keep it light
Kevin Bacon played and sang
And folks began to smile
Chris Bodi played his silver horn
With rhythm and with style
I sang my song Amazing Grace
And people laughed and cried
Ronan Tynan sang Danny Boy and
Not an eye was dry
Steve Buscemi spoke of life
At Engine 55,
Of how these heroes
Stayed the course and
Saved so many lives

To Kingdom come, to hell and gone
To somewhere far away
Where murder doesn't break the heart

A burly man with a handsome face
Stuck out his hand and smiled
Say, meet my wife, we like your songs
We've been with you mile for mile
Though he had a rugged face
I knew I saw the hurt
Then he pointed to a spot above the collar of his shirt.
Just look here on the back of my neck,
There's a tattoo, can you see?
Just right here, I got up close
And saw the number 343,
The number of the Firemen
Who were lost upon that day
The numbers of those heroes,
Ground Zero was their grave

To Kingdom come, to hell and gone
To somewhere far away
Where murder doesn't break the heart
On a sunny day

Those firemen loaded up with gear
Climbed to their death's that day
Along with all the other hundreds
Blasted on their way
Police and EMS and those
On whom death took its toll
And more whose dreams will never dawn,
More than three thousand souls
I left the party after that
I could not stay my tears,
For all our gifts for all our hopes
For all our nameless fears
For all our heroes, men and women
Lost on that black day
Those firemen with courage
In their hearts so strong and brave,
Who made sure in their final hours
There were 30,000 saved.

They've gone to where there are no tears
And every heart is gay,
And they won't be forgotten on a sunny day

pressed and polished, shaking hands down at the store
Everyone had come to see the all-star hop the greyhound bus and go to war
He punched me in the arm to say goodbye
It was the first time that I saw our father cry

I kept all my brother's letters tied in ribbon in a box beneath my bed
Every night I read by flashlight with the covers in a tent above my head

Then it was football games and homecoming and
picking out our dresses for the prom

While the flagpole by the football field flew the colors half-way down the mast
The wind blew cold and snow was coming down
Still everybody turned out from our town
As we laid my brother in that frozen ground

So much was lost, so much was missed
It doesn't seem fair that any boy or any girl
Should have to carry the weight of the world",Weight of the World,2010

And I've seen the stuff they put inside

I was Roger Staubach in my back yard
Had a shoe box full of baseball cards
And a couple of Evel Knievel scars
On my right arm
I was a kid when Elvis died
And my momma cried

It was nineteen seventy somethin'
In the world that I grew up in
Farrah Fawcett harido days
Bell bottoms and eight tracks tapes
Lookin' back now I can see me
And oh man did I look cheesy
But I wouldn't trade those days for nothin'
Nineteen seventy somethin'

It was the dawning of a new decade
When we got our first microwave
And Dad broke down and finally shaved
Them old sideburns off
I took the stickers off of my Rubik's Cube
Watched MTV all afternoon
And my first love was Daisy Duke
In them cut off jeans
A space shuttle fell out of the sky
And the whole world cried

It was nineteen eighty somethin'

Skatin' rinks and black Trans Am's
Big hair and parachute pants
Lookin' back now I can see me

At Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight

She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place
And she signed autographs
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath
That small time town was hers

Hey, she doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends cut her down
The only thought she entertains is where they aren't
And where she is now

A few old neighbors swear they are certain
She slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you're goin'
Unless you got something they ain't got
So she sings tonight

She eats caviar
Just before she performs every night

Somebody's gonna come undone; there's nothin' we can do

Some folks can't hold out that long

This night is gonna last forever.  Last all, last all summer long
Some time before the sun comes up the radio is gonna play that song

There's gonna be a heartache tonight, a heartache tonight I know

Nashville Symphony,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

I said, oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me

I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
She was coming around the hill
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye

Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive

Let's go! Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Tribrary of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging The Gap from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music 
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Super kids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo

The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and oh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, ""Mr. Jones please come get your child
Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild""

Greatest man? The great-greatest man alive

Hey, hey, hey, my Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone
He been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home
Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu

On change une famine en grève de la faim
Si le mendiant opère c'est pour faire don de la main
Lève les deux poings, Africain fier
Car les endettés d'hier seront les rentiers de demain
Nos lignes de vie rempliront les livres vides
Et détruiront les prisons de Libreville
En Amazigh ou en Swahili
Tout le monde sait dire ""Soyons libre""

Je veux toucher ce rêve auquel je ne peux croire
J'ai rêvé de ces pays où les hommes ont des droits
Mais l'illusion s'achève, à défaut de pouvoir
Tenir les rennes, que s'unissent nos sœurs et nos frères

Home is all I have
Home is on my mind
Always in my head
Africa must survive

Ces quelques paroles servent de potions
Révèlent la lumière des peuples à la peau sombre
Appelle-moi ""Médine premier du nom""
J'viens du continent qu'on prend pour le grenier du monde
J'alarme les âmes charitables
Que le saint-bernard aboie parfois au pieds du mauvais arbre
Sorti d'un braquage amical
L’Afrique est coiffée du bonnet de Cabral Amilcar
Porte la fierté comme une seconde peau
Comme un leader à lunettes du RDC Congo
J'suis un tatouage tribal dans une main de Fatma
J'réunis les hommes à la manière du Mahatma
Aux cris du Libyen libérable
Bientôt l'esclave limera les barreaux du Libéria
En Lingala ou en langue arabe
Tout le monde lit bien ""liberta""

Je veux toucher ce rêve auquel je ne peux croire
J'ai rêvé de ces pays où les hommes ont des droits
Mais l'illusion s'achève, à défaut de pouvoir
Tenir les rennes, que s'unissent nos sœurs et nos frères

Nassiri,"[Chorus]
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Or save it all for you?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Would I, fill the tank up with gas and be out the front door in a FLASH
Before reconsidering, this Hell with you
It ain't you it's the things you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would of fell with you
To Hell with you

[Nas]
If Heaven was a mile away
And you could ride by the gates
Would you try to run inside when it opens would you try to die today?
Would you pray louder finally believing His power?
Even if you couldn't see, but you could feel would you still doubt him?
How would you start acting?
Would you try to put the ki's down?
Thinking every drug sell that you make in the streets He can see now
Would a fiend even want to get high, would he stop smoking?
If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in
To get away and escape from the craziness
And I bet you there's a Heaven for an atheist
It's hard taking this
Racist planet where they take another brother in a handcuff
Even if he innocent nigga get on the car put your motherfucking hands up
Thinking I'm a lose it
My mom's in chemo
Three times a week, yo keep trying but people
Is hard and God your young soldier's not so bold
But needs you
This world's my home but world I would leave

[Chorus]

[Nas]
Nigga what you think I'ma stop building
I'ma stop feeling like I'm Amistad's great great grandchildren
How I'm not gonna want to make millions
Since the quarter water days in the hallways making fake coke
Pass with the Reeses Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
But then my style has quite a while that same type as Ill and Al Skratch
Game time to them cats never looked back Cristal blowing dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me
You see the broads and Bentleys is nothing less my nigga spend it all with me
I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all I'd buy some new kicks free of any autographs so
Not to be recognized forgive me
It's becoming unbearable 
Making hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on the hook there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise
Preachers touching on altar boys
Sodomizing not realizing God is watching before the Lord
How can they do the devil's work?
A man giving another man head in church
Hell it hurts just to fathom the thought wishing that I fled the Earth.

Dre, he a Compton-Compton O.G.

Do the history

Way before The Firm, like back in the day
Nas was the first New York **** rappin' with Dre
So of course I got a track to bring it back to your face
The one kid that would've been Aftermath that got away

But we still get together like every several years
To sprinkle, a little bit of Heaven for your ears
Relax sippin' Calico in Rio, stupid ****
Low-key, know G's, but it's still Gucci luggage

I love Cape Cod, and watchin' fly **** with gray eyes
Wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by
I like to celebrate, why? 'Cause I can vision
Collages and images of my lies with no regret to hate

So every breath I take, is all about the rules
It's hard for you to breathe like you at high altitude
So crack the Patrón, it's on heathens, The God's back
Hard body, Mr. Jones never leavin'

What you got's a **** of some different ghetto blocks
West Coast kill the tracks, East Coast gun

1995, eleven years from the day
I'm in the record shop with choices to make
'Illmati' on the top shelf, 'The Chronic' on the left homie
Wanna cop both but only got a twenty on me

So **** it, I stole both, spent the twenty on a dub sack
Ripped the package off 'Illmatic' and bumped that
For my **** it was too complex when Nas rhymed
I was the only Compton **** with a 'New York State of Mind'

Inside the dope house bottlin' up sherm, bangin' The Firm
Dre was king then so I waited my turn
Fast forward, now I'm makin' 'em burn
Ended my peers careers, hollered at Nas, a hard lesson was learned

So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga
I stopped beefin' with ****, 'cause I'm 'Ether' to ****
Comb the earth 'til there's no one left
'If I Ruled the World' I summons all you weak rap **** to death

He a Compton-Compton O.G.
Mix that with a QB-QB true G
What you got's a **** of some different ghetto blocks
West Coast kill the tracks, East Coast gunshots

Yo, the Jordans sportin'
Come off the dice game with a fortune walkin', you a walkin' coffin'
The musket I tucked it, you bluff it I bust it
You're sideways talkin', so I lay often

I wait patient, to duct tape hatin'
****, get bucked ****
Pluck ashes of Cuban cigars, you foolin' with Nas
That's my name and I came with Rugers this time

And if I'm sane that 'Soul Plane' movie's the bomb
Word to my mom's name tattooed to my arm
You can't revolve me, embalm me, calm me or harm me
Rob me or dodge these bullets I'm bustin'

See that's malarky you yappin'
I open up the tripod to put the Gatling on, and I start clappin'

To a mill' on the hand, a mill' on the watch, I'm **** with Doc

I ain't mean to be late, it was my night to watch my little girl.
It's chilly out here.
What happened, you crying?
Y'all got into it again, huh?
See you gotta let em know, from the jump, I don't care who they are, or who they with.
Yeah, I know they know we talking.
Why don't they just leave us alone?
I know it's hard for them to understand people like us can love each other.
Come on, stop cryin' now.
Oh, there's something I gotta tell you, I heard they watching you, yeah they watching you.
They watching me too.
But there ain't no reason to get low, I'm proud, I'm here.
You know, I'ma stand up for you, no matter what; and I know you'll stand up for me.
I don't have no doubt about you being true to me.

Embrace the world of reality we're faced to learn 
Coke connection drug bust graveyards where thugs rest 
I keep my mug blessed the evil is illegal substance sold 
Roll mob deep guns in the black Jeep 
Mac 11's and legends cracks in the streets 
Patroller gold money folder gun happy soldiers 
Never sober takin' over my blood is colder 
Niggaz respect violence so I become it 
I'm from it, I even done it blunted so run it

Brain full of schemes, my crew's rollin' fresh out the greens

Try hard and die hard 
Chances of survivin' the game is like tryin' to feed Allah lard 
A walk a piece with a deadly shadow 
They want to blow me with the double barrel, found no sorrow 
I brawl with Blanka, caught Bison in a thinker 
Don't make hell your new home, with the blue chrome 
Mistakes want me, suave fellow but raunchy 
The soul of a cold body haunts me, I flee the country

Too wild for my own self, hopin' help is near 
Street fightin' was cool but in school I brought a new tool 
Toolin with the devil, a rebel, a fool

I visualize Coups, alligators in suits 
Elevators in my mansion that rises to the roof 
Sippin' eighty proof, watchin' Juice, but hold up 
I see some brothers tryin to roll up, wishin' I could fold up 
It's hard to see their faces in they hoodies, I better boogie 
Too late, I tried to swing when they jigged me, I'm out

Fresher than a star, glowing up in the galaxy
Pagan holidays, are way far from my reality
Far through Evisu jeans, lethal green

With no AKs, I'm the ambassador
Robin Hood in the Aston Mart.

To get the best man, yall niggaz ain't silencing shit

Cats stroke her, once I smash it's over

And s'til see presidents, no matter who paid
'Cause you ain't take the last dollar made
Long as they keep printing it, there's chances of getting it

Whether chrome sparking or loan sharking
Busting rachets or numbers rackets or drug traffic
My funds are wrapped up, no concerns who has what
Financer, skull doo wrapped up

Mob life, prizefights, plasma tvs or first floor
Diversified all my circle
Amid the most sickest groom the proof swiftness
Numero uno, annuit coeptis

That's the language of our Latin ancestors
On the back of a dollar, the plan and the message
In the Rolls Royce like the King of Nigeria
My criteria, smoke cigars

Change rap like Jimi Hendrix changed Rock And Roll
With a broke guitar, diamonds flashing
Almost put a million cash in, in my mommy casket

I'll fuck you rap niggas like virgins,
Dre took my training wheels off his curtains.
I don't need no encore, no claps, no cheers,
The Game ain't over, this the beginning of my career,
The ending of yours, the endin' of his,
Like Flavor Flav's clock, I'm back to handle my biz,
Nigga, it's Game Time, that was Dre's favorite line,
Back when proof was in the booth and I recited his lines,
And I still think about my nigga from time to time,
Make me wanna call 50, and let him know what's on my mind,
But I just hold back 'cause we ain't beefin' like that,
He ain't Big, and I ain't Pac, and we just eatin' off rap.

It broke all shackles ever forged

It showed the way through the divisions
Of hatred, damnation and subterfuge

If you can't spell it out

I can't keep it in

It's not a mystery or an undercover belief

I'm just a little bit out of tune

With what the world is singing you

How do you want that way

And I don't ever want anyone when it's all said and done
Saying, ""Why didn't you tell me?""

Why do we get so blinded by our needs
To live our life in perfect harmony

If there's no practice in your preach
Then it's true your talking is cheap
But if you live I want you to say
This whole world will hear you speak, yeah

The cross tells us
That God understands our sins
And I'll suffer
And from the cross
Got the claims 'I love you'

No, no

Visions of the things to be
The pains that are withheld for me
I realize and I can see

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card of some delay
So this is all I have to say

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skin
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works it's way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it burn

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied, ""Oh why ask me?""

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And you can do the same thing if you please

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me

To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2008
Nat Adderley Sextet,"Something in your eyes,
Makes me want to lose myself
Something in your eyes,
Makes me want to lose myself
In your arms.

There's something in your voice,
Makes my heart beat fast
Hope this feeling lasts
The rest of my life.

If you knew, how lonely my life has been
And how long I've felt so low
If you knew how I've wanted someone to come along
And change my life the way you've done.

Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from
Feels like home to me
Feels like home to me
Feels like Im all the way back where I belong.

A window breaks down a long dark street
And a siren wails in the night
But I'm alright cause I have you here with me
And I can almost see the darkest light

If you knew how much
This moment means to me
And how long I've waited for your touch
If you knew how happy you are making me
I never thought I'd love anyone so much

Nat Adderley Sextet,"It's cost me a lot
But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man, it's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
All of this I'll soon forget with my man

He's not much for looks 
He's no hero out of books 
But I love him, yes I love him
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him
 
I don't know why I should
He isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right

I'll go away, when I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more",My Man (Mon Homme),2017

Cha-cha happy, but I'm lazy
I don't dig that frantic turpsichord

When I trip the light fantastic
I don't wanna be gymnastic
That's not what a dancing floor is for

What I got in mind is a big improvement
With a very minimum amount of movement
Let the other couples push and shove
What I got in mind I think you're gonna love

I got a new-fangled tango
And there's nothing to it
You just sort of stand there
And just sort of do it

You stand close together
There's no wasted motion
A new fangled tango
An old fashioned motion

The floor may be crowded
But that doesn't matter
It's not necessary to move
Don't move, why move

It may be crowded
But that's all the better
It's just like romancing, while dancing
Who's dancin'

You start off with one step
And cling to each other
And you know how one step
Can lead to another

Oh, there's nothing wrong with
A waltz or fandango
But oh, what can come from
A new fangled tango

You cling to your partner
And sway to the rhythm
You can't lose your partner
'Cause you're right there with him

You don't have to be worry
About fast or slow steps
The nice part about it
In this dance, you don't need steps

You don't have to worry
If your dancing won't do
It's not what you do do
It's more what you don't do

You don't need a waltz
Or a fancy fandango
You just need a man
And a new fangled tango

Forget the fandango
Give up the mambo
Do the tango",New-Fangled Tango,2002

I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning

For that old feeling, is still in my heart

I can't forget you, I've thought you out, dear.
I know your profile and I know the way you kiss,
just the things I miss on a night like this.
If dreams are made of imagination
I'm not afraid of my own creation.
With all my heart, my heart is here for you to take.
Why should I quake? I'm not awake.

Isn't it romantic?
Music in the night, a dream that can be heard.
Isn't it romantic?

Moving shadows write the oldest magic word.
I hear the breezes playing in the trees above
while all the world is saying you were meant for love.
Isn't it romantic
merely to be young on such a night as this?
Isn't it romantic?
Every note that's sung is like a lover's kiss.
Sweet symbols in the moonlight,
do you mean that I will fall in love per chance?
Isn't it romance?

My face is glowing, I'm energetic.
The art of sewing I found poetic.
My needle punctuates the rhythm of romance.
I don't give a stitch if I don't get rich.
A custom tailor who has no custom
is like a sailor, no one will trust 'em.
But there is magic in the music of my shears.
I shed no tears, lend me your ears.

Isn't it romantic?
Soon I will have found some girl that I adore.
Isn't it romantic?
While I sit around my love can scrub the floor.
She'll kiss me every hour or she'll get the sack
and when I take a shower she can scrub my back.
Isn't it romantic?
On a moonlight night she'll cook me onion soup.
Kiddies are romantic
and if we don't fight we soon will have a troupe.
We'll help the population,
it's a duty that we owe to dear old France.

This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying

A night of love and glory
A night that left my heart romantic stars
We stood so near to heaven
That I reached clear to heaven
And gathered you a handful of stars

Sweet remembered hour
When love began to flower
With moonlight through the trees like silver bars
And as the moon grew older
I reached across your shoulder
And gathered you a handful of stars

I place my fingertips upon your lips
The stars fell in your eyes
The moonglow made a halo of your hair
Suddenly you looked at me
And dreams began to rise
Oh what things unspoken trembled in the air

Our hearts were madly beating
And then our lips were meeting
And Venus seemed to melt right into Mars
Then while we stood caressing
Blue heaven sent a blessing
A shower of a handful of stars

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.

Like the wind that stirs the trees
Wind that sets the leaves to swaying
Like some violins are playing weird and haunting melodies

That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair, she lost her smile, changed her style
Somehow she's not the same

Wouldn't have no other kind but silk
Does it really have a team of snow white horses

Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!

The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over

Feel a sleepy head on my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!

Better face the facts, ol' buddy,
And be prepared to take the blow.
You don't have to sit and study,
It's something anyone should know.
Shake hands... get your hat...
And go.


You can praise her eyes,
And adore her hair.
But if love ain't there,
It ain't there.


And you can walk her home
In the warm spring air,
But if love ain't there,
It ain't there.


And you can look
With a longing in your look,
And try every method in the book
And worship the smile that kind of
Took you unaware.


And you can weep and sigh,
You can say, ""unfair"".
You can almost die of despair.
But if love ain't there,
It ain't there.

Nat King Cole,"What good is a dream,
A plan or a scheme,
The rainbow that you pursue? 
Its everything, and its nothing
Without someone to tell it to.

How eager you are
To get to that star,
But after the journeys through,
You're only a lonely dreamer
Without someone to tell it to.

There'll be blue days,
Hard to get through days,
Days when you'll just want to die.
Soon you're older,
And the worlds colder,
When there's no shoulder to cry on.

Castles in air
Are empty and bare
With no one to share the view.
The moonlight is merely moonlight,
There's no magic in I love you
Without someone
Someone to tell it to.

When I awake I get up with a tingle

Nat King Cole,"What in all of heaven could've prompted her to go, 
After such a triumph as the ball? 
What could've depressed her,
What could've possessed her? 
I cannot understand the wretch at all. 

Women are irrational, that's all there is to that! 
There heads are full of cotton, hay, and rags! 
They're nothing but exasperating, irritating,
Vacillating, calculating, agitating, 
Maddening and infuriating hags! 

Pickering, why can't a woman be more like a man? 

Hm

Yes,
Why can't a woman be more like a man? 
Men are so honest, so thoroughly square,
Eternally noble, historic'ly fair,
Who, when you win, will always give your back a pat. 
Well, why can't a woman be like that? 
Why does ev'ryone do what the others do? 
Can't a woman learn to use her head? 
Why do they do ev'rything their mothers do? 
Why don't they grow up- well, like their father instead? 
Why can't a woman take after a man? 
Men are so pleasant, so easy to please,
Whenever you are with them, you're always at ease. 
Would you be slighted if I didn't speak for hours? 
 
Of course not! 
 
Would you be livid if I had a drink or two? 
 
Nonsense. 
 
Would you be wounded if I never sent you flowers? 
 
Never. 
 
Well, why can't a woman be like you? 
One man in a million may shout a bit. 
Now and then there's one with slight defects; 
One, perhaps, whose truthfulness you doubt a bit. 
But by and large we are a marvelous sex! 
Why can't a woman take after like a man? 
Cause men are so friendly, good natured and kind. 
A better companion you never will find.
If I were hours late for dinner, would you bellow? 
 
Of course not! 
 
If I forgot your silly birthday, would you fuss? 
 
Nonsense. 
 
Would you complain if I took out another fellow?
 
Never. 
 
Well, why can't a woman be like us? 

Mrs. Pearce, you're a woman,
Why can't a woman be more like a man? 
Men are so decent, such regular chaps. 
Ready to help you through any mishaps. 
Ready to buck you up whenever you are glum. 
Why can't a woman be a chum? 
Why is thinking something women never do? 
Why is logic never even tried?
Straight'ning up their hair is all they ever do. 

Why don't they straighten up the mess that's inside? 
Why can't a woman behave like a man? 
If I was a woman who'd been to a ball, 
Been hailed as a princess by one and by all; 
Would I start weeping like a bathtub overflowing? 
And carry on as if my home were in a tree? 
Would I run off and never tell me where I'm going? 
Why can't a woman be like me?",Hymn to Him,1964

Nat King Cole,"Well after all, Pickering, I'm an ordinary man,
Who desires nothing more than an ordinary chance, 
To live exactly as he likes, and do precisely what he wants

An average man am I, of no eccentric whim, 
Who likes to live his life, free of strife, 
Doing whatever he thinks is best, for him, 
Well, just an ordinary man

But, let a woman in your life and your serenity is through, 
She'll redecorate your home, from the cellar to the dome, 
And then go on to the enthralling fun of overhauling you

Let a woman in your life, and you're up against a wall, 
Make a plan and you will find,
That she has something else in mind, 
And so rather than do either you do something else
That neither likes at all You want to talk of Keats and Milton, 
She only wants to talk of love,
You go to see a play or ballet, and spend it searching 
For her glove, Let a woman in your life 
And you invite eternal strife, 
Let them buy their wedding bands for those anxious little hands

I'd be equally as willing for a dentist to be drilling 
Than to ever let a woman in my life, I'm a very gentle man, 
Even tempered and good natured 
Who you never hear complain, 
Who has the milk of human kindness 
By the quart in every vein,
A patient man am I, down to my fingertips, 
The sort who never could, ever would,
Let an insulting remark escape his lips 
Very gentle man

But, Let a woman in your life, 
And patience hasn't got a chance,
She will beg you for advice, your reply will be concise, 
And she will listen very nicely, and then go out 
And do exactly what she wants!

You are a man of grace and polish, 
Who never spoke above a hush, 
All at once you're using language that would make 
A sailor blush, Let a woman in your life, 
And you're plunging in a knife, 
Let the others of my sex, tie the knot around their necks, 
I prefer a new edition of the Spanish Inquisition 
Than to ever let a woman in my life I'm a quiet living man, 
Who prefers to spend the evening in the silence of his room, 
Who likes an atmosphere as restful as 
An undiscovered tomb, 
A pensive man am I, of philosophical joys, 
Who likes to meditate, contemplate, 
Far for humanities mad inhuman noise, 
Quiet living man

But, let a woman in your life, and your sabbatical is through, 
In a line that never ends comes an army of her friends, 
Come to jabber and to chatter 

And to tell her what the matter is with you!, 
She'll have a booming boisterous family, 
Who will descend on you en mass, 
She'll have a large Wagnerian mother, 
With a voice that shatters glass, 
Let a woman in your life, 
Let a woman in your life, 
Let a woman in your life I shall never let a woman in my life.",I'm an Ordinary Man,1964
Nat King Cole,"Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!
I've grown accustomed to her face. 
She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune that
She whistles night and noon.
Her smiles, her frowns,
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.
I was serenely independent and content before we met,
Surely I could always be that way again-
And yet 
I've grown accustomed to her look,
Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face. 

""Marry Freddy."" 
What an infantile idea. 
What a heartless, wicked, brainless thing to do. 
But she'll regret, she'll  regret it. 
It's doomed before they even take the vow!

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill 
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.

Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed. 
In a year, or so, when she's prematurely grey, 
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk. 
She'll come home, and lo, he'll have upped and run away 
With a social-climbing heiress from New York. 

Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!
How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night 
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite.

Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, ever would, 
Take a position and staunchly never budge. 
A most forgiving man. 
But, I shall never take her back, 
If she were even crawling on her knees. 
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

""Marry Freddy""-h a! 

But I'm so used to hear her say 
""Good morning"" ev'ry day. 
Her joys, her woes, 
Her highs, her lows, 
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in. 
I'm very grateful she's a woman 
And so easy to forget,
Rather like a habit 
One can always break,
And yet, 
I've grown accustomed to the trace 
Of something in the air,
Accustomed to her face.",I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face,1964

Se ato dos alas la ambision de mi suburbio
Con este tango nacio el cielo y con un grito
Salio del sordido barrial buscando el cielo
Conjuro extraño de un amor hecho carencia

Que abrio caminos sin mas ley que su esperanza
Mesclas de rabia, de dolor, de fe, de ausencia
Llorando en la inocencia de un ritmo jugueton
Por tu milagro de notas agoreras
Nacieron sin pensarlo las paicas y las grelas

Luna en los charcos, canyengue en las caderas
Y un ansia fiera en la manera de querer

Nat King Cole,"Gone, gone, gone with the draft!
Gone, gone, gone with the draft!
Gone, gone, gone with the draft!

When skinny me went out with my honey,
The boys all started to laugh,
But now it's not so funny,
They're all gone with the draft!

As a sheik I can't be beat,
The boys all hand me a laugh,
But since I have got flat feet,
I'm not gone with the draft!

I used to envy the fellows
Who had such a fine physique,
But all they can say is ""Hello""
On seven fifty a week!

When the boys get back and see how I'm doin',
They'll be sorry they left,
'Cause one can't keep on wooin'
And still be gone with the draft!

When Franklin B did sign the draft,
The cats all had a chill;
The boys turned pale and ceased to laugh,
'Cause this is as serious bill!

They now realize that skinny me
Was the luckiest one of all,
Who can stay at home with Minnie
While they face the cannon ball!

So boys, take it on the chin
And always wear a smile,
You'll find it hard to grin
Carrying fifty pounds for miles!

When your year of drillin's up,
You get to camp discharge,
You can come back home and freshen up,
And run around at large!
