Mr. Porter,"Bank accounts big cars
Living good like a movie star
My mama house ain't in the hood no more
I moved her out to ?
But it's a trip dog 'cause I am a twenty Crip dog
I gotta lay low my homies wanna do low
I got two strikes and I am gonna get my third
These niggers snitching on me they think I am selling birds
So when I am in the streets I am quick on my feet
See talk is cheap so I stay put on my heat
You niggers bad well Dogg is badder
Ratta, tadder, make you niggers sadder
I was once shot your boy want me now
Went to the station that nigger straight point me out
See I am a lay away and spray away and spray away
'Cause at this time I think it's best I just stay away

[Chorus]
They say I am a fool
'Cause I like to do my thing my own way
I gotta couple strikes against me
One more and I am on my way
I ain't got time to hang around the hood like I used to do
I gotta get my break, keep my head and see
That you never get this money instead

Separate elevate concentrate dominate and innovate
Try to be, flies me and every other homie tellin' lie to me
I need a deal I need some stones
I need some beats, dog I need a loan
Help me out throw me some cash
If I got it, you got it, you ain't got to ask
But on the real or is it lately a lot of homies
They try to implicate me
They say I changed is it the fame
If I throw it to you then charge it to the game
Money full, overload, in the hood, another episode
Man I am getting old, the game cold
Yeah I am from the dub, that ain't how I roll

[Chorus]",My Own Way,2011
Mr. Porter,"[Chorus]
I said I ain't gangsta even though I grew up in the hood
I just wanna feed my people, so misunderstood
Strugglin (strugglin), hustlin (hustlin), tryin to make it right
I just wanna spread the light to help us free our minds

Well oh yeah, you are now in tune to www.fuckthemmotherfuckersradio
Where you will only hear racial shit

E plural pursued 'em, all seein eye, ocular exam
The Apocalypse, back by popular demand
Innocuous but still leave a stage with blood in my hand for the populous
Put a fist in the sky
""Licensed to kill"" italicized into my ID or ""Rocky Illuminati""
Haile Selassie Karate, John ""The Beast"" Mugabi
King Jaffe in the lobby with the fur made of a lion
The eye of hoarse mouths, I am vibrant
Prominent constellations of Orion (whoa!)
The reason why my stars are in alignment (uh)
The renegade, Allahu Akbar, rock star
Tossin homemade grenades, CD's at NYPD cop cars
Just to get the revolution to pop off
Fraudulent stock, funded with Louis Vuitton knock-offs
Hijackin helicopters, detonate your metropolis
While I'm in the cockpit, politicin like Stephanopoulos
And my esophagus is quite atomic when I vomit
It's bioengineered urbanonomics
The formula truth divided by innovative ebonics
Times smooth lime, crushed ice and a splash of tonic
Nigga my past lies are astronomic
Smokin hash in a cathedral with Nostradamus
At mass, discussin Martin Luther's ""Free at Last"" speech
Step on my British Walkers get your ass beat

[Chorus]",Haile Selassie Karate,2011

Mr. President,"Waking up this morning 
Your scent is in the air 
I've been trying to grasp it 
That we've gone our separate ways 
I'm standing at the window 
Searching for mistakes 
Why you have left me? 
Things will happen 
But I can't confess 
To describe my conditions 
To recognize my mess 
I promise you to change it 
My morbid jealousy 
Give me one more chance 

I want to be close to you, baby 
I want to be near to you tonight 
I want to be next to you, baby 
I want to be close to you tonight 

If I have one more chance 
To prove my love to you 
I will do it right this time 
Together we'll make it through 
Don't do the silly things 
Don't make the same mistakes 
That I made years ago 

You said that you need me but you used to use me 
So now your time is up you're cryin' how you miss me 
I remember the time when you used to be my cutey 
Every single head turn 'cause girl you were my beauty 
I would do everything to keep my baby from harm 
I would cuddle up at night and keep little toes warm 
You said my love was too strong and get it on",Close to You,1996
Mr. President,"I'm not a woman

In my mind, you're the kind 
That can help me out of trouble 
Sure enough, there's my love 
Easy you can make it double and you know 

If you would ask what I feel for you 
I'd say thaht my love for you is true 
Come rain, come shine, whatever you do 
The feelings I have they're oh so new 
There were times where I didn't even knew 
What to do 

Don't you ever stop 
I know, I know you'll never

Now where do I belong?
And now I ask myself
If all I did was wrong
What good is love when it can break a lonely heart?
And tearing my life apart

I still got the ring
I gave you last year
I won't get caught like that
I swear the tears you shed
You didn't care
I need somebody that will always be there
All I feel and what's inside
The love I had I could not hide
That how it is so
Now I'll come clean
Don't want to say it twice
You know what I mean

[Chorus]

Got bitten once before
Won't happen again so don't come crying
Saying you need a friend
Why did you leave me hanging in the den?
Wanted to write but I couldn't find a pen
You didn't even want me
You didn't even care
There is nothing more in common
And nothing more to share
That's it is
So now I'll come clean, it's time to say goodbye
So, don't cause a scene

Mr. Probz,"I felt like I was going crazy
Thought I was losing my mind, I did
I even convinced myself it was all in my mind, all of this time
I think it's high time
That some truth comes of this lie I've lived
We've lived or we live together
At least we did when we were together
All of the things that we did together
Tainted, jaded
The first sign of temptation, you gave in
First heard when you tripped up, stumbled over
And did something that I'd never even contemplated
Stick your story, save it
Whether it was a mistake, or were you sober
Or were you wasted?
Did you show him all of your little faces?

If everyone knows
Why ain't nobody telling me, telling me?

Found out all your little secrets
Uncovered all your little lies
The amount of times you'd had me believe it
You were pulling the wool over my eyes (my eyes)
I found out all your little secrets (my eyes)
Uncovered all your little lies
And now I'm starting to put all the pieces
Together in my mind, together in my mind

Did I ask too much of you?
Did I expect too much?
Could I have given you a little extra?
Would it have made you a little less of a strut?
And you walk wherever you walk
Dress barely holding on for the ride
Guess I knew we'd always end premature
I can't say it didn't come as a surprise
So tell me, was it good, was it?
Was it worth it? Did you work it?
Would you be as kind as to
Tell me what it was I did to you to deserve it?
'Cause nah, I ain't perfect
But I ain't ever shown nobody where you sleep
Are you gonna have somebody in my bed?
Guess I better get new sheets

Why ain't nobody telling me, telling me?

Uncovered all your little lies

Well look at me now I did amount to something

No matter were us niggaz rock we watch out for popo
Still up in the struggle I see nothing changes

Sport the jewelry cars and the shelto

Up on the road trips and hot shit we scatting
From the slums stepping representing the jump off (jump off)

Grinding pies writing rhyme 9 to 5
Pimping chicks doing sticks just getting rich takes muscle
Saga of a every day struggle
Bottom line dolla signs we ain't got a dime we gotta hustle
Clip feeling strip stealing sick villain
Let of a lot of wip pealing gangsta type scuffle
Payback could mean is time to layback and bubble
But other times payback is trouble
Just call me a hustle

And a nickel spot with a single shot ready to burn

I was thinking that this young coward nigga had a slime

Watch you niggaz like a job if I got to
Fuck scrapping you gonna feel when I spot you

Did the thing hustle in boulevard dimes

Get down for my crown, partner, what you say? 

Big Mike and Mystikal, in December just like May 



{Mystikal:} 

Shit, I was born and raised in New Orleans 

I grew up on second lining and gumbo, red beans 

Canal Street, river-boardin 

Everybody ???, now I be talkin 

Pointin gats like they do in the movies 

Every night nigga made the news 

Wearin a polo shirt and Bally shoes 

'Stik can remember when them niggas went for hard 

They would climb up they bars and so-called represent they Ward 

When you get to the club it's gon' be some shit-startin 

And some shoulder-bumpin, steppin on toes, bitch, I beg your pardon 

If you're a buster, then you're bust-up 

If you're a sucker, you're gettin sucked up, tough luck 

Stand up like a man and hold your own is the only motto 

Cause all that gettin-fucked-all-over-shit played out with lotto 

Fuckin erase and ease off the throttle 

Before I bust you in your shit with this King Cobra bottle 

Make the bitch respect Michael Tyler 

Lord know a nigga don't want to, but all you muthafuckas gotta 

Not wantin the Gucci's, tellin time through Movado 

I don't sell no powder, but I'm stackin g's in my closet 

Uptown niggas livin foul and 

Westbank niggas gettin clicked out, Downtown niggas gettin violent 

I'd probably be dead or locked down if it wasn't for rappin 

Cause where I'm from niggas ain't havin fun unless they scrappin 

Goin to war brawlin 

Bitch, don't get mad with me, that's how it is in New Orleans

Mr. Quikk,"[Tela] 
It was this bitch that I knew back from '86 
Graduated and made it from the college of dicks 
Now who the fuck you be, bitch you know me 
Tryin' to act solo, down low, hush-hush, and lo-key 
 
Nah hoe I ain't po', where did my motherfuckers go 
I remember this hoe, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well 
How the hell you been since I had no job 
Hum, why don't you give me some 
 
'Cause you know I flow and run for Suave 
Nah, all of that was on the couch 
No doubt why y'all records spin, why y'all shippin' in gold 
It's cold On The Outside lookin' in (brrrr!) 
 
You'd best a make yourself worthy 
Cause I got a click of niggas ready to get their johnson very dirty 
You heard me push these thirty dicks, inside your pearly clit 
Ain't this a bitch 

I remember when you would not give me shit 
Now you down for them habits 
Put your numbers on them naturals 
Make it snappy cause I got to go to the bathroom 
 
[Chorus] 
Hoes with no clothes sure enough
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what? 
Hoes with no clothes sure enough 
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what? 
Hoes with no clothe sure enough 
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what? 
Hoes with no clothes sure enough 
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?, Suave love 
 
[Eightball] 
No different from the rest 
She's just an ordinary hoe 
Hair extensions, long nails, ass thicker than gumbo 
Make it fast, takin' cash, shakin' ass in the mix 
 
Tens turn to twenties and twenties come from plenty tricks 
Niggas in love 
Can't stay out the club 
All in the hoe's face 
But at the end of the paper chase, whatever you had will be erased 
 
I see him in the back 
Countin' up that cheddar 
Talkin' loud, smokin' hay, makin' clouds, gettin' ready for the crowd 
I think I know one 
 
I remember you, oh yes I do 
Tryin' to hide side from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo 
What time the club close, at 3 
What's up, you comin' with me 

We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees 
You want some cheese 
Hoes don't stay at the suave house 
Hoes around my nuts like knots 
 
Real dogs don't pay for cats, that's 
For real baby 
Recognize and sho me love, dig that shit, sure enough

Well I be God damned, this shy ass hoe 
Wants to get close to me 
A few years back in the past, you wouldn't of even noticed me 
Quoting the, lyrics of the songs that you know I flow 
 
Lookin' for, confidants, and tickets to my next show 
Check yo' bitch 
In these short ass pants and blow up dresses 
I can tell they freaky with out three guesses 
 
Oh yes it's very true 
Your bitches be needin' me, leavin' you 
Hell, now what the fuck is a nigga like me supposed to do 
Let her loose or let her remain 

'Cause all she be lookin' for is some fame 
A bigger name 
Look, this thang with bigger game 
And she claim she ain't heard my music 
 
Tryin' to trick me 
So I told that hoe my name Bill Bigsley 
She still hit me 
Now she, killin' my dick softly with her mouth and I 
 
Really just don't plan on takin' it out cause I

""No, faccio l'escort""

Potrei fare come, chi ha fatto un disco insieme a (shh...)

Dovrei parlare di strada come fanno gli artisti
Potrei fingermi morto per vendere i dischi

Ci sarà sempre qualcuno più bravo di te pronto a darti consigli

Nella mia testa c'è una scimmia che parla
Lei tira fuori solo il peggio di me
Ma certe volte io non riesco a fermarla
Vorrebbe dire ciò che pensa di te
Quando mi guardi, quando mi scrivi
Mi sento come Dottor Jekyll e Mr Hyde
Quando mi parli, dovrei contare fino a uno, due, tre

Odio i reality show
Odio il gossip e le interviste
Quando mi chiedi un selfie e nemmeno mi batti il cinque
Quelle che fanno le anticonformiste
E poco dopo scopri il loro nome come prima tendenza su tinder
Puttana!
Il tuo artista preferito ha raccolto le saponette per un briciolo di fama
Odio chi ti ama per il cash ma dice di no
Ma poi quando finisce ""bye bye adios""
Lasciami stare dai smettila di parlare
Che vengo al tuo funerale con gli occhi da psicopatico
Dovrei restare calmo si, ma a volte esagero

Mr. Rain,"Oggi non so chi sono, ieri nemmeno
Tra tutte le persone solo tu mi conosci davvero
Quant'è difficile riuscire a camminare senza farsi male quando sulle spalle un mondo intero
Voglio ventiquattro ore, ma tu non chiedermi il perché
Ventuno delle quali, sai, ti porterei con me
Un'ora con gli amici
Un'ora con i miei cari
Un'ora per pensare alle ventuno prima insieme a te
Dimmi che noi lo faremo insieme
Vorrei portarti lontano da qua dove nessuno ci potrà vedere
Dentro sto dimmerda e fingo che andrà tutto bene
Ma è difficile farlo sapendo che poi non succede
Ahh, così non va
Lasciami un centimetro di cuore e fallo per l'eternità
Così quando vorrai cercarmi saprai dove trovarmi, tu parlami come se fossi ancora qua

Tu insegnami a sognare, non so più come si fa
Vorrei vivere ogni ora come fosse l'ultima
Ma so che c'è un posto per me, ma nulla ha senso se poi non ci sei te
Vieni via con me

Siamo nati per dimenticare
È come mettersi le mani sopra gli occhi e fingere di non guardare
Sarebbe come strapparmi il cuore dal petto, chiuderlo dentro un cassetto e buttare via la chiave
Sorridimi come sai fare tu, non c'è nessuno
Le cose più belle arrivano nel momento meno opportuno
Tu tienimi per mano mentre parlo, tutti sanno che ti amo e di certo continuerò a farlo
Ricordati di me e di tutto ciò che è stato
Ma sai non c'è futuro per chi vive nel passato
Io sarò sempre qua, io sarò sempre qua
Sarò sempre al tuo fianco, nessuno ci dividerà
Nella vita perdi sempre tutto ciò che vuoi
Tornare indietro nel tempo non puoi
Ma so che c'è un posto per noi

Vorrei vivere ogni ora come fosse l'ultima

Mr. Rain,"Un cuoricino così piccolo
Metà bambino, metà uomo
Ho imparato pure a crescere da solo
Mento se vi dico che sto bene dentro
Mi sono perso e se ci penso ancora adesso mi emoziona
Avevo fretta di crescere e diventare grande
Avevo mille sogni in testa e la testa da un altra parte
Ho imparato ad allacciarmi le scarpe
Molto prima di imparare a camminare e fidarmi delle mie gambe
E no
Non perdo tempo
Lo sa il mio cuore spento
Vorrei azzerare i ricordi come Memento
E tu non c'eri
Quando lo zaino colmo di libri che avevo sulle mie spalle pesava meno dei miei problemi
Guardami negli occhi e poi dimmi che cosa vedi
Di certo non sono il tipo perfetto che tu volevi
E se mi guardo allo specchio, più passa il tempo e più assomiglio a te
C'è un mostro che vive dentro di me

Scattami una foto per fermare il tempo
Per rendere ogni singolo momento lungo un eternità
È un vuoto che mi mangia dentro, ma
È solo grazie a me-eh-eh-eh
Se ora sono ciò che sono è solo grazie a me-eh-eh-eh-eh
È solo grazie a me-eh-eh-eh
Se ora sono ciò che sono è solo grazie a me-eh-eh-eh-eh

Questo è il film della mia vita, la ruota gira
Ho un cinema nella mia testa, ti ho lasciato un posto in prima fila
Ma è troppo tardi
La vita troppo breve per sprecarla ad inseguire soltanto i sogni degli altri
E no
Le cicatrici fanno male
Ma col tempo ho imparato a conoscerle prima di farmele passare
Ma a forza di farle passare
Ho perso il conto di tutte le cicatrici che non voglio ricordare
Dovrei spegnere il cervello e non pensare ma
Questo è proprio tutto quello che ho
Potrei staccare la spina e non guardare ma
Questo è proprio tutto quello che ho, oh
Fammi chiudere gli occhi un secondo
Metti a fuoco lo schermo pieno di immagini e lasciami sullo sfondo
E nonostante tutto questo siamo ancora tutti qua, già
Questa è la piccola cosa più bella al mondo


Scattami una foto per fermare il tempo
Scattami una foto per fermare il tempo

Scattami una foto per fermare il tempo

Mr. Rain,"I grandi non piangono mai
Devi essere più forte quante volte me l’hai detto
Il numero di lacrime che io ricevo non è mai proporzionale al numero di lacrime che verso
C’eri quando ero giù
Prometto non lo farò più
Ho fatto un mucchio di stronzate, per fortuna c’eri tu
Tra i miei problemi con la droga crescere tre figli piccoli
Senza chiedere aiuto e farlo da sola
Ma', tu mi hai insegnato cos’è il rispetto
Ho incontrato mille bastardi ma quello non l’ho mai perso
Tu sei stata la prima a dirmi di farlo
La prima a credere in me
E prima ancora di me stesso
Dimmi che devo fare, mi hai detto ""ce la puoi fare""
Una stella che vive di luce propria continua a brillare
Io non dimentico il passato
Come farei a negare il cuore alla persona che me l’ha dato

Imparerei a crescere
Dormirai con la paura del buio
Saremo io e te
Tutto andrà bene se starai con me
Non importa in che parte del mondo sarai
Io ci sarò sempre lo sai
Nessuno meriterà le tue lacrime
I grandi no, non piangono mai

Pensi davvero che io no, non ti riconosca
Per tutti i ruoli che hai interpretato meriti un Oscar
Ed io che mi chiedevo quante maschere avessi
Eri tu la mia miglior nemica, la mia peggior rivale
Eri la mia insegnante, Babbo Natale, il portiere che ti apre se dimentichi la chiave
La stessa che mi ha insegnato a sbagliare, ha interpretato tutti i ruoli del mondo
Prima di essere una madre
Le ore diventano i giorni, i giorni diventano anni
E già sei grande
Non puoi comprare il tempo nessuno lo riavrà
Scrivo canzoni da quando non ho più memoria
Ho capito che preservare i miei ricordi è la mia priorità
Ora che giro per il mondo analizzo il mio sogno
Ricordatevi che anch’io sotto ai tatuaggi ho un cuore
A mio figlio dirò che i grandi non piangono mai
Ma almeno se non dopo questa canzone

Imparerei a crescere
Dormirai con la paura del buio
Saremo io e te

Oggi non vinci tu e sembra una partita a carte
Facciamo presto, salto sul primo treno per Marte
Se chiudo gli occhi, la vedo, la vita che volevo
Funziona solo nei sogni, mi spiace di doverti svegliare

Mi spiace ma un domani non ci sarà

Che se ne va, che non torna più

Non so dire di no, terrò il telefono spento

Prendi il tuo tempo, io non ti odio
Sono felice se sei contento
Se trovi un'altra io non mi offendo
Facciamo che vinci tu e mettiamo i rancori da parte
Ho provato ogni strada
Consumato cuori, consumato scarpe
Se apro gli occhi, la vedo, la vita che volevo
Ti vedo solo nei sogni, che bello potersi svegliare

Dimenticarsi fa male
C'è una parte di me che ti vuole, l'altra ogni giorno ti lascia andare
Siamo tutto ciò che gli altri non vedono
Eravamo ciò che gli altri volevano
Ora il tuo nome non conta più niente, come una lacrima in mezzo all'oceano
Domani non ci sarò più, conviverai con le tue paure

Homie, you would leave me by my lonely

I'm evil and it's pussy that I'm pursuing

My tolerance for physical pain has gained rapidly
I'm gobbling more thizzles then thangs but it came back at me

How to end it all (Yeah), many men will fall (Yeah)
Any sin I saw (Yeah), Nina been involved (Yeah)
You don't really want it with me punk you don't have the gall

Real love is scary
You try to hide when it looks for you
You never know what it will do
Not real love
Not real love
Real love is a long stone bed, he said
His face a mask of indifference
And it don't care about me or you
Not real love
Not real love
Real love on a sunny day
Is a crow on a telephone pole
With something to say
And you feel like someone
Has just walked on your grave
That's real love
That's real love
The glory of love
The glory of love
That precious rain
That falls from above
First a gentle murmur
That calls from the heart
And then a great wind
That will blow you apart
That's real love
That's real love
Like a ghost it will pass right through you
A spirit that lives on
When you are through
And there is nothing that you can do
The wind in the trees
The smell of wet leaves
The rumble of a passing truck
A streak of blood
Please forgive me for what I've done to you
And lord forgive me for what I'm going to do
In the name of...
Real love is scary
You try to hide when it looks for you
You never know what it will do
And it don't care about me or you
And there is nothing you can do about
Real love
Anyway, that's what I heard a crow say
But who cares what a crow say anyway?
Especially about something, something
Something so strictly personal
(Real love)
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? That wind on your face
You can get down on your knees and pray
But nothing that you do or say
Will make it go away
(Real love)
It's like thunder, like lightning
The way you love me
The way you love me
The way you love me
It's frightening
",Real Love,1994
Mr. Right,"I recall at the end of it all 
You were on your knees and I was standing tall 
But is my memory deceiving me? 
Was I hanging there while you prayed for me? 
Remember how when the show was done, 
We were dancing and singing and having some fun, 
Then I heard you speak, your voice was bleak--- 
""What we forget we must repeat."" 

Are-E-M-E-M-be	-E-are, are-E-M-E-M-be	-E-are 
I remember the tricks of the trade, 
Who got left behind and who made the grade, 
And I don't need the pages of some master plan 
To tell me what to do or tell me who I am 
But when all is said and all is done, 
Under the yellow glow of a setting sun, 
It really doesn't matter what you have done, 
You are blind and deaf and dumb 

Are-E-M-E-M-be	-E-are, are-E-M-E-M-be	-E-are 
I remember an endless space 
And the tolling bells of some holy place 
Is it a dream that comes back to me 
Or a memory that I can barely see? 
Not the voices that haunt my mind 
Of the friends and lovers I have left behind. 

What I see, what comes back to me, 
Is a place I cannot find.

She went away 
Gone and left me 
She's gone to stay 
She's gone, but I don't worry 
Because I'm sitting on top of the world 

I'm going down to the hardware 
Gonna buy me a hacksaw 
Gonna free my heard 
Cut that pain away 
She's gone, but I don't worry 
Because I'm sitting on top of the world 

I'm going down to the graveyard 
Gonna buy me a tombstone 
Gonna leave this town

Never ever trust a fake and that's on the real ese
Enemies are gonna die for talkin shit ese
Baggy pants creased up
And I kick it with my thugs
If you ain't one of us
Then to you there is no love

With a homicide like that
Ready to take you off the map

While mumblin the same thing
And wonderin if I gang bang
Well homie press your luck
And their gonna see the bullets rang

But he can not duplicate
So we had to hate
And now we debated

Not nessecry to involve my family

Smoking and choking the indo smoke
Roll it up, light it up
Pass to the next, now hit em up
Get loc'ed out, smoked out, choked out

I'm chilling in the studio gaining hoes like Rogain
Getting hoes like whoa, until in the morning
Crack of dawn
And I've wipe the shit out of my eyes
Then I'll do it again like cup of gin
There I go out to sin
Never will I hit the pig
So fucked up off this cup of gin
And then I'll rap my shit again
A motherfucking once again

Bald head lunatics all ready for some gangsta shit
What up, blaze that shit up
And pass it this way, so we can parly
And gangsta bounce motherfuckers out their socks
Chipping em off what they hitting for, make the whole planet rock
Yeah strickly for the players and thugs
Who been flossing them dubs, skating on chrome rolling up blunts
High sign me between the bitches on the streets
Acting a fool, bang in the corner where the homey creeps
Southside for life baby
The chronic smoke and Southern dues got me acting crazy
California life style, just living it up
Surrounded by them bitches who be giving it up
Now let's toast for the coast that we all love the most
And go for broke and get a shit load of chronic smoke

Haters do not like it, got a big dick for you to suck, now what
Cruising through the enemy territory
Not given a fuck packing big nuts 'cause it's manditory, end of story
That's how it is on these Cali streets
Not packing a heat you're gonna get beat, another casualty
'cause I'm creeping, deceiving, no position is tweeking
Gonna get this bullet's weaking while he's leaking
Now from my milli he's sleeping
Sleeping like the pussy that I was beating last night
Seeking like a private down with no clue inside
My victim, I seek em and whip em with my pistola
Smoking lots of mota, I'm the one que controla

You were just a friend of me
Love they way you brought out the best of me
We drove another, talked about it, we were meant to be
Baby do you feel the same just don't feel ashamed
I know, I found the cold and lonely you'll erase my pain
I understand you already got a man
Gotta tell you how I feel in case my life comes to an end
But I'm still here for you, real for you
I think that I would pack the steel for you, kill for you
Your all I need, so if you really want to try
Follow your feelings they don't lie
Now dry your eyes and please don't cry
Our friendship won't be jeopardized
Would you do the same for me
Take the blame for me
Baby girl you know that I will never change for me
You know I tell you what I'm made of, tell you straight up
What my feelings for you are really made of

Me and you, we were meant to be
Together, Together for all eternity
Me and you, we were meant to be
Together Together for all eternity

So baby tell me what you think
Yeah, I know, that you need some time to think
And did I catch you by surprise
I think I need to tell you how I feel inside
But baby just remember this
We gave each other our very first kiss
We learned about ""the birds and the bees"" together
Made a promise to be friends forever
And I don't want all that to change
And that you know how just I feel
I just don't want things to get strange
Cause I am here for you, real for ya
You know that I'll still shed a tear for ya, real for ya
Your all I need, so if you really want to try
Follow your feelings they don't lie

I lost you a couple of years ago
And I never got a chance to tell you how I feel
So I made this song for you

Push, push, push, push... 

Here it comes... 

It's - it's a girl 



{Big Mike:} 

1971 a young girl gave birth 

Only a child, bringin another child on this earth 

Only 15 years of age 

But comin from the ghetto, it won't make the front page 

See, that's the way shit go 

And to the government she ain't nothin but another hoe 

Thinkin all she want is food stamps 

Give her a check and let her hang with the school tramps 

And mama's gettin mad 

Cause now she gotta watch her little girl grow up fast 

Straight ghetto life, straight ghetto drama 

Wanted a baby doll, now she's somebody's mama 

And life is so confusin to her 

Askin herself why is this happenin to her 

So now she gotta choose 

Between a box of Pampers and a pair of new tennis shoes 

Never had to make that choice before 

Never heard a baby's voice before 

And the daddy ain't nowhere to be found 

Too busy bein a hoe around town 

He just fall into another statistic 

Claimin black men don't do shit 

But that's the way it is 

And little do they know daddy also sheds tears 

Cause he don't know what to do 

Be a father to his child, or run with a crew 

You might say: easy choice, be a father 

But why should he do it when his father didn't bother? 

Just another sample, I guess 

Of black men settin bad examples 

Thinkin deep about the whole thing 

Takes his last bit of money and goes to buy a gold ring 

And askes her to marry her 

Promise to get a job, so he can carry her 

Thinkin that's the way to do it 

But little do they know that there's much more to it 

'cause marriage is demandin 

It takes lots of patience and understandin 

But they go and tie the knot anyway 

And they'll be gettin their own crib anyday 

The first couple of months were alright 

A new crib, adaptin to a new life 

But then came the arguments 

And the constant fightin got em thrown out their apartment 

So now they gotta move in with her moms 

And that just adds to the muthafuckin problems 

Cause now he's feelin like he failed 

And while they asleep he grabs his shit and bails 

Smooth out the do', black 

And never takes another look back 

Now grandma's house is an unhappy home 

Now that daddy's gone 



{Scarface:} 

Daddy broke before I stepped in this muthafucka 

And left the job to be done by my mother's mother 

Raised up by grandmother ??? 

Cause my mark-ass daddy never came around for guidance 

So now I'm forced to stand up on my own two 

Cause mommy dear had to work three jobs, duke 

He didn't even want my friendship 

I guess the mark-ass nigga wasn't down to begin with 

Too lit to come around with his drunk ass 

And beatin up my mom with his punk ass 

And shit got dread 

I guess I shouldn't talk so bad about my dad 

So here it is, brothers 

If you gon' have babies, you need to father them muthafuckas 

Cause if you don't in due time 

Your kids'll speak about daddy exactly like I do mine 

So do yourself a favor 

Take your kids to the park, buy em shit, and they'll pay you later 

But payin's not the issue 

If you'd die right now your little kids wouldn't even miss you 

So put away your caddy 

Call your bitch up and tell her to make room for daddy 

Cause if you don't you'll be alone 

And the only thing they'll say about daddy, is daddy is gone",Daddy's Gone,1994
Mr. Scarface,"Geah...wutup niggas 
The compton cyco is back 
In your shit for the nine deuce 
And check this out 
My nigga Scarface is in the motherfuckin house 
And we bout to drop some gangsta shit 

I guess its true what they say  
When your too far gone ain't no turning back. 
And coming from the Compton mack that's a fuckin fact. 
Livin' in the city where bitches won't 
Give up the pussy for free so a nigga don't. 
So here's my story. Another story about a nigga 
Who lives his life by the fuckin trigga. 
Gotta get my serve on, nigga you don't hear me though 
Throw up the hood, might blast on 5-0. 
First I hit the Ides and get pumped up. 
Now I'm rollin in the car kinda slumped up. 
I pop the glove box, Then I reach the block, 
Then I plug your ass in the chest with the glock. 
And that's how the shits get done, 
I guess I'm a mutherfuckin nigga on the run. 
But I won't let them take me alive, so I don't sleep 
'Cause, geah, I'm in too deep. 

In too deep, ain't no turnin back. 
Cock up your mutherfuckin gauge.

Mista-Mista Scarface for the nine-deuce, 
Niggas pack a nine, fuck you bitch I pack a nine too. 
Millimeter Ruger for you hoes who try to flex nuts, 
You point your shit, I pull my shit, come nigga now lets check nuts. 
Born a hustla, raised a hustla, never gonna stop trick. 
Buck a hustla, mutherfucker boy, you better die bitch. 
Found myself a busta, had the boy front me an Oz. 
Fucked him out his money, worked my way up to a whole key. 
Now he's got some niggas trying to ball 'Face 
Time to go to work, need some back' better call Eiht. 
Call my nigga up, Kicked the fundementals. 
2 way ticket 3 o'clock, continental. 
Eiht rolled in with the mutherfuckin task force, 
Bucked them hoes off, dropped him off at the airport 
Niggas don't ever fuck with me 'cause I'm a nigga who plays the game for 
Keeps, 
Drop you on your ass with the quickness, 'cause I'm in too deep. 

Geeah, the criminals is in the mutherfuckin house.. 

Now they got us on the run, but we tired of runnin 
Got the glocks all cocked, let the fools keep coming. 
Scarface got the mutherfuckin pump under the seat. 
So niggas better duck or your ass is fucked. geah. 
The mad man with nuthin to lose. 
So you better bring your strap or catch the blues. 
And um, or get served like a damn clucker, 
Sucker, or in the end be a short mutherfucker. 
Now them one times is all on my back and 
Heard that Scarface and Eiht peeled the cap and 
They want to gaffle us up. But its a shame. 
Can't fade the best from Compton and the mid-west. 
So watch your back when the niggas step. 
'Cause the scene that is left is your whole families death. 
And fool don't sleep, 
'Cause sorry mutherfucker, we in too deep. 

Geah. In your shit for the nine-deuce.

I expect you'd like to know about frogmen? 
Yeah! 
They live on fish and catch them by diving onto them from a great height.

He can breathe under water because he has amphibious nostrils. 
On the way down he passed hundreds of trout of different sizes. 
Trout are freshwater fish and have under water weapons. 
Trout are very valuable and immensely powerful. 
Keep away from the trout. 

Why should it mean that the fish in the sea are all unable to sing? 

Just listen to me young fellow. 
What need is there for fish to sing, when I can roar and bellow?

And the head of the

Rose above the surface of the water.

It looked dreadful.
It was covered in mud and green weed.
You call that a whale?
Ahh! What sorta fish are you?!
I'm not a real fish at all you stupid man.
What are you if you're not a fish?
You certainly look like a fish..

Swim for it!

I've been shipwrecked

March through the manor while the owner takes communion

Got the soldiers on the hop
Slept in the oak tree
Raided a crop

I caught the King's deer
They were giving me fame
And they heard about my antics
Up at the castle
When I didn't pay my taxes
Down came the hassle
They burnt my village and my family at the stake
I felt the whole ground shake
Why?

They want my pagan head
Turn the hunters in my band and that's as good as it gets

From your nails to your follicles

Burn the city hall - smoke out the residents
Make a mark in my town and adjust my standard of living
Till my pitchfork rusts

Rock Steady was a B-boy crew, but to me it's all about hip hop,
So, rock steady is a hip hop crew now.  Its about all four elements, And we 
represent those lovely, sratch pickers, arsonists,
All the b-boys that are down with us, the b-girls, we have some dope 
B-girls, and you know, we got graf artists like East and Zero T,
Its just straight up on skills, this is Crazy Legs from the Rock Steady 
Crew, I'm out

Hip-Hop was breaking, spray paintin' full train cars
DJ's cutting emcess presents the ghetto stars
I was the skinny shorty wop, with the bop in my step
Shams the bear and teloids, playboys and I was set
Running through the streets of the boogie with a bang
Pops was kinda strict, so at times I couldn't hang
But whateva the case, I stuck close to my hip-hop
Somethin' in my soul just kept that, on lock

And oppurtunity never knocked, but we was still open
Saying ish like fresh, like def (dope in)
And crack was on the corner rumblin' the dry goods
With something I decided never to persue in my hood
I was, too busy in the middle of the streets playing skelly
With Ray and Big Lou, listenin' to Flash and Melly
And rockin' block parties, seemed to be my route
But I had to give that up, they always ended in shoot outs

Hip-Hop was rhyming, hard timin', radio hits
No dats, so the D.J's was still in the mix
Grafitti and breaking took a back seat
Cuz the A&R's couldn't figure how to make they ends meet
I was the high school rapper to the girls in the hall
While my nigga Clarence Greer was slammin' with a basketball
Tune my radio on a saturday night
Daydreamin' 'bout grippin' mikes and being in the spotlight
Fat rope chains in a pair of A.J's in the p.j's frontin' like I had status
(what) who's the baddest?
The brotha on swinten ave, though fresh out the lab
You just couldn't tell Q-Unique what he couldn't have

It all started in Bushwick, defacin' the community
Around the way, all you saw was nothin' but graffiti
As a shorty I was poppin' never could I ever stand still
Always battlin' cuz it was all about the skills
Never learned windmills, but my boogie took me places
When I started emceeing, I kept it fat like my laces
Wrestlin' was the bomb, kept me from doing my homework
Radio was my thing, when red alert went bezerk

Yes yes y'all, let me get some

When I was a little boy you were the only one I wanted to be
To be like pa duke and ma duke
How much I love the both of you
I know all the strain we been through
But it's of no consequence cause we're comin through

[ VERSE 1: Mos Def ]
Check it
I first studied my kung fu in the Brakalak
In the center of ( ? )
This had to be about ten years back
Before I ever even heard of a 24 track
Talkin about you was an MC was not the move
Cause if you said you had skill, well then you had to show and prove
And if there ever was a party, son yo, I would set it
And tell the DJ run the beat from (Ultra-magnetic)
I grab the mic and then I leave the party buzzin
Tellin all the honeys I was Slick Rick's cousin
When they knew I wasn't, but I had no shame
Pa, you know the name, the Mos always had game
Back in the day of the Rap Attack
When brothers knew how to act, before glocks and crack
And Vandy see was doin radio shows
And 'crossover' meant that you wore your mom's clothes
When Sweet G was talkin about the games that people play
I used to sit back and say: yeah indeed, someday
And as I grew older my kung fu grew better
Instead of shootin the humbles I was shootin ( ? )
And now my time has come
And now hip-hop's an industry polluted by bums
Posin with guns, they're puffin mad blunts
Aiyo, brothers just started rhymin last month
They gettin fat deals on any major label
When they only seen other people hold the mic cable
Five years ago when we was dancin house
When the DJ played hip-hop, then you walked out
But now you're hard, talkin about you paid mad dues
I used to see your ass abused wearin platform shoes
I ain't confused, who you think you're foolin with that get-up?
You ain't genuine, so don't waste your time
Riffin over here cause there ain't no chance 
That you could break the sound, son, you ain't that advanced
Times are gettin critical across the land
Don't provide the be	-boy, introduce the be	-man - understand?
The M-o-s D is who I am, now check it out, y'all

My kung fu is the style you haven't mastered

[ VERSE 2: DCQ ]
At the age of 18 made a little money
And I needed some advice on how to live my life
Was goin through strife, people couldn't understand
That I was comin into my own, becomin a man
I had to have a plan cause I know what I'm here for
So I can't waste time, y'all
Gotta be on the ball and represent for my peeps
(Where?) In the streets!
I make beats and kick facts over fat tracks
It's all of that from the Brakalak
Goin through problems as a adolescent
A lot of troubles and turmoils, there was persistence
And I know that I stutter
But it don't matter cause I'm a bad -
I flip a verse either backwards, sideways
I rocks my [edited] from here, Mondays, Fridays
Saturdays and I get a weekend off
My [edited] ain't soft
(Well, excuse me, baby)
You paid your dues cause I'm the boss
So mother[edited] Bruce Springsteen and Diana Ross
Because they know what the time is
I rock [edited] for the fly kids, be	-men, bouncin bass bombastics
Kick it drastic, you get tossed like an ash, kid
Youknowmsayin?

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Ces ]
Well, I'm sleek and I freak a beat
For you and your peeps to bump inside your jeeps
Your Acura, Honda or whatever
Bump it in the Benzi and get your head together
Strollin down the F.D.R.
Playin the microphone star
Deep in your car
With the thump-diddy-thump-da-thump-da-thump-thump
Pop up the trunk and let the bass bump
If you ain't got a ride, well, that's alright
Let the you keep you company on your hike
Trekin down the ave with your headphones on
Take em off for a sec, you still feel gone
You're pressin rewind, many, many times
I must rock the mic cause it's only right
Comin right up off of Eastern ground
This is how you get down, I hope you like the sound
Thermo offering number one
There's more in store, there's more to come
We far from done, no, the show ain't over
So when we comin through, don't say I never told ya
That

Mr. Serv-On,"I'm going through some thangs
These bitch ass niggas got me goin' through some thangs.
I'm going through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs 
These bitch ass niggas got me goin' through some thangs.

I close my eyes, I can't sleep, I visualize death
I seen my little homie get smoked like a cigarette 
And these G's on the streets, enemies, 
They'll take your life for a hundred see's
I mean a hundred dollars or less
The game gets so wicked that I wear a bulletproof vest
And now I'm grown, and they wonder why I'm crazy 
Imagine feedin' tablets and beer to a baby
Never had a chance when I was 5 
Nigga took me in the car, took me on the ghetto ride
Cruisin' through streets that I've never seen 
Pull the clip off a 30 round magazine 
Taught me how to deal with a triple beam 
And ever since then I've been servin' dope fiends
I got the game in the bag that's so big
Nigga see my nuts it's like two figs
Swoll to the fullest, 
In my heart to my vein, pump nickel plated bullets 
And this ghetto got me stressed (stressed), 
'cause niggas that you know (bitches) will rob you blind & leave you to rest.

I'm going through some thangs
These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs 
These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs 
These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs

I hit that nigga with a are-15, do it clean
Back up in the lex, bumpin' Mia, with my mug mean 
Bulletproof vest, Smith and Wess 
For enemies fuckin' steppin' in my direction
I'm gonna teach these niggas a lesson. 
Flexin' like an Anaconda, I'm stuffed like bombers
Hit ya step and get wet, then duck my doorway teck. 
I holds my own like I'm pissin'
Beef with us is death wishing, I put to work because they didn't listen 
They tryed to set me up, why did they push me? 
Hook me up in the town with the killer pussy
Rap me up between the sheets
Nigga bust out the closet, but my 9 made 'em dead meat. 
I shot the hoe who set me up
I'm drivin' off mad because the niggas threw off my nut
I'm going through a thang, ain't no thang though
Cause before I left, I hit the set and took all the dope

I'm going thorugh some thangs
I'm going through some thangs
These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs 
These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs

So if it seem, point the beam
Since a youngster,these niggas pushed my cemetery dream
Lean my body if they could, 
And wished ya die, I wished ya coward motherfuckers would
Everyday, I thank god for my baby, she fall asleep on my chest 
But if her momma catch her callin' me daddy, she whoop that ass 
I'm not scared to blast, why my momma wish she never had me? 
She know these streets got me crazy 
I'm hittin' my momma for some pocket change, 
To stay one step ahead all these niggas in the game 
My daddy, gangsterism pumpin' d up in my vein. 
Should I kill a nigga for respect, or should I let him go?
And if I do, someone please close my eyes 
When I'm layin' bleedin' on the floor 
That's why I never trust a bitch
Cause now a days these bitches carry an extra clip
Ready to knock ya head off for that paper
Always down for a caper, 
Mr. S-E-R-V
I'm going through some thangs, lord help me

I'm going through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs
These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs
I'm going through some thangs 
These bitches and these niggas got me goin' through some thangs

Going through somethings, ya heard me? 
I done made it out the ghetto
And every nigga that I know, that still there 
Think I owe them something 
And every motherfuckin' nigga that was down with me 
Or wanted to be, wanna be just like me 
They think I owe them something
Every bitch I stopped fucking with, 
Thank I owe them something
Know what I'm sayin'? 
Nigga can't even ride in his motherfuckin' car
Nigga can't even walk though the streets 
Without a motherfucker thinkin' a nigga who think he owe him some
I got mine, and you can get yours
Motherfuckers in my family, 
They think a nigga just got boo-coo money,
Just a blown on them, just to give to a motherfucker 
That don't wanna do nothing for theyselves motherfucker
Be a real motherfucker, be a true nigga, get ya own
Damn, can't even mourn the dead anymore 
Without motherfuckers thinking if you a big nigga in the hood
You must be stickin' prices on other niggas heads
But I'm bigger than that nigga
I got family in the Caliope, the Magnolia, and the Saint Bernard nigga",Going Through Somethangs,1997

Hang ya bang ya gang land kill your life, the Kansas City slanger
On elevator rides like OutKast
More lethal then a neck stab
Your bitch and your dope and your area bitch I gotta hail
A hundred pounds in my celing and your whole
Areas kneeling, bowing down to the real drug lord
Push your green nation wide like pharacon
Pushing dream e'ryone on my team then new york got fiends, I mean

Hitting switches, fucking bitches in Milwaukee
Put your colors down and bang your city up, it's a bang up
Hitting switches and fuckin bitches in Charlotte, North Carolina

I don't think so

that I came up with since diapers

All this dope you niggas done sold in the hood

Even though I know shit always don't go they way you want it to go 

I proceed to be a nigga I need, it's only real 

It's money making plans to demand at center field 

And shit's real and right now everything is tight 

I got to pack a gun but if I get caught it's my third strike 

I'm strapped up, my tennis too tight, that's how I'm living 

A nigga on a mission, anything in my way, I'm killing 

That's my mentality right, me and my niggas be quick to fight 

Type of niggas you don't want to cross if you kinda value your life 

Whether wrong or right, I got a pocket full of rocks and I'm on a block 

Smokin weed with my niggas, last thing I want to see is a cop 

On patrol, some dicksuckers roll, the heck is up 

I'm heartless so I point my middle finger cause I don't give a fuck 

I'm strapped up and on parole, I gotta fight to stay out of the penn 

The same shit happened last year, here I go again

Mercy mercy me, Lord forgive me for the wrong I've done

This life full of plenty hurt, so soft and pain 

Consequences of the game but I had to maintain 

Step on toes, I'm ready to ride or roll over 

I'm a kill for a meal, lay back and smoke some doja 

But I know what go around come around good 

Knock on wood and it's understood 

I'm stayin young at twenty one life full of regret

And uh much love to the calliope 
I'm at the Soul Train awards representing my court 
I did a show up in Texas with facing the boys 
South park, fifth ward, nigga bringing the noise 
Front row, nigga tatooed with TRU on his arm 
That's props, that's why I put it in this song 
Went to Cleveland for a three day tour 
At the party at the tele couldn't take no more 
My autograph sessions at the main event 
Thanking all my friends for the money they spent 
At the radio they loving my beats

But they still on my team cause I got fame 
And everywhere I go people be yappin my name

As a matter of fact he slept at my house the other night 
It's cool I let a lot of shit go cause I'm ambitious 
When I'm fed up, nigga, I'm vicious 
Hard to stay focused around these motherfucking locusts 
And not to mention all the cochroaches 
Crab ass niggas hate to see you lead a barrel 
Signed me a contract and got me a Camaro 
And now they acting like I did them wrong by progressing 
I'm guessing that they wanted me to stay up in sections with little 
pocket 
money 
To get a nigga who was going my way

For the love I've got and in return I'm putting it down

Mr. Serv-On,"[Chorus: see-Murder]
Don't blame me for the pain the world has caused
Don't blame me for your own imperfectionate flaws
If every individual were to accept his own blame
I think the world would be a better change
A better change

Nigga don't blame me cause my lyrics hittin your chest like gunshots
And my thoughts seepin into your brain like cooked rocks
It's like a thick I have on a nigga mind is ??? why'all
Sort of like ???????? of thugs
To break off from an overrated government full of corruption and hypocrites
That try to immoralize yourself when they untouchable by laws, that's bullshit
They say I'm overrated, but I'm highly educated
Incarcerated but reinstated and I know them faders really hate it
Rest in peace Malcom and King, TRU soldiers of the black folks
See while why'all gone, I'm a be a mouthpiece for the ghetto
I feel like it's my duty, I be elected through spirit
One of the chosen few soldiers from the infamous No Limit
Records, a cooliation of highly respected ghetto millionaires and servents
Just some independent brothers that deserve it
Now don't point your finger partner, just practice what you preach
Cause it really ain't my fault playa, so don't blame me

[Chorus]
[Mr. Serv-On]
Believe me
If I had my wish I'd robbin every day nigga wake
Cause if you let the world tell em my lyrics are the reason why
Lil niggas took the pains they can't take
Or the troubles he left behind
Why I gotta be the vision
I ain't even lookin at when your child choose music and he choose mine
But if you was a better parent he wouldn't look up to my kind
And time life taught me
The last minutes of your life is like bail, you either make it or you don't
You either goin love me or you won't
But don't blame me when your child ain't got enough to eat
And nigga I appreciate if you goin buy my CD's
But why'all ain't got a decent pair of shoes on his feet
The streets taught me you gotta accept your blame and don't blame it on others
I look at my mother and I watch her suffer
But we beat the bad times in uptown
And nobody gave a fuck, everybody came around
We made it on our own
And turned a fucked up life into a happy home

[Chorus: see-Murder]
[Mia X]
Don't blame me because my skin tone's like God's own
The oldest skeleton was chose to be an Africans born
I'm from a strong race of people who can never be denied
Every tear we cry's like rain water and so our sea dries
Ghetto flowers shades of ebony in full bloom
Women of color got sentenced, blessings unto our womb
They'd rather see us doomed, placin flowers on tombstones
But BeBe's kids multiply while why'all tryin to plum to save your own
Label me wrong because I spit the raw real
Why'all feel all my verses, even if I curse it's straight through em
Screw em, I takes my blame, you hypocrites make me sick
Tryin to sabotage my arches, thoughts stay on some scandalous shit
Get a grip on the way you truly live
Entertainment can't raise your little kids
Run your households
You got to mold their minds and tell them what to look out for
Gangsta rap won't be a cop out no more

Stayed away from the Tanqueray bitches and blunts 
Still Mac nigga ain't nothin' changed 
Got the rings and the gold chains 
Now bitches want to know my whole name 
I penetrate em then I disintegrate em 
I let the next nigga date em 'cause I don't hate em 
I spit voodoo to the most hard to get hoes 
And at the end of the night, I rippin' off clothes 
You fuckin' with the realest, from lyrical spillers 
To killers and dealers and cap peelers, and street guerrillas 
From villains to chillers, we made millions 
And paid killers to protect scrilla 
So what the fuck you talk about winners? 
You hear that word camouflage when you hear my name 
I represent the shell shocked 'cause it's in my veins 
(No Limit soldier) is on my left arm, I took it in blood 
Throw your hood up if you a thug

The nigga that's catchin these niggas and beatin em down

Nigga, that's the fuck, that's about punchin' your fuckin' mouth 
The nigga that'll tear the club up

Mr. Serv-On,"[Mr. Serv-On]
You niggas talkin'bout you run out of this and jump out of that
And hit a nigga block, ha
But I don't really think you know what it means 
to run up on a nigga's shit
And take what you want nigga
Cause as long as I can remember nigga
Down south, No Limit
We take what the fuck we want

[Mr. Serv-On]
Ha, I'm addressin to show a lot of niggaz in the rap game, 
shit bout to change
Nigga you gotta know your pay, chose your side nigga, foe or friend
I can't pretend to love a nigga when I know I don't
I can't pretend to love a woman when I know the fuck I won't
Cause eveything I seem to love, seem to leave
And every nigga I see to trust, 
seem to scream jealously and betrail and bleed
How many niggas you know smoke weed to ease the ghost in they mind
How many niggas you know smile when the judge say 99
I know a lot of niggas in the rap game look at the tank on my chest
And you say to yourself nigga, you hate my kind
When you niggas sit on top of the rap game
Ya'll decided to sit back, get fat, smoke weed, get laid
Then we came, nigga starvin in the middle of the night
Like a new young rapper on a New York train
Then we stepped off, pay the toll, nigga you know tanks roll
Why you niggas strollin in your videos in the park
We was wagin bloody war in the dark
And if you about that talk nigga, fuck you

Chorus
You don't know when I hit your block I hit right
You don't know when I hit your block, aight
You don't know when I hit your block, I hit it right
Cause everything in sight gotta die tonight x2

Now ease up nigga, don't make a sound, lay it down
I fuck with the Pound, 
and any new other gang won't make me fuck with this rap thang
I could take each one of my producers, send them each to one of your labels
And you finally get the feelin of what it feels like to get a real hit
And don't be afraid to look at that sound scan shit
Cause with the pound name nigga
You know you be shippin enough out the door
And pay you artist to a video, buy a house for your wife, you know my ho
See I was like Randy Moss, the top draft choice
a lot of you niggas looked at me but you was too scared to touch my voice
But that nigga with the gold teeth picked me late in the first round
Now I get down with young savage niggas
From LA to smoking weed with that nigga Tony from town 87, and Chi town
I even get down with Jack Town Ballers, Mississippi niggas
Callin me on my beeper sayin Serv, nigga you need extra trigger
Forever nigga, that's how I do it when I put it down nigga
If you ain't fuckin with a nigga 
I bang, hang, nigga lesson hang, sayin nigga

Chorus x2

You know what I'm saying motherfucker?
You goin know what's happening
Like that little nigga that like to bark say
Nigga talk is cheap motherfucker
You know what I'm sayin

I hate the way, I hate it, I hate it

Niggaz close to me ain't scared to let me die
What I'm ridin for, ain't nobody fightin for, ya heard me?
I hate the way I live, I hate the way I live (c'mon, c'mon)

[Mr. Serv-On]
Niggaz act like we was close
I could see it in they eyes, what we had went up in smoke
We used to laugh and joke
When money was small, time to change
I thought everybody would ball, thought if I could call back our life
I guess the bad times when we was broke and down to fight
I'm back to back, pass me a strap, but I feel assed out
It's like I'm the only nigga screamin for the poor niggas down south
The rain seem to cover my tears
I remember the days stealin out of Sears
How am I ever anticipated by bitches killin niggas doing time
And gang related, somebody feel my pain
I thought I'd change, thought I had so much to give
I made a little money, but I hate the way I live
I hate the way I live, c'mon

Chorus 2X

[Mr. Serv-On]
See my life
If it was a book I'd tell my homies turn back the page
Cause it be like I'm a little child 
walking in a man's body lookin for a better age
Cause when I was two I lost my pops and I ain't know what to do
I know what they put my moms through, 
working her fingers to the bone
It was like she was stabbin at her head stone
Get home alone, trying to become a man in this fuckin killers world
And I look up now I'm a father with two girls
what should I do (I love them both)
Hope last, but then I look at the past
See how many niggas fell down
And now I'm sayin damn I could scream for a town
I'll always be rowdy, and I'm always ready to ride
But I put this tank on my chest 
and I'll tell you niggas I ain't scared to die
When I write about it, lot of niggaz read about it, y'all dream about it
What up, y'all niggaz can't fuck with what I stand for
I'm a nigga that'll live this game, 
nigga what you ride for, I know what I'd die for
And when the time come nigga I'm a be my mama's son
And I'm a blast till there ain't no more, c'mon

Chorus 2X

[Mr. Serv-On]
I sit back and I watch women, y'all hooked on crack
And then I say god damn that makes me want to just pull my strap
Get em, get em! The fool out there that's sellin it to em
They pregnant with a baby
I see em through it, I don't and I go crazy if it was my lady
I gotta look back, that's the way life is in these streets
Look back then one day you standing up
And one day it'll knock you off your feet
You got tags on em, I get back and I sit back, 
(what's my name?) You see I'm Serv-On
But the thangs gon' change my fame, maybe if you know my name
It's better than what I can
That's why I try to shield some of these people
You gotta be what only God let you
But then at the same time I'ma be a +Devil+ and get with the +Advocate+
Take it to another level, that's my game, that's my style
You'll never understand what it means to be a father of the child
Ya'll just full of hate, I look back and try to escape
Deep into my dreams, (I hate it) but this is the way it is
I've been a fiend, I've been one
c'mon

Chorus: Mr. Serv-On (repeat 4X)

I'm fightin tears for the time you spent
When your nights are dark, but in your heart you got a friend

[Mr. Serv-On]
You chose a destiny of prison terms and crack pipes
I fell victim to a world full of hard women and gang life
You did nine, now you got five
And every day I feel like I'm fighting myself just to stay alive
I got a little money but it ain't all that
What's the use of having it if it'll keep you from going back
I saw a look in your eyes like you wasn't scared to die
You lost your mom and your sister in three months
and never once I saw you cry
Maybe it was a soldier thing or you didn't know how
Cause so many nights I pray to God, just look at our life and smile
Cause somewhere in this ghetto life we lost our heart
Now we just a bunch of helpless souls searching for heaven, play your part
I witness you fight the demons in your mind
You told me they come late at night, you know that he was hard to find
But sometimes you gotta sit back and relax, and say a prayer
Cause when all the pain goes away I'll always be there

Chorus 4X

[Mr. Serv-On]
Some of the ??? around the way on they third and fourth babies
I wonder if you was home one of them would be yours
You gotta laugh at that, life is crazy
The other day Larry Tunes got twenty
He said he had to feed his baby, 
pay some bills and take care of his lady
I went around the way and the new thing seemed to be wheelchairs
Either they too blind to see or they just don't care
I saw your grandmother and she looked okay
But you know black women, they strong, they only cry when they pray
And I'm still tryin to bang all the tricks you used to hit up
And as usual they ask me where you at, and tell me what's up
But lately every day, now I caught my hands without a bottle
I guess I feel the pressure of these magazines callin me a role model
I look in these kids eyes and I see confusion
We never knew how bad it was, 
we just wanted to represent, never losin (New Orleans)
And no matter how times get hard
You just think about it, you look in your heart, I'll play my part

Chorus 4X

[Mr. Serv-On]
Oh man
I'm still thinkin bout all the times we had
It ain't the same no more, man you know
The game, the hustlin, none of that
I talked to moms the other day
We tryin to get that appeal together",I'll Be There,1999

When will I see my friends 
As the time go I could never 
When will I see my friends 
In this time lord I need some 
When will I see my friends 
 
Have you ever tried to count every raindrop 
Before it hit the ground probably not better yet 
Count every love one or friend that ain't around I did 
Hopin that the time it took it would ease my troubles in 
The end all I got was to many tears an my reflection in a 
Puddle sometimes I just want to stand in the rain and look up 
With my arms open hopin God could tell me why babies die 
Why my cousin Fish keep smokin, mama told me say a prayer 
And it'll ease the pain you think Mouse before he died 
At lease smile and said his son name I'd give anything 
If I could hear my Aunt Gussie curse me out 
Auntee if you see Randall tell him his pad holdin up and 
Hold me a place in his new house cause so many nights 
I look at my Dun and ask myself what's the purpose its been a 
Long time since I been to church is that reason enough to hurt us 
They told my cousin he got HIV known he facin death he walk 
Around with a smile, every Sunday he praisein a thought he 
Still Gods child and mama lost a nephew and a sister in the same 
Year and never once I saw her just lay down, give up and 
Shed a tear

Mr. Serv-On,"Niggas realize we all livin' in our last days.
And we all Prime Suspects to the pains of this world.
And just think if you was lookin' eye to eye with your killer.
It's your last breath, it's your last cry.

I go all out constantly thankin' how to get mine
Everything I do is a hustle, pullin' work tryin' to get by
Every time I close my eyes
I'm havin' nightmares of closed caskets faced down
Thankin' is it my time
But got to watch these niggas with the slanted and crooked eyes
Lookin' me straight in my face and I know they be jive
But I make moves like a chess play why'all then I handles mine
I'm pressure stress to the fullest, but only the smart survive
Can I maintain, or will my mama see my name inscribed
Losin' all my faith, chase one bag and weed
That felt in my ear claimin' she can show me a better day
That's why I'm boxin' with the devil, that's why I'm totin' the AK
That's why I'm peepin' through my window every motherfuckin' day
The final chapter want to write me away
But it ain't goin' be that easy, I'm livin' out my own play
I'm hollerin' right, left, never goin' astray

[Chorus: ]
Now why I'm peepin' through my window
These last days got me sleepin' in my steel toes
But I gotta survive, hollerin' how much time
Till I'm just another memory, my name inscribed (Repeat 2X)

I heard a ghetto child cryin' tonight
Sayin' Lord don't let that killer nigga take my life
But the reaper breathe death and he came to visit
Layin' shaking with his bacon, hot fry to the finish
Babies dying, mama's crying, yellow tapes around the scenes
The last day's right before us so I run and catch my niece
Paranoid with my gun, thinkin' I could be next
Trust in a few, niggas blastin' at me to rest

Now see that drama that I'm bringin', half of these niggas can't even touch
Now see these last days and times, they got a nigga mind fucked up
But I gotta maintain and keep my composure
That's why I smoke dolja, cause see it's trife down south
They takin' it off your shoulders
And bloody bodies just an everyday thang
Motherfuckin' consequences if you hang where I slang
Look it's this thang you get banged
On my block is how we do it
Shit is real these days, use that vest, I'm comin' through it
Nigga fuck who mourn, your best bet is to protect your neck
And never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
There's a constant threat in the N.O.
That's why I'm peepin' through my window
That shit is grimy in the gumbo

[Chorus: ]

Check it
These streets is dangerous and life is hard
Murder murder's in my eyes, take it away my Lord
Cause ever since I was a lil nigga
Chasing Nike's and Hilfiger
I never knew one day that I would have to kill nigga
I ain't never had shit, I'm straight from the ghetto where niggas are poor
Crack heads are hangin' in front of the corner store
Chasin' little bitty pieces of flow
Everybody want to be like Master P, tattoos screamin' out they 'bout it
Could why'all make a change and be up out the game
I really doubt it doubt it

Hey I could give you what you want, T.I.P.'s the hottest
Gain what ya need, I could tell you all about it
You could up in the streets, but it ain't no gettin' out it
When I tell you I'ma G, pimp I'm really bein' modest
I could tell bout the dope boys, hoes, and the ballers (ho)
The pimps and the macks, real niggas that what they call us
Hangin' in the trap cause dat's what our daddies' taught us
Put 30's on a Lac to a Benz on brawlers
Standin' on the corner, slagin' crack and stackin' dollars
Till it's time to cop a brick and I'm tired of movin' quarters
My dad wasn't a doctor and my momma wasn't a lawyer
I ain't never had shit, congratulation is in order (still trappin')
Tryin' ta get a meal for my sons and my daughter
If I call a bad bitch wit connects down in Florida
Say her daddy and her uncle still getting cross the wall
??? I'd be a motherfuckin' fool if I don't call her

I gotta grip a twin, I'm finna buss a move (ah buss a move)
Ah what it is my nigga, what it do? (hey what it do)

Hey what it do, what it do, what it do, hey what it do

If I fuck witcha, ya get 'em for 16
I know people, get 'em 300 a pound
Give 'em to ya for 500 if you my round

I'm the king of the jungle, you can follow me there
Or you can hear it from these niggas who was hardly there
Or take it from niggas who fought to make it a star to get here
Several years ago I told myself I solemnly swear
Forever be hard to kill, even harder to scare
One reason why me and other cats is hard to compare
Cause I'm fact, that's fiction, it hardly compares
Bein' hated part of the game, pimp it's hard but it's fair
Well I'ma be the best, hate me, see if I care
But just know I'm raisin' the bar and I'm keepin' there
And I'ma still ride clean, blowin' weed in the air
With 2 or 3 bad bitches got they feet in the air
Say they like when I smack on they ass and skeet in they hair
Listen, I don't care if you got the song of the year
Ya whole show shutin' down when the don appear

Lucky luciano, probably cause they went out bangin
Gangstas like machine gun kelly
Rest in peace 2pac, aka makaveli

A pocket full of lemon drops, laughin' at crooked cops 

I guess I'm doin' what I gotta do 

As long as I stay TRU, until they put me through 

I know its a shame, things'll never change 

I hope I live long enough to see my daughter spell my name 

I'm TRU 2 Da Game

No Limit Records, Down South Hustlers (independent black owned) 

and the West Coast Bad Boyz 

and I told y'all, I can drop something anytime I want to 

y'all done realized by now, the haters done fell off 

Cause they ain't TRU 2 da game 

I could never forget where I came from 

I'm from the ghetto 

But I won't ever change 

Cause I'm TRU 2 da game, believe that 

Keepin' it real, keepin' it real 

Never sell out, can never sell out

I'm cold wit it
I'm just cold wit it
Know what I'm sayin'?
If you don't know by now, I'm cold wit it
Ah, I don't know if its...
I'm, I'm, I'm just I don't get when I'm dunkin'
Ah, I don't know if I just can't be faded when I do my fadeaways
Why they get jealous of my jumpshots
Man, I'm, I'm tired of it
Look, check it out

Verse 1:
They call my game Alaska
Ice cubes in the cup that simmer Nebraska
The final chapter
Took me some time to master
Many crashed and burned, ain't my concern
No, I ain't gettin' paid to teach, but you can learn
I wake up 'fore the sun, speak to God 'fore I run
Review skills, cause now I'm more effective than the gun
Told since day one that my time gon' come
Step into the field and I can't be outdone
I roam the rectangle
Dangers from all angles
Leave your feelings at home
Cause this could get painful
Stamped and approved
Born not to lose
'Till you play wit me, don't talk
Then get your own shoes

I'm cold wit it, I'm cold wit it
Throw it against the glass and watch me go get it
I'm cold wit it, I'm cold wit it
I want to put my game in cans so you can go get it

I'm the number one draft pick
I make layers cough up their last chips
My feet came with springs like a mattress
Frightnin'
Faster than the speed of lightnin'
Excitnin'
Like the fights of the '93 Tyson
No mistakes
Before you get to yip-yappin' in my face
You better have your ankles braced
Screws and duct tape
I'm a starter like Maurice Carter
Here to serve ya
Naturally made for the game like D.A. and Brian Mercer
They playin' WAAAHHHH!!! music
Time to get hyped now
want to be a soldier
Let's go to Master P's right now
Can't be ignored, showed every time I scored
Had to put money aside
Cause I just shattered the backboard

I'm cold wit it, I'm cold wit it
I'm 'bout to glide right passed ya watch me just go get it
I'm cold wit it, I'm cold wit it
'Bout to put it in a can so you can just go get it
I'm cold wit it, I'm cold wit it
Throw it against the glass and watch the boy go get it
I'm cold wit it, I'm cold wit it
Now when I dunk in your face why don't you act like I ain't did it

Past, present, and future
I ain't eat in a couple days
All I'm trying to tell you
Is this here, I see a opportunity to eat
It's them niggas sleeping across the street
And I'm go get em'(gun shots)

I was a reject on the ghetto blocks
In the end thangs trend thangs servin out them rocks(baby)
Quanties but I know nobody
In this contest I got to hold somebody
Got a gun name Scottie
And he bout to put his beam on him
I want to if he know I'm bout to put that gangsta lean on him(bzzzz)
Thinkin' to myself it's only for the worst if I miss him
When I'm cappin' none of you take it personal
Bustin' got me stuck, (damn) All I see is brains bitch
2 more got to go and I got the aim still(gunshots)
Don't blame this
I said you was go bleed when I greed
It was a matter of time before my mind it find speed
Proceed with 2 slaves damn open it up like Keize Soza
Broke it off to a J' everyday
For all the pay
My beretta say a better day
And I believe that nigga
Money go make souls leave that nigga

It done got to hot in my neighborhood
So I'm a chill minute and make the flavor good
It's understood
That this nigga got to eat(I'm hungry)
So I'm a handle my bussiness on these triflin' streets
My rifle keeps
My mind at ease at all times
Along with a blunt helps commit all crimes
My style brangin' the whole, put me into crack
My paper stack
Even though I did erase the black(so what)
Picture that
A survivor takin' and robbin' for his
I want to guide the surviving kids
After me
Next I done bought me some plastic glocks
And teach my lil homies how to sell and bag these rocks
I'm a beast some say I'm just like Gotti
Mainataining my respect with my A-k shottie
Don't know karate
But I got some hands of steel
(slap slap didn't I tell ya bout playin huh)
But baby in these streets it's kill or be killed
Murderous skills
Ready to do what I gotta
Keys for 1-3 so I got a lot on the collar(come hollar at the collar)
Herion and powder
This shit go keep me in power
I want money as my mattress and take moet showers
Drug deals go sour
That's why my gat on the side
So want ya come test the mother fuckin' baddest alive

Chorus x2
I ain't to be fucking with I'm a Jones nigga
Born to get it on for the throne
The dirt I did got me named Capone
Blowin' homes
In revenge, for my partners and kins
Murdered many men 
Some personal but mostly for ends
My sins
Be forgotten, survivors actin rotten
With the cocaine crockin'
I got the Champagne poppin'
Plottin up stragetted warfares
For my heirs, Nigga
I don't care
For that ? got me scared
Somewhere niggas made it home
With there loss souls
Heads I done toss those
Left in the crossroads(handle that)
The yard full with mother fuckers who died in the game
But a car full of niggas died crying my name
Releasing pain like Charde
But in my way(my way)
Split a blunt on the highway(highway)
Cause it was my say(my say)
I died that day but GOD told me finish my task
Hit the hash, grab all the guns and cash
And dash

And what you got, never allowed the chance to touch it
Was it obvious that nigga ain't die
He was in from the begginning had a piece of the pie
Cause in his eyes, cold like chicago weather
Birds of a feather fuck over together, that's forever
The only change, they accepted when I got him killed
Well they all a time for real over a dollar bill
So now you feel that all street family ain't yours
Receiving cuts and sores because you opened your pores
These niggas ride like volvos, and we ain't talkin bout these whores
Give a section of the beach, nigga surfers gotta swim ashore
If you need more, then take this notion with my devotion
Remember jealousy is a wasted emotion.

And to all the slugs from niggas that have hate for me
Tell my lady I'll take two years don't even wait for me
And see, you never get a second chance to live a first life

Gave my homie 20 years for shop lifttin' 
Now that's bad because LaWan got 3 for murder 
Politics in the court house ain't the same since the murder. 
That's why constantly I watch all my enemies 
'Cause death is a disease to all my TRU g'z 
The can't shake it 
They can't seem to break the cycle 
That's why I'm protected by the gat and St. Micheal 
Ralph Sten said money runs the country 
Make ya do some strange things when it's right in front ya 
I done see mothers turn on they own kids 
Money make brothers turn on one another. 
Even make each other split the other's wig 
Animosity 
Least of all tops is ta watch ya back 
Life or Death 
'Cause ya never know if ya breathed ya last breath. 

[Chorus: x2] 
 
I'm already dead 
So can't nobody kill me 
I done suffered to long to let another man fear me 
My pain brings anger to a total stranger 
Ain't no limit to my hall when I'm constantly in danger 
I just want to be surrounded by somebody that luv me 
But reallity is sendin' me those hatas undercover 
I don't know who to trust but my family and friends 
Takin' chances on your life when you let a stranger in 
Nowadays rappers dying 
So I take it as a message 
I lived to see another year so I count my blessings 
Tell Em' I'ma changed man, but they don't hear me 
On my knees beggin' god can you please forgive me 
Let the past be the past 
I'm investin' in the future 
Watch the ones that swallow most ya 
And the ones that'll do ya 
My advice to the world 
Maintain your sanity 
I know your faced with life or death everyday but overlook the evil 
Thoughts 
'Cause there's gotta be another way 
Life or Death? 
See me? 
I trust nobody 
Money is the rule to all evil 
Better watch yourself boo

Most niggas might think I'm crazy when I tell em this

All this type of shit as heroes
They might look at motherfuckin Muhammed Ali
Yah know Sugar Ray Leanord, Mike Tyson, but me..

Air Jordan ain't no motherfuckin hero G
My heroes is niggas in the ghetto that slang D
That right on chrome and triple gold and pimp hoes
And take any nigga in the click to the Super Bowl
And party like it ain't nothin
But most of my homies they done died over drug money
Like Bizzy Bob and Sam Skutty but I still love em
Air full of motherfucker and I still want to hug em
Big Dave, my nigga gone to the battle field
Dandon and Levi, damn guard ya grill
'cause where ya goin you gotta watch your back
Judge, god damn another nigga didn't make it back (Mr.C)
My lil brother Kevin Miller rest in peace
Elbraud, Nextditch, and Big Leaf

To lil Tony,to dime P
Seritz,Burnell,can't believe
That he's gone, the Scarface
Dank,Loot,and Meathead
And what about Kenny Sep
And all my niggas that dead and gone that got caught in the rep
And my other heroes still livin
But they locked up behind bars, caught up in some pigeons
Like my lil cousin Jimmy,lil Horgel
Randall,Marlow,Pee Wee damn
Another mission complete
Took off the streets locked up by the police
Meatball, and Nap, La Crowe   
Pac, jinte, the gats go pow

Even though they had no way out the ghetto but the come up
Off the streets in the hood money

A hero is a zero to me
The only hero that I know is them niggas in my hood G
They gave me the game so I enhanced the gat
Than I took the game, and ripped it out the frame
I tried and told ya
A hero can't be ya lucky rabbit's foot or ya 4-leaf clover
It all be a myth in ya mind
A hero ain't about shit if they ain't about dying
You know who was a hero to me
that nigga MoXs on the Howard J G

That still hustlin in the game tryin to make it
But y'all niggas better realize you can't fake it

Mr. Serv-On,"Check this out playas
All y'all gangster niggas
Y'all motherfucking gangsta bitches out there (the dope game) 
I'm a let y'all know something (welcome to the dope game)
Something that'll never end, this shit is going on like fucking numbers
Black on black crime, nigga it go like this here
We live an eye for an eye

You kill me, I kill you, my partners kill your partners
And you dead ain't no love on my spot
Me and my partners pushing rocks
Got them 17 round glocks at your ass spitting like loogies
We packing heat, 32 round clips, my automatic uzi
But I look into the eyes and I stare, I see death
Goddamn thinking ""the fuck?"", it could be me
My little homie on the ground crying
I'm thinking I'm gone, Oh my lord
My little homie Tony's dying (ripped his heart out)
He never had a chance to see his life glow
And he never had a chance to see his wife bro
And his little kid is only 8
It ain't about me or you motherfucker 
You gone peep defeat off the tree  
Cause you die and you murder, how could you live on the streets
And you never hurt, another nigga with a glock G
I'm thinking about Tic-Toc Boom, there goes another one
Send him to the moon
Ain't no rocket ship bitch, it's the temple of doom
I mean the ghetto, cause it's wicked
Most niggas out there in the hood, trying to get a chicken
But never even seen a bird
They die for that cain and that weed and they water
And they to fucking high, to see the enemy
Niggas that pretend to be, fools don't come close to me
Your best friend will kill you
I'm from that 3rd Ward, Caliope Projects 
Where they peel your caps like bananas
Police trying to stand on them buildings with them radars and scanners
But they can't stop the murders 
That's happening in my hood motherfuckers
Cause everybody study capping in this
Everyday, all day niggas dying, mothers crying
But y'all niggas ain't realizing that the hood is murder
Find your ass in a 6 inch gurder
Cause niggas banging like Charlie Chan
You'd better pack a piece nigga 
And welcome to the never ending game

The never ending game, (the dope game) the never ending game
Will I die up in my sleep, or die on these streets
Cause the ghetto ain't no joke
Niggas in my hood everyday getting smoked
Welcome to the never ending game
Will I die up in my sleep or die on these streets

And the ghetto ain't no joke
Cause every motherfucking day another nigga gets smoked
And momma pray it ain't me
But I'm addicted to this dope game, addicted to this green cheese
I be making mail like the mailman
This is for my partners in the hood pushing massive cain (ice cream)
Through the hood of the projects
Its fiends walking up for bubble ups
You think I'm bout to reject
When a nigga get some money, I got them gats cocked nigga
I ain't living like no dummy
If I die, I ain't scared to die, but don't ask me why
Will I retire and give it up realize
That's this my only mission of money
But y'all niggas look at a nigga hustling like its funny
But I got to feed the family
Even though if that take me getting fucking scandalous G
And I have to hurt shit
Put a nigga in the dirt, mean putting in work
Lay him down, and punch in your time card
Cause you never know when your ass bout to go meet the Lord
So I live ruthless, reckless, and rangeless (dangerous)
Don't give a fuck, my clique is ready to hang shit
Off the rack, ain't no trap
Just a bunch of motherfuckers walking with gats
Through the projects and walky-talkies
Jacking shit motherfucker ungh, that's why they bark
Like dogs, watch a nigga hard
And I be slanging dope like I'm getting paid like Lou Rollins
And the white folks can't stop this
And the Taz can't stop this nigga, cause I'm in the hood slanging rocks
Getting paid cause I'm major
And if I die fucking retire my shoes and hang up my pager
And give 4 G's to my sons and kill my enemies
Y'all can't stop a nigga please, even if I'm dead G

Will I die sellin' dope, or would I sell a million records

Even tough the ATF, done kicked down your home
And ran right through and got me
But you still came to see me
And said that you love me
And I know that you real though
Cause when I got out, you's the first one at the door
Knowing that your boy turned into a man
But you done tripped cause I still understand
That I'm trying to make some money
And if I die in this game, I guess that won't be funny
But you still on my side cause you a soldier
You the only friend I got and ma I told ya
One day I'ma change G

If I make it out this dope game
I know that life won't be the same, momma I gone make a change

Totin chips and A-K's, money round drugs (ha)
Shoot first, and leave them standing in their shoes

I'm marchin' with my AK one two three 
Ya'll niggas want to be like us but it ain't gone be 
Huh nigga what we soldiers",Soldiers,2013
Mr. Serv-On,"Yo, yo, what's up nigga? You know the streets is a jungle
You gotta survive out here
You need a strong mind to do the shit I do
You ever seen something blown up before
See that nigga cross the street in that Cutlass
Check this out

[Chorus x2]
Survival of the fittest, respect my come up
Survival of the fittest, you better not run up

I remember back in 89 a nigga used to steal
And now I got a Navi with a mothafucking grill
One time chase a nigga through the fucking alley
Mad cause I fucked up my only pair of Bally's
I used to smoke weed with the ballers after school
Mothafuckas wanted to hang cause I used to act a fool
Started slanging rocks because the shit was fun
I used to bang at niggaz just to see them run
People started hearing shit started recognizing me
Big timers fronted me some coke and a ride g
Dope became a business, no longer a hobby
I owed a nigga 5 g's so I started robbing
I knew I had to move before I had to bang him up
I'm a act a donkey if you don't respect my come up
Dumb niggaz die and real niggaz live
The ghetto is so wicked I can't even trust my kids

[Chorus x2]

Started in this game at the age of thirteen
Getting paid making money serving crack to the fiends
Hoes couldn't take me, niggaz gave me jealous looks
To the world I was a man, to the feds I was a crook
Put my face up in the paper, put my name in they books
Cause they see a nigga balling off the birds that I cooked
As the years went by still survival of the fittest
Now I'm riding in the tank representing to the fullest
Putting bullets in you bitches jealous niggaz in disguise
Shooting niggaz til we die, Gambino's on the rise
My nigga Fiend up by my side, my enemy bound to die
Got no mercy in my eyes label Gotti one of the realest

[Chorus x2]

I was born a bastard, my pops was a thug
Four years in the pen for transporting drugs
I was Known in the hood as a nigga with the weight
Bithces all up in my business, shipping keys from state to state
Triple beams in the project, Calliope where I broke 'em down
Razor blades and baking soda, pure white fuck the brown
My clientele was growing started investing in some other shit
Barber shops on every block, even had a weed spot
Moms and the kids put away up in the house
A fellas Cameras in the lawn to spook a nigga out
Pitbulls in the backyard trained to kill
Call my folks up on the phone before I made a deal
I'm one step ahead of a nigga doing wrong
That's why I'm still alive and been on top so fucking long
I had to spank some busters, to show 'em I mean business
The ghetto is so wicked its survival of the fittest

Things ain't what they used to be.  
Things ain't what they used to be.

[Verse 1: Master P]
I remember back in the days it wasn't like that
Everybody knew everybody, now days it ain't like that
We used to stand on the corners and drink brew 
Now days you gotta duck when they drive through
Cause they blastin', life is like plastic
But who would be the next egg took out the easter basket
Is it you, me, or her or she or he? 
who would live to see the long age of 23? 
Cause once you dead and gone who gives a damn
On your tombstone would read Rest In Peace Sam  
But in the ghetto you cooked 'till you dead 
Ain't no love when you dead and gone cause you red 
Like roaches for the gutter, peanut butter
your life in the gutter , fool cause you fluttered 
With this game that I spit, shoot out, don't quit 
Now you a victim of society another statistic
I heard the gunshots rain from the middle of the street 
The gun-smoke cleared three people on the concrete
I mean it's crazy, slippin' on daisies
Time to call it quits, they done put a bullet in a baby

[Chorus: Master P and Mo. be Dick]
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be
Times done changed things ain't what they used to be

[Verse 2: Master P]
Watch you back in the ghetto black 
Open the box, Mom's ain't nothing to eat 
Back in the day, I thought we was a family
My little brother on the street corner selling crack 
Only 15 used to be a quarterback
I wish the law would rehabilitate my auntie 
I came home try to visit that girl tried to do me
Started tweakin' said that she needed crack
Stole my grandma's rent money out her purse black
I stay Tru 2 Da Game you devils' can't see me 
I put that on my mom, I put that on my gold teeth   
My homies bangin' ,no respect for the American flag
But they kill over that blue and red rag

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Master P]
I remember back in the day smoking weed was the everyday drug
Now days they shoot heroin and sell blood 
Back in the day catchin' the clamps was gettin' us shot 
Now days catch the AIDS and your time will stop
My lil' homies doin' time, 25 with a L
A victim of the system, I'd rather die and go to hell 
I try to be legit and start my own company
Till these sucker want to bump into P
They point the finger at me for tellin' another what to do
How could another person tell you what to do
I could tell you to rob or steal or kill 
that's like pointin' the finger at Jack or Jill
For being the first person on this little earth
Is like askin' Mary why she had to give birth
And who would be the next victim to lose his life 
And who would be the next one to make a life
But when you make a life you gotta learn to teach your kid
So one day they can grow up and make it big
But all this gangbangin' and turf wars gotta cease
Cause y'all know we livin' in the last days G

You bitches better break me off my money 'cause I'm crazy
Girl you ain't got my cash

You won't see your baby
Put my dope in the baggies I mean the bundle up
Dollar bills in my fuckin' pocket tightly crumbled up
50's in my mouth got my goddamn tongue
Remember when I walk on the set
Bitch I'm gonna leave you dumb
Break me off my cash
I ain't takin' no shorts
I'm aimin' that Tek-9 right at your heart
Ain't no fuckin' return from the dead

I'm ready to kill bitch
I'm the wrong nigga in the game to be fuckin' with
I'm kickin' doors down

Leavin' fiends on the ground
Face down like dummies
You better have the cash
Or your ass in the body bag
Killa murda muthafucka
I ain't runnin' from the tads

Rat-a-tat-tat is the sound from my gat
I told you muthafuckas that you won't be coming back
You came up short with the muthafuckin' grits
That's why yo ass got caught up in some gangsta shit
Call me the black rambo
'cause I don't give a fuck
And just like my boy said
Yo ass got plucked
You shoulda came right with my money
You started smokin'

That's why I had to break you off some tokens
So jump on the bus ride to hell bitch
I'm gonna let your know who the fuck you be fuckin' with
Tha M-A-STER to the muthafuckin' P
And I ain't takin' no shorts with ya'll niggas with my D

[Chorus]

Went into the crackhouse and opened up the safe
One nigga at the door lookin' at me hellah fake
I played it all like it was fuckin good G
That's when I told my man
Hit 'em with the oozi!
That's it
1-2-times rat a tatta
One nigga on the ground lookin' like a eggo plater
But I ain't even trippin'
Gotta show them I ain't fakin'
'cause if these other niggas get me for some bacon

I started counting my dope
Everything was cool black
Headed to the front
Got them fiends walkin' in the back
I ain't even trippin'
Ain't no time to serve these fiends
I got 40 g's and two fuckin' keys
Headed to the bienz to put the fuckin' cash up
Jumped on the freeway nigga fuckin' dashed bro
Think I see the rollers behind me through the rear-view

But I ain't even trippin' 'cause I ran through clear view
Stopped at Egg-Zone tried to get some gas
That's when I see two robbers on my ass
Played it all cold
Told be	 to get that pistol
Jumped back in the bienz shoulda seen they head whistle
I went back to the house and my homie want some flour
I ain't Scarface but got the money and the power
They call me Nino Brown
Or fuckin' Frank Nitty

But if you come up short
There's gonna be some shit up in my city

Mr. Shadow,"[Mr. Shadow]
Muatalo, that's all I heard in the back of my mind
The voices in my dome got me thinkin so kurpted
The way that I be interupted it's impossible
My actions are unstoppable
Shadow's on the loose bringin war like the Neim troops
I got my boats and my gauge ready to exacute
Those that try to pretend to be a friend of me
You'll remember me for taking many lives
I live my life wise makin widows out of your wives
I analyze every thing before my eyes
I bring the drama from the crack of dawn to sun rise
surprise, I'm one step ahead of you, I'm warning you
I think it's better you, just keep a distance
I'll make your death a mystery like some unlistent
Pistol whippin and unloadin the clip on naybody trippin
Shippin em out without doubt
You should of know what Shadows all about
Scalpin mothafuckas letting em know the man is out
I heard it one to many times
Now I'm bringin mass disasters to your masterminds
With arrors and carabines
You try to play the role of a foe but that's a no-no
And know you got to go with a hole in your soul
Understand I put up with shit from no man
I stand alone now you outta put the chrome to your own dome [Suicide]
I explain the unspoken, leave a happen home broken
Provokin mothafuckas out there lokin
If you got the balls then why don't youcome and test me
Let me show you where your place of rest me
Expekt me, to bring the MAYHEM like only I kind
Remember that I still have you stranded in my land
You and only you is who I'm after
Your ememy for life and where ever you got after
I remain strong, not given a fuck what goes wrong
Ready to battle cause Mr. Shadow is the bomb",El Matador,1998
Mr. Shadow," 

[Mr. Shadow]
Introducin, seducing your mind, makin the one they call Stallon
To Shadow the one man batallon, retaliate never hesitate
To break a home, cause it's either you or him
With a hole inside your dome, I am known
To be the pain inflicter, 380 chrome in your mouth get the picture
I hitcha like Chavez, the job is well done when I am through
Whatcha even be thinking about stepping to this bald headed fool
On a mission, 36 1 9 up on the map,
Blowin up like oklahoma, like McVeigh I will attack
Fools collaps like the wall of berlin, when I enter
Down to the end of my days I represent the southern california,
Home of real soldiers, warriors down for the broads and not the corninor
Waiting for the call, I be the one makin the throw,
I be ready to blast in the party,
not the one to pass, now who's the badest thug of all

[Chorus](2x)
Now everybody in the hood throw your hands up in the sky
Represent where you from cause Deigo til I die
It is I Mr. Shadow on the rise with this gansta hit I don't plan to quit
Til I come upon a grip [repeat]

[Mr. Shadow]
When I flow this time leavin fools with multiple scraloses
Shadow is on the mic 619 until my coffen closes
I am ready to lyricly abuse plus confuse people
Like abuse no excuse, I'm devoted to my crime
With a bullet every time I bust a rhyme
Fool you got to hold your own in this city I reside
Throw them hands up in the sky represent where you from
Bop your head to beat move your feet to the drum
Here I come ready to take on any battle,
I'll show you that I rock from San Deigo to Seattle
I'll do you like a rattle, can you handle all this drama
Now I'm in your ghetto, I'm the rapping Jeffery Dahma
I'ma give it to you raw, cause this Shadow so Notorious
Every battle that I'm in I'm Victorious, to the point of no return
I'm unloading lyrics like a clip, down to spit like a cobra
So look over your shoulder

Chorus

[Mr. Shadow]
As I bust through the door and I drop another flow
Third Verse now in progress, convicts meet the congress
Mobbin ready with the squad droppin massive bomb
Blowin up like land mines atomic like the dogg (roof, roof, roof)
So watch when I shoot, cause fools be getting kicked
With my lyrics like a bitch, When I look, look behind cha
Shadow be ready to blind ya, enemies better be ready
When ever they diss me, cause I find cha
And I'm down with the finest in the state,
And the woods is where I dwell, fools get your story straight
I'll be damned like Alexander, my furture Holy like Evander
And when I get up on the mic, it's so tight I get some more stylez
And prehaps I'm the one talking to the fool, talking to you
And I'm unloading the strap and cappin you
And you can't handle, when ever the gat is exploding
And bustin the cap, it's the Shadow with the sickness
Leaving you twisted like tornado, ain't no witnesses like Kato
Cause I'm fatal

If your ass wants to live another day
Get the fuck out of my way when I lyricly slay
Bring it on all my foes
Mr. Shadow be the one killing mothafuckas
Like told shove em all in holes
Lke a ghost I'ma hauncha mothafuckas make the stories tie
I can hear the cries I sing when you bring it with more jealousy
I give a bullet and begin to do the fool like I do that vatos mine
To the night with a sight when
I look the moon is full and get tool and look for my foe
Got that five footed star on my chest so you know what it is that I'm searching for
Murder you heard of me makin it dark like an eclips
Like ""Tales From the Crypt"" I come equipped with the triple six
And I'm bound to get sick
It's The evilest lyricist bringing this wickedness nemisis
Giant on my premisis withnessin part like the Exorcist
Cause I'm comin to get em like every day
You run and you can hide but you won't get away
It's the game that I play like the quija board
You can't see me but you will believe me, and need me
If you look a little closer you can see The Shadow of a demon appearin
I'm hearing the voices that tell me to do the evil shit that I do
And you know that I'm due so I do when I cast my spell on you
The evilness just fell on you and I'm the perfect fool to wish HELL ON YOU

Tonight, 781 to your area
You know it's gonna happen tonight
But of course, 781 to your area

Creepin up on your ass you won't even see or hear me coming
Be running I'm becoming some thing evil fuck people fuck sequals
Got to get the murder done now, all I see is the fear in your eyes
Your tempature rise, You're terrorized
Don't be surprised, I see my reflection like a mirror in your eyes
Every thing gots a price, but you got a price to pay
I sold your life away, you stole a slice away
Dealin with your life I took your strap, your price is right
Could tonight be the night that I feel some thing come over me
I don't know what it is with a devilish grin
Foes and friend and bloody sin
Don't know when it's gonna end
Just like a puppet on a string he'e controlin me
I try to be cutting those string but like smokey he gots a hold on me

That's the fool that rolled on you
That's the fool that stoled on you
What the fuck you gon do
Fuck it I'll do it for you

I'm having a conversation with somebody who's not even there
Hearin the voices inside my head saying you'll get no where he you care
I be the Lil' Rob going insane when he calls me name
I'm hearing voices in my head and every night I do what said

[Demon Voices]

I better listen to my master
It's good bye, tonight is your night
You should of never messed with me
Never mess with, maricon

And I know you like it like porn treat the streets like hors leave em torn
In drop my rhymes like the storm when it rains it pours
I take form and I...
Hit the streets looking all nice and neat top fully creased
One hell of a looking beat the least of my feats from west to east
From north and south not knowing what it's all about top me on scout
Looking for my new recruits to follow my foot steps down my route

But if not your better pray cause I'm coming your way

Krimes pays when ever the fuck I inflict pain with pick
And I'm coming to stick you let satin be with you
Nobody will probably miss you when I diss you
If you want to fuck around with these two blad headed mothafuckas
That'll leave you in the mist when I clutch my fist
I'm pist you missed Apocalypse, I can't resist the bloodyness
The mess ain't over on 31st of October, I toldcha
The Virgin Mary won't hold, I'll scoldcha and moldcha into a deamon screamin
I'm leavin you sufferin wonderin why

Tell what you think then I will meet you at the crossroads

Look at his girl
She's lookin at who?

I'm so excited got your bitch on my dick
And the hoe want to ride it

I'm so excited got your bitch on my dick
And the hoe want to ride it

I'm so excited got your bitch on my dick
And the hoe want to ride it

I'm so excited got your bitch on my dick
And the hoe want to ride it

I remember when I met you
I knew I had to sweat you
Had me all erected so how could I neglect it
Seen you around meant your man was in the county
Set to serve a bid now I'm headin to where you live
I got me a posse forget you or not
Maybe we could talk and exchange our iner thoughts
Knowin one another but keep it undercover
I got to keep a secret if I want to be your lover
Now keep it on the down low, nobody knows
Sippin on my beer as you're whisperin in my ear
Tellin me your real and that you want to feel
Like you would ever leave me, descive me, believe me
Never have I trusted a women that I lusted
Now were always screwin and nobody could ruin it
that's what you told me, when you would hold
Now I hold a grudge from the colors that you show me

I got scopes that are deadly like strokes when I roll by
Everybody sayin hi, I'm not knowin why
All up in the mix and still triple sixen
I brag when I sag with a bag full of trixes
Stay away from the rain when it falls
The baddest of them all hit it up on your walls
Kinda like Ruch Banis I got the fame
I'm young and bad and I'ma blow up like his plane
It gets kinda a critical when I get lyrical
Words that I speak got your fiendin like tweak
Show em no pity down to the grity
Kinda like when Jesus got jumped by a whole city
It gets scary so watch who you marry
She might be the first one to laugh when you're buried
Take you for your goods all alone in the woods
Sufferin lonely what about your homies
Everybodies fake so watch who you trust
The girl that you love is the girl that I lust
Watch as I take her, show you she's a faka
Go ahead baby shake your money maker

I creep and I crawl
I shoot and make em fall
I'm posted on your walls
Now who you gonna call
It's me and my dawg through the fog breakin laws
2 bald headed thugs with the slugs for the cause
Pause, hold up, wait up, and give me an minute
Remember it was you and only you all up in it
But all of a sudden, your mind went through changes [changes]
Never talk to strangers [strangers]
You should of told her, beggin me to hold her
Look over your shoulder Hi it's me
And all because of a rap got a knife in your back
You're crazy for life now she's gonna be your wife
Now ain't that a shame when she calls out my name [Shadow]
So how do you feel, are you fake or ya real
So why don't you come and face me
You lick her and you taste me
And even though you hate me
I'm knownin that you praise me",Excited [Featuring Mr. Lil One],1998

Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue

And the parlor lamps begin to glow

Mr. Shadow,"Hi this is Steve Austin
Reportin' live from San Diego, California
I'm here wit two controversial rappers from the city
Lil' Rob and Mr. Shadow A-K-A The Mayhem Click
And we're talkin' about rumors
Now Lil' Rob we understand you have an album out entitle the Crazy Life
Can you tell us what kind of rumors have you murder sense the release of that album
And some of the things you been through

Well let me put it like this
All this fools talkin' shit all the time
I was sixteen wit the bullet representin' the 6-1-9
But this fools couldn't take it, they didn't want me to make it
And so they rather hate it because they just can't fade it
Gang related, situated, now I'm back
This putos talkin' smack but I kind of like that
In a way, in one day, I might say that the ones who helped me do this
Had it any other time and I knew this I'm still foolish fools are clueless
To what I can do wit my ability thought of myself as a cholo not a real MC
And so I did what I did, I'm so glad that I did it
Because it put some chips in my pocket when I finished
Using words like Homes, Simon, and Leba
People try to put me down but end floatin' on the river
See I told you twice before but I'll say it one more time
You do your thing Homes but I'm gonna do mine

[Chorus: x2]
Look at all this rumors
Started by jealous people

And basically that's what I think
All this fuckin' fools can talk all the fuckin shit they want about me
'Cause I can give a fuck you know what I mean
It proves that I'm above their level, You Know

So Shadow we understand you havin' similar problem as those of Lil' Robs
Is there anythin' that you would like to say
To them Player Haters and if so what would it be

Man I gotta give it up to the punks tryin' to diss me
Talkin' mad shit 'cause they miss me
Reminisce me because they use to talk head about my rhymes
And when they heard me in the radio they requested till I die and I must admit
That I love you yappin' lips
'Cause it makes me ride my rolas amd my music stacks my chips
Mr. Shadow the crazy vato that fools wanna battle
When they end up undergravel when they act like who's in tattle
Now Why would you want part of this truthfulness
Don't get caught up in the mess
'Cause I hate them phony putos dippin' all up in my business ese
Got hate straight for all the fools that player hate
'Cause ain't no punk chavala stoppin' me from makin' bake
I don't need to take it to make it like claus I brake it unfaded
I be remainin' like say it I'm servin' hate to those perpetrated it

[Chorus: x2]

Yeah, that's pretty much how I feel
Gotta tell them haters that ah
You can only witness what you see not the things you hear
Remember that

Sense we're talkin' about rumors
I heard that Lil' Rob and Shadow weren't always the best of friends
So Shadow can you clear that up for us and tell us what's really goin' on

Simon, we had some problems like a dose we had to squash it
We're from the Mayhem Click (WHY?)
'Cause everybody wants it
The baddest mother fuckers now together no one is ever gonna
Intimidate us, just imitate us player haters
Don't bother analyzin' anythin' we do
'Cause the shit we kick is tight and you know that this is true
Mr. Shadow and Lil' Rob makin' heads bob and it don't stop
'Cause we're about to keep on flowin' 'til you see our caskets drop

It's the one lil' cholo, back before I go
Just thought that I let you know that you can never stop my flow
So I suggest you put that shit to rest, quit talkin' all the mess
You're talkin' about the best and you're just wastin' your breath
As sit here, thinkin' neva thought it would be you
The city that I represent talkin' all that shit
Because all we do is kick it and mind our own business
Lil' Rob and Mr. Shadow scratchin' fools off the bitch list

[Chorus: x4]

So now you know where we're comin' from
And wit that it concludes the story for today
I hope you mother fuckers learned your lesson
And learn how to keep your fuckin' trap shut
And quit spreadin' rumors that ain't true
'Cause that shit be gettin' mother fuckers in trouble
And believe me, you don't want part of that
You don't want none of this The Mayhem Click
And we're out",Rumours [Featuring Lil Rob],1998

And now it's just me and you, and I'll be seeing you

At your gave for trying to act brave, you could of stayed
But the pigs couldn't wait, and those fools that be-trade
For your ass that never prayed, for cheers if you never shed a tear
Now you sleep with the maggots you motherfucking fagots

Your clan should have never ran cause I'm the man
Mr. Shadow gots you motherfuckers stranded in my land

[Chorus: x2]
What goes around comes around, the tables turns
It's the Shadow of your death come back I'm gonna burn
You slip away slow but I won't it go, what goes around comes around

[Mr. Shadow]
I walk up in the cemetery and I was buried
But then I made out when you thought you laid me out
And now it's all about the pay back, think of way back
I'm your terror, your enemy forever, so let's call the priest

Ain't no peace til deceased, I be the first motherfucker to release
My demon, I know I got you dreamin' and screamin', stirring up the news
'Cause you heard I broke the rules, never leaving clues, I'm refusin' to lose
Every fool that I stake, best believe I payed my dues, many clues that took

Live my life as a crook, take look where ya step or I might resurrect
And Huantcha, bitch motherfucker cause I want you
Teach y'all a lesson that your momma never taught you,
I shot you, took ya for the life you were living, your enemy for life
And you still see me grinning

[Chorus]

[Mr. Shadow]
I'll see you in the next life, I'll be waiting
If you think you've seen the last of me, you're mistaking
Now you don't have to ask, let me run you down the facts
They way you bust raps is the way up bust caps, fuck the snaps

I gave you all my testimony, you're a fraud you's a fake
And forever be a phony, now throw away your fantasy
That you were me, but never could it be, because I'm bigger then the sea
I saw ya coming, I was walking you were running,

And all of a sudden I was pointin' and blastin', at you
I was taking away every day that you lived, and I never forgive
Unforgiven, physco way I was driven with the evils how I'm livin'
6 letters in my name, 6 thoughts up in my brain, 6 shots from my slug

Gotcha wakin' up in a frame, a memory of you but it's all because of me
'Til you paid for your sins is the day I set you free

[Chorus]",What Goes Around Comes Around,1999
Mr. Shadow,"Who's that fool in a 62 Impala
Heard it through the vine
You was mad cause I'ma baller
I'ma tell you how it is
When I thug through these streets
I mob with my dawgs
And these hogs play for keeps
You'll sleep deep in a grave
For misbehaving
Inhalin' the chronic smoke
It ain't know joke I'm gang related
Reinstated by the pecker wood
Situated in my neighborhood
Still an active gang member understood
Now you can find me
After, a bitch that be swingin'
Puffin in the dark see the spark
When I'm hittin' the blunt
They got me spinnin'
Thinkin' up a way
To make a buck
Fuck it I hustle every day
I hate cops and they hate me
Cause I won't stop
To grow my sticky stems of grass
So they wanna burn my crops
Props to all my drug smokin'
Law breakers
Life takers
You better duck and cover
If you's a faker trick

I blast at these haters

Close your mouth open your eyes
And peep game
How I make it taste dark like my name
Make way CA is the state
SD is my town
Beyond is my label
So you haters bow down
Gangsta style is what I bring
When I create these melodies
Dedicated to them crooks catchin' felonies
Remember me as the stalker of your life
That one man battalion livin' by the knife
Through the night cause I'ma rider
With my poket lighter
Ready to homicide a mothafucka
So trucha cause I'll buck ya
Duck you in the dirt
Like a seed of marijane
Explode like propane
When you step into my domain
The K is what I claim
Mr. Shadow is my name
All I want is the moolah
So fuck you homie and the fame

Now I'm bouncin' loungin'
Chillin' in a different state
Playa haters stay away
Before you get sprayed
Lay to rest cause in the West
We don't play
Strapped with chrome
Shake dome is the way
Say that one day
Me and you ever clashed
I hate to tell you homie
I'ma have to whip your ass
Twenty five smash while I mash in the lo lo
Trust no man and stay away from the po po
Stay secluded from society
Some stated that I was gonna have
The killer blood inside of me
Sapriety is some thing I never feel
Now my daddy always told me
To be the king of the hill
Shoot to kill
When I be dumpin' on my rivals
I gotta runnin' and duckin'
Make sure there's no survival
So check your vitals
Cause I don't know what you've been sniffin'
And you are wiggin'
If you thinkin' you could ever catch

Hell a High, off that sticky gram weed
Livin' the thug life, sellin' drug life
Packin' snubs, smokin' weed all day bud life
Can't fuck wit it baby

It's the 'unfadable', confrontation with 'I' is consequential
Me and Slush ""The Villain"" makin' your advisories parental
Fuck a presidential limousine
I roll wit thugs in maxima's on Lomos

Or Impalas on chrome d's 
Follow me and see why everybody calls me hostile
How motherfuckers be hatin' 'cause I live a gangsta lifestyle
My profile is so wild you wouldn't want to kick it

With these two young thugs, packin' snubs and gettin' convicted
Inflictin' much pain like my a.k.a. was migraine
Make a fool swallow piss for disrespectin' my name
From the sky falls rain to the streets, you'll fall victim

And all I got to say to my thugs is fuck the system

Makin' fools panic cause they heard about the aftermath
I'm at the point of no return and so I keep burnin'
Marijuana cause I want the higher learner

Me and my faculities bodies covered up with tattoos
So when you see me it's intimidation that you feel
Cause you know these fuckin' Eses mess for real
Cause we're soldado down to throw putasos

Con chiflasos tricky let's throw chingasos
I got Shadow on the side of me
With that gram sticky green mothafucka

Come get high with me
And if you say you'se my homie, don't decieve me
Cause when I say I'm gonna kill, you best believe me

Even out of town we break motherfuckers down like car trouble
Tricky grab an axe and a shovel
Show these sons of hood rats who gots the bag of tricks
Full of guns, ammunition, screwdrivers and ice picks

We pick who dies, when the wolf cries
Brutalize mothafuckas, catch em by surprise
We're unexpekted like a car crash
Head bash a mothafucka, and give him whip lash
Think fast, blink and it's your ass up in pieces
Have your mom screamin for Jesus

Down to buck motherfuckers
Better duck or that ass get plucked motherfucker
I got all I need to succeed, let's get to test em'
Pocket full of weed and a gun that's full of teflon

I'm a motherfucker thug with no love
I'm seein' my enemies bleedin' sleepin' in their blood
I'm fantasizin' homicidal thoughts like Charles Manson
Money schemin' plots to come up, like hold you for ransom

It's all about the skrilla homie, I'll put a price on your head
And iIf they don't pay up by mornin best believe that you're dead
Playin wit your life like God but I don't care
Ain't gon let nobody stop me from bein a millionaire

So take your time
Give me yours and I'll owe you mine
Fill the mind of any man how you shake that figure, shit
I'll blow your mind how I this work finger
Nine milli for the haters, can't nobody fade us
Going down like elevators, rough necks like alligators
It's better late then never, girl you know the rest
Why you trying to be cute, banging fools in a tight dress
You might stress over petty ass shit
But I never have and I won't you punk bitch

Massive exposure, I thought I told ya
You said that you're good but my homeboy knows ya
Back on up
I'm from the West and I'm throwing it up
Blowing up like see-4, dynamite, or black powder
When you come to me it'll be your last hour
Girl how about a trick with your man
Serve my dogs and then get the fuck out
Far out's where we go, a place you don't know
A spot where motherfuckers be taking your hoe
Oh no, how many times did it happen
I don't know but your bitch loves cacking

There's one more thing
About your bitch and the shit that she brings
Tongue rings, G-strings and lingere
Alize, hennessy, indo smoke and bombay
All day slutty ways, the nerve of this bitch
Like my dog Kurupt said just swerve with this trick
Big thighs, pretty eyes, it shouldn't be no surprise
That your girl was a hoochie fucking so many guys
Spanish fly in her drink, got her thinking X-rated
I guess that's how they penetrated
And you hated, trust no man or bitch on this motherfucking planet

Take a choke it's time to ride tonight

Ain't nobody slipping, one of my boys got a weapon
I'm headed to the park, jeans swinging left to right
Feeling alright, keep my dogs all in sight

And it's barely the beginning
Hot women spending big faces for hours
Drinking White Russians and Mintory Sours
Leaning like the tower, bent to the limit
Take another shot for the block, homey clear it

Hoes want to do me, foes want to do me in
Now what am I to do
On the streets with the war, and shit you ain't known
Now what am I to do
I keep breaking the laws, stay rugged and raw uhh
Now what am I to do
If I come to jack him then I'm gonna jack you too

[Mr. Shadow]
What am I to do uhh check it out

This is for my riders who be moving things
Out of state with a full crate doing it big, fooling the pigs
Who's in the mix and who's not
You can tell by the way a fool talks and walks
Around the clock, it's never to late to clock
The longer you stay on the block, the bigger the knot
We plot schemes that turn dreams into real life
Handle our business and do the shit right
Now what am I to do, yeah
The streets are loyal so I gotta stay true
Paid dues and the game will pay you, that's real
Don't try to act sick, you'll sit down for your last meal
The battle field is made out for real soldiers
Bald motherfuckers with stripes on they shoulders
Nothing can hold us now, we full throttle
Money talks, bullshit walks, that's the motto

Kickin' up dust, we kickin' up dirt
Your picking up ounces, we pickin' up birds
Under no circumstance do anything piety
Why risk your ass trying to cop a quick twenty
Every motherfucker I work with is major
Nobody menos, nobody can break us
Move makers, from Diego to Vegas
Real players with the name you can't blame us
Haters can't stand the next man doing better
First you gotta master the skill to make cheddar
Faster than the average when it comes to stacking cabbage
It ain't a hobby motherfucker it's a habit
I have it in my blood (what) to taste lute
And take fruit to the cranium harder than titanium
It's like a stadium we all play in it
Some of you lose and most of us come out winnin'

[Chorus]

If you all about banging, making others hate you
They hate you cause you doing it right, plain and simple
Sicko ass fools with tattoos, on the free way
In Sunny Southern Cali, CA is where we play
Gangs, ten steps ahead of these lames
Shipping out full crates from the state where it never rains
Don't complain or take two to the brain
I'll drag your body like the foot drags a ball on the chain
You say nothin' when they ask you somethin'
You get the run in or get done in when I'm dumpin'
13 rounds that's the sound, then you hit the ground
You ain't safe or sound when I'm around
Now everybody listen, stop, look
Lie straight or get booked by this Southside crook
Yeah, I leave em shooked in the state of shock
Don't get caught on my block with no strap and your pants drop

And the hoe want to ride it

I'm so excited got your bitch on my dick
And the hoe want to ride it

I remember when I met you
I knew I had to sweat you
Had me all erected so how could I neglect it
Seen you around meant your man was in the county
Set to serve a bid now I'm headin to where you live
I got me a posse forget you or not
Maybe we could talk and exchange our iner thoughts
Knowin one another but keep it undercover
I got to keep a secret if I want to be your lover
Now keep it on the down low, nobody knows
Sippin on my beer as you're whisperin in my ear
Tellin me your real and that you want to feel
Like you would ever leave me, descive me, believe me
Never have I trusted a women that I lusted
Now were always screwin and nobody could ruin it
that's what you told me, when you would hold
Now I hold a grudge from the colors that you show me

I got scopes that are deadly like strokes when I roll by
Everybody sayin hi, I'm not knowin why
All up in the mix and still triple sixen
I brag when I sag with a bag full of trixes
Stay away from the rain when it falls
The baddest of them all hit it up on your walls
Kinda like Ruch Banis I got the fame
I'm young and bad and I'ma blow up like his plane
It gets kinda a critical when I get lyrical
Words that I speak got your fiendin like tweak
Show em no pity down to the grity
Kinda like when Jesus got jumped by a whole city
It gets scary so watch who you marry
She might be the first one to laugh when you're buried
Take you for your goods all alone in the woods
Sufferin lonely what about your homies
Everybodies fake so watch who you trust
The girl that you love is the girl that I lust
Watch as I take her, show you she's a faka
Go ahead baby shake your money maker

I creep and I crawl
I shoot and make em fall
I'm posted on your walls
Now who you gonna call
It's me and my dawg through the fog breakin laws
2 bald headed thugs with the slugs for the cause
Pause, hold up, wait up, and give me an minute
Remember it was you and only you all up in it
But all of a sudden, your mind went through changes [changes]
Never talk to strangers [strangers]
You should of told her, beggin me to hold her
Look over your shoulder Hi it's me
And all because of a rap got a knife in your back
You're crazy for life now she's gonna be your wife
Now ain't that a shame when she calls out my name [Shadow]
So how do you feel, are you fake or ya real
So why don't you come and face me
You lick her and you taste me
And even though you hate me
I'm knownin that you praise me",Excited,2002

Can you tell us what kind of rumors have you murder sense the release of that album
And some of the things you been through

[Verse One: Lil' Rob]
Well let me put it like this
All this fools talkin' shit all the time 
I was 16 wit the bullet representin' the 6-1-9
But this fools couldn't take it, they didn't want me to make it
And so they rather hate it because they just can't fade it
Gang related, situated, now I'm back
This putos talkin' smack but I kind of like that 
In a way, in one day, I might say that the ones who helped me do this 
Had it any other time and I knew this I'm still foolish fools are clueless
To what I can do wit my ability thought of myself as a cholo not a real MC
And so I did what I did, I'm so glad that I did it 
Because it put some chips in my pocket when I finished
Using words like Homes, Simon, and Leba
People try to put me down but end floatin' on the river
See I told you twice before but I'll say it one more time
You do your thing Homes but I'm gonna do mine

[Chorus: x2]
Look at all this rumors
Started by jealous people

[Lil' Rob]
And basically that's what I think 
All this fuckin' fools can talk all the fuckin shit they want about me 
Cause I can give a fuck you know what I mean 
It proves that I'm above their level, You Know

[Steve Austin]
So Shadow we understand you havin' similar problem as those of Lil' Robs
Is ther anythin' that you would like to say 
To them Player Haters and if so what would it be

[Verse Two: Mr. Shadow]
Man I gotta give it up to the punks tryin' to diss me 
Talkin' mad shit 'cause they miss me 
Reminisce me because they use to talk head about my rhymes
And when they heard me in the radio they requested till I die and I must admit
That I love you yappin' lips 
Cause it makes me ride my rolas amd my music stacks my chips
Mr. Shadow the crazy vato that fools want to battle 
When they end up undergravel when they act like who's in tattle 
Now Why would you want part of this truthfulness
Don't get caught up in the mess 
Cause I hate them phony putos dippin' all up in my business ese 
Got hate straight for all the fools that player hate
Cause ain't no punk chavala stoppin' me from makin' bake
I don't need to take it to make it like claus I brake it unfaded
I be remainin' like say it I'm servin' hate to those perpetrated it 

[Chorus 2X]
[Mr. Shadow over Chorus]
Yeah, that's pretty much how I feel
Gotta tell them haters that ah
You can only witness what you see not the things you hear
Remember that

[Steve Austin]
Sense we're talkin' about rumors
I heard that Lil' Rob and Shadow weren't always the best of friends
So Shadow can you clear that up for us and tell us what's really goin' on

[Verse Three: Mr. Shadow]
Simon, we had some problems like a dose we had to squash it
We're from the Mayhem Click (Why?)
Cause everybody wants it
The baddest mother fuckers now together no one is ever gonna 
Intimidate us, just imitate us player haters 
Don't bother analyzin' anythin' we do 
Cause the shit we kick is tight and you know that this is true
Mr. Shadow and Lil' Rob makin' heads bob and it don't stop 
Cause we're about to keep on flowin' 'til you see our caskets drop

[Verse Four: Lil' Rob]
It's the one lil' cholo, back before I go
Just thought that I let you know that you can never stop my flow
So I suggest you put that shit to rest, quit talkin' all the mess
You're talkin' about the best and you're just wastin' your breath
As sit here, thinkin' neva thought it would be you
The city that I represent talkin' all that shit
Because all we do is kick it and mind our own business
Lil' Rob and Mr. Shadow scratchin' fools off the bitch list

[Chorus: x4]

[Mr. Shadow]
So now you know where we're comin' from
And wit that it concludes the story for today
I hope you mother fuckers learned your lesson
And learn how to keep your fuckin' trap shut
And quit spreadin' rumors that ain't true
Cause that shit be gettin' mother fuckers in trouble 
And believe me, you don't want part of that 
You don't want none of this The Mayhem Click
And we're out",Rumors,2003

Oh, here motherfucker, since you wanna go fetch
On my worst day, you couldn't fuck with me at your best

Probably cause you know I break a bitch and I'm about to blow up
Now it's hoe season
Motherfuckin' so why bitch
That you hatin' and contemplatin' on a real pimp for no apparent reason
That I beat the situation and I'm hot
Recognized that you hatin', cause I got them trick waitin'

Oh, you fuckin' with a pimp
And you will get slapped

And make you tell 'em other players what I did to you

I had a bad ass bitch with a caramel tone
So I put my back in my bone, and mack in my tone
Told her, ""Shut the fuck up, "" and sit in the back of the broom
Snatch my cheese up quick and kick the back with a shroom

'Cause we don't love them hoes and
A bitch ain't worth a shit with no gold
So I hit the club to cop more
Y'all know
It's Suga Free and 40 Glocc in Dego
With Mr. Shadow all the way from Colton to Seattle
And back to Pomona
Hoes to promote the corner
Hit me on my two-way Motorola
I got a whole lot of soldiers that love to throw boulders
It's all over, test the faith and bleed slower
The heat Blaze Just that fast, give me Hovah
I want the cash and the ice and the keys to the Rover
Tricky gotta kick cheese to meet, nigga, to ball, blow up
Biotch

I said, ""She's A Hoe
Her friend's a hoe""
If you ain't about trickin', then your ass gotta go
From the open toe pumps to the way that you move
I'm a show you how a ese from the S.D. do
Straight act a fool, got you making me loot
Got you standing on the corner and that ass look cute
And you know when the fuck I'm comin' 'round the block
With the homey So G, Suga Free and 40 Glocc
It don't stop, we stay pimpin'
Bitch, why you trippin'
Don't hate the playa, hate the game
You damn chicken
Stickin', no lickin'
That's the motto
And boy, the life I life
Is hard to swallow
Make your shit hollow, real quick, don't try to follow

Drinking White Russians and Mintory Sours
Leaning like the tower, bent to the limit

We'll be strapped down with guns, got gats in each hand
And I'll do you like Godzilla did to fucking Japan
So embrace a motherfucker like I was a god
And you can meet me in the back and we'll be taking a shot
Breaking em off a little something, man you know how we do it

See the thing about you, that caught my eye, 
Is the same thing that makes me change, my mind. 
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try. 
You need to sit down, this may take a while. 
You see this girl she sorta looks, just like you. 
She even smiles, just the way you do. 
So innocent, she seemed, but I was schooled 
I'm reminded when I look at you, but, 

You remind of a girl, that I once knew. 
See her face whenever I, I look at you. 
You won't believe all of the things that she put me through. 
This is why I just can't get with you. 

Thought that she was the one for me, 
Til I found out she was on her dream, 
Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me. 
This is why we could never be.

This is why I just can't get with you. 

I know it's so unfair to you, 
But I'd be lingering the rest to you, 
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two

How can you sleep in these troubled times

Ey yo, fuck it. I guess I can't so I stand
Up on my feet and try to relax drinking cans
Of? that's like drinking can-
Cer in a container, but fuck it. What isn't?
You're already dying if your living
And I'm sinning, but I'm asking no one for forgiveness
Because the people running the church is a crooked politician
So I'm tripping, but not psychedelic more like psychotic
Because I'm sick of these psycho bitches in my pockets
What are my options other than to just sit and just watch it?
Have them take action and try to stop this, nonsense, 
Crying alert and trying to feed, never thought I'd wake up to see
The mark of the beast, but I did now how can I sleep
I can't even dream without even?
To help with keep up with the conscience
And by that I mean awake, 
Cause now I'm feeling that sleeping was my biggest mistake
But I don't know

How can you sleep in these troubled times ( I wanna
Sleep but I don't wanna let my guard down)
How can you sleep in these troubled times (I can't
Sleep my gears are grinding too hard now)
How can you sleep in these troubled times (I never
Sleep more than four hours at a time now)
How can you sleep in these troubled times ( I don't
Even wanna lie down, because if I do then lights out)

Super insomniac rolling up comiac? Blunts in a Pontiac
Like pardon me, honey, but where is your mommy at
Fighting for innocence. Trying to be militant
Even though at times I'm high and belligerent
Lighting a cigarette, not with tobacco in it
But don't start acting strange and stuff
These ingredients ain't as dangerous as angel dust
I promise you I've never been violent or psychotic, 
Dude but at times I just might forget who I was talking to
But that's the worst of it. At least I know what my
Purpose is I never swerve it? If it was legalized I would purchase it
Or perhaps that's the deprivation and later when I awaken
I can meditate over my statements, but fuck it
You need to know this. Every song recorded
Should reflect a moment in the life of the person that wrote it
As well as the personality of those that support it
And if you disagree, may the cousin of death leave you slaughtered

How can you sleep in these troubled times ( I wanna
Sleep but I don't wanna let my guard down)
How can you sleep in these troubled times (I can't
Sleep my gears are grinding too hard now)
How can you sleep in these troubled times (I never
Sleep more than four hours at a time now)

Who can you turn to? (when you're fucked up and uh)
Who can you turn to? (when you're feeling stuck and ya)
Who can you turn to? (feel like everything sucks. Tell me)
Who can you turn to? (when you're feeling stressed and uh)
Who can you turn to? (when you're in a mess and ya keep hearing)
Peace and love are the only keys to gladness

Yeah that's what they say to me

Walking with broken two wings
Adapting, while time keeps changing degrees rapidly
You can tell by cracks in the streets
Because it's aging, but see
But amazingly not one agency
Has concerns for saving things
Except for maybe me and my people
Who stay with me fighting courageously
Haters who sleep major, but can't take it from me
Because I never sleep",I Can't Sleep,

I see you sippin' on Crissy, 'bout to get pissy
Heading back to the hizzy with my izzy
Girl I like the way you shake your hips
I love it when you lick your lips
Talking in my niggas 'cause we sexy with cash
'cause a Bentley and a six is a thing of the past

(I know) what we came here to do
Give me the number, I'll holla later on if it's cool
(And I know) looking kinda right tonight
Then I'm hoping to get a hit tonight

Yo, mama, do you want it?
Yo, mama you crucial
Your body rankin', can you imagine what I'm thinkin'
You been nominated 'cause you such a situation
Many situations you can get handcuffed and done drivin'
Tied up and cut, garage hit, whatchu know about it
'cause you look scrumptious, something the mic with a touch
Fly, I'll mess up your head a little
Ma, you critical, way back
Believe you broke your boy neck when you stepped in
In them tight shorts, you made the games begin
(It's all about ten)
But wait, listen, it ain't like that
Lil' mama you crucial and I'm just tryna get with that
But nah, I was thinkin', we could least hook up and trade numbers
And sexy lil' conversation with a nigga
Lil' mama, you crucial and I do something to ya
Let's connect and do what grownups like to do
Don't fight it boo, 'cause you too cute to act ugly
You should at least try to hug me
Or better yet love me
You make the situation bubbly

Mr. Tibbs,"[Intro: Tim Westwood (Mr. Tibbs) {Skinnyman ]

Yo this is Westwood

I'm at Radio 1 just doin' my thing tonight

And just walked into this studio some of the hottest UK cats out there


My man Skinnyman {Woah, woah, Blade 
And Mr. Tibbs what's the deal? What you got for me?

{Yeah we got ya the new banger Tim straight from RZA

Straight from the Wu-Tang





(Yeah representin' live all my UK hip hop heads in the North Side, el tarno)

Down it's gonna bang in ya face, lets go



[Skinnyman (RZA)]

Regardless, I'll be here bringin' it heartless

Ruthless, to the death I'll stand for the truth yes

My God given talent is all that I can do best

Keep spittin' over these tracks and leavin' you blessed

So who requested my time on the set

Skinnyman's what you get, so you ain't really hearin' nuttin' yet

Ya best upthreat 'cause it gets better yet
I'm that deft intellect, them boy they don't pent


So who requested Wu-Tang on the set (it's the RZA)

What you get so you ain't really hearin' nuttin' yet

We'll never let anybody else step

Or ever come with anything less for what you'd expect

If you pass me the mic then I'll gladly accept

I'll take it to the street, show you how rough it can get

'cause everybody knows this rappin' thing isn't happenin'

Now they jack it in and go back to shottin' crack again

Locked down the block and get strapped with the gat again

Then we break it down then just deal with the matter then

So how you'd think a British ghetto youth feels

He can't get a record deal but he can get drugs to deal

He can't get a job but he can go for rob and steel

Lookin' for a mill' while you screamin' ""keep it real!""

So I'll just stand here with this mic that I hold

Request the higher force to sweep over my soul

So I can fulfill my dream, go for my goals

I'm sick of spendin' every late night out of role



[Chorus: RZA]
Skinnyman make the party Boing, bza Boing, Boing


Blade make the party bza Boing, Boing

Mr. Tibbs he makes the party Boing, Boing

Bob Digi makes the party Boing, Boing

Skinnyman make the party Boing, bza Boing, Boing

Blade makes the party bza Boing, Boing



[Blade]

Calm but still merciless, rugged on impact

Explosive, leavin' nuttin' but rubber with a spinback
Snap a photo with your camera, capture the stamina


Hand it to a amateur, show him how to damage a
Live set, make him feel the full effect


And yet still make it hard to detect and what's left?

Four men remain standin' like Gladiators

When the dusk clears nuttin' for the average ears

For years its been the same with minds of the artillery

God forgave us all for the merciless delivery

Holdin' the tools of the trade with a death grip

Rememberin' the times when nothin' was right, we was desperate

Dreams blown to smithereens, turned into nightmares with screams

There's a world of CREAM
If all goes correct we can stash supreme


Feed the fiend 'cause that's the way it was meant to have been
You should of seen the comin', the language is universal


One time perfect attack with no rehearsal

Shook the Earth for what it's worth

You're in danger of a takeover, and it's analysed as global

We can find them whatever your predictions

Enterin' the realm unknown with no restricitons

It might be hard to believe
We invade, we conquer and lead




[Chorus: RZA]

Skinnyman make the party Boing, bza Boing, Boing


Blade make the party bza Boing, Boing
Mr. Tibbs he makes the party Boing, Boing

Bob Digi makes the party Boing, Boing



[Mr. Tibbs]

I'm a country man at heart but a city man by nature

'cause even though it's fuck free, it's all about the paper

I love to live expensive, smoke like I'm in Jamiaca

Even when I'm broke I think I'm like but a creater

Avoids the green, even from my early teens

???????? in need of CREAM seen (seen)


But then I had a dream 'bout bein' the best rapper
But that ain't what it seems, next chapter

That's spreadin' the word

Inspiration from the hurb is what you hear when I got heard

I sat back and observed most of the men that shined before me

All that respect, keeper know 'nough of them will bore me

Singin' the same story, I'm better than you

And to tell you the truth most of them men are shut fools

We asked them in the struggle to make ends meet

That's why I told these MCs that talk is cheap

You might think you know Tibbs, you don't know me

Unless you walk my streets and talk to my peeps



[Chorus: RZA]


Bob Digi makes the party Boing, Boing
Skinnyman make the party Boing, bza Boing, Boing



[RZA]

With your high pitched face like eye liner

If the black gat bust you get struck by the side winder

You can't block and stop it when I spotted

I shoot like Luke Skywalker inside the cockpit
Aimin' at the top fighter


Who I mighta have thirty thousand kids spark the lighter


And set flames to the sky, we aim high
The baseline kick like the kid from Shang-Hi

Make your bubble bust, cuddle up from the rubble thrust

You'se will have the double juice duck, then I doubled up

To the double four, puddles pour from ya bum bot

Open swords can't be cured by the blood clot
Ya bum bastards, son I come classic

Frame won't last the length of my matchstick


Drunk off the Hennessey V.S. stop the B.S.

I'm still off to catch the CREAM like P.S.

Jake was makin' that green
People always say what the hell does that mean




[Chorus: RZA]

With Skinny man he makes the party Boing, Boing

Bob Digi makes the party Boing, Boing

Mr. Tibbs he makes the party Boing, Boing

Bza Blade he makes the party Boing, Boing

Mr. Toi,"Wilin' in the club smoking hash with my niggas 
? liquor put my mack on a strippa 
But she gasped on a a nigga flashed me her figure 
Ready to take this bitch in the bathroom and hit her 
This other nigga stepped up tryin' to rap on a nigga 
Tryin' to battle spittin' bull trash through a nigga 
Must have been blazed off the sacks we deliver 
'Cause my rhymes on the scale be the last on the rhicter 
This nigga had ice, I'm about to jack like the ripper 
I chill 'cause I'm still tryin' to get ass from the stripper 
Bust up in a mickey from the glass that I slipped her 
'Cause the bitch blacked out and made a dash at the nigga 
I held it down then I laughed at the nigga 
He came back throwin' arms fast like a pitcher 
Then I put it on this nigga like a blast from the trigger 
Took all the ice and cash from the nigga 

[Chorus: x4]
Put it on a nigga 
Put it on a nigga 
Put it on Put it on and shitted on a nigga 

Fuck the glitter, I'm bigga, so why you frontin' on a nigga 
Only time you know a nigga is when you smokin' wit' a nigga 
I be rappin' east and westin so not a question who got the blessin'
Buddah, while niggas be smokin' my shit like Smiff & Wesson 
We put it on a nigga, it's the supreme shot liquor 
Up in cheetas with your sister about to put it on a nigga 
Smoke it out with the mixture then get caught up in a figure 
 
It be Mr. Green layin more dick than Dirt Digler 
Make figures, shine bright like God over niggas 
I wake up every morning smoke an el wit niggas 
With the hydraploric mixture 
Do a one hit and quiter 
You can be the size of Big Pun my herb will lift ya 
The power ? used to hit my babysitter 
I put it on a sister with my dick just past my zipper 
I was 5 when I did her 
And I'm live when I hit ya 
The funk funk shitter to put it on motherfuckers 

[Chorus: x4]

Shit what, as I flip what, on a nigga 
Niggas better pay me for my verse on my ?spilla? 
The pimpa it's miss teasy and you the ? 
But if your dick is short than I'm about to call Godzilla 
Platinum realeses and new realses sellin'' my name bigger 
Channel live checkin for ? day my niggas 
This ? and we can negotiate the figures 
And possible I'll go with the feat 
If it's the realer and dealer and causin casualties from niggas 
And my brigade is gonna ride and pistol whip these niggas 
And if you got any questions I'm to a sister 
And yes my name is Miss Toi so don't try and play wit her 
From coast to coast you know I'm gonna ride to check the ?milla? 
And in the year 2g's be ready for the superheroes 
I soacialize and get paid then I can work wit ya 
But I put on, shit it on, spit it on niggas

Mr. Toma,"Refrain
Je chante pour ne pas oublier
Je chante aussi pour supporter
Les peines, les larmes que je croise
Le temps qui marque les visages
Les larmes dans les yeux des autres j'aimerais les sécher.
Moi je passe mon temps à combattre le vent
Pour ne pas changer de direction
Si bien souvent, je sais ce qui m'attend
Une route chargée de victoires
Et de déceptions
Mais je tape dedans
Toujours droit devant, même s'ils veulent m'empêcher de tourner en rond
Depuis trop longtemps moi je serre les dents
Trop de baltringues, trop de bouffons
Trop de stars en carton
Ici tu dois trouver ta place
Tout faire pour que jamais ils ne t'effacent
J'bouge travaille, transpire et me déplace
Pour pas m'retrouver coincée dans un sas
J'fais ma musique pèpère, j'esquive les crasses
Dans ce biz ne me dit pas qu't'es efficace
J'aime pas quand ils pissent là ou je passe
Dans ce couloir on marche tous la tête basse
J'veux pas m'fondre dans la masse
Donne moi un micro pour qu'j'travaille
Pour qu'ils n'oublient pas ma face
Leur fashion me dépasse le micro mon arme fatale mes lyrics, mon famasse
J'aime quand la basse frappe qu'elle te tabasse
Etre sur scène, voir que des foules s'amassent
Bien longtemps que j'ai fait mes classes
J'livre bataille, j'ai semé mes grains et maintenant je les ramasse.
On ne court pas après les mêmes choses
C'est toujours les mêmes qu'ils exposent
Prêts à accepter tout ce qu'on leur impose
Si c'est pas pour faire rentrer les bifftons que le mic je l'explose

All money ain't good money, this i know
But i still love hood money, it gets my dough
And as a youngster, that nigga went through so much church
That still turned out fucked up, i did so much dirt
Told to bang the neighbourhood, i put in so much work
Did a whole lot of time, caused mom so much hurt
On everythang, that boy wasn't done on purpose
Who knew that all my darkness was really gon' surface
I was stuck on that bullshit jus runnin' the streets
Without some type of beef, the week wasn't complete
Its like a nigga felt better after dumpin this heat
On feet, just to see the body slumped in the seat
Its like a whole 'nother rush to me, bussin' was sweet
Now im smarter, im all about something to eat
Im on the road spend 30 days a month in the suite
But im still gon' hustle and cheat, Lets Go Now!

That's why i bring the Benz out to impress him (yeah)
Caught in my zone, all alone, homes rattlin' my bones
Cuz he yappin' off his lips and if i hit him i be wrong
Cuz he ain't never gon' be shit, i done work so hard
But i will make you a corn of the cob, you be performin for God
Either that or rob you on your boulevard
Bet you never thought for a second niggas would pull your cards
I don't know about y'all star, cuz my nigga gone
H.P tatted on me so his memory lives on
Engagin in drama without your llama
There'll be funeral arrangements for your momma
I learnd that when i was in pajamas watchin Micheal and Madonna
Now i got the appetite of a piranna, nigga

When nobody knows all the walls you go through
You can't even talk to those that supposedly know you
Some of the levels that these people'll go to, for crumbs
Damn tell me, is this what that dough do?
That's when you find yourself talkin to Pro Two
There's not to many people who ever can walk in Loc shoes
Its good as hell that my heart contains
I explain, so many different parts of pain
Im clean, but still some marks remain
From the past, when that crushed weed sparks to brang
The cash made some people start to change
I feel hate when i pulled up and parked the range
Ya damn right i got rich, but my heart the same
And practice makes perfect with the harder aim
You ain't really got the heart to bang
You ain't start to hang, till you find out I cought the chain..

Mr. Tru,"[Verse 1: Trina]
Icy blue rocks on my arm I shop at Malone for Louie Vinton
The diamond diva miss Cinderella, Versace gown by Donna Tella
And can't none of these hoes out floss me
Gator boots by Sergio Rossi
Ms. Trina I got to splurge, 58 frame baby watch the curves
Walk in the club don't waste no time
Hit the bar up two cases of wine
Cute face thin waste line
Drop to the beat pop to the base line
To all my girls that's kickin it
You got Chris in yo glass and you sippin it
You bout money and you gettin it
We tight that's right. Uh

[Chorus]
(Hey) This how we do!
(Hooo) why'all can't deny
(Hey) This how we do (whoa)
I'm the baddest far from the average (Hey)
Diamond Princess (whoa)
Ghetto F-a-be	 (hey)
This how we do (whoa)

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
I like my ladies off the glass like shotin off the back board
Sexiest mommies beautiful as black broads
Cutest rude girl, thick as Caucasian
Pretty as conversions, slick as malatians
Ask them let them bitches say yes sir
Young and live among riches in West Jerve
Switch in the excurve
Strut through this bitch in the best furs
Bitch in a Lex Jerse
Twin gray crosses (bling) I'm the might cone
Brightly chrome vendaidoes
Cover your girl face
From the Bruce Lee Roy glow
On a mother a pearl face
All I do is say one word
why'all say it's foolish
I send splurge
I'm a lose 1/3
I never go broke my name got to o's
F-A-be	-O-L-O-you-S

[Chorus: x 2]

[Verse 3: Trina]
Nice lips, nice thighs, nice hips
Pussy tighter then a pair of vice grips
I don't pay niggas, niggas pay me
(I'm a hustler baby) like Jay-Z
It's the diamond princess million dollar mistress
From the M-I home of the stop bitches
Christal, and caviar bitches, twist this game for all you fly bitches
I Spit nuttin but the hot shit, you got the four dot get the four dot six
Maybe than you can ride with a hot bitch
VS from the anklet to the wrist
I been in the game just two years
End a few careers there it is
But now I'm back on top again
With some red hot shit for you can cop again (Yeah)

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs

So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed 

When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty knives in the club
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they want to show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they want to fuck 
But homie ain't nothing change hold down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that nigga roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying ""50 you hot""
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend want to get bi and they ready to go

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs 
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love 
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed

So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed 

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things 
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look, nigga, I came up and I ain't changed

And you should love it, way more then you hate it
Nigga you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that fagot ass nigga trying to pull me back right?
When my junk get to pumping in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
If the niggas hate then let 'em hate 
Watch the money pile up
Or we go upside there wit a bottle of bub
You know where we fucking be

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs 
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love

Lose ya self there, whether you believe it or don't

Walk through the crowd wid all intentions I'm leavin' wid hoes
Seems like a nice way of livin', the stressful have
Cause all them jealous cats, ready to test your ass
Let's not take it there, I remain cool
Learnt how to handle them situations in grade school

From New York to London, when crews talk amongst us
it's nothin' but good things
Not only the bad stuff is what the hood brings
Listen, cats is salivatin' plottin' on eatin' ya meal
The four fives carried in our dome keep it concealed

Disregardin' where we grow from we teamin' up still

Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Now I’m on another one it’s a night flight
When they say I’m a star I say thank you
It’s all due to the scenes that I ran through
So I keep flyin the flags for all people
No messing about we’re all equal
Vibe alive in the club when I roll in
I get around with the crowd when I’m roaming

Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me

They should know I bring vibes on a club night
Keep the crowd hyped up brother party
Red, she wanna say words in my earlobe
Reminds me there’s an hour of the party left
See the fireworks, celebration, team winning the Grey Goose amazing
Send them Jaeger bombs I got a craving
So many women I don’t wanna stop raving
They should know I got tunes for the gyal dem
Once the ladies are there see the man dem reach
They wanna leave there with a number
Check the peng ting she’s gonna hang with me
I’m skanking all round the party I’m skanking
I got girls to the left and girls to the right

He said get my passport told me to come through
Put your sun cream in your suitcase
When I arrive causing a heat wave too
Got my SnapBack and my vest on
Looking at the hot girl with the red dress on
Light skin with a beautiful body like Kim
So I had to get my Kanye West on
She told me she’s feeling my jewellery
She said that she’s in love with my Jesus piece
I told her to look again closely
It’s not Jesus baby it’s JME
And I was like babe come over
I don’t bite girl come a little closer
Come a little closer
I don’t bite girl come a little closer

You know I don’t usually party
But Skepta and Wiley said its a hype
I can’t find my phone or my car keys
Like Zippy Tafari said on the mic
The vibe is off the richter
And I can’t even tweet a picture
I’m on the dance floor the joke is
I never had a drink but I’m acting the drunkest
She’s staring like I’m a weirdo
Or then again maybe she likes me
I’m not supposed to be here though
Haven’t got a wrist band for the VIP
No triple A pass but I’m partying with the stars
Yep, I can’t complain I just enjoy while it lasts

Creatures seem to scream and fade 
Shadows bleed and the locks will break
Questions we could never solve
As answers in darkness evolve

Have I only seen what I want to see

Boy with a broken soul
Heart with a gaping hole
Dark twisted fantasy turned to reality
Kissing death and losing my breath
Midnight hours cobble street passages
Forgotten savages, forgotten savages

Dig up her bones but leave the soul alone
Let her find a way to a better place
Broken dreams and silent screams
Empty churches with soulless curses
We found a way to escape the day

Dig up her bones but leave the soul alone
Lost in the pages of self made cages
Life slips away and the ghosts come to play
These are hard times
These are hard times for dreamers
And love lost believers

Let her find a way to a better place
Broken dreams and silent screams

Marinate in misery
Like a girl of only seventeen

And the romance of sadness
Beautiful dance that happened by chance
Happened by chance, happened by chance

See the fireworks, celebration, team winning the Grey Goose amazing
Send them Jaeger bombs I got a craving
So many women I don’t wanna stop raving
They should know I got tunes for the gyal dem
Once the ladies are there see the man dem reach
They wanna leave there with a number
Check the peng ting she’s gonna hang with me

She told me she’s feeling my jewellery
She said that she’s in love with my Jesus piece
I told her to look again closely
It’s not Jesus baby it’s JME
And I was like babe come over
I don’t bite girl come a little closer
Come a little closer
I don’t bite girl come a little closer

Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayaya ayaya ayaya ayaya

You know I don’t usually party
But Skepta and Wiley said its a hype
I can’t find my phone or my car keys
Like Zippy Tafari said on the mic
The vibe is off the richter
And I can’t even tweet a picture
I’m on the dance floor the joke is
I never had a drink but I’m acting the drunkest
She’s staring like I’m a weirdo
Or then again maybe she likes me
I’m not supposed to be here though
Haven’t got a wrist band for the VIP
No triple A pass but I’m partying with the stars
Yep, I can’t complain I just enjoy while it lasts

Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayaya ayaya ayaya ayaya
Everybody right now can you hear me
Through the speakers turn me up if you hear me
Ayaya ayaya ayaya ayaya",Can You Hear Me? (Ayayaya),2012

Reload reload re reload the music
Just throw those hands up, show them you don't care
I want you to reload reload re reload the music
Reload reload re reload the music

Reload reload
Reload reload re reload the music

We just came to live some life
We roll out when we want
I be right inside the party
Jamming to my favorite songs
All the stars are on the ground right now
But that won't be for long
We go back up into the sky and shine
Put my high beam on
I'm liking the vibe she's on
Looking into my eyes
I might want to talk and take a walk
But I'm avoiding spies

They see me vibing with the blames
And ladies by my side
I see them with a smile like hi
Willing to chat my name on the sly
That's when I raise a glass up high
I want this moment for life
So DJ reload it says the host who's there on the mic
This game can be a good thing
Only if your future's bright
That plane can be a good thing
That's why I'm always on flights

Tonight's a moment, yeah it's going down
So why don't you reload reload re reload the music
Reload reload re reload the music
Shit might get crazy, hope that you ain't scared
I want you to reload reload re reload the music
Reload reload re reload the music

Yo, see I've been working all week
Man I could use a drink
Long as I'm with all my people
I don't care what club we hit
Wake up drunk like Ed Sheeran
Last night was perfect
I'm surprised I ain't dead
I took more shots than Curtis
All my freshers
That know I'm the freshest
It's first year you want a first
Tonight I'll pray you'll get it
You see I started rapping at fourteen
Met Wiley at one six
Household name in the game now
And I ain't ever touched one brick
So DJ's press play
Bottles up
It's toast time
The Roley's presidential like it's vote time
We taking shots
No free throw
This is down for that reload
Like oxide neutrino

We're gonna make the stars come out tonight
So why don't you reload reload re reload the music
Reload reload re reload the music

Just throw those hands up, show them you don't care

Went through all the things a teenage girl goes through
Hangin' out all night and breaking my curfew
When my daddy hit the door I gave my mumma the blues
Use 2 spend my time blazin' lazin' days away
Thought I was grown left home at 15 didn't wanna obey
Had 2 get my act together couldn't take the heat
And now I'm makin' beats 4 the streets

I'm Ms Dy-na-mi-tee
I stay blowin' up ur stereo
I'm just Ms Dy-na-mi-tee

C me bouncin' in da video
And I come 2 rock da show
I'm Ms Dy-na-mi-tee
Everybody loose control
Let my vibe 2uch ur soul

I remember all the house parties that took place
Bein' in my bed upstairs and we could still feel the base
And my cousins and my brothers we'd sit up all night
Listenin' 2 my family vibin' till the mornin' light
Remember my first years of school I was so innocent
I just wanted 2 learn I never been so content
But the more that I learned I found a guidin' light
That showed me the need 2 fight
And be

Let my vibe 2uch ur soul

At 13 I thought that I was in love with this guy
Anytime I caught his eye I thought that I'd just die
Remember playin' class clown I was just a disruptive fool
And the beatin' that I got first time suspended from school
Remember Sunday School and after go 2 grammas 4 lunch
Macaroni, rice and peas, chicken and pineapple punch
Never had much my mum brother sister and me
But love was enough 2 succeed
2 grow

Ms. Dynamite,"[Verse One]
In my heart the sharpest pain
The darkest clouds up in my brain
Anger so immense and rage so deep
Each time he took one away from me
It's only now I see
They were angels too good to be
Here in this hell on earth and so he set them free
Only now I see, now I'm sure
I don't want no more brothers and sisters
Growing up in this cold world of war

[Chorus x2]
I ain't ready to die
But I ain't afraid to die
And go check my
Bro's and sisters on the other side

[Verse Two]
Everyday they still walk with me
Every night they still talk with me
They spirit deep in my soul
They oh so far but they closer than close
It's only now I see there's no more tears to shed
I done some crazy shit to ease all the mad confusion
And numbness in my head
Only now I see it's alright
Good hearts don't die
They just fly to be in peace
Beyond the sky

[Chorus x2]

[Breakdown]
Where there's no evil and no greed
No sign of war cause everybody's free
Where only joyful tears are cried
There's no pain
No tears
No lies
He'll free your soul
Free your mind
When it's your time
Your time

[Chorus x2]",Afraid 2 Fly,2002
Ms. Dynamite,"[Verse One]
When I'm with you I only feel completness
I can feel taste on my lips
It's so hard to conceal the weakness caused by your fingertips
If I told you just how deep my lovin' really goes for you
And that you got all my trust
If you knew tell me what would you do?

[Chorus]
All I ever want to do is love you
That's why I take the time to make it special
Night after night
Night after night
Everything I have is yours only yours
Bothing ever touched my soul like this before
Feels so right
Feels so right

[Verse Two]
Now if I told you that you're worth the world and all it's love to me
If I told you that I want to birth a family with you some day
If I told you that I want to grow old together what would you say?
If I was to let you know I want to see forever with you
Would you run away?

[Repeat Chorus]

If I told you I want to be your drive
Your strength and courage when your weak
I send my angels out every night to protect you from the street
If you knew I'd sacrifice almost everything to keep you happy
Would you let me love you for life
It's all I want It's all I need

[Repeat Chorus Till Fade]",All I Ever,2002
Ms. Dynamite,"So many girls I know,
Don't wanna let me go,
That is the reason why,
Me and you just flow.
It's like you make me glow.
As soon as i see you, child,
Yes, you drive me wild,
Wit' your ebony smile,
You are, you are, you are something special.

So Anyway u want it,
You know I'll always try,
And when you need it (Girl),
You know I will provide,
You know I love it (love it),
Havin' you by my side,
Let's stay together (Girl),

[Verse Two (Ms Dynamite):]

I never tasted such a sweet kiss,
And I never felt so much tenderness,
And he got me weak,
He's gone five minutes and I miss him,
I'm feelin' deep,
Baby sit down and listen.
Anytime that you ain't here you got me feenin',
For your love it feels so good it's like I'm dreamin'.
Just your touch has got my heart screamin',
It's crazy baby what ya got me feelin'.

So Anyway u want it,
You know I'll always try,
And when you need it (Boy),
You know I will provide,
You know I love it (love it),
Havin' you by my side,
Let's stay together (Boy),

[Verse Three (Keon Bryce And Ms Dynamite):]

I know something, 
I do see,
Baby you got that love I need.
you're the only one that can set me free,
Boy I'll love you eternally.
I don't need nobody baby,
I really want you to know I love you crazy.
I don't need nothin' besides,
Havin' you in my life.
",Anyway U Want It,2002
Ms. Dynamite,"When we were young life was so unjust
At times I felt it was just us
Mumma workin' hard 2 put food on the table
All on her own she sacrificed
Even when my sisters and brothers died
Somehow she stayed strong I never saw her cry
I was the oldest and responsibility
was so immense, the tension, we'd disagree
So I left cos at the time I felt she hated me
U told me to be strong
Told me 2 hang on hugged me tight
And said big sister it'll be alright

Brother I love ya
Little brother I thank god 4 you every day
Little brother I love ya
Little brother and I pray he'll never take u away

When my soul withered and I lived in the dark
An emptiness it filled my heart
U never stopped holdin' me up never stopped
tryin' 2 open me up
The days n nights I spent stressin'
The years I spent in depression this is my confession
thought bout endin' it sometime
But the second that u crossed my mind
I knew I could never leave u
Made me believe
U set me free
2 this day all I say and do I owe it all 2 u

Brother I love ya
Little brother I thank god 4 you every day
Little brother I love ya
Little brother and I pray he'll never take u away

Ooh I would lie 4 u, cry 4 u,
Ride or die 4 u,
Touch the sky 4 u,
If u ask me 2
Theres nothin' I won't do
I took this life 4 joke
I would drink and smoke
2 ease away the pain
And forget the memories in my brain
But u helped me 2 stop the rain
Oh brother brother

Brother I love ya
Little brother I thank god 4 you every day
Little brother I love ya
Little brother and I pray he'll never take u away

Thought I was grown left home at 15 didn't wanna obey
Had 2 get my act together couldn't take the heat
And now I'm makin' beats 4 the streets

I'm Ms Dy-na-mi-tee
I stay blowin' up ur stereo
I'm just Ms Dy-na-mi-tee
Everybody gotta hear me u
Hear me bussin' on da radio
Now feel my flow u get me through

And I come 2 rock da show
I'm Ms Dy-na-mi-tee
Everybody loose control
Let my vibe 2uch ur soul

I remember all the house parties that took place
Bein' in my bed upstairs and we could still feel the base
And my cousins and my brothers we'd sit up all night
Listenin' 2 my family vibin' till the mornin' light
Remember my first years of school I was so innocent
I just wanted 2 learn I never been so content
But the more that I learned I found a guidin' light
That showed me the need 2 fight
And be

And I come 2 rock da show
I'm Ms Dy-na-mi-tee
Everybody loose control
Let my vibe 2uch ur soul

At 13 I thought that I was in love with this guy
Anytime I caught his eye I thought that I'd just die
Remember playin' class clown I was just a disruptive fool
And the beatin' that I got first time suspended from school
Remember Sunday School and after go 2 grammas 4 lunch
Macaroni, rice and peas, chicken and pineapple punch
Never had much my mum brother sister and me
But love was enough 2 succeed
2 grow

I'm Ms Dy-na-mi-tee

I still feel you in my heart but I just can't stay
I ain't nobody's fool, I know just what I'm worth
I know what I want, What I need, What I feel that I deserve
You said you want to be someone
Said you want to get out the game
And I'm hearin' all your talk but I ain't seein' no change
You say you want to grow wit' me and uplift each others minds
But baby all you're showing me is you wasting your time

I just gotta let you know
I don't want nobody else
I just want to see you grow
But I can't help if you won't help yourself
I just gotta let you know
I don't want nobody else
I just gotta let you go
'cause I can't help if you want help yourself

I have always told you that I'm happy being second best
To your baby girl but I ain't havin' your baby mumma's stress

Her intent is obvious
And nigga the way you deal with her
You're fooling with my trust
Now boy it's really killing me
You don't have to say a word
I see the sorrow in your eyes
And in my soul I feel your hurt

Never have I seen him kiss or hug u
He don't make effort he don't respect u or accept u 4 u
Tells u what 2 wear and how 2 behave
Comes in ur home and treats u like his slave
Don't need him if he make u sacrifice
Ur freedom get him out ur life
Shout and curse at u in public places
Sleep in ur house on a part time basis
He aint even takin' care of his child he don't make u smile.

time that he raised his hand
Treat your home like hotel and don't pay his way
Lost count of the times that that dog has strayed
Sleep around creep around bring back disease
what if next time it was HIV
4 baby mummas, 8 kids and no work
U can play strong but I know that it hurt
U make the choices U gotta stop this 'cos

shits called neglect u hear
Sure she confused and tired of always seeing
mummas face bruised and drownin' in tears
Look what u showin' her by lettin' him disrespect u
U just growin' her to think that it's something

[Verse One (Kymani Marley):]
Yo,
Oh,
At first glance its like cupid hit,
Mesmorised by her thighs and her hips.
So, she went ahead and find a man wit' some chips,
And left school when she cop da whip.
Caught in the game,
Locked in the speedin' lane.
Livin a life for money, drugs and fame,
But true love is what she can't entertain.
And every chance she get she's given the blame.
Then she askin' why,
I told she was livin a lie.
When I told her she started to cry.
Don't just sit and let life pass you by,
And I slowly wiped the tears from her eyes.
[Chorus:]
I told her to take it slow,
Girl give it time to flow,
And from a seed to a flower you'll grow.
So many seeds on the street,
No sunshine but always heat.
And lives are lost at every heartbeat. 
I told her take it slow,
Girl give it time to flow,
And from a seed to a flower you'll grow.
So many seeds on the street,
No sunshine but always heat.
Drownin' in poverty and deceit,
But black roses grow from concrete.
[Verse Two (Ms Dynamite):]
He got a family to feed,
So every night he out on the street,
Shottin poison to young mothers and youths dem,
Coz he feel it the only way to keep his peeps on they feet,
Makes ends meet,
And gets his own up out of poverty.
Until one night,
He came home to find his mother cry,
she pointed to the floor and he saw a trail of his supply,
She led him to his room to find his brother on his bed,
Track marks, 
Needle in his arm and stone cold dead.
And suddenly, 
They all flashed before his eyes,
The kids that he sold to,
And they mothers cries. 
Every child is someones child 
You affa a mind what you do,
'cause Karma gunna bring the drama back on you.
Do what you gotta do,
But nigga when it comes to them youths,
There is no excuse,
Our future that,
We supposed to nurture that,
Nah lettin nuttin or nobody hurt that.
Do what you gotta do,
But nigga when it comes to them youths,
There is no excuse,

Nah lettin nuttin or nobody hurt that.

Twenty inch thighs make twenty inch, eyes
Hoping for American twenty inch, pies

Oh how I love these pretty ass, hoes
Pretty ass high class anything, goes
Catch 'em in the club throwing pretty ass 'bows

Any stank puss' make my long john, pause
Women on they cell making long john calls
And if they like to juggle, get long john's, balls

All my players in the house that can buy the bar
And the balling ass niggas wit the candy cars
If you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes
When you get on the flow (nigga throw them 'bows)
All my women in the house if you chasing cash
And you got some big titties wit a matching ass
With ya fly-ass boots or ya open toes

Hand me down drug dealers hand me down rocks
Hand me down a 50 pack Swisher Sweets box
And goodfella rich niggas hand me down stocks

Forty glock cal' keep your mouth on hold
Lie through your teeth you could find your mouth, cold
and rip out ya tongue cause of what ya mouth, told

Sweat from the hot sauce, sweat from the D
And you can sweat from a burn in the third degree
And if you sweat in your sleep then you sweat from me

Ms. Dynamite,"Spent 23 years trying to be what you wanted me to be
Though it seemed like you couldn't save me
Till I picked up the mic and I was on the TV
Now you're ringing off my phone like every week
Where were you at 6, 7, 11 and 13 when shit was impossible
Mama left nine months pregnant 
But she came home alone from the hospital

How could you call yourself a man if you can't 
love your only lesson can't contol them
You'd rather destroy their souls and she was 
13 years old and you couldn't protected the innocence from being stolen
And I don't give a damn what you was going through and mama wasn't able
To put food on the table
You left the family unstable
Now you come around and act like you were some kind of a praisel

You can't play like you daddy now
And you can't claim shit 'cause you weren't around
And you can't get mad but what can you do?
You can't tell me shit 
I'm grown without you

I spent 23 years trying to be the fucking man you should be
Taking care of your responsibility
Putting clothes on our back and shoes on our feet no help
But you always had your bag of weed
Where were you on 12,13, 14 and 15 when life was unliveable
Momma was so damn angry the way she treated me was unforgivable
You call yourself a man your oldest son he had to learn from his sister
How to put a niggas fist up, how to fuck a 
niggas shit up and I cut any motherfucker 
that had come and tried to diss us
And I don't give a damn what you was going through 
And I needed saving I spent my every second 
blazing a little girl with the blade in and 
trying to fuck up and take my life just wanted to dig my grave in

You can't play like you daddy now
And you can't claim shit 'cause you weren't around
And you can't get mad but what can you do? (now what you gonna do?)
You can't tell me shit I'm grown without you 

You can't play like you daddy now
And you can't claim shit 'cause you weren't around
And you can't get mad but what can you do?
You can't tell me shit 
I'm grown without you

Can't come and tryin' to tell me tonight",Father,2005
Ms. Dynamite,"How could you beat your woman till you see tears?
Got your children living in fear,
How you gonna wash the blood from your hands?
Selling debt to fiends
Barely fifteens
So you can have another option and rip off your dreams
Tell me..
How you gonna wash the blood from your hands?
You claim you're doing God's work
Greet the family with a smile
When all the while
You been raping that child
You a priest but you still can't
Wash the blood from your hands.
The self hate they create in your hair
Got you pickin' up their weapons
And leaving your brothers there,
Tell me..
How you gonna wash the blood from your hands?

[Chorus]
I wonder what you gon' do
When he comes for you
Where you gon' run
Once he calls for you
Where you gonna hide
The day he sends for you
And he questions you
I wonder what you gonna say
When that day comes
When judgement day comes

I'm talking bout the sins you commit
giving orders that permit,
Killing innocent kids so you can fill your pockets
Tell me how you gonna wash the blood from your hands?
Now take a look at these project buildings
They got us living in
It's like we're raised in prison cos of the colour of our skin
Now how you gonna wash the blood from your hands?
The pharmaceutical industry need to get paid
They're sitting on a cure
Watching new born babies die of AIDS
Tell me how you gonna wash the blood from your hands?
How could you keep exploiting third world children
Using them as underpaid slaves
So you can make your millions
How you gonna wash the blood from your hands?

[Repeat Chorus]

We sit and watch why people get hurt
Stand to say nothing while they do the devil's work
Walk straight by leave them crying in the dirt
What kind of people does that make me n you?
And we could have all the good intent
But we sitting in silence
We committing greed and violence
Then we got blood on our hands too

Ms. Dynamite,"I never wanted to fall in love
He took me from where I was comfortable
Skeptical still I gave my all
But he couldn't handle it
He was too insecure and immature
I was open, my heart got broken
I shoulda' known that it was gonna be this way
I let him in, now I'm burnin'
I wish that we never even met that day
Now let me tell you how the story goes
Sure you heard it all a million times before
I loved and lost and now I'm in pain
I ain't never gonna give my heart to love again

[Chorus]
When I fall in love
It will be forever
Coz I'll never ever
Fall in love again
When I fall in love
There will be no other
Only me and you
In this whole wide world

A lover that can sweet me, keep me on my toes 
A brother that can keep me from the cold 
Elevate my mind and stimulate my soul 
Love me much and he ain't afraid to let it show 
And help me grow and he's honest 
And a promise is a promise 
I can trust him completely, coz he keep his word 
Help me achieve things there every time I need him 
And he sacrifice, he always put me first 
Now let me tell you exactly what I want 
I know you heard it all a million times before 
Strong enough that he ain't causing me pain 
But that's what its gon' be if I ever fall in love again 

[Chorus]

Me nah really care 
For the way certain boy dem a flex 
The way dem bwoy 'a gwan jus'a get me vex 
The attitude, disrespect 
The games and the strain 
Got a good woman like me, never wanting to know love again 
Coz love has been pain, I'm at the end of my tether 
So if I fall in love again, its gotta be for ever 
I know you heard it all a million times before 
I ain't the first and sure as hell gonna be many more

When the chains that were once broken 
become an invisible burden for us to carry forever
If the wounds that turn to scars, grow bigger go deeper
you still feel pain would not go away would not wither
When the mirror that was broken is put back together
and then begins to scream your name, your name
When you realize decisions you have made are made
you cannot turn back time, you cannot change your fate
You have killed, you let her suffer
you make the world suffer, you let him down, you let God down
Oh you carry your own cross, and I too, I carry my cross, oh but yet

Razor blades to the rocks, even lied to the cops

Played your wifey and mother, cousin, sister and brother
Accountant lawyer and lover, I'm through dealin' wit suckers
Shuttin' and lockin' the door, bout to settle the score
You wastin' my time, nigga, but what about my nigga

All this money that he's spendin', you owe me everything

The other half is trashed, 'cause words could never kill me

They get loco, but you know I know the drilly

Yo, yo, yo, why you looking at me?
Why you looking at me?
Why you looking at me?
Why you looking at me? Come on; tell em Jade

	People look at me wrong 'cause I dress different
	Cos I talk different, 'cause I walk different
	People look at me wrong think I'm so different
	Wear my hair different, make the world listen

	People look at me wrong 'cause I dress different
	Cos I talk different, 'cause I walk different
	People look at me wrong think I'm so different
	Wear my hair different, make the world listen

People look at me wrong 'cause I
Hate women that want to be other women
Since they won I never fit in
I'm a rock the world with no games or gimmicks
Plan on winning ? limits
You hear it all in my sentence going
Shock up the world with something new and improved
Ain't stoppin I'm makin moves
No choices then I'm a choose
They can tell me to stop but it's obvious I'm gonna go
They say yes I say no you hear it all in my flow
This is young America steering you in your area, area
Do what I want and that's period
I get up and put on what I feel like putting on
When I don't blend in people look at me like something wrong
As if I'm crazy, strange, weird or throwed off
New chick driving fast in a old car
I'm still pimpin, still pimpin just tryna make a living
From the end to the beginning
It's a damn shame when you stick out thinking you insane
Rock everything from name brand to hand made
This is my life this is who I am I will not escape
Don't want a piece of the pie I just want a bigger plate
I'm just tryna live and watch how the plot thickens
Ain't no problem 'cause everybody's just a little different
Open your ears and eyes and make the world listen
Be an original individual is my mission

People is gon stare gon hate gon talk
But never will they expose what they doing in the dark
If you don't give a shit but you know you got it together, fuck it
They gotta put you down to make they-self feel better
Black or white, dark brown or light
Short, thin and small, thick, big or tall
And I think it's a mess we judged on how we dress
How many cars we got, how many bitches we pop
If a nigga got girls then he considered the pro
But if a girl got niggas then she considered the ho
And if a white person hang around blacks he a wigga
And if a black person hang around whites he a nigga
And if we try to make it out the ghetto we a sell-out
Pressure gets so deep at times I want to yell out
This shit is crazy it's time we take a stand
Focus on ourselves and stop worrying about the next man
It's your prerogative tight pants are sagging
Can't please em all with a hotter poppin of has-beens
It's just the world we live in that amaze me
People claim they real but most of them must feel gazy
Quick to judge when they so artificial
Shit it's obvious I guess people just got some issues
Counterfeit and crazy, so shady
What else can I say; I'm just a different kinda lady

	People look at me wrong 'cause I dress different

Jumpin and gettin it down, sweatin and workin it now
No question, gonna throw on them clothes tonight
So set them bows tonight, engines gon' hum on the bikes
No matter is he black, peurto rican or white

I got your dude lickin my toes and stuff
What wha wha wha what, light the chronic up!

You got beef with me? Then don't speak to me

You want to taste? Miss me like I'm Mase
You want to taste? Like me William H.

gettin nice at the bar, bang it loud in your car
I'm from the town, niggas gon' hold me down
Lost but now I'm found, watch me snatch the crown
I clear my throat, ladies spit what I wrote
takin off my coat, stuntin tryin to poke
We in the back, countin and peelin the stacks
combin and brushin the tracks--y'all can't hold me back

But Ima do exactly what them losers said I can't
Gotta stay on my toes and I ain't afraid of that
You niggas pimp on, I leave you where your gators at
This is for every person that I owe, I'm paying back
And every nigga turned groupie, I know you heard of that
People that smiled in my face and talked behind my back
For every dream that got lost, I promise I'm winning back
To all my peoples that knocked, we gone bounce back
And all the babies in the hood, gotta announce that
I can't give up, I won't give up, I crown myself the champ
So I don't think y'all want to see me when I'm really amped
Ain't no stopping me, I'm a long way from breaking man
I'm Ms. Jade, bout to show you how to take a chance
Corner full of rappers, show you how to take a man
A squad full of thugs, show you how to break a man
Niggas full of pride, show you how to make them dance
They can't stand to walk in my shoes and my favorite pants

Yo, what I need right here..
Is my ladies on one side..
And my fellas on one side..
This goes out to all the ghetto clubs..
And this how we gone put it down..
BEEEAAATTT CLUUUBBB!! OHH!

[Verse One]
Who the hell want to test me? Big guns and things
See me in the SOURCE book, big frozen rings
Never been a follower, always been a leader
y'all to meet us, get down on ya knees when you greet her
I'm a gangsta, see me in the ball wit my niggas
Rowdy lil' dudes ain't afraid to pull triggas
Get shit crunk, I'm a fuckin' icon
Niggas in the street whisperin' about mine, why?
Cause I'm.. the broad from the East
Smellin' like Gucci, Fendi linen pants wit the crease, huh
You want a piece? I don't think ya half-ready
See fifty-five, but I used to push the Chevy
Fuck up tracks, but y'all just rap
Never touch pape, most of y'all just act
Heidi-flights, pimp rap, must tell y'all the truth
I get it in, but y'all mess around in the booth
What the fuck, y'all suck, come at all y'all smuts
Poppin' up worldwide, everywhere like Starbucks
What the fuck, y'all suck come at all y'all smuts
Poppin' up worldwide, everywhere like Starbucks

[Chorus]
She's a gangsta
Not a pranksta, y'all
Not a follower
But a leader, y'all, feel that
She's a gangsta girl
She's a gangsta girl
Now can ya feel that?
She's a gangsta girl
She's a gangsta girl

[Verse Two]
I got the sickest, rolled me a big spliff
Crazy when the mic palmed in my black fist
You do it like you, I do it like this
Ms. Jade, power food and project piss
Now, how y'all want to play? Spit it for the big pay
I leave that ass Up In Smoke like Eminem and Dre
Semi or the AK, do this shit the Philly way
We ball out to Hamptons just to get away
Best 'bout time we settle this
Up in the club, throwin' bows, actin' ghetto-ish
And if I stop, I'm a still be a rebel chick
Have you fuckas duckin' quick, puffin' in a tinted whip 
Beat the case like Puffy did, legend-style like 'Pac and Big
When I'm gone, trust me, I'm a still live
Take, but I'd rather get you fuckin' wit the bigger kids
Bigger ones, bigger funds
Bigger fleece, Timbaland, bigger beats..

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Cruisin' down 95 wit a cup in my hand
Hot throws, large bills tucked up in a rubberband
Got the aimed amount, won't let 'em burn me out
Cause I'm a strong black woman, yup, grown black woman
Gangs, do I really play? Nine-to-five barely pay
Pounds of the green shit, never fuck wit the trays
I don't care if it bothers you, I'm still gone blaze
So sick like a virus that never goes away, hey
Hold ya breathe, you can smell the success
Spit sixteen off the pit pattin' ya chest
Yes, I'm so blessed, y'all cats is so stressed
Yeah, the streets been talkin' but my pen'll do the rest
Future mapped out, money linked all in
I'm a saturate the game, then sink y'all in
Snakes, fakes, and dick riders, what I dispise
Out to take it all over and will not compromise

(Intro)
Ms. Jade's the name comin to ruin the game (Do It) (repeat 3)

(Verse 1)
I got a master plan knocking these bum broads outta my way
Just came in the door and they got somethin to say
Tell em step up if they want to act hard
I don't need no great big bodyguard
Only dump dimes when it's time to blaze the L
You can do it just as long as you don't hurt ya self
Pull up, hop out start spitting like the A.R.
1-5 cake or sky high oh my
Got the science and the formula for hatin chicks
And whatcha do, if you don't like me you can suck a dick
I'm smoother then a pair of lizard skins in '88
A lotta suckas portrayin us when we know they ain't
Get the fuck outta here your dealin with a rider here
The chef in hell's kitchen, I'm stayin here for  alotta years
And for my thugs, real bitches and all my hustlers
Keep it movin I ain't got no paitence for you bustas (DO IT)

(Chorus paraphrasing Audio Two)
Step up if you want to get hurt
Ms. Jade's gonna pull your skirt (oh)

Step up if you want to get hurt
Ms. Jade's gonna pull your skirt (OH)
I am chillin (OH), we is chillin (OH), what else can we say? TOP BILLIN

(Verse 2)
Now I don't mean to be rude cocky and arrogant
I Guess that's just the PHILLY in me, and I don't even care
I Guess that's just the PHILLY in me, and I ain't even scared
This rap game is a war and I done came prepared
It ain't nothin to me to just pack up and leave
but why shouldn't I give it every breath that I breathe
And why shouldn't I kill it every time that I leave
When these fake mutha fucka's is so easy to read 'cause
My family got needs, my city need me
So I'mma do it from the muscle bitch believe me
Think 'cause I'm with Tim that I got it easy
but that don't stop me from smoking up in the Crown V
Stayin sucka free, weed in the truck with me
This music biz keep a bitch puffin heavily
3 in the mornin listening to Frankie Beverly
I won't stop till the whole world lovin me (DO IT)

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
You can Cha Cha Cha to this mardi gras
I'm the sickest rap bitch you done heard thus far
And it will get be-tta I'm bout my che-dda
and no one gets hurt (as long as you let her)
Do my thing whether 2003 swing
or I'm poppin that thing thing and lockin the game mane
won't fuck up my game plan, dealin the same hand
Just getting started and I'm only getting hotta mane
So getcha feet into the heat start lurkin
A dollar or a million I'mma be the same person

And even if I'm through with ya'll couldnt catch my twist (DO IT)

Come on home here
I miss ya

Chorus: Mr. Serv-On (repeat 4X)

I'm fightin tears for the time you spent
When your nights are dark, but in your heart you got a friend

[Mr. Serv-On]
You chose a destiny of prison terms and crack pipes
I fell victim to a world full of hard women and gang life
You did nine, now you got five
And every day I feel like I'm fighting myself just to stay alive
I got a little money but it ain't all that
What's the use of having it if it'll keep you from going back
I saw a look in your eyes like you wasn't scared to die
You lost your mom and your sister in three months
and never once I saw you cry
Maybe it was a soldier thing or you didn't know how
Cause so many nights I pray to God, just look at our life and smile
Cause somewhere in this ghetto life we lost our heart
Now we just a bunch of helpless souls searching for heaven, play your part
I witness you fight the demons in your mind
You told me they come late at night, you know that he was hard to find
But sometimes you gotta sit back and relax, and say a prayer
Cause when all the pain goes away I'll always be there

Chorus 4X

[Mr. Serv-On]
Some of the ??? around the way on they third and fourth babies
I wonder if you was home one of them would be yours
You gotta laugh at that, life is crazy
The other day Larry Tunes got twenty
He said he had to feed his baby, 
pay some bills and take care of his lady
I went around the way and the new thing seemed to be wheelchairs
Either they too blind to see or they just don't care
I saw your grandmother and she looked okay
But you know black women, they strong, they only cry when they pray
And I'm still tryin to bang all the tricks you used to hit up
And as usual they ask me where you at, and tell me what's up
But lately every day, now I caught my hands without a bottle
I guess I feel the pressure of these magazines callin me a role model
I look in these kids eyes and I see confusion
We never knew how bad it was, 
we just wanted to represent, never losin (New Orleans)
And no matter how times get hard
You just think about it, you look in your heart, I'll play my part

Chorus 4X

[Mr. Serv-On]
Oh man
I'm still thinkin bout all the times we had
It ain't the same no more, man you know

They got me sporting camoflauge when I'm misled, preparing on the armageddon
And everybody to blame for the supplies

For six months I watch, coulda gotchu at your baby's mother's house
Even at your down-low weed spot
But the backdrop, wasn't flattering enough
I didn't want people gathering and stuff
Snapshots of blood splattering from the snuff
Here - puff this here, while I figure which way, to split yo' wig
Right now you as nervous, as a Farmer John pig
As I dig into my tragic bag, take out the HK
Twist on the silencer, insert the thirty-shot mag
Bullet stuck to his brain like a magnet
Skull in fragments, I leave the cleanup to Dragnet

This is anybody (Murderah)
To fuckin' everybody (Murderah)
Nigga all y'all (Murderah)
Uh, uh, for real
You'll fuck around and get killed
This is anybody (Murderah)
Motherfuckin' everybody (Murderah)
Yeah nigga all y'all (Murderah)
Uh, uh, for real
You'll fuck around and get killed

Peeped all the stash drop and exchange of the dough
Lurkin through the turf, think how I'mma just work
Give em chase to the crib and yo he properly laced
Stepped out the car, put my steel, to the side of his face
Murder - this the fuckin Case, rob this nigga and shake
The fuckin spot cause in a few it's gon' be crawlin with cops!
Who's the bad bitch now, you crept on, paid the piper
Who'da thought a sexy bitch could be a murderous sniper
Detrimental to your health, shoulda learned yo' lesson
But it's too late nigga bye-bye, better count yo' blessings
I been watchin you watchin me, yeah you ballin
Was, nigga now you finger fucked and steady fallin
A thug wit no love, but bitch niggas die fast
Thug niggas die young - oh what you thought you would last?
Blast two shots to the dome, slide back to the pad
And jack my nigga off, til his dick get soft
Resume the wifey boo shit, cause yo my man don't know
That his bitch is straight ill, servin ass with fo'fo'

I'm a motherfuckin (Murderah)
Bitch this is anybody (Murderah)
Yeah nigga all y'all (Murderah)
Uh, uh, for real
You'll fuck around and get killed

Ms. Roq,"Aww they say uhh
A black man is a pimp
Well let me tell you the biggest pimp
On planet motherfuckin' Earth, is her momma
It's her momma that told her,
""Get a man that got a good job girl,
Make sure he got a good car girl,
Make sure he can take you out and buy you somethin' girl""
What happened to just fallin' in love with a nigga with a bus pass
Just 'cause you loved a nigga
But I'm the pimp motherfucker
I gotta be the player

Biggest hoes, on planet Earth
Are walkin' through the motherfuckin' neighborhood
You knew when you got with the nigga he already had a woman
You knew he already had a family
But you fucked him anyway
And then when you thought you gon' lose the nigga
You went and got pregnant, didn't you bitch, didn't you?
The ol' 'keep a nigga baby'
And then when the nigga ain't around, what do you tell the child?
""Aww that nigga ain't shit, that's why yo' daddy ain't here, 'cause that nigga ain't shit""
How 'bout being a woman, and tellin' the kid the truth
That yo' momma, you was a hoe
Tell the kid
Momma was a hoe, I was weekend pussy
I had you to keep the nigga, it didn't work out
That's why he ain't here, but he a good nigga
'Cause he take care of his real family
I was just a dumb bitch, tryin' to keep, a nigga that I wanted",Ed-Ucation,1999
Ms. Roq,"Yeah nigga, MC Ren up in this motherfucker
(West West y'all)
Yeah, L.A. niggas
L.A. niggas rule the world nigga
Y'all niggas gotta recognize, yaknahmsayin?
Niggas don't wanna peep game, yaknahmsayin?
But this shit come all the way back around here
My nigga Dre, droppin' heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin? You gotta recognize
L.A. niggas, connected all over the motherfucking world, nigga
Recognize this; peep game

Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd up from the feet up
Blue'd up from the shoe up's how I grew up
Loc'n, smokin' and drinkin' til we threw up (threw up)
At Leimert Park, taggin', hittin' fools up
Ditching my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggas quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I maneuver, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin Disciples to the Hoover

I'm coming ""Straight Outta Compton"" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twisting wit Tha Liks
And Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold separate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown and run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my max crew, at Fairfax
Who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggas jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain, C.K. B.K
Blue'd up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggas get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai, drive-bys, six-fo's on switches

I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brew's by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and pack heat
Requirements for survival each day in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way in L.A.!

First Verse (Kangol Slim):
Tell me Baby girl why you actin' funny?
Everytime you come around you gotta ask me for money,
Not really trickin' off, ain't my style,
But I might give you somethin' if it's worth my while,
I don't know, the games that you play,
But we don't play that, around my way,
The only money that I really plan to spend,
Is on me and you scorin' on La Quinta inn
Now Baby girl I can see on you face,
You really want to hop up in the Z-28,
You know one thing, you ain't bout to get no money,
Round here stuntin' for your friends, tell me why you actin' funny?
You actin' bad with your kitty-kitty kat,
Knowin' that a brotha done already hit that,
You'z a want to-be hot girl,
But you'z a cold girl,
In a Hot Girl's World

Second Verse (Ms. Tee):
Ooh, say boy why you actin' funny?
You never want to give me no lovin' or money,
You want some ass, don't want to give up the cash,
You want to sex me, then tell your boys and laugh,
Thought I would forgot about the things that we do?
Keep runnin' your mouth and ain't no love for you,
You want to sex me, but don't want to pay my bills,
And in the 9-8, you gonna have to hustle and heal,
Now you upsettin' me,
want to cry when they give you ten years in the pen,
But it wasn't like that, when you was home,
Now you keep on callin' my cellular phone,
And now I see,
You ain't no man,
You supposed to support me every way that you can,
Boy you want it, about my body,
And now I see, you ain't got no love for me

Ms. Toi,"Wilin' in the club smoking hash with my niggas 
? liquor put my mack on a strippa 
But she gasped on a a nigga flashed me her figure 
Ready to take this bitch in the bathroom and hit her 
This other nigga stepped up tryin' to rap on a nigga 
Tryin' to battle spittin' bull trash through a nigga 
Must have been blazed off the sacks we deliver 
'Cause my rhymes on the scale be the last on the rhicter 
This nigga had ice, I'm about to jack like the ripper 
I chill 'cause I'm still tryin' to get ass from the stripper 
Bust up in a mickey from the glass that I slipped her 
'Cause the bitch blacked out and made a dash at the nigga 
I held it down then I laughed at the nigga 
He came back throwin' arms fast like a pitcher 
Then I put it on this nigga like a blast from the trigger 
Took all the ice and cash from the nigga 

[Chorus: x4]
Put it on a nigga 
Put it on a nigga 
Put it on Put it on and shitted on a nigga 

Fuck the glitter, I'm bigga, so why you frontin' on a nigga 
Only time you know a nigga is when you smokin' wit' a nigga 
I be rappin' east and westin so not a question who got the blessin'
Buddah, while niggas be smokin' my shit like Smiff & Wesson 
We put it on a nigga, it's the supreme shot liquor 
Up in cheetas with your sister about to put it on a nigga 
Smoke it out with the mixture then get caught up in a figure 
 
It be Mr. Green layin more dick than Dirt Digler 
Make figures, shine bright like God over niggas 
I wake up every morning smoke an el wit niggas 
With the hydraploric mixture 
Do a one hit and quiter 
You can be the size of Big Pun my herb will lift ya 
The power ? used to hit my babysitter 
I put it on a sister with my dick just past my zipper 
I was 5 when I did her 
And I'm live when I hit ya 
The funk funk shitter to put it on motherfuckers 

[Chorus: x4]

Shit what, as I flip what, on a nigga 
Niggas better pay me for my verse on my ?spilla? 
The pimpa it's miss teasy and you the ? 
But if your dick is short than I'm about to call Godzilla 
Platinum realeses and new realses sellin'' my name bigger 
Channel live checkin for ? day my niggas 
This ? and we can negotiate the figures 
And possible I'll go with the feat 
If it's the realer and dealer and causin casualties from niggas 
And my brigade is gonna ride and pistol whip these niggas 
And if you got any questions I'm to a sister 
And yes my name is Miss Toi so don't try and play wit her 
From coast to coast you know I'm gonna ride to check the ?milla? 
And in the year 2g's be ready for the superheroes

Fuck the cemetery that a nigga get buried on

Nigga ask the bartender if you think we lie
But if you think we high, nigga think again
Cause when it's sink or swim
You got to think to win
And if I drink this Hen'
Everybody will know it
Cause I ain't going for it
So pray to the Lord that I don't pull out
Cuss out and bust out

Extra love for the ones who ain't got no date
But when we hit checkmate with Ice Cube the great
As soon as I get a word we can rush the safe
Fuck them license plates because life is great

Passing the mud shit
Pockets on flood shit
OG lyrical blood shit
I don't rent I buy shit
Niggas jealous of my shit
You unaware of this young nigga getting all the fly shit
While you're rooting and recruiting
Nigga 6-8 whooping
I was in the hood shooting cause I had the wife whooping
I come from padres gold in over sized jars
I past up strife and got star awards
No time for playa hating, Mack paper chasing
Came out the substation to the hip hop nation
The mo' hits the mo' bigga with illegal weight figga
Done develop the status of a platinum plus nigga
Bust the first asshole to show I can hit it
I keep pushing, don't quit it
Don't stop till I get it

Damn she wrong, bad little candy cone
One head nod from me she out the door
One head job from her she out the door
Back to the beach, back yo, the line o
