Christophe Beck,"Beth I hear you calling
But I can't come home right now
Me and the boys are playing
And we just can't find the sound

Just a few more hours
And I'll be right home to you
I think I hear them calling
Oh Beth what can I do
Beth what can I do

You say you feel so empty
That our house just ain't our home
I'm always somewhere else
And you're always there alone

Just a few more hours
And I'll be right home to you
I think I hear them calling
Oh Beth what can I do
Beth what can I do

Beth I know you're lonely
And I hope you'll be alright
'Cause me and the boys will be playing all night",Beth Cooper Suite,2009
Christophe Beck,"I would climb any mountain
Sail across the stormy sea
If that's what it takes me baby
To show how much you mean to me
And I guess that it's just the woman in you
That brings out the man in me
I know I can't help myself
You're all in the world to me

It feels like the first time
Feels like the very first time
It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time

I have waited a lifetime
Spent my time so foolishly
But now that I found you
Together we'll make history
And I know that it must be the woman in you
That brings out the man in me
I know I can't help myself
You're all my eyes can see

And it feels like the first time
Like it never did before
Feels like the first time
Like we've opened up the door
Feels like the first time
Like it never will again, never again

It feels like the first time
Feels like the very first time
It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time

Won't you open up the door

It feels like the first time
Feels like the very first time
It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time",Feels Like the First Time,2009
Christophe Beck,"Well we got no choice
All the girls and boys
Makin' all that noise
'Cause they found new toys
Well we can't salute ya can't find a flag
If that don't suit ya that's a drag
School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces

No more pencils no more books
No more teacher's dirty looks yeah
Well we got no class
And we got no principals
And we got no innocence
We can't even think of a word that rhymes
School's out for summer
School's out forever
My school's been blown to pieces

No more pencils no more books
No more teacher's dirty looks
Out for summer
Out till fall
We might not come back at all

School's out for summer
School's out with fever
School's out completely",School's Out,2009

Christophe Beck,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight 
Not a footprint to be seen 
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queen 
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside 
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I've tried 

Don't let them in, don't let them see 
Be the good girl you always have to be 
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know 
Well now they know 

Let it go, let it go 
Can't hold it back anymore 
Let it go, let it go, 
Turn away and slam the door 
I don't care what they'e going to say 
Let the storm rage on 
The cold never bothered me anyway 

It's funny how some distance 
Makes everything seem small 
And the fears that once controlled me 
Can't get to me at all 

Time to see what I can do 
To test the limits and break through 
No right or wrong, no rules for me 
I'm free 

Let it go, let it go 
I am one with the wind and sky 
Let it go, let it go 
You'll never see me cry 
Here I stand and here I stay 
Let the storm rage on 

My power flurries through the air into the ground 
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around 
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast 
I'm never going back, the past is in the past 

Let it go, Let it go 
And I'll rise like the break of dawn 
Let it go, let it go 
That perfect girl is gone 
Here I stand in the light of day 
Let the storm rage on 
The cold never bothered me anyway",Let's Do It,2014
Christophe Goze,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravane,2002

Christophe Maé,"Qui voudrait être à ma place
Qui saurait comment faire face
A ce rôle qui me fait peur ?

Je vous laisse juge et complice
Vous en laisse le bénéfice
Pour jouer en coulisse

A chacun sa place,
A chacun son impasse ...

Pas la peine 
De me chercher,
Non pas la peine
De me proposer,
A vos rêves m'attacher,
Je suis fait pour rien faire,
Mais surtout pour bien le faire

Pas envie
De me lever,
Non je n'ai pas envie
De m'encombrer

Pas pour la prise de tête, non ...

La vie est trop sérieuse pour m'y ennuyer
Ha, ha, ha, à qui la faute ?
Non, non,
C'est pas de ma faute, non

Pas de quoi
Se relever
Non, pas de quoi
En rajouter
Ni de quoi s'en vanter

Pas pour la prise de tête, non ...

Ne me rend pas heureux ...

Christophe Maé,"Si j'étais un mystère quel mirage
Voudrais-tu voir apparaître
Je peux être l'envers dont l'image
Ou dévoiler son contraire

Si j'étais un rêve éphémère que tu devais conquérir
Serai-je une ombre passagère ou ton avenir

Juste un geste de vous et je suivrais le message
Un regard qu'on déjoue et je tournerai la page
Sans rien dire d'un sourire
Faire semblant de ne rien voir
Juste un geste entre nous
C'est ce qu'il me faut pour savoir
Pour m'avoir
Pour m'avoir

Si j'étais un mystère quel courage
Aurais-tu pour me connaître
Je peux être moi-même qu'un visage
Ou te rester étrangère
Si j'étais un loup solitaire que tu devais découvrir

Christophe Maé,"On oublie un peu facilement d'où l'on vient, d'où l'on part
Ça nous arrange de perdre de temps en temps la mémoire
Quand il y a danger on regarde son voisin, c'est bizarre
Sans voir qu'on l'a peut-être laissé trop longtemps à l'écart

Y a-t-il un cœur qui s'élève pour que tout le monde soit d'accord?
Un cœur qui prenne la relève
Quelqu'un qui vienne en renfort
C'est ma terre où je m'assois
Ma rivière, l'eau que je bois
Qu'on n'y touche pas
C'est mes frères autour de moi
Mes repères et ma seule voix
Qu'on n'y touche pas

On alimente nos peurs qu'en détournant nos regards
De nos belles valeurs qui ne seraient pourtant qu'un devoir
Et si on apprenait à se prendre la main
Pas se voir autrement que des inconnus qui ne font rien, des histoires

Christophe Maé,"Qu'elle était belle à tes côtés
Sur ta voix son corps dansait
Dans ses dentelles virevoltait
L'effet d'un corps de ballet
Papa, tu as pris la route sans dire adieu
Papa, tu as laissé son corps je t'en veux

Mon âme se met à genou
Quand les anges s'envolent et ne veillent plus sur nous
Aux armes je crois bien devenir fou
Mais j'irai venger l'amour

Ma vie est une larme qui ne cesse de tomber

Le tour m'embrouille mes heures
Spleen, quand vient le soir
Les fantômes de la nuit tissent mon histoire
Spleen, pluies du cœur

De maintenant, de ce qu'on fait

Parce que notre avenir dépendra de notre nature
Et de ce qu'on aura laissé derrière soi
On a qu'une seule vie à vivre et qu'une seule nature
Je voudrais m'en aller sans un regret derrière moi

Il n'est pas question de zèle
Ni de chasser le naturel
L'homme est un animal sauvage (hummm)
Qui n'est pas fait pour les cages

Il est question d'être 6 milliards
Sous le même toit la même mare

Parce que notre avenir dépendra de notre nature
Et de ce qu'on aura laissé derrière soi
On a qu'une seule vie à vivre et qu'une seule nature
Je voudrais m'en aller sans un regret derrière moi

Si je veux me regarder dans la glace
Et dans le regard de mes enfants (no)
Si je veux un jour leur dire en face
Ce qu'on a fait, ce qui les attend

Parce que notre avenir dépendra de notre nature
Et de ce qu'on aura laissé derrière soi
On a qu'une seule vie à vivre et qu'une seule nature

Posé sur le bord de la berge comme
Une barque en bois qui se noie
Je me rappelle qu'elle me faisait du bien
Alors ce soir le monde pourra m'attendre car
Je resterai certainement là
Simplement je me souviens

Comme elle contemplait la lune
En me disant tout bas
Je me sens toute étourdie
De te voir le cœur dans la brume
Et plus vraiment là
Quand le ciel s'assombrit

Quand vient la saison de l'automne
Tout me rappelle que je l'aime encore
Alors je laisse mon amour à l'automne
Et dans ses dentelles tous mes remords

Faisant autour d'elle bien d'autres dégâts
C'est vrai qu'elle n'allait pas rester là à m'attendre mais
Quand l'été s'en va
Tu sais moi je me souviens ouais

Ils disent que ça se termine bien n'aie pas peur

Loin de moi l'idée de
Ne pas t'épouser alors
Non ne t'en fais pas ma belle
Non ne t'en fais pas
Car loin de moi l'idée d'une
Femme sur chaque quai alors
Non ne t'en fais pas ma belle
Ne t'en fais pas

Je regarde l'étoile du nord
Seul comme un chercheur d'or
Je regarde vers l'est
Le soleil se lève quand tu dors
J'oublie peu à peu ton corps
Y'a que la solitude à bord
Mais le vent me pousse encore

Laisse-moi m'en aller
Je te promet de revenir vers
Nos années
Quand je te disais qu'un jour j'allais
T'emmener
Et te faire l'amour la vie entière
Crois-moi crois-moi
Laisse-moi m'en aller

Aïe aïe aïe aïe aïe aïe ahé

Loin de moi l'idée de
Ne pas t'enlacer alors
Non ne t'en fais pas ma belle
Non ne t'en fais pas
Car loin de toi je sais
Que la chance et la joie m'ignorent
Non ne t'en fais pas ma belle
Ne t'en fais pas

Je deviens fou je perds le nord
Seul comme un chercheur d'or
J'ai la tête à l'ouest
La lune se couche quand tu dors
N'oublie surtout pas mon corps
Y'a que la solitude à bord
Mais le vent nous pousse encore

Laisse-moi m'en aller
Je te promet de revenir vers
Nos années
Quand je te disais qu'un jour j'allais
T'emmener
Et te faire l'amour la vie entière
Crois-moi crois-moi

Regarde la mer
Si le vent se lève
C'est que je serais là bientôt
Regarde et espère
L'absence est un rêve
D'où je reviens bientôt

Laisse-moi m'en aller
Je te promet de revenir
Te faire l'amour
Alors laisse-moi

Laisse-moi m'en aller

Christophe Maé,"Les yeux dans le vide, elle me regarde passer
Dans le creux de ses rides moi j'ai trébuché
Ça me fait mal au bide
Sa belle gueule cassée comme une étoile livide à deux doigts de tomber
Elle tire sur un mégot cent fois rallumé
Quand je lui tend la main à travers la fumée

Elle était si belle la poupée,
Elle que les anges avaient oublié.
Si on avait un peu regardé
Peut-être que l'hiver ne l'aurait pas brisée

Un pied dans le vide, elle a déménagé
Elle perd son équilibre entre deux larmes salées
Y'a comme un goût acide qui entre ses baisers
Elle dit qu'elle est lucide, non, plus jamais se caser
Elle tire sur un mégot cent fois rallumé
Quand je lui tend la main à travers la fumée

Elle était si belle la poupée,
Elle que les anges avaient oublié.
Si on avait un peu regardé
Peut-être que l'hiver ne l'aurait pas brisée

Et ton cœur en hiver je le garde au chaud,
En attendant le retour du soleil
Et si le mien passe l'hiver au chaud,
Sache que sur toi je veille

Elle était si belle la poupée,
Elle que les anges avaient oublié.
Si on avait un peu regardé

Qu'ici tout est beau

Mon cœur s'étonner car il faut que je te dise

Je suis tombé sous le charme,
À Cause de tes mains, tes mots doux
Tourne autour de mon âme comme des refrains vaudou
Je suis tombé sous le charme
À Cause de ton sein sur ma joue
Tourne autour de mon âme et je tombe dans le bayou

Je crois pas au hasard,
Le jour comme le soir, tu me tiens chaud
Comme l'ébène et l'ivoire,
Viens on va s’asseoir au vieux piano
Alors tu laisses ton cœur décider, ton cœur hésiter
Mais j'aimerai t'entendre dire

Je suis tombé sous le charme,
À Cause de tes mains, tes mots doux
Tourne autour de mon âme comme des refrains vaudou
Je suis tombé sous le charme
À Cause de ton sein sur ma joue
Tourne autour de mon âme et je tombe dans le bayou

Laissons passer les heures,
Laissons passer nos peurs
Et laisse faire ouais, laisse faire le bonheur
Rempli toi de candeur, rempli moi de douceur
Et roulons nous dans les fleurs

Je suis tombé sous le charme,
À Cause de tes mains, tes mots doux
Tourne autour de mon âme comme des refrains vaudou
Je suis tombé sous le charme
À Cause de ton sein sur ma joue
Tourne autour de mon âme et sautons dans le bayou

Et oui même si je ne suis pas d'ici,
Je connais par cœur le bord du Mississippi
Même si je ne suis pas de là,
Je veux m'oublier, m'oublier, dans tes bras
Même si je ne suis pas d'ici,
Je connais par cœur le bord du Mississippi
Même si je ne suis pas de là,
Je veux m'oublier, m'oublier, dans tes bras

Qu’on se mate une expo au 104 Lary Clarck

Dans le pavillon nord 
Que t'avais redouté 
La grande sortie offerte 
Que tu m'avais refusée

Qu'on n'était pas bien là 
Et aller bien au fond 
Et revenir encore

Quand tu chialais tu faisais moins peur 
Comme si tu effaçais tous mes erreurs 
Et j'imaginais bien 
Ça ne tenait à presque rien 
On aurait pu faire face 
À ce qu'on avait vu 
Le jour de l'ouverture 
De notre grande surface 
On aurait dû s'achever 
Pour ne pas avoir à en pleurer 
Se retrouver dehors 
Sans doute elles seront là 
Peut-être sortie des salles 
En face en plein milieu 
Pour enfin se préparer 
Il suffisait d'why croire 
À nos belles retrouvailles..

There's really nothing more to say
I'll get along without your kiss tonight
Just close the door and walk away

Never gonna fall in love again
I don't want to start with someone new

Ont-ils oublié que demain, ils devraient courir dans la ville ?
Et je cherche en vain un moyen de rendre mes pas utiles

J'apercois l'ombre d'une fille, je baisse un peu les yeux,
D'un coup de main habile, remets en place mes cheveux
Quelque chose me dit, qu'elle me veut

Les enceintes sans se lasser, répètent toujours les memes accords
Pour danser, jusqu'à  ce que le temps soit mort

Ne nous arretons pas
Ce qui se passe entre toi et moi

A un côté intemporel
Eternel

Est-ce la chance ou le destin, qui a réuni nos chemins ?
Peu importe car je sais qu'à  deux heures du matin
Notre histoire et ma vie sont sans lendemain
Les BPM s'accélèrent et vont maintenant à  toute allure
Ses yeux me foudroient comme l'éclair, ses lèvres ont un goût de futur

Floating gently trough the clouds

Dances on my skin

Des drôles d'histoires
Goûter la gloire
Et la poussière

Et j'veux du ciel
Des orages et des étoiles
Éternelles
Et du vent dans nos voiles

Je rêve, je vis
Je rêve que mes péchés soient bénis
Je cherche, je prie
Je prie pour une caresse
Quelques tendresses

J'veux des péchés
J'veux des prières
Vivre assoiffé
A la lisière

J'veux des regrets
Des drôles d'histoires
Goûter la gloire
Et la poussière

Et j'veux du ciel
Des orages et des étoiles
Éternelles
Et du vent dans nos voiles",Faute et plaisir,2014

Who's a good friend of mine

He goes Argh! That's how he laughs
He goes Argh! That means he's glad
He goes Argh! That means he's having
The greatest time that he ever had

He's got fangs on his jaws
His fur is orange, and he's got these claws
He looks so mean that he could scare a crowd
But if you tickle him he laughs out loud

He goes Argh! That's how he laughs
He goes Argh! That means he's glad
He goes Argh! That means he's having

Sometimes he feels low down and ugly, too
And then the tears begin to fill his eyes
It's so pathetic when a monster cries

He goes Argh! That's how he cries
He goes Argh! That means he's sad
He goes Argh! That means he's having
The lowest time that he ever had

Just remember
One of those roads leads back to me
Don't you say goodbye

Careful what you say
You might be back someday
Baby, don't you say goodbye

Will whisper every day

Takin' a shot into the dark
Hopin' that someone will see the spark
Of the light in you
Noah's ark to the ship of fools
Didn't we break all the golden rules
Caught in the dance of the hours
Open your heart 'til everyone's in
It's never too late to believe and begin
Open your heart 'til everyone's in
You can wish on the light of a star 'til the end
Everyone's out on the open sea
We're all a part of the mystery
You know how lonely it can be
Surviving
You say you're gonna settle down
Just play guitar and walk around
Until you turn into the sound
Of laughter

And at the end we will fly",Open Your Heart,1985
Christopher Cross,"There's a place I know called Swing Street
Where you can really feel the heartbeat
After working hard til sundown
The city comes alive

High up, low down, down on Swing Street
Gypsy jazzmen tickling my feet
Jive and music, love and money
There's enough to get you high

Sidewalk preachers hustling bibles
Longing for one more revival
There's a truth in all these dreamers
If you read between the lines

Well, it's all right watching the world come together
A real life movie that goes on forever
Take your chances and pull on the lever
Down on Swing Street

Down on Swing Street
Morning comes, that alarm clock screaming
Coat and tie, and wheeling, dealing
I wish that I could be back on Swing Street

Living out of magazines
But there's still one place

It's a calm wind blowing on my skin
And I've been dreaming again
Now that we're all here

We can share these notes and all this madness
We can talk of innocence
And of all the things we believe in

Is it an alibi
Is it the reason why
Is it the way we really feel inside

Set it free
The magic of those nights brings me closer to that light
That helps me see the path ahead of me
I can feel that something
A hint of mystery
A trace of dare
To live the truth I hide somewhere
Daybreak

In a place I've known before
Will I find me behind that final door
I can hear the footsteps of the past
I can feel the thunder and it's coming fast
I'm gonna spend some time with the moon
Pour myself a glass of midnight
Keep myself in tune

Is it the way I see it through your eyes

Christopher Cross,"I woke up to my world this morning
Took a long look in the looking glass
Last night I guess I had one or too many
Somebody tried to tell me I had no class
What ever happened to me

Maybe I've been living on lies
Never really had a dream come true
Then again I guess I never really tried
Now the years all slip away

And things are like they're gonna stay
All the roads I didn't take are just
One more thing in the back of my mind
Taking space and time

Wish I'd finished that book I never started
Maybe that's the story of my life
Should've learned to play that saxophone
So I could tell my song to the streetlight
Shouldn't have been so stuck on my own
Could've had a wife and a child
Should've made that house a home
I don't know why my life is so wild
Now the years all slip away

And things are like they're gonna stay
All the chances I didn't take are just
One more thing in the back of my mind
Taking space and time
One more thing in the back of my mind

So I'm thinking about a walk in the sunlight
I've got to get my shadow behind me
Try and make some sense of it all
With my feet on the ground and my heart still free
As the years will slip away

I'll let the cards fall where they may
And all the roads I didn't take will be just
One more thing in the back of my mind
As the years will slip away

And the cards fall as they may

Take the holy water, wash away the tears

Oh she loves me, she told me so
As a tear came to her eye
And I love her, I will, I know
Love her for the rest of my life
Once more I'm feeling like I'm out of control
'Cause the girl's got a serious hold
On me

And part of me says run away
But I want to stay
Should I be up front or cool
Which way is playing the fool
The only time I know what's right
Is when I hear her telling me

Shining for the love of hearts
The light of that star, like the hand of a friend

Christopher Cross,"The boys find a home in a family born of hate
The girls plant desperate love
In a womb that just won't wait
Forgotten mother pushes a cart with her heart

Through a twisted fate
As walls come down and spirits rise
The business of fear never dies
The artful dodgers with their false alarms

Take from the mouths to feed the arms
Pit god against god for a piece of land
They think they hear his words but they don't understand
Like a river lost on its way to the sea

Where is humanity
I know that nothing will change
'Til it changes in me
'Til it changes in you

There's a plague upon the body
A plague upon the mind

From the fallen forest to the poison bay

Turning out that way

I smell the blood of a million sons

Christopher Cross,"All across the sky
The mysteries of faith
Fossils of desire all assume their rightful place
Is there any danger in their fire
Is there any solace in their wake
Could it really make a world of difference for goodness sake

Train rolls a cappella
To a sympathetic moon
Carrying the stories of every heart, earned wound
Will there be a lover at the station
Will there be a last conductor's call
Will there really be a happy ending after all

[Chorus]
To the rendezvous
Fortunes to be told
To the rendezvous
Wonders to behold
Onto a place where we can find
Maybe a trace of peace of mind
To the rendezvous all in good time

Painting the horizon
A mast beyond the blue
Caught up in the tempest of another point of view
Could there be a mutiny in the making
Could it be a lorelei in song
Is it just a ghost that's been forgiven all along

Will there be a jewel beneath the boulder
Will there be a pride beyond the fall
Will there really be a happy ending after all
Will there be a pride beyond the fall
Will there really be a happy ending after all

[Chorus]",Rendezvous,1993
Christopher Cross,"Everyone maybe once or twice
Finds a friend that's a friend for life
Somebody who believed in me like you
From those days of childhood fights
Through the nights when we'd ask advice
All of those times when nobody else would do

Any old time that you wanna hear from me
To find your way or kick around a memory
Like the old times
Any old time will do

I can tell when the telephone rings
It's gonna be you just to talk about things
It's funny how it seems to happen when you're on my mind
Every time good love goes bad
When I can't believe the luck I've had
All of those times I'm glad you're a friend of mine

Any old time that you need to call on me
To find your way or kick around those memories
Like the old times
Any old time will do

Don't you ever forget
Any old time when the road is getting rough to climb
And you think maybe you've had enough
Just like the old times
Any old time you're blue

All at once I went and got a hunch
Everything we ever felt was true
As we find the years behind us and we live the years ahead
Let's remember laughter and all the words we said

Make new friends and keep the old
One is silver and the other one's gold
Something Sally said that stuck in my head
And I never wanna let it go

I'll be there, you can dream on me
Just like the old times
Any old time will do",Any Old Time,1993
Christopher Cross,"You gotta be smart you gotta be cool

But the meat is clean
The best take advantage of you like a machine
You gotta charm that snake now, maybe

Don't let the fingernails
Under the heart
If they get a good grip
They're gonna rip it apart
The first and last kisses 
Are the dangerous part

Christopher Cross,"We think about the loves we lost
Will it come again?
We think of all the things we want
Will we ever win?

We listen to the voice of children
Will they find their way?
Keep an open heart
The answer to it all's a wish away

Never let the tears you're cryin' blind you
To the dream that's waitin' to find you
'Cause there's one more chance
With every turn of the world

Is it gold or glory
A taste of freedom
Or the strong warm touch of a body?
There are all these things with every turn of the world

Human kindness - diamond of the heart
Tearing down the old walls
As long as we can share
Desire's not a sin, after all

Missing tender magic touching you

Hey, don't you know my name
It wasn't all that long ago

Would you still look as good standing in the rain

Take it from me, it's gonna be alright

Been there done that
Been there, then somebody takes you back
Been there done that
So hard, hard to avoid the trap

They break your heart, why do we let them in
The drug is strong but the will is weak
We make the same mistakes again
There comes a time we all gotta rise above
Look inside and redefine, just what it is we want from love

Been there done that
Been there, still working my way back
Been there done that
So hard, hard to avoid the trap

And when you feel strong enough to face up to it
You're gonna do just fine

Both unaware of what the gods had planned
She was lost in her Cosmo readin' about the stars
He was readin' about two-headed babies from Mars
When she reached for a Snickers she dropped her keys
And so began one of life's mysteries
He was a little old-fashioned and a little oversexed
He picked them up never guessing what would happen next

Then she smiled and said I like your tie
Yeah she smiled and told him that little white lie
And his soul lit up like the fourth of July
When she smiled

They made it to Starbuck's just before it closed
He pointed to the jar and said you want one of those
So over biscotti and double decafs
They shared their stories and they had some laughs
He got up his courage and asked her back to his place
Then he held his breath as he studied her face
She just sat and she stared and she said nothing at all
He knew he blew it and he waited for the ax to fall

Then she smiled and he knew he hadn't been wrong
Yeah she smiled and said what took you so long
And the world felt good like a rock and roll song
When she smiled

When she smiles I forget my lines
When she smiles man I'm on cloud nine
When she smiles oh it's time out of mind
When she smiles

Then she smiled and said where you been all my life
And she smiled when he asked her to be his wife
And the future had never looked so bright
When she smiled

I'm just diggin' her diggin' me diggin' her

When she smiles I forget my lines
When she smiles man I'm on cloud nine
When she smiles oh it's time out of mind
When she smiles

When she smiles I come all undone
When she smiles I'm the only one
When she smiles I'm a smoking gun

Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?""

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do ......
The best that you can do is fall in love

Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life, he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a really good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do .....
The best that you can do is fall in love

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do .....
The best that you can do is fall in love",Arthur's Theme [From Arthur],2010

In the jungle I run tonight
Find no peace to logical life
No confusion, just wrong or right, oh yeah.


Faces, numbers I recognize
You don't fool me with cynical lies
No problems, no compromise, oh yeah


Only solutions
Don't pull me down, I just want to hear
Only solutions
Oh, it won't be long, it won't take too long


Modern times drive me insane
Explanations I can't explain
Leaves me standing in the rain, oh yeah


Solving mysteries with nothing to lose
Magic leaves you without any clues
There's only so much one man can do, oh yeah


Only solutions
Don't pull me down, I just want to hear

Oh it won't be long, it won't take too long

Christopher Gamper,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,
Christopher Garcia,"The water is wide, I can't cross over
and neither I have wings to fly
give me a boat that can carry two
and both shall row - my love and I

Now love is gentle, and love is kind
the sweetest flower when first it's new
but love grows old, and waxes cold
and fades away like morning dew

There is a ship, she sails the sea
she's loaded deep as deep can be
but not as deep as the love I'm in
I know not how I sink or swim

The water is wide, I can't cross over
and neither I have wings to fly
give me a boat that can carry two
and both shall row - my love and I

Où parfois passaient des éclairs
Comme au ciel passent des orages.

Que j'ai jamais très bien compris.
Son cou portait ""Pas vu, pas pris.""

Sur son bras droit un mot ""Raisonne"".

Et l'envie de sa peau me ronge.

I know my way around here
The cardboard trees, the painted scenes, the sound here
Yes a world to rediscover
But I'm not in any hurry
And I need a moment

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always
Feel the early morning madness
Feel the magic in the making
Why everything's as if we never said goodbye

I've spent so many mornings
Just trying to resist you
I'm trembling now
You can't know how I've missed you
Missed the fairy-tail adventures
In this ever-spinning playground
We were young together

I'm coming out of make-up
The lights already burning
Not long until the camera's will start turning
And the early morning madness
And the magic in the making
Yes, everything is as if we never said goodbye

I don't want to be alone that's all in the past
This world's waited long enough
I've come home at last

And this time will be bigger
And brighter than we knew it
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it
Could I stop my hand from shaking?
Has there ever been a moment with so much to live for?

The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways
So much to say not just today but always

We'll have magic in the making

Are you my life to be
That dream come true

Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

That thrills and delights me, oh no

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true

To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1998

Each time I see a train go by
I'll think of us, the night, the sky forever

But appealing, I feel I know him
Seeing is believing, and I like what I see here
I like where I am, what I'm feeling

What are we doing? Can you believe it?
A starving actress and a star struck boy
Oh well, I might as well enjoy
This moment, can you believe it?

Seeing is believing, I never thought I'd be here
Is this really me? Am I dreaming?
No way of knowing where this is leading
It's fun forgetting who we are, who cares?

When now the world is far behind us
Seeing is believing, my life is just beginning
We touched and my head won't stop spinning
From winning your love

This tradition is our mission
And Moana, there's so much to do (make way!)

We joke and we weave our baskets (aha!)

We use the leaves to build fires (we use the leaves to build fires)
We cook up the meat inside (we cook up the meat inside)

There you are

You must find happiness right
Where you are

I like to dance with the water

The water is mischievous (ha!)
I like how it misbehaves

Or say that I drift too far
But once you know what you like, well
There you are

You are your father's daughter

Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star

We make our nets from the fibers (we weave our nets from the fibers)
The water is sweet inside (and we taste the sweet inside)
We use the leaves to build fires (we sing these songs in our choir)
We cook up the meat inside (we have mouths to feed inside)

Cooled only by the touch of your hands

And each night that is to come

Is it love or is it me
That makes me change so suddenly
From looking out to feeling free?

I sit here lying in my bed
Wondering what it was I said
That made me think I lost my head
When I knew I lost my heart instead

So won't you please read my signs?
Be a gypsy
Tell me what I hope to find deep within me
And because you can find my mind
Please be with me

And of all the better things I've heard
Loving you has made the words
And all the rest seem so absurd
'Cause in the end it all comes out I'm sure

Tell me what I hope to find deep within me
And because you can find my mind

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
Asleep on the hay

O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us

Christopher Mora,"I am weak,
Omni potency,
A dream, unachieved by mankind’s means,
The essence of your consistency,
Hold you from what you’ll achieve.
I’m not the answer to earth’s urgencies,

You can’t pray to me,
You can’t pray to me.
I am not the answer,

Chorus:
You are what I cannot be,
The answer to everything,
All that I need,

I am weak,
My infatuation,
Started at creation,
Soon after I was lost in the separation,
When I was the mirror of desperation.

You are what I cannot be.

Chorus:

The only thing,
I could possibly need,
Is more,
The only hands,
That could hold up my feet,
Are Yours

Chorus",The Answer,2016
Christopher Mora,"Restore. 
Simplicity of the innocent, 
Something taken for granted, 
Follow reason to find the end,
Until there's no more times to lend, 

Push, push, push until your worn,
Pull the rope until it's torn,

What you have is more than what you conjugate, 

Chorus:
I will not remove,
The essence of my morality, 
Forsaking, my misdeeds,
For the need, to believe, 

But now I stood tired and hungry,
Looking at my past unloving, 
How did I forget my direction, 
Guided by misguided affection, 

Everything has felt the same,
Faults initiate my blame,
Time to revive,
Time to restore. 

Chorus

Grab hold of moments worth remembering, 
While the beat in your heart is still pumping, 
This is something resonating in me,
Now that I have returned and I am starting to see.",Back Breaker,2016
Christopher Mora,"Your heirs are full of lies,
Just when my soul,
Longs for more,
The world evens the score,
I want to admit that Your words are true,
But Your children slander all that You do. 

How can You let them control,
What they refuse to uphold,
You claim to conquer the dead,
But it’s the living that I dread.

Breeding disaster,
To please their master.

Chorus:
Deceiver,
You left Your mark,
Lost souls embracing the dark.
Believer,
Where is your heart?
Lost souls embracing the dark.

Judgment and condemnation,
Setting wars between the nations,
Death reigns in Your name,
How can I believe this is how it should be?

How can You let them control,
What they refuse to uphold,
You claim to conquer the dead,
But it’s the living that I dread.
I am a victim of Your purging,
You sent Your sheep to bury me.

Chorus

Where is Your plan?",Deceiver,2016
Christopher Mora,"I lived under the tree of life,
Feeding off whatever is left,
After the kings have feast,
Ignoring my every need.
The first will be the last,
But this strain will break my back,
 The strings I pull are getting shorter,
And the flame is getting warmer.

What if You’re nothing,
And I’ve been deceived by trusting,

Chorus:
Show me to believe,
Because life will claim,
All that I’ve ever known.

Everyday I’ve raised the sword,
To separate everything you left ignored.
With the words in my hand,
And the faith in my heart,
I’ve seen the sword rip existence apart.
Judgment burns you left and right,
Don’t you dare cross to my side,
Rumors cripple the image,
You create, 

Chorus

What if You’re nothing,
And I’ve been deceived by trusting,

But what if I’m wrong?
I can’t conceive a world without You in it,
I can’t believe there was a time,
That You did not exist to me,
As my spine bends back,
And I’m about to break,
There You stand with my feet misplaced.

Chorus",Deliverance,2016
Christopher Mora,"Break down the abode,
And with the flames let my name go,
Deteriorate what I’ve lived with,
The ground is all that is left to believe in,
Tremors shake and collapse my home,
An earthquake from a burning dome,
The core of my existence,
Engulfs everything I’ve built on it,
Is this the end of it all?

Chorus:
If this is temporary,
Will You show me what lasts,
From ashes I cry out,
Is this the end of it all?

Creeping lies and ill promise,
Crumble the world upon us,
Deceiving nature drives the herd,
Misunderstanding the word,
False lies and unjust doctrine,
Prosperity forgotten.

Flames burn all that I know,
Is this the end of it all?

Chorus

Hold fast to what is left,
The only thing I hold close,
Life fades away,
Life fades to grey,

Chorus",The End of It All,2016
Christopher Mora,"Gaps filled with trusting,
A mind with no holes,
A heart engulfing,
The depths of my soul,
I searched the world that gave me no gifts,
I walked to the very end of my bliss,

And even vacancy denies my name,
My name,
And decency begins to fade away,
Away

Chorus:
Every essence of my being,
Leaves me questioning,
Who I’m meant to be,
Who I’m meant to be.

Corrupted society,
Breeding false propriety,
Popularity breeds promiscuity,
I can’t buy back ignorance that I lack.

And even vacancy denies my name,
My name,
And decency begins to fade away,
Away

Chorus

Teach me to be a man,
Who doesn’t need to understand,
Every fabric of my being,
Is this what it’s like,
To end uncertainty,
Is this how it feels?
Chorus",From Dust to Stone,2016
Christopher Mora,"I’ve been walking the line,
Following a life that binds,
You taught me freedom comes,
When you release conviction,
Commands to live a life,
Never learning what’s inside,
I’ve been saved by birthright.

Chorus:
Quit pretending,
To understand me,
Doubt has consumed me,
I can’t escape it.

I’ve been walking the line,
Following a life that binds,
You taught me freedom comes,
When you release conviction,
Commands to live a life,
Never learning what’s inside,
I’ve been saved by birthright.

Chorus

I am starting to question why,
They say believe just because they know it’s right,
Pick up your head and don’t bother asking why,
I will not be convinced this time.
Give me a chance to question what is right,
Will blind obedience accommodate,
A soul that never knew the gates?
I’ve been saved by birthright. 

Chorus",A Life That Binds,2016
Christopher Mora,"As my blood drips from my heavy heart,
I yearn for that second start.
The seasons are unchanging,
How can it be?

Chorus:
Now I cannot see,
Cannot feel anything, anymore,
Now I’ve lost it all.
Oh how can it be?
How can I see anything, anymore,
At the end of it all?

Please forgive my undiscerning,
Questioning my yearning,
I was the transgressor,
Please hold me together,

Chorus",Mirror of Death,2016
Christopher Mora,"I've seen things, 
I thought I could only dream,
I've read the book, 
But I'm surrounded by misery. 
Imperfect, yet inspired, 
Life in the cracks, 
Contradicting humanity. 

I can't comprehend, 
This twisted reality, 
There has to be,
Substance in inconsistency, 
Weaving time and reality, 
Is faith the only thing holding up my belief? 
In the darkness my eyes show me,
There is so much more that I can't see,
How defined can I be?
My fate is dependence fueled by needs,

Who will you help? 
When the whole world bleeds,
How will you help?
When your whole world bleeds.

Oh Misery, why have you left me questioning, 
My existence, 
Father will You come and show us,
How to live again?

My lack of vitality,
Affirms my humanity,
I boast not of my sufficiency, 
But to demand of Your authority, 

Is this the point for everything that I'm feeling,
Is compassion supposed to drive my yearning? 
The love You put on my heart,
Wasn't just mine from the start,
We were cut from the vine,
Pruned to be Your congregation. 

Chorus

Every inch of my being questions, 
How to repay,
The agony the laceration,
That cured my Misery. 
My Misery.",Misery,2016

Could you open my mind,
Revealing what’s inside?
Denying everything you left behind,

Decaying the worry of man,

The decay of flesh with no time to lend,
Years of endless trying,
Years of tithing for what’s worthless,
With no purpose.

Chorus:
Where will I go,
When there’s no hope at all,
And I am numb to breathing?

I look around at the world,
Conflicted by what I see,
Everything I lived for,
Is failing to birth growth,
Spinning to death,
I see him wait,
With his scythe at his side,
Spinning to death,
Relief will rise at it kills me,

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

I drove down Monterey Street

And I made every moment last
And I thought about years
How they take so long
And they go so fast

That I paced that porch and swore I'd die of boredom there
And I thought of what I'd give to feel another summer linger

And I made every moment last

Christopher Walken,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
""'Tis some visiter,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door
Only this and nothing more.""

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow, vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost Lenore
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me, filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
""'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door
Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;
This it is and nothing more.""

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
""Sir,"" said I, ""or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you"" here I opened wide the door
Darkness there and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore?""
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""Lenore!""
Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my sour within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.
""Surely,"" said I, ""surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is and this mystery explore
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore
'Tis the wind and nothing more.

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he,
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door
 Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" I said, ""art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!""
 Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
 With such name as ""Nevermore.""

But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if its soul in that one word he did outpour
Nothing farther then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered
Till I scarcely more than muttered: ""Other friends have flown before
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.""
 Then the bird said ""Nevermore.""

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
""Doubtless,"" said I, ""what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
 Of 'Never--nevermore.'""

But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
 Meant in croaking ""Nevermore.""

This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er
 She shall press, ah, nevermore!

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
""Wretch,"" I cried, ""thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent thee
Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!""
 Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""

""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted
On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore
Is there--is there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!""
 Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""

""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil! Prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.""
 Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""

""Be that our sign of parting, bird or fiend!"" I shrieked, upstarting--
""Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!""
 Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""

And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted - NEVERMORE!",The Raven,1997

My people roll swanga's, I wanted to be rollin' the same thang
Never had alot of work, but I was doin' what I could
Movin' nickles, dimes, twenty's, and ounces all threw my hood
Since I had a one yolla fines cash me up
Mean while thumpin' for a ride my homies pass me up
It's all gravy, when I'm able I'm a showin' all somthin'
From a hopte to a foreign, I'm ballin' it's all or nothin'
Treat my feet with' designer to fine sneak's when I leave my home
Only place you catch me walkin' is to my mail box's
Cause on the streets I be on crome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rollin' chrome

Huh, I started off with' a canary yellow cutlass supreme on bald tire's
Yeah I know I was out of line
But that was all I could find
Or should I say that was all I could purchase for what I had to spend
But at least I had somthin' to go from point A to B and
No more offerin' gas money to get a lift
Besides when your driven it's easyer to get a chick
So ani't no more parkin' lot pimpin' at the club I'm up in there
Seekin' little mama, with' thick thighs, I hope she let me in there
Like swim wear, pull up to the motel, and we'll go in there
Nothin' left to do but comit a sin there
And that was in my hopte, but when I show up in my big body with' the gloss
All of the boppers was boppin' I just could'nt shake'm off
Sixteen switches, tewnty-two inches, trunk goin' to war
They don't want to lay here with me, they want to lay in my car
I was lovin' it back then and still love it today
Except I'm not yellow cutlase no more, I'm 300 blue over gray, on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rolin chrome

Finally I'm in the mix, ridin' twenty four's or twenty six
My neck and my wrist lite, with' out me sellin' a brick
Tv's in the roof and the dashboard and I'm watchin' a flick
Rollin' with my pistol in my lap and I'm cockin' if
I spy somethin' suspicious in my rear view mirror when I'm creepin'
If you plan on jackin' me I plan on leavin' you sleepin'
I be in different vehicle cause I'm havin' thangs
King of the ghetto entertainment got me havin' change
You can smell it on me, even tho quite, the way I live it be tellin' on me
Don't get twisted I'm still a felon homie
Thinkin' you goin' to rob me that's a N O
And when I'm in N O I roll with god and as always Mr.Marsello
And they be with me when they in Texas don't par take it as a spy
Harlum nights in stores where they drop it like it's hot
So if your tryin' to call me and I don't answer my phone
I can't hear it cause my music to loud I'm bangin' on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on (holdin' on)
I'll keep rolin chrome (yaah)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (yes I am)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (I'm rollin chrome)
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on (is what I'm holdin on)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (S.U.C.)

Christopher Watson,"You muthafuckas think we gonna stop keepin' on
We shall prevail 
Muthafuckas fear what they do not understand
And what they do not understand they try and destroy
Come on now

I hear 'em whisperin' in corners speakin' dirty talk on us
Bout how we too grown up, that we unknowners 
And my persona is rock 'n rollish yo' nigga told us
Every word that you quoted 

Said I wouldn't be the one that sold it, but ha we exploded
I'm that rap nigga that you heard with 2Pac, Sole
Lynch and Bo, Wake Up Show wit King Tech and Sway
Yukmouth, Thicker Than Water, Gang Related, Eminem

Roger Trout, MC Ren, nigga Spice-1 and them
Hit 'em wit a venom send 'em down kill 'em when I spit
When I get a bit of scrilla Tech is givin niggas shit
Love 'em love us but the playa hatin niggas betta split

It'll neva be another Tecca Nina when I quit
You better kneel when you hear a nigga that's real 
I feel 18 when I bust from the grill 
Because, (if you keep it young)

Yo song is always sung 
So street life taught me to keep 'em sprung
God sent me to kill, lyrical scripts
The miracle whipped you demons and hatas who tripped

Listen I really feel, my Villainty real when he spit
Fuck them plus anybody they go get, and shit

You can pray and pray on my downfall
When I rise like the sun I ain't fuckin' wit y'all
I'ma keep on, keepin' on, keep on, holdin' on

The storm consumes all the sun and moon fall 
When you saw the mega morion dregorian Jet and are you Paul's
Extreme case of blue balls cuz you bang
Got fruit all in his veins 

What I'm sayin' is I will reign murder you all in his name
Biss malla wit the fist in a pistola 
Dismiss the kiss from a hiss giva
Wrist slita male bitch or witch wit a twist

A glitch man abyss swimma, trick
I will never slide, never fall, never fail
Never the devils side, ever call, never hell
But I got these muthafuckas prayin' for my downfall

But the orange hair means time to clown y'all
Thanks to Jenny I'll get the message to many
The circus is comin' and gunnin' wit plenty
I heard that Bakari got a poster of me burnin'

To get his earnin' concernin' not I killed him but he ain't learnin'
Nigga you couldn't burn me wit acid or in a fiery pit
You couldn't burn in a volcano were lava is spit 
You couldn't burn me if you damned me to hell where Satan sit
The only way you can burn me is wit ya bitch nigga

Why don't you niggas keep ya mouth shut 
Without us you clout sucks you doubt us and get ya mouth bust
We veterans and better then you young cheesy cheddar men
Bouncin' across the nation and you home watchin' Letterman

I'm the nigga that got 'em listenin' I know its sickenin'
To know I'm the nigga got girlies coochie glistenin'
From listenin' to my shit and when I get her for christenin'
She splits again cuz I made her spit the nitro glycerin

I'm on you, callin' me a old negro
But I don't know a young nigga that could hold me though 
Plus the dough be low, average and I hold the glow
But they want me to fall so they can say ""I told you so""

But if I'm mutli punks would say I just lucked up
Keep talkin' that shit might getcha fucked up
You some Jimmy Rucker Tommy Tucker type of muthafuckas
Glamorize and specialize in gettin' butt fucked

Niggas think they dope then gonna try to check me
I'm here to let yo ass know you need to respect me
Although you ain't sayin shit you gettin' on my nerves
I'ma keep on keepin' on mufucka that's word

They say I don't fit in
But I won't listen

You can say what you wanna 
I'ma come up on a 
Life from livin' gutta 
I have to be no otha
Keep on, keepin' on, keep on, holdin' on
Keep on, keepin' on, keep on, holdin' on

So now do you understand?
Is the picture clearly?
Heh...fuck y'all niggas",Keep on Keepin' On,2002
Christopher West,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay

Christopher West,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Christopher Williams,"Boy all I see is you and me
And all I do is think of you
Yo I remember when we met the whole scene was set
Backstage rockin' black shades
Told you not to be afraid
We touched, then your smile turned to a blush
I had to get to know your name
Then I got your number
seventeen  and under, maybe just a little younger
Had to get to know cause there's things I got to show you
Forget them other brothers they know lines that they told you
Now your acting all shy, hmm I wonder why
Everytime I look at you, you turn and drop your eye
We faced, began to lace you up with lines
Fragrance by Ann Klein had me loosing my mind
With your zodiac sign, my perfect match in fact
I'm compatible with anything from Mio to Ash
Now it's all about uus cause we're hooked like drug
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

Boy all I see is you and me
And all I do is think of you
Give me the chance to know your name
I'll never turn and walk away
I can't get you out of my mind
I'd be lying,
If I said I wasn't hooked after just one look
Yeah see you at the mall with your mom looking all flashy
Poppin' out of a taxi, met eyes when you passed me
Been inside of my head all day
What can I say?
All I can do is reminisce like Mary J
I want to get with you
So come and get with me
We'll be K-I-S-S-I-N-G
And all that good stuff
Calling you bluff, now look at us

Just met and already talkin' 'bout trust
All the things we did
How we planned to live
How you got rid of that kid, who use to call you crib
Shut it down
Now look what you found state of dawn
You da bomb, plus you got props from my mom
Now it's all about uus cause we're hooked like drugs
I'm on my way to being a thug, show me love

Think about you all of the time
Got to get to know you babe, baby, oh
I'm glad I made my move
I'm glad I stepped to you
Enough respect that my whole crew excepted you
Even my ex called you
She wasn't insecure
Feeling she got a little hurt but was being mature
Gave her blessing
She learned a valuable lesson
Now she's my best friend
Don't even stress, Cause all I see is you and me
Like Latifah you're queen lets bring some unity
Ain't no reason to fight, We're always keeping it tight
Whether walking or holding hands or sharing seats on the bike
Always on my mind with your Gucci design
Feel free to drop a line, yeah that would suit me fine
It's all about you boo, and all the things you do
Making dreams come true, buying rings for two
Now it's all about uus cause we're hooked like drugs

Have you ever seen a po pimp with eyes as pretty as this 
And still be the rawest, spittin' flawless game while I get my G's 
I hit my B's, pullin' up on fees I bet I get piece 
'Cause I'm impressin', lovin', when I'm kissin' and huggin' 
All into good rushin', touchin', better roll when I flush 'em 
I'm causin' concussion, sportin' pellet, come here baby 
My way will change, I used to kinda rugged my day 
Let's dance, while we get our groove on I get known 
If it's on, then Lexus she gon' get home 
First get bucked up and sip on 
G on the room and drink po wine up in the whirlpool 
Don't leave my comb and pearl too 
Leavin', let the girl cool my world, ooh 
I like to get down, straight up you're freaky 
You want to meet me, just beep me, take the ? and weakling 
Drop the top and leave haters wishin' the ?

I treat you precious as diamond rings, so don't cut me up 
I start the fussin', I'm a get the bustin', now no thang, I gotta give it up 
'Cause all your love can make the hardest thug cry like a dove 
Pull my mink over your shoulders when we leave out the club 
Ain't no need to knock a con, I'm feelin' like Chaka Kahn 
She the bomb like Lebanon, still fine with no Revlon 
Just let the Don inside, I promise pleasure and sweat 
I guarantee you ain't gon' be no regrets

Don't hurt me, take it easy girl, we on the E-Way 
You know you met me when I crashed the bar 
And why'd you kissin' on my neck, I'm 'bout to crash the car 
So pass the 'la, relax baby it ain't far 
Since you started askin' me questions on gossip about stars 
Girl you better be on script on who you with 
She's been forcin' Liffy Stokes from the mobsta click 

I'm chillin' at the click, with nums getting numb, I bumps 
Tryin' to find a cutie to kickin' with, watch the risin' sun 
Here she comes with them big legs, no fat on the back 
What's up shorty, can we kick it tonight and choke on the sack 
Come see as I foreplay, freaky at this slow-ass track 
Big and black, had attention ready to dig in that 
So what we just met, that don't mean I won't give you respect 
I just fight the temptation to get your body real wet 

Ah, keep givin' them hand claps, baby 
Watch them speakers be harmed 
And the bass be soft, ooh 
Ah, keep givin' them hand claps, baby 
Watch them speakers be harmed 
And the bass be soft, ooh

'Cause on the way up to my condo, your ears pop 
When I hit the lock I'm a villain, the mobstas make the killin' 
As we lay on my waterbed with the mirrors on the ceiling 
The wall too, got friends that's all true, I call Cru 
Tryin' to fall too, I got tall brew, it's all you 
Or like I be, let's shoot up to the club, like two tattoos 
VIP, who gets who, no dancing with two left shoes 
Do that fool, do that, do that, who that creeps on my hood 
Do I see my nigs thuggin' but, dawg, y'all lookin' good 
Ballers please, it's a straight playas party, can't fuck with these 
Champagne and Henessies for my G's and stuck a piece, and uh 
Haters please, no bustin' we up in place 
Put 'em in the trunk, the flame 
When I'm tryin' to get up with ""what's her name"" 
The precious tonight I met, let's ride, I feel this like a set 
While you're dancing, I'm a kiss off the sweat 
That's how you let me get it wet

Christos Rafalides,"Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

There's little hope but the fool that I am 
Still holding on to this dream of a man

You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

Christy Moore,"Two island swans mated for life,
And his faithful heart would not consider any other wife.
For three years peaceful joy midst the rushes of the pond,
Proud and gentle was the loving of the last two island swans.

Their love was like a circle, no beginning and no end,
With his lady by his side a treasure and best friend.
And the pond was all so peaceful with the rising of the sun,
Young and free like the island breeze their life was just begun.

'Til a dread day in November when the searing cold did start,
Stalked the hunter with his bow, he put an arrow through her heart.
Husband come to my side let your feathers warm my pain,
For I feel I will not spend another day with you again.

And the cold winds blow,
He was brave but he's laid low.
By her body in the isle of mist,
I saw him give her one last cold kiss,
One last cold kiss.

Of swans the people talk of only one in this days tide,
They brought him twenty ladies he would take no other bride.
They say he will not move from the place where she did fall,
Once so proud he's beaten now, he will not speak at all.

And the cold winds blow,
He was brave but he's laid low.
By her body in the isle of mist,
I saw him give her one last cold kiss,

Christy Moore,"One summer evening drunk as hell
I sat there nearly lifeless.
An old man in the corner sang,
Where the water lilies grow.
On the jukebox Johnny sang,
About a thing called love.
And it's ""how are you kid? What's your name?
And what do you know?""

In blood and death 'neath a screaming sky
I lay down on the ground.
The arms and legs of other men
Were scattered all around.
Some prayed and cursed, then cursed and prayed
And then they prayed some more.
And the only thing that I could see,
Was a pair of brown eyes they were looking at me.
When we got back, labeled parts one to three,
There was no fairer brown eyes waiting for me.

And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,
A rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,
And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,
For a pair of brown eyes,
For a pair of brown eyes.

I looked at him he looked at me,
All I could do was hate him.
While Ray and Philomena sang,
Of my elusive dream.
I saw the streams and the rolling hills,
Where his brown eyes were waiting.
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes,
That waited once for me,
That waited once for me.

So drunk as hell I left the place,
Sometimes walking, sometimes crawling.
A hungry sound came through the breeze,
So I gave the walls a talking.
And I heard the sounds of long ago,
From the old canal.
And the birds were whistling in the trees,
Where the wind was gently laughing.

And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,
A rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,
And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,
For a pair of brown eyes,
For a pair of brown eyes.",A Pair of Brown Eyes,1987
Christy Moore,"I'm an ordinary man, nothing special nothing grand
I've had to work for everything I own
I never asked for a lot, I was happy with what I got
Enough to keep my family and my home

Now they say that times are hard and they've handed me my cards
They say there's not the work to go around
And when the whistle blows, the gates will finally close
Tonight they're going to shut this factory down
Then they'll tear it d-o-w-n

He still drives a car and smokes his cigar
And still he takes his family on a cruise, he'll never lose

Now my cheque is spent and I can't afford the rent

And you can't live on love, on love alone
So you sail cross the ocean, away cross the foam

Good for nothing but stacking a brick
Your best mate's a spade and he carries a hod
Two work horses heavily shod

I'd give all for the price of a flight
Oh I'm missing you
Under Piccadilly's neon

Who did you murder, are you a spy?
I'm just fond of a drink helps me laugh, helps me cry
So I just drink red biddy for a permanent high
I laugh a lot less and I'll cry till I die

All ye young people now take my advice
Before crossing the ocean you'd better think twice
Cause you can't live without love, without love alone
The proof is round London in the nobody zone

No-one had ever seen such a terrible[ sight before
The world looked on with eyes wide to see where it
Might lead
The politics of power, they passed around their seed
It was a time to remember, we never can forget
They were playin' Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Russian
Roulette

They arose like the saviours of our modern human race
With radiation haloes, that hung about their face

Speaking always of the enemy, who lurked across the
Sea
While they crept in among us like a carrier disease

Lead
Einstein's disciples working steadily ahead
Making heavy metal power-plants to fire the city
Lights
All you can hear in the underground is the humming
Through the night
And the walls of tight security, circle all around
Where they spill out their poison and bury it in the
Ground

Holed up in the harbours hidden secretly away

War-heads and submarines await to make their play
The military masterminds improve on their design
The soldiers get all doped up and stumble through the
Lines
While the spills into the rivers get carried out by the
Tide
They call this security but we're not satisfied

Our statesmen and leaders and politicians pay
Quick to heed the hand that feeds, they're careful what
They say
They call out experts to assure us, to wave their magic
Wands

On
And they call in their favours, all their political
Gains
While the spills fill the rivers and settle in the
Plains

I know the minds behind them, they are riddled full of
Holes
Not to be trusted with their hands at the controls
Their eyesight it is twisted by the glory of their
Careers
The heaped praise and flattery is music to their ears
To listen to them talk about how it hasn't happened
Yet's
Like playing Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Russian Roulette",Hiroshima Nagasaki Russian Roulette,2006

And feel your hand across the water
Walk with you along an unapproved road
Not looking over my shoulder

I want to see, and I want to hear
To understand your fears
But we're north and south of the river

I've been doing it wrong all of my life
This holy town has turned me over
A young man running from what he didn't understand
The wind from the loch just get colder, colder

There was a badness that had it's way
But love wasn't lost, love will have it's day
North and south of the river
North and south of the river

Can we stop playing these old tattoos
Darling I don't have the answer
I want to meet you where you are
I don't need you to surrender

'Cause there's no feeling that's so alone
As when the one you're hurting is your own

Some connections are not worth making

Christy Moore,"In a neat little town they called Belfast 
Apprentice to trade I was bound
And many an hour's sweet happiness
Have I spent in that neat little town

As sad misfortune came over me
Which caused me to stray from the land
Far away from me friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band

Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

I took a stroll down broadway
Meaning not long for to stay
When who should I meet but this pretty fair maid
Come a-traipsing along the highway

She was both fair and handsome
Her neck, it was just like a swan
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid
And a gentleman passing us by
Well, I knew she meant the doing of him
By the look in her roguish black eye

A gold watch she took from his pocket
And placed it right into my hand
And the very first thing that I said, was
Bad 'cess to the black velvet band

Her eyes they shown like diamonds
I thought her the queen of the land
And her hair, it hung over her shoulder
Tied up with a black velvet band

Before the judge and the jury
Next morning, I had to appear
The judge, he says to me
""Young man, you're case it is proven clear

We'll give you seven years penal servitude
To be spent far away from the land
Far away from your friends and relations
Betrayed by the black velvet band""

And her hair, it hung over her shoulder

A warning take by me
When you are out on the town, me lads
Beware of the pretty Colleens

They'll feed you with strong drink, me lads

And the very first thing that you'll know is
You've landed in Van Diemens Land

You shone like the sun
Shine on you crazy diamond
Now there's a look in your eyes

Blown on the steel breeze
Come on you target for faraway laughter
Come on you stranger

You martyr

You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the moon

Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light

Well, you wore out your welcome
With random percision
Rode on the steel breeze

Come on you painter
You piper
You prisoner

Pile on many more years
And I'll be joining you there

Come on you miner for truth and delusion

Now ain't that some shit ya hatin' on this click
You gon' make a nigga get up with cha kid
Split yo wig oh yes, I did

I done warned the glock spot to spot hit the locks
Hit a nigga for his stash spot
Took the rock nigga was got that was the plot
Dodge the cops they labeled it another closing shop

Open it up for closin' it up I don't give a fuck
On a daily basis I be postin' it up
Smokin' it up choppin' it to match it wit dub

But ya'll know ya'll done heard all that befo'
Y'all done seen the fo-fos and folks kick in ya doe

You done seen the gauge pump bout to see a Chevy trunk
Lights out next to the Mississippi river plumped
Duck tape hog tied wrong place wrong time
Hypnotized minds trick knocked ya up off ya grind

Get yo ass flipped sideways cut ya through the doe

Candy ass nigga boy you softer than cotton
Fight me or squash it 'cause I ain't 'bout the spit boxin'
Hootin and hollerin' like a cheerleader squadron

You can't be like me slangin' D 'cause I'm hurtin' ya
No competition with the juice 'cause it's curtains
It ain't nothin' shakin' but some pimps in this bizitch
That's why you muggin' and yo face lookin' pizzissed

Stay flippin' cars ballin' out like to shizine
You stay askin' questions how the hell them niggaz do that
We smoke the best of dro while she down with some jack-jack
My eyes like the red carpet still on the blue side

They locked me up just like 2Pac and I went platinium
Laid it down for a calendar I'm right back at 'em
Took my game then weighed it up on a triple beam
Niggaz rob, kill, murder steal for that ghetty green

U.S. marshal at my folks house want to kill me dead
Wanna see me in a pine box bullet in my head
I'm was like, ""I ain't did shit why you hatin' this?""
Ghetto thugs know my rap songs they relate to this

I been doin' this too long to still be strugglin' livin' like this
Fuckin' off with major labels slayed me like a bitch
And these got cheese and ride on rolls it mean hoes
But still on the road doin' free shows

Tryna get a few spins in a few spots
I growed up back in the day I wouldn't use my glock
I hear a lotta corny shit on the radio
That's because they record company wouldn't spend dough

Yeah, my label got a hook up with MTV
But they just keep forgettin' to tell 'em 'bout me
They try to play like its love and it's family
But all my marketin' dollars goin' to, shh

When she's gone to a better place
And loneliness will hurt you if you can't get through the night
Then the moment starts to fade
And dawn is just an hour away
I feel she's watching over and it gets me through the night

It makes me wonder what you'd say
It's taking me back to the month of May
When I watched you do it (All night)
I'm thinking back to what we'd share
In many ways I'm already there
And I watched you do it

Don't turn the lights on
'Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark
Don't turn the lights on
'Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark
Don't turn the lights on
'Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark
Don't turn the lights on
'Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark

Another walk to take
Another lonesome evening spent without you there
And only those who hurt you
Will say patience is a virtue
And it's been so long
And I can't think about it
No, I can't figure it out
It's just the way you're feeling
Every time that you're appealing
Leaves no room for doubt

It makes me wonder what you'd say
It's taking me back to the month of May
When I watched you do it (All night)

Deep down you're mad, you think I did my share
It's so unfair to put the blame on me
You made a mistake, now Shorty can't you see?

Are you selfish, or do you wanna be free?
You have your ways and I can't tell you how to be
You have your morals and you know what's right from wrong

A smoky atmosphere
I had nothing to fear
The night was young
A message loud and clear
She spoke into my ear
My heart was stung

So I looked to the left, looked to the right
Only one girl was outta sight
And I wanted her
It's just one of those types of memories
And I'm still thinking of her

Don't let me play the fool, yeah
And get carried away (carried away)
Don't let me play the fool, yeah
And get carried away
Because I might end up fooling around with you
Yeah, I might end up fooling around with you

And the sparks are flying, it's no wonder why
And the lights are shining bright enough
They're almost blinding my eye
I feel like my fate and your fate are combined
On the floor tonight
'Cause no one escapes from lust

Yeah, I might end up fooling around with you
Yeah, I might end up fooling around with you

Chromeo,"An electrifying moment
A blast of lightning through the storm
Should have seen it as an omen

This is what those tales are made of
It was rather true to form
A boy sees girl then his knees just drop
Heartbeat stops

I care for you
And I'll switch the word up if you want me to
I care for you
But caring is so see-through
The sequel is a thing we call love

I can't leave you alone
It's rattling my bones
I can feel it

I'm sweating but my hands are dry
Say the word and I'm the first one running
I'm the first one running

And every little move you make is no mistake
So don't just take me for a pretender
I'm a contender

You face interferences with an aim for fearlessness

With eyes wide open it can be so hard to live in this world today

memories of yesterdays
the years'll pass by but they'll never bring me back to you

a better way

when i wasn't afraid
to carry the weight of you

you are the earth that makes mud that comes from rain that made the flood
we cycle in and out of what our lives are capable of

Everything was just fine
She must have waited to cave in
On that day nine

Say goodbye to you my friend
Say goodbye

Ten, nine, eight, seven
Sixth day before I left
We pretended things were fine
Even though the ninth day cave was acting as both our minds
Fifth day and counting
Well she found it astounding
When I told her I didn't want to miss her while she was in my surroundings
The fourth day was new with her
Same question asked again
Once you're gone how long 'til I get my depth perception back again?
At that I had the same flabbergasted face for most of the third and second
Days
The final day before I left came and I still had nothing to say

The fifth day after I had left I was trying to adjust and she came
The sixth day she was stuck looking for sparks but couldn't see the flame
The seventh day I fell asleep in the fire that we had made
She woke me up and I said goodbye and we were never the same

Well obviously waiting on honesty hurts worse
Than arguing over how much the dirt's worth

Can turn to a flat line from hospitalized bird chirps
Would you line up with me to be the first cursed

Been saving truth in a pile
Standing in front of it

And when you're in my way
I'm not dividing me from you cause we're working together

Once responsibility is taken I can render
Experience to be however I want to remember

Time and time again we fall in to the depths of who we are
But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find

Enter experiences you normally wouldn't dare to go
It's all for the character and the arrogant afterglow
Of knowing it's appearance according to your patterns of growth
And what your parents handed down to you to handle
Make sure you carry torches when their putting out your candles
Predictions can be unkind but unwind them still
Don't erase the part of you that's responsible for your will

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Well I've seen you and those things you do
And the way you hide that shadow can't be good for you
Your dark defines your light

There's some utterly damaged particles to deal with
And if I stutter I'm sorry but it's hard to feel swift
When stuck in my stomach is a cannon ball anchor to lift
I've been pushing it down pretending it doesn't exist
Well this is what happens when you're pissed about being pissed
You dig yourself so deep you resist just to resist
And there's no way to get back experiences you missed

You can run away 
But you can't escape
All these wicked games

You're impossible like ignoring the habit of breathing
I'm expendable to you completed then superseded

I insist it ends
My circumstances, burned my chances
The answers want it that way
But I'm still awake
I have opponents
I've got moments to own that know my way

But it still exists and it's still there
You can't escape these wicked games

Go through your pain and struggle but maintain the knowing
Of what'll come to you showing, it's all right
There's plenty around to drown you
Pronounciate found to all that surround you

Give them all flight
Running away is a stain 
In the mud a brain stem with a plug
When you get there you don't know why you came

You end up going where your knowing
Is showing in different form 
But inside you feel the same
There's always someone else to blame


Now this was a long, long time ago
When music was loved on the radio
Before my birth, I'm not that old
Bands didn't have to pay the radio to be sold

I'm told, it was quite a day
To have a station have a dj
Not have a play list of what he'd play
Or a PD wanting it their way

Just a love for tunes and comparison
Now we just compare embarrassment
It's such a scare this carelessness
It's not awareness, it's harassment

Cherish this choice that we have
Not to listen if it gets bad
Not to listen if it's  add
Don't have to bitch and kick and get sad

That it takes ten days of supervision
For you to find a good song to listen
I got mine new to tradition
Let's just break this new tradition

Place your blame on a taste of fame
Play the same way, a faceless name would play the game

Especially when they know that you're out looking to sign dots

But it's her dream to ride the conveyer belt of that side walk
She's got intentions of being number one
But can she handle rejection in the city of no sun
Where bricks change colors faster than careers do
And few people drive away and like what's in their rearview

And with what her folks make
You know she'd have stability
She just needs to get out there
And step toward her validity

Because it's just killing me
She's not used to foot steps digging in her chest
High heeled investments and suites getting undressed
Growing old and having new recruits become the best
And finding that she's stepped on everyone and no one's left

Smashing ideas with open skin
Till the pearl white drops of blood turn red
And everyone can tell
That you've worked hard enough

And don't think about how much time you're fixing to spend

Crips and slugs, the trigger happiest thugs
Claiming the slums, and all the hoods that they from
Too much of the some, got it twisted up blinded in a rat race
Cash straight, the fake kill jake, the snakes too late
My eyes dilate, and I could tell them how he strafe
Coming at me sideways, get straighten up
Don't deflate it up gimmie the bucks my cash wrinkling up
Looking back in the days, amazed
Cause the lab rat done made it out the maze
Still feel caged, enraged though
Used the underground railroad like a runaway slave
Broke off the chains still runway fresh
Got you on that mental plane with my project jet
I'm two steps above that nimbus cloud
My limit is low, when I'm smoking on that loud
Focus in the now, when the lotus is around
It's the Brooklyn sound, a pro found, Biggie would be proud about
But I don't need a vet to even shop me out
Punchlines pack a Pacquiao they can't box me out

Had to keep calm and hold ma corner

Of living in a city with a thousand dons
A thousand ghetto youts with a thousand guns

You need to hear about beautiful black things 'cause
Most time we hear about black, we hear about black magic and black witches
Black list, black book, black market
Black Friday, ya spend off your black riches
I've never seen a doctor in black nor seen a black pill fi cure no black people
But I've seen bush doctors like Tosh and Marley resurrect like a real black beatle
Malcom, Marcus, Martin
When you see Walter Rodney ask him
How you nuh hear about Howell often
So when the little offspring asking, tell them

They never told us that black is beautiful
They never told us, black is beauty
They never told us that black is beautiful
They never told us, they never told us black is beautiful

You ah behave and ah gwaan like you never spend 500 years pon a farm
The same chain you ah wear and a gwaan is another black life in Sierra Leone
Dem find out mama earth got gold then
Dem mine out mama earth black soul then
You work hard just fi get ah black card
Same card weh you swipe buy back your black gold then
Hol' on, I see nuff faces long
But this is not a racist song
This is a song for the children who was never told about where their race is from
They never hear it in dem favourite songs
Everybody calm, ah say slavery's done
What a go gwaan when the babies come
And start read 'bout things like
Dogons, black Kemet and Kush
Black kings, black senates and books
Weh teach 'bout pyramids and put
Real significance to we physical looks
So every word weh mi say black
In my world everything black
Black white, white black right back
So don't be surprised when mi say mi king black

They never told us, black is beauty
They never told us that black is beautiful

The problems which confront us today are unprecedented 
They have no counterparts in human experience 
Men search the pages of history for solutions, for precedents, but there are none
This, then, is the ultimate challenge
Where are we to look for our survival?
For the answers to the questions which have never before been posed?

We must look, first, to Almighty
Who has raised man above the animals and endowed him with intelligence and reason
And we must look into ourselves, into the depth of our souls 
We must become something we have never been
And for which our education and experience and environment have ill-prepared us 
We must become bigger than we have been
More courageous, greater in spirit, larger in outlook
We must become members of a new race, overcoming petty prejudice 
Owing our ultimate allegiance not to nations but to our fellow men within the human community",Hardcore [Remix],2017

Kiss me. Kiss me, sweet innamorata
*Hold me close and say you're mine
With a love as warm as wine

Want you more and more, innamorata
You're a symphony, the very beautiful sonata
My innamorata; say that you're my sweetheart, my love

Chrous,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,2002
