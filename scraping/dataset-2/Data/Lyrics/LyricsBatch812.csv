Paloma Faith,"We want to use our vote, so then, we just vote
So we vote
But we don't, we're not actually, I feel like we're not actually being heard
We're just kind of being patted on the head, and quietened, yeah absolutely

We really care about these things, that's why we're here, that's why we're getting together in force
To be here and to say something, to show you, to show you and to make a change
But then we really kind of, we're just, pawns in this life
And you're like, allowing us to have our playtime
It's like, relax, water's down there in its impact, doesn't it?",Pawns,2017
Paloma Faith,"The rights and freedoms that we have today were won by your mothers
Your fathers, your grandmothers, your grandfathers, your ancestors before them
We stand on the shoulders of giants and we owe it to our ancestors
Not just to defend the rights and freedoms that they fought for at such cost 
And at such sacrifice, that continue their struggle that a different sort of society
Not a society run in the interests of a tiny elite
But a society run in the interests of the majority
Those who preach the politics of despair
They want us to believe that all injustice is like the weather
That you can complain about it raining but there's nothing you can do about it
But the politics of hope tell us something else",Politics of Hope,2017
Paloma Faith,"Poison are you lips when you're kissing me
But I don't wanna give it up
Why do I do this to myself, when I know you're not good enough?
Say that I could break it off with you
Oh, like I have the choice
I try to run away, but my legs don't work when they hear your voice

And your love is stuck to me like sadness to the blues
Try to shake it but my stomach is tied up in knots at the thought of you

And I don't know why I do the things that I do
I don't know why I can't say no
I don't know why I'm so hung up on you
I can't leave when I can't let go
I don't know why I've given you the power
To lift me up so high then drop me down
And I don't know
Why I'm still around

A bad habit I can't quit
Give it to me, I need it
So hung up, you got me addicted
Never thought I'd be obsessed until I met you
Now I can't let you go

And your love is stuck to me like sadness to the blues
Try to shake it but my stomach is tied up in knots at the thought of you

And I don't know why I do the things that I do
I don't know why I can't say no
I don't know why I'm so hung up on you
I can't leave when I can't let go
I don't know why I've given you the power
To lift me up so high then drop me down
And I don't know
Why I'm still

No one's worth your tears
And the one that is won't make you cry (make you cry)
So it's time I packed my bags and left, said my goodbye
'Cause it's not my fault
It's time I say no, I'm gonna let go
It's got to be you who's high and dry

I don't know why I do the things that I do
I don't know why I can't say no
I don't know why I'm so hung up on you
I can't leave when I can't let go
I don't know why I've given you the power
To lift me up so high then drop me down

And I don't know
Why I'm still
And I don't know
Why I'm still
And I don't know
Why I'm still around",Still Around,2017
Paloma Faith,"Saw you on my street again, in the shadows
Innocent, I found you
I found you
A victim of your circumstance
I just didn't have the heart to leave you
I couldn't leave you
You've seen too much hurt and pain
You say you won't love again
But you will
Oh, you will

Suddenly, there's nothing that I wouldn't do

Let go, surrender
Just stay with me
Lie low, surrender
Don't go, don't leave

Heavy rest your heart and soul
I can be the light that will surround you
I will surround you
I can wipe those tears away
You should know that I will stay beside you
I'll stay beside you

Suddenly, there's nothing that I wouldn't do

Let go, surrender
Just stay with me
Lie low, surrender
Don't go, don't leave

Suddenly, there's nothing that I wouldn't do

Lie low
Surrender
We're both pretenders
Please stay with me

Give yourself up to the fight
Everything will be alright
Healing strangers, what we're working for

Let go, surrender
Just stay with me
We're both pretenders
Please stay with me

Let go, surrender
Just stay with me",Surrender,2017

Solid gold survivor, that's my attitude

Baby, don't ask me to be strong for you as well

Paloma Faith,"Break down, tears fall to the ground
Tell myself, do it, nothing can be found
When you're a fighter
You're a fighter
You're a fighter, fight on baby

Some days I'm sure I lose to fate
Some days I cannot find my faith
But I just fight on
I just fight on
I just fight on baby, baby

And I am a wounded warrior
And now that the enemy is closing in
I am a wounded warrior
Looking for someone to let me in

Black and blue, I'm begging you
Take me in, I'm surrendering
Black and blue, but if I'm with you
If I'm with you, I'll live to fight on through

I'll let go, walk into the unknown

Paloma Faith,"What kind of man gets a thrill from the life he's taken?
How many times can you turn and pretend to see?
Heaven is ours if we want, but we're not courageous

I've had enough, I'm calling you out

Hold up my hands, I swear we're in World War 3
There ain't no peace left here between you and me
These bombs keep blowing when no one's watching
And through my tears I look to the sky and scream
We're in World War 3 (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
We're in World War 3 (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

I'm innocent for my crime and I want my freedom
You shoot me down 'cause you need someone else you can blame
When will it end, when the whole damn world's been beaten?

I've had enough, I'm calling you out

Hold up my hands, I swear we're in World War 3
There ain't no peace left here between you and me

And through my tears I look to the sky and scream

Over and over, we keep repeating
Frozen in history, time stands still
Over and over, this is a nightmare
Nobody's listening
Kill, kill, kill

Hold up my hands, I swear we're in World War 3
There ain't no peace left here between you and me

Si estoy sola pienso en ti, entre la gente pienso en ti
Me doy cuenta que no se vivir sin ti

Nadie como tú, en mi vida
Nadie como tú, en mis sueños

O que me llame a cualquier hora
Solo para saber como estoy

Pienso en ti cada día, cada noche
Pienso en ti, cuando llueve o sale el sol
O si escuchó una canción, simplemente
Todo me recuerda a tí

Y al viento las campanas
Dirán que ya eres mía
Y locas las fontanas
Se contaran su amor

La noche que me quieras
Desde el azul del cielo
Las estrellas celosas
Nos miraran pasar
Y un rayo misterioso
Hará nido en tu pelo

Que vera que eres mi consuelo

Será clara la aurora
Y alegre el manantial
Traerá quieta la brisa

Y nos darán las fuentes

Florecerá la vida

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

I found an old fashioned log cabin so beautiful there to behold
A stranger was standing in silence his eyes firmly fixed on the door
My heart ached in pity to see him for these were the words that it bore
And the sign read An Old Log Cabin For Sale an oaken bucket and well
Easy terms just keep a log on the fire and a light burning bright in the dell
Many years an old couple so patiently looked for their boy who's last promise did fail
Now the old rocking chair will be rocking no more there's an old log cabin for sale

A welcome I read on the floormat an old braided rug by the door
The hands of an angel had made it with many a prayer prayed before
In an old rocking chair on she waited for one glimpse of him how she yearned
But now he was standing in silence too late yes too late he'd returned
And the sign read...

A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Pam Pameijer,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,

That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here

And if you don't mind the thorns, she'll take you in and keep you warm,
Lying in the dark in a bed of broken hearts, 'cause...

Pam Tillis,"My eyes may be hollow
My face may be pale
I may just be a shadow of my former self
But tonight the ghost of heartaches past
Is steppin' into town
Gonna haunt the places where we used to hang around

Draggin' my chains
Draggin' my chains
Movin' in slow motion but it's motion just the same
Pulling the weight of yesterday's pain
I may not be free yet, but
I'm draggin' my chains

Some chains are made of gold
Some chains are made of steel
Just 'cause you can't see these chains

Until I find the weakest line in your memory
I'll be a prisoner of love tryin' to break free",Draggin' My Chains,1991
Pam Tillis,"I know it was pretty strange timing and maybe the odds were bad
We were awkward as a couple of left-footed dancers, baby we were pretty sad
You tried to tell me that it just wouldn't work
Your heart was too far gone
And it might have been easier to leave you alone

I've seen enough to know, a heart worth savin'
Enough to know, a chance worth takin'
Even though you're tryin' not to let it show
There's a part of you that's dyin', dyin' to let go
And I've seen enough to know, I've seen enough to know

There's a light in your eyes and a warmth to your touch that wasn't there yesterday
And there's a crack in the wall that you've built around your heart 
And it's startin' to give way
It's taken time, it's taken patience waiting in the dark
But my intuition's been right on the money so far

I've seen enough to know, a heart worth savin'
Enough to know, a chance worth takin'
Even though you're tryin' not to let it show

Pam Tillis,"A baby with a baby just barely seventeen
My mother mourned her innocence
While she bounced me on her knee
A daddy on the road added to her tears and trials
Like silver rain they fell upon this melancholy child

The sounds of my childhood still linger in my song
My mother's lullaby that train that ran behind our home
A whippoorwill on a window sill - It should have made me smile
But everything sounds lonesome to a melancholy child

Now a restless blood runs in our family
I thought I could out run the emptiness inside of me
So I went a little crazy, went a little wild
Trying to outdistance my own melancholy child

I met a kind and gentle man who thinks the world of me
And when he looks my way it is a woman that he sees
But when I can't explain to him the tears that fill my eyes
He takes me in his arms and rocks his melancholy child

You take a black Irish temper and some solemn Cherokee
A Southern sense of humour and you got someone like me
There are thorns on every rose to this I'm reconciled 
They're just a little sharper to a melancholy child

And in my own babe's eyes I see the signs of melancholy child

Heaven help us all, another melancholy child",Melancholy Child,1991

Now I'm on the other side of a heartache
And if I can make it baby you can too
May you just need a little help now gettin' through
So before you think of throwin' the towel
Give me a chance to soften your mistake
True love is waitin' just inside these four walls

Then somebody else will

She's a homeward looking angel 
And she's feeling mighty tired

And that girl looking back in the mirror, 
Lord, made such a mess of things
She's leaving in the morning soon 
As she can find her wings,
Soon as she can find her wings

She's so hungry at heart for a piece of Mama's pie
Served up on Grandma's china after church on Sunday night
Papa's probably turning out the light and heading up the stairs
And the wayward child he never talks about 
Still turns up in his prayers

And when he got through, what else could she do

Katydid sing like a symphony
Porch swing swayin' like a Tennessee lullaby
Melody blowing through the willow tree

What was I supposed to do
Standing there lookin' at you
A lonely boy far from home

Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was Southern summer nights
Maybe it was you maybe it was me
But it sure felt right

Read about you in a Faulkner novel
Met you once in a Williams play
Heard about you in a country love song
Summer night beauty took my breath away

What was I supposed to do
Standing there lookin' at you
A lonely boy far from home

Every night now since I've been back home
I lie awake drifting in my memory
I think about you on your momma's front porch swing
Talking that way so soft to me

But come September I'm flying away""
I said ""I'm gonna miss you"" then I made her promise to write

Since we were tall as the corn in the spring
We shared every secret, shared every dream
So anxious to grow in the new summer rain
And bloom like a rose on the calico plains

How could she hear as we laughed on that warm summer night
The tiny heart of the baby she carried inside
I stood beside her when September came
Watched her get married and caught the bouquet
And like those hand me down dresses she gave me
I made her dreams mine

From a seat by the window on wings made of steel
I stared at the patchwork over the fields
Where young tears that once fell like warm summer rain
Were turning to snow on the calico plains

Sweet Abilena looks out at the Midwestern sky
Closer to thirty but farther away in her eyes
She holds her babies like she holds her dreams
Each night she kisses and rocks them to sleep while
She reads the letters she makes me promise to write

Pam Tillis,"You drove up in your pickup truck
That hot September day
Not a wisp of wind in the parking lot
But honey I was blown away

And later on that fall at the Dixie Mall
When I didn't know what to say
I seen hide nor hair of no dynamite
But honey I was blown away

Big sister said ""You'd better watch out""
I slammed my door and said
""You don't know what you're talkin' about""

Mama said I sang when the telephone rang
And she called out ""Honey, it's Ray""
Like a piece of dust on a four lane road
Honey I was blown away

I'm talking 'bout smithereens
Just you in a pair of jeans
Now I know what crazy means

Big sister said ""You'd better watch out""
I slammed my door and said
""You don't know what you're talkin' about""

Then one Tuesday night Daddy said
""Some guy's on the porch with a big bouquet""
You stood there with your slicked-back hair
And honey, I was blown away

And when we slipped out back
Across the railroad track
And you softly touched my face
Well I never did feel a train go by
But honey, I was blown away

No, I never did feel a train go by
But honey, I was blown away",I Was Blown Away,1994

But don't be mistaking my smile

They sway

The sound
But when the song ended the one in my arms 
Let me down

Will you remain, remember my name

And lonely for way too long
And I knew when he made his move
You weren't feeling all that strong
So I bit my tongue 'cause I saw it coming
And you danced so close to him
It's two steps forward and three steps back
When a heart is on the mend

Did you really think that guy hung the moon
Right now you hate yourself 'cause you knew better

Well you just got to pull yourself back up
Dry your morning-after tears

You're forgettin' to give me

You're like fruit from a fickle vine
You turn sweet in the nick of time
Love, you only come alive when you're losin' me
And it's a childish game
I've got to shake you up just to wake you up
To make you love me

I'll shake the sugar tree
Till I feel your love falling
All around me
You've got to tend to what you've planted
And if you take my love for granted baby
I'll shake the sugar tree

I'm awake and I'm dreamin'
Oh honey 'bout the way you used to be
A little time's gone by
Now do you think that I'm content
With the cookin' and the payin' of the rent
No, I want to know if your love's all spent

Till I feel your love falling

There's only one place it grows
On the shady banks of the Tennessee River

There's a door to my dreams and one day you'll walk in
And until that day I'll be true

Never wanted very much out of this world
Just an occasional dinner and a twirl from a regular guy

So Betty sat up one lonely night
Trying to figure out what a man might like
Then like a bolt right out of the blue she got herself a plan

Betty's got a bass boat, Betty's got a truck
All of a sudden things are looking up
She's the most popular girl in town
Since she got a new rifle and a hunting hound
It might be coincidental, just might never know
Oh, but things sure got a lot better
Since Betty got a bass boat

Now lately getting a date isn't all that hard
There's a half a dozen bubbas fighting in the yard
She won 'em all over with her southern charm and a satellite dish

Now Betty can't believe her popularity
She's thinking 'bout marketing her recipe
So ironic that the funny thing is she never even liked to fish

It played on the lake like a mandolin

Another faithless heart
Locked inside a neon tomb
Hiding in the dark and

In a string of bad to worse
Yet the bourbon seems to deaden all that hurts

Sometimes I need atttention when you need left alone
Sometimes you feel like clinging when I feel like being gone

As long as we meet somewhere between a whisper and a scream
Well, I know you'll be listening
And you know I'll be there
Between a whisper and a scream we'll find a prayer

Pam Tillis,"As the fireflies buzzed around him
Like so many dancing stars
God told all the angels from Jupiter to Mars

There's a basket in the river
Bearing something dear to me
Embarking on a journey to fulfill his destiny

A pretty maiden on the banks stood with open arms
God put it in her heart
To keep that baby safe from harm

She said ""Don't matter where you come from
Now you belong to me""
She was wise enough to know
It was simply meant to be

God was there when the firefly lied
At the angel's side
And the maiden's heart as she played her part
As she scooped him up, headed into town

That's the way it all went down
On the way to Holy Ground
Milk and honey bound

One night that little prince was tossed
Into a stormy prophet's dream
And it took a while for him to understand
What he had seen

When that boy became a man
Those dreams they did transpire
He wandered into the desert
Where he talked to a bush of fire

And a voice said
""I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there with you
Deliver my people out of Pharaoh's chains
And I will see you through""

God was there in the prophet's dream
And the sparkled stream that flowed from the rock
In the burning bush, on the mountain top

All across that desert sand
Fingerprints of the master's hand
He cried out 'Pharaoh I'm headin' back to town'
That's the way it all went down
Milk and honey bound

What we believe in
Funny, just the other day
I was walking down the street
Stopped into that place
You know, the one where we used to meet
Thought I heard you call my name
And I whispered on the wind
And I remember you were going,
Never coming back again
But if love is what we believe in
I'll see you in heaven's first bright star
If seeing is believing
I look into the skies and there you are
You're not that far
'Cause love is what we believe in
Looking through some photographs
From not so long ago
Right now, I'd give anything
If I had only known
I would never you touch you, hold you
Or kiss your face
Feel your arms around me
Or fall in your embrace
Now love will break your heart
When you say goodbye
But love is worth the pain
And all tears you cry
And if seeing is believing

I stood there sad and proud and smiled through tears and said goodbye
I gave you boosts, I gave you wings and girl I understand
An eagle can't sit waiting on the wind

If you rise for every challenge, if you run to catch your dreams
That star that you keep reaching for is closer than it seems
Heaven and earth reward all those who try and try again
And will not be caught waiting on the wind

Whatever strength you find in me I thank my father for
His wisdom faith and courage set me on a steady course
And when my sails are empty their words lift me up again
And I will not be caught waiting on the wind

If you rise for every challenge, if you run to catch your dreams
That star that you keep reaching for is closer than it seems
Storms of life may force you to change courses now and then
But never be caught waiting on the wind
Never be caught waiting, never be caught waiting on the wind

Most everybody's doing too much fighting and there's not enough singing going
on
How many people have you ever seen fight while they were singing a song
Most everybody's mistreating one another just fight a personal game
But that wouldn't happen to the sisters and the brothers
When they hold back their heads and sing
Most everybody's doing too much talking talking it and just get mad
So if all that talking's gonna make you unhappy why don't just sing and be glad",Come on and Sing,2002
Pam Tillis,"I wanna go home I wanna go home oh how I wanna go home
Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
And I dreamed about those cottonfields and home
I dreamed about my mother dear old papa sister and brother
I dreamed about that boy who's been waiting for so long

Homefolks think I'm big in Detroit City
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars by night I sing in bars
If only they could read between the lines

Cause you know I rode the freight train north to Detroit City
And after all these years I find I've just been wastin' my time
So I just think I'll take my foolish pride
And put on a Southbound freight and ride
And go on back to the loved ones I left waiting far behind
I wanna go home I wanna go home oh how I wanna go home

A ball of string and a paper dream that I could not make fly
Then daddy pulled it to the sky, behind him as he ran
And said, ""Girl don't be caught waiting on the wind""

The time comes when a young girl wants to leave the nest and fly
I stood there sad and proud and smiled through tears and said goodbye
I gave you boosts, I gave you wings and girl I understand
An eagle can't sit waiting on the wind

If you rise for every challenge, if you run to catch your dreams
That star that you keep reaching for is closer than it seems
Heaven and earth reward all those who try and try again
And will not be caught waiting on the wind

Whatever strength you find in me I thank my father for
His wisdom faith and courage set me on a steady course
And when my sails are empty their words lift me up again
And I will not be caught waiting on the wind

Sent a warrior down from Heaven carrying his mighty sword.

WITH PAMELA ROSE GADD
Writer Shel Silvertstein
Copyright 1972

She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters, they flock around her, and they fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
She arrives in all her splendor every night at nine o'clock
And her chariot is a cross-town bus that stops right down the block
The ol' piano minstrel plays a song as she walks in
And the queen of the Silver Dollar, she's home again
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her, and fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
Her royal gown is a satin dress, that's stained and slightly torn
And her sparkling jewels are rhinestones, and her shoes are scuffed and worn
From the many roads she's travelled and the wonderous sights she's seen
And I watch her and I pray God save the queen
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her, and fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
The queen of the Silver Dollar is not as haughty as she seems
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams
But I found her and I won her, and I brought her to this world
Yes I'm the man who made a queen of a simple country girl
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her, and fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom.......

And perhaps we'll never meet anymore
Till we gather in Heaven's bright city

There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven
By the side of the river of life
(Where the charming roses bloom forever)
(And where separation comes no more)

If we never meet again this side of Heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore

Where no storm clouds ever darken the sky
And they say we'll be happy in Heaven

Pamela Gadd,"While strolling along in the country reviewing the scenes new and old
I found an old fashioned log cabin so beautiful there to behold
A stranger was standing in silence his eyes firmly fixed on the door
My heart ached in pity to see him for these were the words that it bore
And the sign read An Old Log Cabin For Sale an oaken bucket and well
Easy terms just keep a log on the fire and a light burning bright in the dell
Many years an old couple so patiently looked for their boy who's last promise did fail
Now the old rocking chair will be rocking no more there's an old log cabin for sale
[ guitar ]
A welcome I read on the floormat an old braided rug by the door
The hands of an angel had made it with many a prayer prayed before
In an old rocking chair on she waited for one glimpse of him how she yearned
But now he was standing in silence too late yes too late he'd returned
And the sign read...

We were paradise bound

But others took their places
Always strange new faces
Always one more chance to go around

A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!!",Fools Rush In,2006
Pamela Luss,"How do you keep
The music playing?
How do you make it last
How do keep
The song from fading
Too fast

How do you lose yourself
To someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run
Out of new things
To say

And since you know
We're always changing
How can it be the same
And tell me how
Year after year
You're sure your heart
Will fall apart
Each time
You hear her name

I know the way
I feel for you
Is now or never
The more
I love the more
There I'm afraid
That in yours eyes
I may not see forever
Forever

The best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends

Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five but I am still alive.

I was a sailor. I was born upon the tide and with the sea I did abide.
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed but I am living still.

I was a dam builder across the river deep and wide where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around I will always be around

I fly a starship across the Universe divide and when I reach the other side

Pamela Rose,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

I'm tempted, my darling, to steal you away
Don't let me cross over, stay out of my way
You know that I love you but I'm not the stealing kind
And I'm faced with heartaches that love's cheating line

Don't let me cross over love's cheating line

I know one step closer would be heaven divine

Pamela Rose,"QUEEN OF THE SILVER DOLLAR
WITH PAMELA ROSE GADD
Writer Shel Silvertstein
Copyright 1972

She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters, they flock around her, and they fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
She arrives in all her splendor every night at nine o'clock
And her chariot is a cross-town bus that stops right down the block
The ol' piano minstrel plays a song as she walks in
And the queen of the Silver Dollar, she's home again
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her, and fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
Her royal gown is a satin dress, that's stained and slightly torn
And her sparkling jewels are rhinestones, and her shoes are scuffed and worn
From the many roads she's travelled and the wonderous sights she's seen
And I watch her and I pray God save the queen
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her, and fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
The queen of the Silver Dollar is not as haughty as she seems
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams
But I found her and I won her, and I brought her to this world
Yes I'm the man who made a queen of a simple country girl
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom
And her sceptre is a wine glass and a bar-stool is her throne
And the jesters flock around her, and fight to win her favors
And see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
She's the queen of the Silver Dollar, and she rules this smokey kingdom.......

I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)

Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all

Ernie like to chew gum, no, not chew, Pop

Like, I come home this one day and there's Ernie
Layin' on the couch chewin', no, not chewin', poppin'
So, I said to him, I said
""Ernie, you pop that gum one more time"" and he did

So I took the shotgun off the wall
And I fired two warning shots into his head

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame

I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake city about two years ago
And he told me he was single and we hit it off right away
So, we started living together

He'd go to work, he'd come home, I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner.
Then I found out, single, my ass
Not only was he married, well, he had six wives
One of those Mormons, you know

So that night, when he came home
I fixed him his drink as usual
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic

He had it coming, he had it coming
He took a flower in its prime
And then he used it and he abused it
It was a murder but not a crime

Now, I'm standing in the kitchen
Carvin' up the chicken for dinner
And in storms my husband Wilbrin in a jealous rage
""You been screwin' the milkman""

He says and he kept sayin'
""You been screwin the milkman""
Then he ran into my knife
He ran into my knife ten times

And my husband, Charlie traveled around with us

Flip flops, back flips, one right after the other
Well, this one night we were in Cicero

The three of us, we were in this hotel room
Boozin' and havin' a few laughs and we ran out of ice
So I went out to get some

I come back, open the door
There's Veronica and Charlie
Doing number seventeen, the spread eagle

Well, I was in such a state of shock, I completely blacked out
I can't remember a thing, it wasn't until later
When I was washing the blood off my hands
I even knew they were dead

They had it coming, they had it coming
They had it coming all along
I didn't do it, in spite if I'd done it
How could you tell me that I was wrong?

I loved Alvin Lipschitz, he was a real artistic guy, sensitive, a painter
But he was always trying to find himself
He go out every night looking for himself
And on the way, he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary and Irving

I guess you can say we broke up because of artistic differences
He saw himself as alive and I saw him dead

The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

They had it comin', they had it comin'
They had it comin' all along

How could they tell us that we were wrong?

I started out a long, long, long time ago
But my journey held most things I did not know
But I was sure and believed the plan You gave
Was so secure inside of me

In latter days I found failure down
And complacency came to pull me down
They wrestled deep inside of me, now the passion's gone
Staring me right in the face, asking me if I am sure

Now when I need strength to endure
There's one thing that I can count on

Before I waste another day

This is how I remind myself

Now my savior's gone, it seems like I have it down
I've stood through it all, it feels still to rise and come around
Trying to guarantee this day I'm going forward
And the battle starts all over again

I will slam dunk on your big man.
Been rappin' for years, crackin' them bears, the sound of platinum chairs.
Predict future cash and it's near, my speech is dittly.
I bust shots until the heat gets heavy.
Fuck bitches until the sheets get sweaty.
Beats and melodies, will make me blink.
I'll pull my shank out, and give a warrior's cry.
If you ain't down wit' my crew, all you die.
You can tell I'm real, by lookin' in the ball of my eye.
I will get some cream from it, one day, your baby, and my baby.
Can my some dough on Teem Summit.
Countin' the loot, fountain the youth, the young God.
Here's the inside thug, like a Marmashad.
Some want to have emotions and kill me.
Put the toast to my kidney, when I speak most of them feel me.
So, keep my name off ya breath.
'Fore my nigga, Gruff, take the chain off ya chest.
All guaranteeing, blaow, take the brain off ya neck.
Off the top of the dough, one shot and you'll blow.
Fuckin' wit' Panama P.I., guarantee I'll take ya outta ya zone.

Aiyo me and my nigga, Hais, ride, lay loose.
'Case ya try to play Zeus, got the tray deuce.
Hidin' right inside the bubble, face goose.
Not too quickly to make... to make news.
I'm a ace deuce, caught cases, I got Gotti and O.J. juice.
And my crew, you're very stackless, very cock now.
Phase of every Rocky, turn your caviar ass into, um,
Chicken teriyaki, Spanish nigga try to front on me.
I say papi, Rocky, wish he would of shot me.
'Cause I don't care if he frail or cock D.
When I got the glock, B can't stop me.
And no judicial system could affix me, try to lock me.
Over papes on mine, Mr. D.A., someone to lace ya dime.
And tell P.H. that the camera job, come on, that's a waste of mine.
'Cause I got my girl Curry, live in D.C.,
Work the spring court, you know for me, that just scary.
How Harlem nigga do, get in the building, bitch, hurry,
Before my girl see, back to top, so she can give me one on jury.
Says hung, got her sprung, she felt that I'm young.
Her little toy boy, make her lick my ass wit a tongue.
She's so smart, she's dumb, but I keep; tomorrow ain't promised.
Now I might need a one way flight to St. Thomas,
And at the same time I got a JAG fetish,
And who knows, I might have bad credit.
I can't borrow from niggas I ass betted.
Go to your girl, I pop my truck faster.
Don't make me Flex on you, ghetto style, like Funkmaster.

You got money, what it look like?
You got crack, what it cook like?
You got a song, what the hook like?
Word is bond, when P.I. hit the microphone, niggas took mics.
You got crack, what it cook like?
You got a song, what the hook like?
You got some money, what it look like?
What part of the game is that?
You fuck around wit' my track, blaow, part of the flaming stat.

I live the God knowledge, my book of life, he read like twice.
Five percent shine, today the grease like, my attribute's like.
Paretic chrome, I thrown, throw it at your dome, blown.
It be known, like Sa Salasi clone, connect wit' one zone.
Cybernetic, verbal buck slang, king ebonic.
Nickname: Farad, all of ya dude, rock me Muhammad.
I came swift, wit' off as the shit, they couldn't catch it.
Define this, got drawn so swift, couldn't detect it.
Thug covert, sip Scotch drink, just like an Irish.
Move like the infamous, full blown, antivirus.
Apollus, mad Olympic, fragile fitness.
Supreme gymnast, ancient decent, homey scriptures.
Equilibrium, catch me at the Wimbledon, thug gentlemen.
Guess jeans, Wu shirts, construction Timberland.
You're nobody wit' nothing, and your name shall be Nathan.
Who you facin?  Slugs blazin' the amazin'.

Aiyo check it, I used to live reckless,
Snatch kids necklace, nigga, respect this.
A nigga catch this, blaow, trigga specialist.
Is your death wish, leave you rib and chestless.
Gun ho, real life thug, every one know.
From the Bumjo, to the kids, to Colombo.
My niggas locked down doin' state, did you rumble?
Twenty-five to L, on the humble, real thug shit.
Plug shit, catch you, wouldn't dare fuck wit'.
Care rugged, from the skulls down to the Timb's.
Surroundin' your Benz, wit' niggas houndin' your gems.
Yo, pump this jam in your joint.
All my thug niggas cruisin' wit' the mamas on points.
City wise guys, gritty high guys, pretty mamas.
I even make boricua, shake the titty tatas.
Harlem World slugger, watch it explode like Pearl Harbor.
Screw ma, get a girl's Vodka,
And get them hotter, slide 'em off, twist 'em proper.
Yo, I'm a sex fiend, fuckin' in my four hundred Lex' ring.
Flex cream, presidential rolly wit' gets gleam.

Panama Wedding,"News day cover page meant the killer isn't done
The county chief in Gilgo beach found another one
As we stood in our house burn beneath the sun
We thought all this time growing up yet we still feel young

Ohh it feels just like summer time we're all fading away
All I know is that I wont be home tonight ohh child
Ohh and im feeling lazy my heart is beating now
I got a feeling maybe we're on our way tonight

Tv weather line meant the storm would be awhile
On a rainy day we were caught in shame with the score board tied
As we sat in our seats waiting for the rain 
To lighten up we spent all night long 
Holding out for that one last run

Ohh it feels just like summer time we're all fading away
All I know is that I wont be home tonight ohh child
Ohh and im feeling lazy my heart is beating now
I got a feeling maybe we're on our way tonight
You know that I feel and though I see the morning
My heart is beating loud
I got a feeling baby we'll run away tonight

Sometimes I cant tell the ocean from the sky
Or the way the silver clouds touch the land fall down on the horizon line
I wanna kiss you now but baby I dont mean goodbye
I wanna set all the lights like a movie scene where we go tonight

Is to let all our worries

De las que no ahí a diario
Ella una joven preciosa

El un muchacho de barrio
Se amaban con toda el alma
Fue su amor lo más sagrado

Fue en una noche de Octubre
En una fiesta de amigos
Cuando ellos se conocieron

Y se  juraron cariño
Amor que nació del alma
Se juraron estar unidos

Mas quien avía de pensarlo
Que aquel muchacho de vario
Se enredara entre las drogas

Empezará en malos pasos
Entro sin conocer nada
Entro muy bravo y lo mataron

Ella lloro sin consuelo
Como se llora un cariño
Gritándole a Dios del cielo

Regrésamelo Dios mío
Quiso quitarse la vida
Gritaballevame contigo

Por azares de la vida
O caprichos del destino
Rezando su novenario
Ella callo sin sentido

Murió con una sonrisa
Porque siguió a su cariño
De amores

Pancho Villa,"[3] - I'm going to vauco in my black seville
I follow two my behind a truck with half a mil
I make my first stop at my homeboys ranch 
I ask him ""what's in the bag"" he says ""two acres of plants
It's easy going in but hell gettin out
I want to make this paper and I think I know how
surprise surprise I done made it back home
in an ice cream truck ""who want to buy a snow cone""
  
Hook - repeat 2X

I'm going to the valley
Vauco the valley
I'm goin to the valley what you think fo
  
[4] - From Texas to Cali we get our ye from the valley
We be hustlin on blocks moving in and out the alley
We call it medicine that's what you need when you get sick
Sometimes it's hard rock sometimes it's white pearl brick
Across, across the state line just me and my girlfriend
From powder to pine I got money on my mind
Stop wasting all my time and get me over to the spot
Unload all the cargo and meet me at the docks
  
[5] - Going back to the valley staying on top of my game
Meeting up wit my bitches snow white and mary jane
Only thing that ever mattered to me 
Stacking dollars shit we making a week
Who the cowards who the killas who's the niggas wit scrilla
Felt all up in they pockets rocking fo' niggas that try to kill us
Then maybe later you bitches bother me 
You wanted to pay you too late don't bother calling me
  
[6] - Going to the valley fo' soldiers in a caddy 
And in the back of the caddy got fifty pound of smally
Tryed to jack but can't catch me
I just keep that paper stacking
Always packin never slacking 
leaving you hoe ass niggas unhappy
Chopping burs when able, fucking hoes on the table
Watching cable in a Sable, Dope House is the label
Selling em three for ten to my closest friends
Rolling back to H-towm big body Benz
  
hook
  
[7] - Houston Texas cowboy wit a dime and a fiesta saddle
And I'm moving mo weight then a whole herd of cattle
I grip up the grain blowing up the panhandle
mobile phone on scramble cause rap hustlin is a gamble
Brick moving these H dudes gonna keep you grooving pursuing
Shit, hell on my surella ice water lyrical good fella
SPM got the hook up, say watch out 
I hit the highway, let twenkies crawl
I'm going to the valley
  
[8] - Man I'm flipping up to Mexico to hit some licks
In a Navigator bus bringing back some bricks
Get to checkpoint now I'm past the border
tell my guy alemar to play some more
Fat money cause we in the mix
I got that white girl and that stinky bitch
Better ryders and roamers can't really ask 
""We going out T?"" ""Bitch I'm headed to the valley
So I'm out about to make some money
Pull up to a trailor wit about 800
Unload it I flip it get paid let's ride
Chunk a deuce to the guys and I'm back to Southside
Cruisin wit a couple of pines
Trying hard as hell to make it back to H-Town
Flippin but only make one stop
Then I'm buring out moving shit to a dope house
  
[9] - Cruisin to the valley checking up on me campos
Make thirty calls so I can wire free samples
Get me a plane so I can make my drops
Flying real low to avoid the cops
Weighing my weed on a digital beam
Wrapping it in a plastic quick so I can make my green
My windows are tinted so nobody sees in it
Wit mary jane and snow white the sky's the limit
  
Hook

[10] - My package is small, stack em in the entire wall
Fuck the chotha must be loca
Everything a nigga want make it to the border wit the motha
Pockets rising better quit sizing me up
But these coffe beans fucking the smell up
What's up, back in the city 
de bull lada I'm talking pronto
Call me the head honcho start a new revloution
like a back poncho 
He yah see yah wouldn't want to be yah
Gots to flee, start the G
Switch the ride I'm headed back to the valley
  
[11] - Get um up hit em up
They want to know what it is all about
They way that we roll down south
Start baby wit dope house josie wells gonna 
there ain't nuthin funna then being and outlaw runna 
stunna pimpin in a humma millennium smuggler
Dope game juggla, no nuts no glory
Real mobsters, they never worry
but we ain't home yet so don't get happy
we ain't paid Officer O'Malley
Thinking of my profits going to the valley 
It's all cavi
  
[12] - I'm flipping to the valley federalies
Fucking wit michael decodie motorcycles
?? cruises my disciples 
I'm the type to crew smoke two and synas
wit my G's I'll hunt you 
like Arnold hunts Sarah Connors
Primadonnas big tymers, playa, and rob reports
benz sports,courts, naked hoes, lascivious resorts
I get short my last resort tell L
to keep the Cali cause little down wit his essays 
parlaying down in the valley
  
Hook
  
[13] - I'm a creep 59
to the end of the rainbow land of the llello
Dope fiends on my payroll, got rocks to blow
behind the stop and go they holla 
goodness graious great balls of snow
Don't speed or trip when you see the lights
cause they can tell you're nervous just by looking in your eyes
in H-Town the business in booming
but it won't last long if you don't know what you're doing
  
[14] - Yeundo pal el valle in a nice Expedition
Got me creepin for mi ruka and my boys blowing swishas
Mcallen brownsville harlingen
six hour trip to get my endz
I'm out to get my Benz
on the lean coming clean
lean man flashing green
el meadow meadow meadow
???
thendo vact is none stop
daily stackes to the top
???
keep my hoes by the flock
  
[15] - Who rides like me come wrapped that tightly
L be's moving by the ton
Packed up in tanks under the trunk, 59 to 77 
Collecting my lot not even sweating, back on 35
wit my cheeder just gettin mine
You know me your boy O-Z
Never left lonely wit out my G see
One trip cocks a flip 
The way I flip multiplies a chip
I'm steady ?? cash flow
Transactions stacking paper rolls
The currency connect from Houston to the valley

Confía en mi, amor?.lo tengo calculado
Si algo sale mal, pido perdón de ante mano, pues así soy yo

Te tengo amor obsesivo, un poco tétrico
Te invito a sentir malestar sin fin
Dame tu mano, pongámosle fin al sufrir

Sabes de lo que soy capaz
Tengo un complejo muy crudo why psicópata

Que representa la desdicha en mi
Pero no puedo, no me atrevo a mentir, enséñame?.me enseñas?

Solo el pasado podría competir
Con la belleza de una foto de ti
La fantasía duraría why no tendría fin?.me enseñas?

Me quiero informar si piensa en mi
Why si acaso ese pensamiento es sutil
Pero no servirá de nada, yo se que no existe

Feliz ocupo ser, no quiero aprender
Es doloroso el proceso aquel
Pero si tu no estás nada podré yo hacer

Que tal si lo mejor está por venir (que tal si lo mejor)
Que la distancia deje ya de existir (Que la distancia deje ya de existir)
Pero eso nunca pasará, es mucho pedir

Olor a fuego, música en el callejón
La sensación de lejanía
Que ahoga cuando se avecina

Me has dado tanto como nadie nunca dio

Sincronizando los latidos
De tu corazón y el mío
Las nubes han borrado el sol

Quién que no soy yo te da calor
Quién beberá de tu sonrisa como miel
Quién te da el veneno del amor

Me gustaría poner todo boca arriba
Cambiar el orden de las cosas y volver
A recuperar tus labios otra vez

No te puedo echar fuera de mi corazón
Todo el tiempo estás arañando mi interior
No te puedo echar fuera de mi corazón
Círculo mágico, jeroglífico a resolver
Código místico, de querer a poder

Quiero volver a estar contigo igual
Que ayer y recuperar lo que viví

Haré arcoíris rutilantes de color

Y saco fuerzas de mi flaqueza
Para afrontar por fin un día más sin ti

Para engañarme y fingir que soy feliz
Tratando de olvidar que yo quería estar
Soñaba estar, pedía estar

Sola, sola, sola
Como un barco en alta mar
Sin tener que compartir mi libertad

Sola, sola, sola

Si no fuera por mi orgullo
Volvería al lado tuyo

Y ver si soy capaz de no llamarte más
Aunque en el fondo hoy daría cualquier cosa
Por dar un paso atrás y recobrarte

But there's one thing that I've got 
It's my man
Cold and wet, tired you bet
But all that I soon forget 
With my man
He's not much for looks 
And no hero out of books 
Is my man
Two or three girls has he 
That he likes as well as me
But I love him! 
I don't know why I should
He isn't good, he isn't true
He beats me too
What can I do?
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say
I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot
 
Oh, my man I love him so
He'll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don't care 
When he takes me in his arms 
The world is bright, all right

encontrarte en plena calle, 
fue una chispa en mi equilibrio 
dinamita que estalló.

Fue un encuentro tan pequeño

We've got all the time in the world.
That's good,
That's nice...
I've been dreaming up a storm lately
Over and over again
And now I can't stop, can't stop...
Been dreaming about mirrors.Millions of mirrors.
An endless army of mirrors out of control, reflecting people to death.
To blindness and then death.
Oh and the mirrors kept getting larger.
They kept growing... swelling...
They kept spreading out And now I can't seem to stop them.
They're still growing and I can't seem to stop them.
I have to keep filling them up,
I have to keep feeding them
And they're still getting larger!And larger!!!
The mirrors have become vast and beautiful
And very, very hungry.
Hungrier than I've ever been.
Too hungry.
I no longer have any control over what they show me or what they see.
They decide themselves what they would like to reflect.
They won't obey me!!!
They create a reflection and then I have to go out and find the real thing that matches it.
And almost always when I put the real thing in front of the mirrors
It's not nearly as beautiful as the reflection that came first.
And at that point I have to destroy the real thing
And go out looking again until finally
I find another real thing,A thing that does match what's inside the mirror
and which is truly worthy of the beautiful reflection that came first.
But I almost never find it.
And the mirrors get even hungrier.
Pretty soon now they're going to devour me.
They're going to swallow me up Piece by piece,Bit by bit, shiver by shiver, tremble by tremble,Sliver and sliver and splinter by splinter...
But you can help me, please.
They want you, please.
They've given me your image.
Before I ever saw you they gave me you image.
Please.I'd like to make you one of my reflections
And feed you to the mirrors.
Please.
They only need one more to fill them up
And if it were you I feel that they would be satisfied.As I would.
Please.You have such a beautiful reflection...
Don't ever waste it.

She is a mountain
And her breast
It touch the sky
And my father
He is a river
Running through her
Sweet bye and bye
And my sister
She is a songbird
And she's singing in her flight
And my brother
He is a moonbeam

On the highway at night
Drivin' like a bat outta hell
When I beheld an amazing sight
It was a lonely apparition
By the roadside standing there
With his thumb out in the wilderness
And a halo in his hair

[Chorus]
He said ""Gimme a ride to heaven boy
I'll Show you paradise
Yeah gimme a ride to heaven boy
My name is Jesus Christ""

So I come screeching to a halt
I said ""Hop on in""
He says ""thanks a lot for the lift
I forgive you of your sins
Yeah I just come from Jerusalem
Where things are going bad
Ah gimme a ride to heaven boy
I need to talk to my dad""

[Chorus]

Well I didn't know what to do
So I jammed her down in gear
Kind a kicked my feet beneath the seat
I was trying to hide the beer
Ah but he just grinned and said ""My friend,
I know you must think it's odd
But you got nothin' to fear about drinkin' a beer
If you share it with the son of God""

[Chorus]

Well I saw good news in his baby blues
So I stomped it on the floor
I said you have to show me how to get there
I ain't been before
""Well it's a hard place to find"" he said
""But I'll give you a little clue
It ain't somewhere up in the air
It's sittin' right here inside with you""
Then right in the middle of that perfect smile
From his robes he pulled a gun
An stuck it up beside my head and said
""How's this for Kingdom Come?""
Well I pulled off scared but I heard him say
As he left me beneath the stars
""The Lord moves in mysterious ways
And tonight, my son H'e's gonna use your car""

Panic at the Disco,"Broadway is black like a sinkhole
Everyone raced to the suburbs
And I'm on the rooftop with curious strangers
This is the oddest of summers
Maybe I'll medicate, maybe inebriate
Strange situations, I get anxious
Maybe I'll smile a bit, maybe the opposite
But pray that they don't call me thankless

My tell-tale heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk-tied tourniquet

This is my roaring, roaring 20's
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I wanna go home

Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt, 'cause I want, I wanna go home

Oscars and Emmy's and Grammy's
Everyone here is a trophy
And I'm sipping bourbon
The future's uncertain
The past on the pavement below me
Maybe I'll elevate, maybe I'm second rate
So unaware of my status
Maybe I'm overjoyed, maybe I'm paranoid
Designer me up in straight jackets

My tell-tale heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk-tied tourniquet

Hallucinations only mean that your brain is on fire
If it's Lord of the Flies in my mind tonight
I don't know if I will survive
Lighters up if you're feelin' me
Fade to black if you're not mine
'Cause I just need a sign, or a signal inside

This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me a, roll me a blunt

We got the streets locked
Over sees at punjabi mc and the roc
I came to see the mamis in the spot
On the count of three drop ur body like its hot
1 young 2 you want to 3 young hovs a snake charmer
Move ur body lika snake mama
Make me wanna put tha snake on ya
I'm on my 8th summer still hot young's the 8th wonder
All I do is get bread yea I take wonder
I take one of ya chics straight from under ya arm pit
The black Brad Pit I mack till 6 in the AM
All day I'm P-I-M-P I am simply attached to tha track like symphony
Its simply good young hov infinately

Kari na kise de nal pyar
Mundeyan ton bach ke rahi
Ni tu hune hune hoyi mutiyaar
Mundeyan ton bach ke rahi
Ni tu hune hune hoyi mutiyaar
Mundeyan ton bach ke rahi

Tera ki kasoor je nasheele nain ho gaye
Sikh ke adavaan sharmeele nain ho gaye
Tera ki kasoor je nasheele nain ho gaye
Sikh ke adavaan sharmeele nain ho gaye
Sambh ke rakh ni eh joban patari
Sambh ke rakh ni eh joban patari
Hun murhke ni aouni eh bahaar
Mundeyan ton bach ke rahi
Ni tu hune hune hoyi mutiyaar
Mundeyan ton bach ke rahi
Ni tu hune hune hoyi mutiyaar
Mundeyan ton bach ke rahi-oyyye

Charhdi jawani tera roop thathan mardaa
Patla jeha lakk na hulara vi sahardaa
Charhdi jawani tera roop thathan mardaa
Patla jeha lakk na hulara vi sahardaa
Gora gora rang utton mirghan jehi tor
Gora gora rang utton mirghan jehi tor
Nahi teri jahi sohni koi naar
Mundeyan ton bach ke rahi
Ni tu hune hune hoyi mutiyaar
Mundeyan ton bach ke rahi
Ni tu hune hune hoyi mutiyaar
Mundeyan ton bach ke rahi

Mundeyan de bullan utte teria kahania
Chani ne taan Khanne diyan galiyan vi chhaanyia
Chobran de bullan utte teria kahania
Chani ne taan Khanne diyan galiyan vi chhaanyia
Janjua tan hoya tere roop da deewana
Janjua tan hoya tere roop da deewana
Jhall sakeya na husan da vaar
Mundeyan ton bach ke rahi
Ni tu hune hune hoyi mutiyaar
Mundeyan ton bach ke rahi
Ni tu hune hune hoyi mutiyaar

Panjabi MC,"Its the Roc in the building
Calib, Ramel, Tarrell in the house

Neeviaan tu kujh chir paa ke rakh lai,
Palle vich mukhra lukaa ke rakh lai.

Yes, live from the United States
Brooklyn New York its ya boy, Young

Neeviaan tu kujh chir paa ke rakh lai,
Palle vich mukhra lukaa ke rakh lai.
