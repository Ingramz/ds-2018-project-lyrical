Alter Bridge,"When all is lost to you inside
When all the darkness takes the light
The ritual warning has begun
And now you tear away from everyone
Disconnected so alone yeah
Severed ties from all you know

Isolation
Brings you to the end
Until you love again
Isolation
If you could only see
What will come to be?
Yeah!

Justify you waste away
You dare to dream but still you're too afraid
And now you're broken and deceived
Lost to live this cruel reality
You're disconnected so alone
Severed ties from all you know

Isolation
Brings you to the end
Until you love again
Isolation
If you could only see
What will come to be?
Yeah!

Maybe you'll stand
Maybe you'll give and break to find another way
And makes things better
Maybe you'll find
A you can live and learn to love along the way
And make things better
And make things better

Isolation
Brings you to the end
Until you love again
Isolation
If you could only see
What will come to be?
Yeah!

Alter Bridge,"Sitting alone in the cold of the night
You're trying to find what you need to survive
You're so afraid
You can't go on

Left in the silence that tears at your heart
They only remind you how broken you are
You've lost your way
But hope is not gone

'Cause the sun always sets
The moon always falls
It feels like the end
Just pay no mind at all
Keep rolling
Rolling
Life must go on

Do you remember and long for the past?
When love was eternal
And joy seemed to last
Yesterday
Forever is gone

'Cause the sun always sets
The moon always falls
It feels like the end
Just pay no mind at all
Keep rolling
Rolling
Life must go on
It must go on

We have our misfortunes
The darkest of days
We must endure and keep strong
Just look to the morning
The promise awaits
And know that this life must go on

And the sun always sets
The moon always falls
It feels like the end
Just pay no mind at all
Keep rolling
Rolling
Life must go on

And the sun always sets
The moon always falls
It feels like the end
Just pay no mind at all
Keep rolling
Keep rolling
Life must go on
It must go on

Life must go on
Life must go on
When you're feeling alright (?)
So you keep rolling on
Keep rolling on
With your heart you'll be safe (?)
Life must go on
Life must go on
So you keep rolling on
Keep rolling on",Life Must Go On,2010
Alter Bridge,"How many times have you cut only to feel the pain?
How many days have you run only to crawl?
How many nights did you scream only to scream in vain?
How many years till you face the shame of it all?

Into the fire you fall, only you can make it right (Make it right)
Stand up and fight for us all if only you can make it right (Make it right)

How many lies did you steal just to convince the fool?
How many knives did you wear to disguise and remove?
How many years till you break all that keeps breaking you?
How many tears will you waste while finding the truth?

Into the fire you fall, only you can make it right (Make it right)
Stand up and fight for us all if only you can make it right (Make it right)

Into the fire you fall, only you can make it right (Make it right)
Stand up and fight for us all if only you can make it right (Make it right)

Here comes the time when one must decide
The life they are living is far from true
Lost and deceived, i beg to believe
I know i have scars that have yet to show

Stand up and fight for us all if only you can make it right (Make it right)

Alter Bridge,"A trail of tears beyond redemption
Just a word and nothing more no more
I must reveal I am falling
To the dark I now am born

So if you hear this cry
Show me a sign give me meaning
Leave me to life let me know
Why all the lies I'm believing
Have lead me so far far from home

Gutting anguish not forgotten
Eternal life will not be mine tonight
But if I wake to find perdition
This I know the fault is mine
This I know your fault is mine

So if you hear this cry
Show me a sign give me meaning
Leave me to life let me know
Why all the lies I'm believing
Have lead me so far far from home

And the fire inside is gone
And all that I once had is lost
To the darkness I am born

Just a word and nothing more
I must reveal that I'm falling

Alter Bridge,"To the dark
To the fall
Crawl to the life you shouldn't know
You should never come this way
To test the hands of fate
You don't belong here

Peel back the skin
Close your eyes
Hell is born
To the abyss, but be warned
You fear what you've become
My God what have you done?
You don't belong here

But it's all in the way
You touch and you will pay
Denial

But it's all in the way
You touch and you will pay
Denial

Sever the ties
Trip the wire
Take your hold
Doubt is alive and you know
You were once led to believe
You were young and so naive
And now no longer
But it's all in the way
You turn your back today

Left to face this alone
Left to die with nothing you can own
Left to break in the cold
In the void that you made
The moment you let love go

Try win back your days
You let them all escape your heart
Now that you've come so far
Why did you have to fall so hard?
Look at what you've done
What have you become?

Left to face this alone
Left to die with nothing you can own

Still you turn your back on me
Pulled you from the fire when you were burning
Still you never could believe

So carry on if you must go your way
Go embrace my heart
Your free will still remains

I save you from your fall when you were slipping
Still you broke from me to run
So how can you justify the life you're living

You must carry on if you must go your way
Go embrace my heart
Your free will still remains

You'll deny
You'll deny me once again

And just hear me sing,
One last long goodbye,
One last song before you spread your wings.

There's so much left to say,
And before this moment slips away

What a wonderful life,
For as long as you've been at my side,
And I want you to know,
I loved you so

Then the cold night calls,
And the tears fall like rain,
It's so hard letting go,
Of the one thing I'll never replace

And soon you will be gone,

You let me be,
I will remember you,
For all that you've done,
And given to me

This I can see,
Now and forever more
Because of you,
Now I believe

I swear I still believe though I don't know

I only fear
Now I only crawl

The only thing that we have left to hold 
In a world gone mad there's nowhere left to go 
Where nothing lasts there's permanence I know

Is there something I can say?
To bring back what once remained
Where is all that we let go?
Where is home?

Doubt 
From inside I hear it calling out 
Tearing at the truth it must be found 
In the end it only brings me down

Is there something I can say?
To bring back what once remained
Where is all that we let go?
Where is home?

If you need a reason a reason tonight
To cast every doubt from your heart and your mind
Look to tomorrow and maybe you'll find
Something more. Something more.

Alter Bridge,"Now there is a light in the dark some will say
There is a grace up high
There is a beauty that some can behold
Not I. Not I.
There is a power that's felt from the shore
There is a force that won't break
But all of these things to me are no more
I've changed. I've changed.

What in the hell have you done
Cast aside all that you love
Sorrows you never out run

Zero.
Nothing for you's ever good enough
Zero
Nothing makes you whole

How many times have you felt all alone
How many tears have you cried
Called out in vain for a god to behold
Inside. Inside
How many fires you let die in your heart
How many storms must you face
Left out to fight for yourself in the cold
No faith. No faith.

So nothing to lean on this time
Nothing is left to decide
All that you've known you deny

Zero
Nothing for you's ever good enough
Zero
Nothing makes you whole
Zero
Nothing for you's ever good enough
Zero
Nothing makes you whole

Go now surrender
You can't take no more
And just cry out
Surrender your faith is no more

What in the hell have you done
Cast aside all that you love
Sorrows you never out run
Just look what you have become.

Nothing for you's ever good enough
Zero
Nothing makes you whole

Alter Bridge,"Against the sky
Streams of light call out to me and you
We leave as one, we've just begun
To find the solace we're due
This is a life we must choose

We will make a brand new start
From the pieces torn apart
The break of day is before us
Cast your sorrows to the wind
Let the highway take us in
As we escape the disorder

This desert road, that we call home
This is our destiny
We chase the setting sun
As we outrun a life of agony
God, how we ache to be free

We will make a brand new start
From the pieces torn apart
The break of day is before us
Cast your sorrows to the wind
Let the highway take us in
As we escape the disorder

Alternative TV,"One time to know that it's real 
 One time to know how it feels 
 That's all 
 One call - your voice on the phone 
 One place - a moment alone 
 That's all 
 What do you see? 
 What do you know? 
 What are the signs? 
 What do I do? 
 Just follow your lifelines through 
 What do you hate? 
 What do I do? 
 What do you say? 
 Don't throw your lifelines away 
 Don't throw your lifelines away 
 One time - just once in my life 
 One time- to know it can happen twice 
 One shot of a clear blue sky 
 One look - I see no reasons why you can't 
 One chance to be back 
 To the point where everything starts 
 Once chance to keep it together 
 Things fall apart 
 Once I make us believe it's true 
 What do we see? 
 Where do we go? 
 What are the signs? 
 How do we grow? 
 By letting your lifelines show 
 What if we do? What up to now? 
 What do you say? 
 How do I know? 
 Don't let your lifeline go 
 Don't let your lifeline go 
 Don't let your lifeline go",Life,1979

[Verse One: Foxy Brown]
From the cradle til' now, still Fox, just a little more mature
Seen it with my bare eyes, did it all before
Been through hell on earth
Playin' out my role I was given since birth, receptin' it well

Go hard at them critics, they expect me to fail
Work hard for my fans, they expect me to sell
They suspect I'm livin' well
But they don't know the pain I feel

Five minutes away from gettin' killed, it's ill
My moms always hug me when I'm leavin'
I wake up cryin' because death bugs me when I'm sleepin'
Jam Master died, it's like I ain't done grievin'

Big and Pac gone and look we still beefin'
And son even, we at odds in these days
Where niggas die over cars and they chains
I thank God that I'm saved and I'mma hold it down in this game

Now, from the cradle to the grave

[Chorus: Althea]
From the cradle to the grave
I, wish I knew my life would end up being this way

[Verse Two: Foxy Brown]
From the cradle til now, I been through it all why'all
Y'all don't know half the things, I been through it dawg
Pain and sufferation, I been through it all
My heart's still cold, I been through the storm

Confused all these years, shit, we grew all these years 
I remember me and you on the stairs
Talkin' bout what we gonna do when we're big
Money came into play and best friends went they way, shit

I wish it never had to go that way, uh
The price of fame can cost a whole friendship
Yeah we got dollars, but it's senseless
So I pray to God for forgiveness and ask him to carry me through

All the stress and the drama in this business
I bare witness, I Fox, and keep going strong until my heart stop
And keep flowing strong with a ?rap pon coc?, see'mon

[Chorus: Althea]
From the cradle to the grave
I, wish I knew my life would end up being this way
From the cradle to the grave
I, wish I knew my life would end up being this way

As a little girl I wish I knew that I
Would be goin' through the drama that's in my life
All the sufferin', everywhere I been
How I get myself in all this bullshit I'm in

[Verse Three: Foxy Brown]
From now til' the grave, I look back at my life
Smile and say ""wow"" in amazement
All these roadblocks, wonder how did I make it
Wonder how I 'came famous, I'm impressed with me

It's like rumours been obsessed with me
But the truth never told, it was left with me
And what's left for me, is to extend my hand
If they don't reach then I'll let them be

I got to live my life right
But I wouldn't change how I lived my like 
If I could live my life twice
Y'all don't understand what Inga's life's like

A black stressed, I turned my back to the world
And now I'm back to the world, this black girl's blessed
Yeah, my fans helped me through it
I was destined to blaze from the cradle to the grave
Thank God my fam helped me through it (c'mon)

In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

Baby can you feel me
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight

I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine

See I been goin' on, the shit be goin' on, got to trust me ma

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think she was from your past
Silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids
Love is so blind it feels right when it's wrong

I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women
It took me some time, but now I moved on
Because I realized I got

Me, myself, and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry, I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' my own best friend

That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry, I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' my own best friend

You're so controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong

Now that it's over, stop calling me, come pick up yo clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know
Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low
Took me some time, but now I am strong
Because I realized I've got

Me, myself, and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry, I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' my own best friend

That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry, I took a vow that from now

Altiyan Childs,"I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five-and-dime
Played it till my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit, Jody got married
Shoulda known, we'd never get far

Oh when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always want to be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you

We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
Think about you wonder what went wrong

Without a dream in my heart 
Without a love of my own 

Blue Moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for 

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper, ""Please adore me""

Alto Madness,"They're writing songs of love, but not for me.
A lucky star's above, but not for me.
With love to lead the way, I've seen more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee.
I was a fool to fall and get that way.
Hey ho, alas, and also lackaday.
Although I can't dismiss, the memory of her kiss.
I guess she's not for me.

She's knocking on the door, but not for me.
She'll plan a two by four, but not for me.
I know that love's a game, I'm puzzled just the same.
Was I the moth or flame, I'm all at sea.
It all began so well, but what an end.

When every happy plot ends with the marriage knot
And there's no knot for me.",But Not for Me,2004

Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of those girls

She loves the free, fresh wind in her hair
Life without care

My Hobohemia is the place to be

I get too hungry for dinner at eight, I like the theatre but never come late. 
I never bother with people I hate, that's why the lady is a tramp. 
I don't like crap games with Barons and Earls, 
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls. 
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls: 
That's why the lady is a tramp. 

I like the free fresh wind in my hair, life without care: 
I'm broke, it's oke. 
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp: 
That's why the lady is a tramp. 
I go to Coney  the beach is divine. 
I go to ball games  the bleachers are fine. 
I follow Winchell and read every line: 
That's why the lady is a tramp! 
I like a prize fight that isn't a fake. 
I love the rowing on Central park lake. 
I go to opera and stay wide awake: 
That's why the lady is a tramp! 
I like the green grass under my shoes, what can I lose? 
I'm flat! That's that! I'm all alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp! Don't know the reason for cocktails at five. 
I don't like flying  I'm glad I'm alive. 
I crave affection but not when I drive: 
That's why the lady is a tramp! 
Folks went to London and left me behind. 
I missed the crowning  Queen Mary didn't mind. 
Won't play Scarlett in ""Gone With the Wind""
That's why the lady is a tramp! 
I like to hang my hat where I please, sail with the breeze. 
No dough  Heigh  Ho! I still like Roosevelt 
and think he's a champ: 
That's why the lady is a tramp. 

Girls get massages, they cry and they moan 
Tell Lizzie Arden to leave me alone. 
I'm not so hot but my shape is my own: 
That's why the lady is a tramp! 
The food at Rector's is perfect, no doubt. 
I wouldn't know what the Ritz is about. 
I drop a nickel and coffee comes out: 
That's why the lady is a tramp! 
I like the sweet fresh rain in my face. 
Diamonds and lace  no got, so what? 
For Robert Taylor I whistle and stamp:

Why'd you see me coming through the thousand others passing you by?
And what I thought I wanted was the worst thing I could think of
And of course, the only thing you'd use to mess up my life
You were there for everything, even though I wished you weren't

Hit the floor cause I'm faded

It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by

E poi non dirmi che è un'illusione

Lasciati sola senza una ragione
Lasciati sola senza troppa intenzione

Álvaro López,"Estoy creciendo y siento cambios en mi
Creo tener la razón en todo
Y pienso que siempre voy a ser joven
No hago caso a los mayores

Siento que no me comprenden, que seria mejor
No vivir mas, no vivir mas
Y así ellos se arrepentirán y dirán que tenia razón
De lo que hacia, de lo que hacia
Y un día el cielo me ilumino
Y un día el cielo me ilumino

Me mando un ángel de ojos color miel
Lo vi cuando meditaba en el jardín
Se acerco hacia mi diciéndome que era muy joven
Y así conversamos muchas cosas mas, muchas cosas mas
Hasta que comprendí, cosas que no entendía de la vida
Hasta que comprendí, vi la vida de otro color
vi la vida de otro color

Siento que no me comprenden

Mi corazón no lo tengo aquí 
Alguién me está esperando 
Me está aguardando que vuelva aquí 

Cuando salí de Cuba
Dejé mi vida dejé mi amor 
Cuando salí de Cuba
Dejé enterrado mi corazón 

Late y sigue latiendo 
Porque la tierra vida le da 
Pero llegará un día 
En que mi mano te alcanzará 

Cuando salí de Cuba
Dejé mi vida dejé mi amor 
Cuando salí de Cuba
Dejé enterrado mi corazón 

Una triste tormenta 
Te está azotando sin descansar 
Pero el sol de tus hijos 
Pronto la calma te hará alcanzar

Hizo pensar que te fueras con otro
Ya no puedo mas desde que te has ido

Alvaro Soler,"Siempre ha estado allí
El hermano del destino
Nunca solo me sentí

A mi lado el camino

He cambiado el rumbo sin sentido
En aquel momento no entendí
Yo pensé que me había perdido
Al tratar de buscarlo yo vi

Siempre ha estado allí
El hermano del destino
Nunca solo me sentí
A mi lado el camino

Subiendo la cuesta al horizonte
El bolsillo de polvo se llenó
Apariencias que tal vez confunden
Cicatrices cuentan que pasó

Cuando no supe seguir
El camino entendí

Y yo no pude explicar porque tenía
Que pasarlo mal, y no lo vi

Pero ahora sé que el destino fue
Es parte del recorrido

Siempre ha estado allí

Nunca solo me sentí

Alvaro Soler,"Como te voy a decir
Me duele la distancia, solo quiero estar
Perdido en tus abrazos en qualquier lugar

¿Cuándo volverás?

La última vez que yo te vi no pude evitar
Grabar en mi corazón la imagen
Que quise guardar
Para recordarla siempre y así solo
Yo nunca tendría que estar

Grabar el sabor de aquel café
Después de pasear
Por las calles del pueblo perdidos en Sant Cugat
Para recordarlo siempre y así un rato
Yo contigo podría estar

Como te voy a decir
Me duele la distancia, solo quiero estar
Perdido en tus abrazos en qualquier lugar
¿Cuándo volverás?
Y como te voy a decir
Te veo en la ventana sentado en el bar
Te miro y me sonríes, vuelvo a preguntar
¿Y cuándo volverás?

Te llevo alrededor de mi muñeca junto con
Recuerdos que un día dejé atrás
Me dan la ilusión
Para yo acordarme siempre que
Hay alguien esperando con razón

Como te voy a decir
Me duele la distancia, solo quiero estar
Perdido en tus abrazos en qualquier lugar
¿Cuándo volverás?
Y como te voy a decir
Te veo en la ventana sentado en el bar
Te miro y me sonríes, vuelvo a preguntar
¿Y cuándo volverás?

Tengo esperanza que algún día me vuelvas a encontrar
Volver a llenar tus ojos de alegría junto al mar
Y tengo esperanza que si tú no me encuentras
Seguro lo haré yo
Sí lo haré yo

Como te voy a decir
Me duele la distancia, solo quiero estar
Perdido en tus abrazos en qualquier lugar

Mueve las, mueve las caderas

Todo poco a poco, sí, va cuéntamelo

Alvaro Soler,"I've been sleepless at night
'Cause I don't know how I feel
I've been waiting on you
Just to say something real

There's a light on the road
And I think you know
Morning is coming
And I have to go

I don't know why, I don't know why
We need to break so hard
I don't know why we break so hard

But if we're strong enough
To let it in, in, in
We strong enough
To let it go, oho, oho

Let it all go, let it all go
Let it all out now

If I look back to the start now
I know, I see everything true
There's still a fire in me heart, my darling
But I'm not burning for you

We started it wrong
And I think you know
We waited too long
Now I have to go

I don't know why, I don't know why
We need to break so hard
I don't know why we break so hard

But if we're strong enough
To let it in, in, in
We strong enough
To let it go, oho, oho

Let it all go, let it all go
Let it all out now
Let it all go, let it all go
Let it all out now

Who says, who says?
Who says, who says?
Who says truth is beauty after all?
And who says love should break us when we fall?

But if we're strong enough
To let it in, in, in
We strong enough
To let it go, oho, oho

Su vestido de seda calienta mi corazón

Eh, me acerco a ti
Bailemos, juguemos, eh
Acércate, oh

No lo tengo en las venas y no la puedo controlar

Tropiezo con la arena, ya no me puedo controlar

Pongo el alma why la vida en tus manos
Para que sepas que tu eres todo para mi.

Nada se compara contigo las emociones mas profundas
Why tantas iluciones juntas
Solo he podido descubrirlas junto a ti,
Tu me fascinas why eres la tentacion mas exquisita.

Nada se compara contigo no tuve amor mas impetuoso
Why la pasion que en ti derrocho
Why aunque parezca fantacioso es asi de lo vivido
Nada se compara contigo.

A contemplarte que había olvidado
Hasta la sensación de disfrutarte
Pero hoy bajé hasta el fondo de tu vientre
Hasta ahí donde se vive de esperanza
De donde un día yo me fui a buscar mi suerte

El tiempo vuela que hare
Que en estas calles yo era un niño
Como cualquiera ganándome la vida en mil oficios
En el barrio ya no hay nadie conocido
Nuevas vidas han brotado why pido al cielo
Que dios bendiga el futuro de estos niños

Toma esta canción patria querida
Escrita con nostalgia why con melancolía
Es mi corazón el que se inspira
Pues en la distancia te añoro cada día

Toma esta canción patria querida
Escrita con nostalgia why con melancolía
Es mi corazón el que se inspira
Pues en la distancia te añoro cada día

Cubierto con perdón why olvido

Pero quiero que se enteren mis amigos
Que todavía los recuerdo why los extraño

Enamorarse, amarte es como amar aun ángel, no
Quiero despertar si esto es un sueño, mi ángel de
Amor mi alma es tuya desde el día q te vi sin duda
Alguna yo he nacido para ti pase lo q pase, mi

Angel de amor quien descifra la emoción de amarte
Así, se quedan cortas cortas mis palabras al
Decir q te amo mas q ah nadie en este mundo

Álvaro Urquijo,"En el bulevar de los sueños rotos

Gata valiente de piel de tigre
Con voz de rayo de luna llena

Pasan de largo los terremotos
Y hay un tequila por cada duda

Diego Rivera lápiz en mano,
Dibuja a Frida Kahlo desnuda

Se escapo de una cárcel de amor,
De un delirio de alcohol,
De mil noches en vela
Se dejo el corazón en Madrid

Como llora Chavela!

Desconsolados van los devotos
De San Antonio pidiendo besos,
Ponme la mano aC, Macorina""
Rezan tus fieles por las cantinas,
Paloma Negra de los excesos

Moja una lagrima antiguas fotos
Y una canción se burla del miedo
Las amarguras no son amargas
Cuando las canta Chavela Vargas
Y las escribe un tal José Alfredo

Llueva o nieve en diciembre o en abril
Los tejados son asi
La ciudad esta debajo y también Maria
Que se desnuda frente al espejo
y se enamora de su cuerpo
Maria, que me descubre
Me mira y manda un beso
y se que no debería de volverme a enamorar
Tendría que tener un poco mas de voluntad
Espiar desde el tejado ya no es cosa de mi edad
Debería de tener mas voluntad

Con mil antenas que rascan el cielo gris
Hay cuatro gatos junto a mi
Mirando hacia abajo
y viendo que Maria
Se cambia de ropa
La miro es inútil resistir

Se ríe me enamoro de ella

Alvin & the Chipmunks,"Out in Arizona where the bad men are,
And the only friend to guide you is an Evening Star,
The roughest, toughest man by far
Is Ragtime Cowboy Joe.
Got his name from singing to the cows and sheep
Every night they say he sings the herd to sleep
In a basso rich and deep,
Crooning soft and low

How he sings raggy music to his cattle
As he swings back and forward in his saddle
On his horse (a pretty good horse)
Who is syncopated gaited
And with such a funny meter
To the roar of his repeater

How they run when they hear the feller's gun
Because the western folks all know:
He's a hifalootin' scootin', shootin'
Son-of-a-gun from Arizona
Ragtime cowboy (talk about your cowboy)
Ragtime cowboy Joe.

Dressed up ev'ry Sunday in his Sunday clothes
He beats it for the village where he always goes,
And ev'ry girl in town is Joe's
'Cause he's a ragtime bear;
When he starts a-spieling on the dance hall floor,
No one but a lunatic would start a war
Wise men know his forty-four
Makes men dance for fair.",Ragtime Cowboy Joe,1959

And your temper starts to rile up,
That's the time a fellow needs a song.

Doctor, Banker, Butcher, Baker,
You can be a merry maker,
If you'll keep on singing all day long.

If you're hanging in suspense from eight till five,
And you want to keep the sense of humor alive.
Just, whistle while you work (whistle)
Put on that grin and start right in, 
To whistle loud and long.

Just hum a merry tune (hum)
Just do your best,
Then take a rest and sing yourself a song.

When there's too much to do,
Don't let it bother you, 
Forget your trouble, try to be just like a cheerful chick-a-dee,
And whistle while you work (whistle)

Come on get smart
Tune up and start
To whistle while you work.

Alvin & the Chipmunks,"You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen,
Comet and Cupid and Donder and Blitzen,
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose,
And if you ever saw it,
You would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names;
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas Eve,
Santa came to say:
""Rudolph, with your nose so bright,
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him,
As they shouted out with glee,

You'll go down in history!""",Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,1995

And I'll tell you what I heard

Santa's comin in a pickup
Instead of his trusty sleigh 
He'll have a truck instead of reindeer
To carry him on his way
Cause the weatherman had some problems
He couldn't get snow you see

Santa's gonna come in a pickup truck
When he visits you and me

Santa can't bring his reindeer
He'll leave them far away

What you think is right",Jolly Old Saint Nicholas,2003
Alvin & the Chipmunks,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

""Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.

His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""",The Night Before Christmas,2003

Alvin & the Chipmunks,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Alvin & the Chipmunks,"Alright boys, so far so good
Now, what did Dr Doolittle wanna do with the animals
More than anything else, Alvin?
He wanted to learn to talk to them
And who promised to teach him how to talk to the animals, Simon?
Polynesia the parrot

Okay now, Theodore
Do you think you remember the song the doctor sang?
Ah, sure I can, if you help me
Okay Theodore, I'll start it out for you

If I could talk to the animals, just imagine it
Chatting with the chimp in chimpanzee
Imagine talking to a tiger, chatting with a cheetah
What a neat achievement it would be

If we could talk to the animals, learn their languages
Maybe take an animal degree
I'd study elephants and eagle, buffalo and beagle
Alligator, guinea pig and flea

I would converse in polar bear and python
I could converse in fluent kangaroo
If people asked me, ""Can you speak rhinoceros?""
I'd say, ""Of courserous, can't you?""

If I conferred with our furry friends, man to animal
Think of the amazing repartee
If I could walk with the animals, talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak, and squawk with the animals
And they could talk to me

If I consulted with quadrupeds
Think what fun we’d have asking over crocodiles for tea
Or maybe lunch with two or three lions, walruses and sea lions
What a lovely place the world would be

If I spoke slang to orangutans
The advantages any fool on earth can plainly see
Discussing eastern art and dramas with intellectual llamas
That’s a big step forward you’ll agree

I’d learn to speak in antelope and turtle
My Pekinese would be extremely good
If I were asked to sing in hippopotamus
I’d say “Whynotamous?” and would

If I could parlay with pachyderms
It’s a fairy tale worthy of Hans Anderson or Grimm
A man who walks with the animals, talks with the animals
Grunts and squeaks, and squawks with the animals
And they could talk to him

I’d study every living creature’s language
So you could speak to all of them on site
If friends said, “Can he talk in crab or pelican?”
Then I'd say, “Well, I can” and I’d be right

And if you just stop and think a bit
There's no doubt of it we would win a place in history
If I could walk with the animals, talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak, and squawk with the animals
And they could squeak and squawk, and speak and talk to me

Alright fellas, I understand that's enough

I had a jukebox graduate for first mate, she couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed b-52 and bombed them with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing

You've got to hold her and want her and make her feel you'll always need her
You know a woman is sentimental and so easy to upset
So make her feel that she's for real and she'll give you happiness
Woh, oh, oh, strange as it seems, you know you can't treat a woman mean
 
So my friend there you have it, the easy simple way
If you fail to do this, don't blame her if she looks my way
'Cause I'm gonna treat her like a lady;  so affectionately
I'm gonna treat her like a lady, she'll give in to me

Alvin Youngblood Hart,"This land is your land, this land is my land
From [the] California to the [Staten] New York Island,
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf stream waters,
[God blessed America for me.]
As I went walking that ribbon of highway
And saw above me that endless skyway,
And saw below me the golden valley, I said:
[God blessed America for me.]

I roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts,
And all around me , a voice was sounding:
[God blessed America for me.]

Was a high wall there that tried to stop me
A sign was painted said: Private Property,
But on the back side it didn't say nothing
[God blessed America for me.]

When the sun come shining, then I was strolling
In wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling;
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting:
[God blessed America for me.]

One bright sunny morning in the shadow of the steeple
By the Relief Office I saw my people
As they stood hungry, I stood there wondering if

Alvin Youngblood Hart,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme",The Third Man Theme (Harry Lime) [From the Third Man],2005

When I walked right through the door.

Yet little did I know before,
We would be something more.

Hanging out with someone new
Come on, dude, I can't believe who

Did it hurt? Oh yes, it hurt
But not as much as I thought it would
Guess it's time for me to move on

I'm getting closer (closer, close)
Closer to closure (closer to closure)
Every day's closer (closer, close)
Closer to closure (closer to closure)

I finally took your pictures down
And all that other stuff I found
Hidden somewhere in my closet

I used to wear your shirt to bed
But now it's in the trash instead
I don't want to be reminded, no, no

I'm getting closer (closer, close)
Closer to closure (closer to closure)
Every day's closer (closer, close)
Closer to closure (closer to closure)

I saw you today taking my breath away
But then you opened your mouth without thinking
And then I recalled why I ended it all
And it makes me feel good about leaving, leaving

Mmm
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
I'm getting closer

I'm getting closer (closer, close)

There'll be no more trying, no more coming back
No more forgiving you, no more thinking that
Somehow the sum will be different
By using division

Half of your friends would attend before they ever knew
Why they are going to this party I'm throwing
They would be thinking that I would be pleading to you
To get back together, well, how about never?

But the question got the better of his scientific mind, 
And to his blind and dying gaze, 
He looked up high and often sighed, 
And sometimes cried, 

Who puts the rainbow in the sky?
Who lights the stars at night?
Who dreamt up someone so divine?
Someone like you and made them mine?

Love can make you ask some funny questions now and then.
But just remember the alternatives for I remember when
I was lonely and unhappy, 
And my lips were cold as ice.
But you kissed me, and good heavens, 
Now I'm here in paradise, 
So if ever I'm not kissing you or looking in your eyes.
I won't be blind, and I won't cry.
I'll look up high and gladly sigh, 
And thank the guy, 

Who puts the rainbow in the sky?
Who lights the stars at night?
Who dreamt up someone so divine?
Someone like you and made them mine?
Someone like you and made them mine?",Galileo (Someone Like You),2012
Aly Bain,"I saw you on the avenue
You looked so tired and a little blue
You were in your Sunday best
With your father's tie upon your chest

[Chorus:]
Hey, you always stood me still
Hey, you always will

In the corridor of one hotel
We once crossed paths I recall it well
Voices in an empty hall
Slamming doors to hearts that fall

[Chorus]

Always will
Always will
Hey
Always will
Always will
Hey

Love has been my passer by
I stood too still to catch your eye
But there out on the avenue
In your father's tie I'll remember you

Hey, you always will",Always Will,2013

Aly Bain,"My history is no secret it's written in the stones
In the hill beside this river rest my mother's gentle bones
And daddy there beside her among his next of kin
And their legacy passed down to me the sons of mountain men

Raised to be a miner by a miners callused hands
Passed my youth between these mountains where I grew to understand
That family was the word of God and faith was it's demand
And life and death the same came from the coal beneath this land

Well, a rich man writes the book of laws a poor man must defend
But the highest laws are written on the hearts of honest men
If that cup is passed to me to do what must be done
When they lay me down remind them I was just my father's son

I've walked among these people, heard the stories that they tell
I've crawled beside them in the mines and touched the walls of hell
I've shared their sacred secrets, known their triumph and their pain
And right or wrong I'll stand with them on the final judgment day

They say God gives his comfort when the time of trouble comes
They say we'll know no share of peace till we lay down our guns
But will my boy have the chance to do the things I've never done
Or will he, like me, be told that he must be his father's son?

Well, a rich man writes the book of laws a poor man must defend
But the highest laws are written on the hearts of honest men
When that cup is passed to me to do what must be done
On a chunk of coal just carve these words, ""I was just my father's son""",My Father's Son,2013
Aly Bain,"You say this ain't over yet
I've said things that I regret
Won't be easy to forget
Scars take time to heal

Before another bitter word gets loose
I was hoping we could call a truce

Cause nobody wins, we both lose
Hearts get broken and love get bruised
When we light that same old fuse
Again and again
Nobody wins slamming doors
We've both lost this fight before
And I won't play that game no more
Cause nobody wins

Darlin' we've got too much pride
It don't matter who's wrong or right
Honey love ain't black and white
It's the way I feel about you

All I wanna do is hold you tight
I can't take another angry night

I figured it out I need you
Don't know why I didn't know it then
I got it all wrong I miss you
Don't know what I was thinking

When it's going along when it's something to give
That's when I feel I have to wonder

For what my heart was saying

",Don't Know What I Was Thinking,2013
Aly Bain,"Made up my mind to go
Some place so far away, I headed west
Without a sad goodbye
No hugs or tears that way, it's probably for the best
Sent cards along the way
Said I was looking for a brand new life
I never settled down
My wanderlust would always cut the ties like a knife
Sometimes the lonesome wind
Calls out just like it knows me
And on a night like this
When I don't know where to go, he shows me the way

He knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away

I always looked ahead
I was so afraid that I'd be caught behind
Followed a crooked stream
To places I'd never seen and one more highway sign
Just like some other guys
I count the hours 'til the day will end
But it's not so I can rest
For me it's the time that's best for talking to my friend

Cause he knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away

Now half my life is gone
The only home I have is open road
My skin is cracked and brown
A mirror to the dessert ground and the dusty wind that blows
I never made a mark
Just scattered footsteps on the shifting sand
Whatever pushes me
It's something only he can understand

He knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away",Brother Wind,2014
Aly Bain,"After the morning there comes an evening
And after the evening another day
And after a false love there comes a true love
I'd have you listen now to what I say

I swear my love is the finest young man
As fair as any the sun shines on
But how to save him, I do not know it
For he has got a sentence to be hung

As he was marching the streets of Derry
I own he marched up right manfully
Being much more like a commanding officer
Than a man to die upon the gallows tree

""What keeps my love so long in coming
Oh what detains her so long from me
Or does she think it a shame or scandal
To see me die upon the gallows tree""

He looked around and he saw her coming
And she was dressed all in woolen fine
The weary steed that my love was riding
It flew more swiftly than the wind

Come down, come down from that cruel gallows
I've got your pardon from the king
And I'll let them see that they dare not hang you
And I'll crown my love with a bunch of green",The Streets of Derry,2014

Aly Bain,"Last night I dreamed my head was in fever
Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star

I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star

The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star

Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star

I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star

I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star
",Bright Morning Star,2014
Aly Bain,"I can tell by the way you're walking
You don't want company 
I'll let you alone and I'll let you walk on 
And in your own good time you'll be 

Back where the sun can find you
Under the wise wishing tree 
And with all of them made we'll lie under the shade
And call it a jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're talking
That the past isn't letting you go 
But there's only so long you can take it all on
And then the wrong's gotta be on its own

And when you're ready to leave it behind you
You'll look back and all that you'll see 
Is the wreckage and rust that you left in the dust
On your way to the jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're listening
That you're still expecting to hear 
Your name being called like a summons to all
Who have failed to account for their doubts and their fears

They can't add up to to much without you
And so if it were up to me, I'd take hold of your hand 
Saying come hear the band
Play your song at the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're searching
For something you can't even name  
That you haven't been able to come to the table
Simply glad that you came

When you feel like this try to imagine
That we're all like frail boats on the sea 
Just scanning the night for that great guiding light
Announcing the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're standing
With your eyes filling with tears 
That it's habit alone that keeps you turning for home
Even though your home is right here

Where the people who love you are gathered
Under the wise wishing tree 
May we all be considered then straight on delivered
Down to the jubilee 

Because to people who love you are waiting
And they'll wait just as long as need be 
When we look back and say those were halcyon days 
We're talking about jubilee",Jubilee,2014

The place where I was born and raised.

No pleasures here on earth I found. 
For in this world I'm bound to ramble, 
I have no friends to help me now.

Time would come for roll call 
Time for us to part

I'd hold you tight
We'd kiss good night

Somewhere over there
All confined to barracks
'Twas more than I could bear 
I knew you were waiting in the street
I heard your feet
But could not meet 
My Lili of the lamplight 
My own Lili Marlene 

Resting in our billet 
Just behind the line
Even though we're parted 
Your lips are close to mine 
You wait where that lantern softly gleamed
Your sweet face seems 
To haunt my dreams

Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes 
Wipe his glasses when he read the news 
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch

The magic of Aladdin couldn't do as much
She's a wizard, she's a champ
And she doesn't need a lamp

A woman's touch can weave a spell
The kind of hocus pocus that she does so well
With the magic of a broom
She can mesmerize a room

With a whisk whisk here and a whisk whisk there
And a dustpan for the cinders
With a rub rub here and a rub rub there
She can polish up the winders

Then presto chango 
Suddenly, the sun comes shining through
And what does Mr Sunshine say to you?
How d'you do?

It makes you blink, to stop and think
A woman and a whisk-broom 
Can accomplish so darn much
So never under-estimate a woman's touch

A woman's touch can quickly fill
The empty flower boxes on a window sill
One smile from her and zoom
Little buds begin to bloom  

A touch of paint, a magic nail
Can turn a kitchen chair into a Chippendale
Even make the lamp appear
Like a crystal chandelier

With a tack tack here and a tack tack there
And a hand around a hammer
With a mop mop here and a mop mop there
You can give a cabin glamour

Then gosh, almighty, all at once
The cabin that we knew
Becomes a shining castle built for two
Me and you

The pies and cakes a woman bakes
Can make a fella tell her 
That he loves her very much

I mean to be all honest, that is, but now hmm
well let's just say I'm not ashamed

Now in my lifetime I've been all around the world
(Round and around and around)
From city to city, from state to state
And of course, from girl to girl

And I believe that I've played every game in the world
that one man could possibly play (don't play with me baby)

that's made me feel this way 
Now I realize that love takes time
and trust is somethin' that you have to earn
(Ooh, you gotta earn it baby) mmm
Well I'm prepared to give you all of me
but, I need the same in return (you know you got it)

that I'm to blame (are you sure)

for some type of commitment (don't you want it)

You keep from me, but I'm drowning and slowly sinking in a bottle of patron.
I cant let go-oh ooh I cant let go, so

Its just another lonely night
They happen all the time
Now that you're not around.
Like picking up a loaded gun
Holding the telephone
And I should put it down.
Its just another wasted call full of alcohol,
Another night I know that I wont recall,
And its never enough, its another heartbreak coverup.

Its there beneath all the shattered, broken pieces I've been trying to let go-oh.
Hiding away in the places to see distant faces of the love you used to know, oh.
To keep from me and I'm spinning, I feel like dying, I got one foot on the floor
I cant let go-oh, ooh I cant let go, so

Its just another lonely night
They happen all the time
Now that you're not around.
Like picking up a loaded gun
Holding the telephone
And I should put it down.
Its just another wasted call full of alcohol,
Another night I know that I wont recall,
And its never enough, its another heartbreak coverup.

Its another heartache, mistake, waiting for the rain after the knife
Cause crying wont be enough to brush the blood after the fighting,
You see the pain I'm feeling,
Isn't less, than the moment till I get you mine I'm still standing until I call the fight.

Its just another lonely night
They happen all the time
Now that you're not around.

And I should put it down.

Alyssa Reid,"You with the sad eyes, don’t be discouraged
Oh I realize, it’s hard to take courage
In a world full of people, you can lose sight of it
And the darkness inside you makes you feel so small

But I see your true colours shining through
I see your true colours, that’s why I love you
So don’t be afraid to let them show your true colours
True colours are beautiful
Like a rainbow
(Oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh)
Like a rainbow
(Oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh)

Show me a smile then, don’t be unhappy
Can’t remember when I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy and you’ve taken all you can bear
You call me up because you know I’ll be there

I see your true colours shining through
I see your true colours, that’s why I love you
So don’t be afraid to let them show your true colours
True colours are beautiful (Cheer up!) like a rainbow

I see your colours though they appear to be different
You should never be afraid because your difference is the difference
We live in a time where to be yourself is hard
And the way you really feel can leave you emotional scar
But stay strong, stay firm and never back down
Being yourself is the only way to act that
(Like a rainbow)
Trust me, I’m a fighter and a lover
But the only time I fight is to reveal my true colours
You know

I see your true colours shining through
I see your true colours, that’s why I love you

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Lose their taste for kissing?

Alyth McCormack,"I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
I saw three ships come sailing in
On Christmas Day in the morning
 
And what was in those ships all three
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?
And what was in those ships all three
On Christmas Day in the morning?

The Virgin Mary and Christ were there
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there
On Christmas Day in the morning

Pray, wither sailed those ships all three
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
Pray, wither sailed those ships all three
On Christmas Day in the morning

O they sailed into Bethlehem
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
O they sailed into Bethlehem
On Christmas Day in the morning

And all the bells on earth shall ring
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
And all the bells on earth shall ring
On Christmas Day in the morning

And all the Angels in Heaven shall sing
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
And all the Angels in Heaven shall sing
On Christmas Day in the morning

And all the souls on earth shall sing
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
And all the souls on earth shall sing
On Christmas Day in the morning

Then let us all rejoice again
On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
Then let us all rejoice again
On Christmas Day in the morning",I Saw Three Ships,2013
Am,"Fragment of twilight
Trace of existence
Find the connection inside my dream
Heart of illusion
Ancestral wisdom
Mystical fusion, pure energy

Genesis, aria
Genesis, acqua
Genesis, terra
Genesis, fuoco

Rising sun, purple moon, falling star, wide blue ocean
Morning light, hidden myst, fire, ice, starless nightfall
Visions of unknown that lead to eternal words

Dying rose, crystal snow, crying dawn, frozen season
Raging wind, lightning's strike, open sea, magic solstice
Soul's cosmic feeling that turns into inner calls

Fragment of twilight

Find the connection inside my dream

AM,"Looking out at the city so bright
Not sure if its imagined or real
Show me something that you'd always want to hide
And then well get away
You always wanted to say what you feel
But all those right hands keep telling you wrong
Got another who's just stepping on your heels
Got to get away
Get away from

All these troubled and all of these lies
Find yourself a reason 
Leave tonight
Take your chances 
Feeling alright
And then well fade away
Fade away tonight

Helpless highways looking alone
Seen nothing but the worst of your times
All in all it s got you climbing up the walls
You gotta get away
Get away from

All these troubled and all of these lies
Find yourself a reason 
Leave tonight
Take your chances 
Feeling alright
And then well fade away
Fade away tonight",City Syndrome,2005
AM,"Far away you've gone, and left me here
So cold without you, so lonely dear
May June July I count the time
Every minute I go takes the smell of your clothes further away

'Cause you've gone away
Where there isn't a telephone wire
Still I wait by the phone
You don't even write to say goodbye
Goodbye

I have saved every piece of paper
Like grocery lists & note cards
To do lists & race scores
So just in case you change your mind
& come back, I've kept everything safe

While you're gone away
Where there isn't a telephone wire
Still I wait by the phone
You don't even write to say goodbye

Get me out get me off
This is a ride going nowhere
But somewhere that I despise
Going nowhere to end up with a tearful
I don't wanna go on
With these pieces of paper
That you've left behind for

This is a ride going nowhere
But somewhere that I despise
Going nowhere to end up with a tearful
I don't wanna go on
With these pieces of paper
To keep me company in my old age

While you're gone away
Where there isn't a telephone wire
Still I wait by the phone
Why don't you write to say goodbye
Goodbye",Gone Away,2005
AM,"I've got a little red bow
And I bought it for you
'Cause I know you're not fair
I don't get it, oh well
And you color my skin
And the colors don't blend

'Cause I'm gonna get you
And your little dog too
There's a yellow brick road
That we follow back home
'Cause I know you can't wait
Your belligerent hate
There's no place like home
There's no place like home

Like home
I've, got a southern belle too
And ruby red shoes
With a body of straw
Are you sick of it all?
There's a man made of tin
With an oil can grin

And I'm gonna get you
And your little dog too
There's a yellow brick road
That we follow back home
And I know you can't wait
Your belligerent hate
There's no place like home
There's no place like home

There's a little white porch
And you wanted it so
Can you let me go down
To the end of the road
In the black and the white
A techni-colorful life
Can I stand by your side?
We can make it alright

Like home
'Cause I'm home
There's a little white porch
And you wanted it so
Can you let me go down
To the end of the road
In the black and the white
A Technicolorful life

Then another arrived
It's a cowardly lion
What I want from this world
What I wanna resolve
When I want you to stay
So I want you to wait

I don't wanna be bold
I don't wanna be cold
I don't wanna grow old
I don't wanna go home",Home,2005
AM,"In the dead of the night
As the candles die out
I'm watching her going to sleep
She has to be strong
She's left all along
I have to go out in the fields

You're all I ever wanted

And I can't go on without you
But some things come between us,
My love

Words cannot express
The sorrow I feel
I wish I could turn back time
To where we began
Where love had no end
And you and me were as one

You're all I ever wanted
There's just pain without you
Hear the angels cry in heaven, my love

I'm scared I might be losing you
and I don't know which way to turn
I fell I might be losing you
I can't live my life without your love

The sound of your breath

The smell of your hair

The touch of your golden skin

They keep me awake

Through out every night
To think of what might have been
You're all I ever wanted
You're my life and my lust
I could never mean to hurt you, my love

I have fought so many battles
I have suffered so much pain
Without you to love and hold me
All of this would be in vain",Losing You,2005
