Yuridia,"Todo comienza muy bien
Tú me llamas y contesto
Que me extrañas y concuerdo
Que me quieres y te creo

Que si nos vamos a ver 
Y mis planes los cancelo
Que si quiero acompañarte
Siempre digo: por supuesto

Y luego casi todo es felicidad 
Hasta que me presentas como amiga 
Y yo me callo mejor 
Aunque quisiera gritar que no

Que los amigos no 
Se besan en la boca
Los amigos no se extrañan todo el día, gente loca 
Los amigos no se llaman a las dos de la mañana
Los amigos no se deberían dormir en la misma cama

Los amigos no 
Se conocen todo el cuerpo
Por eso anda ve e inventa otra palabra, no te creo
Amigos no, por favor
Amigos no, por favor
Porque los amigos no se hacen el amor

Y entonces digo
Esta fue la última que nos veremos
No me merezco ser de nadie 
Su juguete, su pasatiempo

Pero algo pasa cuando vuelves a llamar 
Y salimos de nuevo
Todo es tan perfecto 
Hasta ese momento en que me vuelves a presentar 

Que los amigos no 
Se besan en la boca
Los amigos no se extrañan todo el día, gente loca
Los amigos no se llaman a las dos de la mañana
Los amigos no se deberían dormir en la misma cama 

Los amigos no 
Se conocen todo el cuerpo
Por eso anda ve e inventa otra palabra, no te creo 
Amigos no, por favor
Amigos no, por favor

Porque los amigos no se hacen el amor (amigos no por favor)
Porque los amigos no se hacen el amor",Amigos No por Favor,
Yuridia,"Perdón por ver estrellas donde no había
Y por ilusionarme con tus besos de papel
Perdón por confundir amor con compañía
Comprarme la idea de que un día
Tú me ibas a querer, a querer

Dicen que lo mejor para un buen adiós
Es disculparse y perdonar lo que dolió
Hay yo ya no sé quien lo hizo peor
Si tú y tu ego o yo y mi terco corazón

Perdóname, perdóname
Por haberte dado más de lo que tú querías tener
Perdóname, perdóname
La culpa es toda mía, tú tuviste algo que ver

Perdóname
Mi error fue abrazarte
Mi error fue entregarme
Mi error fue enamorarme, de un cobarde

Perdón por extrañarte cada noche y día
Por no ver las señales que eran claras en tu piel
Perdón por aferrarme a esta fantasía
Y hacerme a la idea de que un día tu me ibas a ser fiel

Dicen que lo mejor para un buen adiós
Es disculparse y perdonar lo que dolió
Hay yo ya no sé quien lo hizo peor
Si tú y tu ego o yo y mi terco corazón

Ustedes
(Perdóname, perdóname)
Por haberte dado más de lo que tú querías tener
Perdóname perdóname
La culpa es toda mía, tú tuviste algo que ver

No es cinismo en verdad estoy arrepentida
Perdóname por apostar que yo podría ser el amor de tu vida

Perdóname, perdóname
Por haberte dado más de lo que tú querías tener
Perdóname, perdóname
La culpa es toda mía, tú tuviste algo que ver

Perdóname
Mi error fue abrazarte
Mi error fue entregarme
Mi error fue enamorarme de un cobarde",Cobarde,
Yuridia,"Yo no vi las flores, marchitar
Ni ese frío en tus ojos, al mirar
No, no vi la realidad
Me ibas a dejar

Dicen que la vida no es como la vez
Para aprender hay que caer
Para ganar hay que perder
Lo di todo por ti

Lloré y lloré y juré que no iba a perderte
Traté y traté de negar este amor
Tantas veces, baby

Si mis lagrimas fueron en vano
Si al final yo te amé demasiado
Como yo, como yo
Nadie te ha amado

Cada hora, una eternidad
Cada amanecer un comenzar
Ilusiones nada más
Que fácil fué soñar

Tantas noches de intimidad
Parecían no acabar
Nos dejamos desafiar
Y hoy nada es igual

Sé que en verdad el amor
Al final siempre duele
No lo pude sanar y hoy voy
A pagarlo con creces, baby

Si mis lágrimas fueron en vano
Si al final yo te amé demasiado
Como yo, como yo
Nadie te ha amado

Lloré y lloré y juré que no iba a perderte
Traté y traté de negar este amor
Tantas veces, baby

Si mis lágrimas fueron en vano
Si al final yo te amé demasiado
Como yo, como yo
Nadie te ha amado

Esta vez la pasión a ganado
Y por eso, sigo esperando
Como yo, como yo
Nadie te ha amado",Como Yo Nadie Te Ha Amado,
Yuridia,"Vienes y siembras la duda aquí en mi corazón
Un día dices si y otro dices no
¿Qué quieres que piense?
Dame una respuesta

Dame una razón para no desconfiar
De todas tus promesas, no me pidas cosas
Que son imposibles, quiero todo o nada
De una vez decide

Porque me están matando las dudas
De no saber qué va a pasar
Por favor un minuto ponte en mi lugar
Y ojalá me resuelvas esta confusión
Que hay en mi corazón

Porque si no me aclaras
Qué pasa en tu mente al besarme la piel
Cómo diablos me pides que me sienta bien
Si no sé lo que significo para ti
Ya no puedo fingir

Y sin una respuesta solo haces que
Yo dude más de ti

Tengo miedo de seguir, miedo de parar
Una sensación que no sé explicar
Este amor es grande
Mas que mi cordura

Porque al escuchar tu voz diciéndome
Que de verdad me amas se me olvida todo
Y creo en tu mirada pero al despedirte
Me quedo sin nada

Porque me están matando las dudas
De no saber qué va a pasar
Por favor un minuto ponte en mi lugar
Y ojalá me resuelvas esta confusión
Que hay en mi corazón

Porque si no me aclaras
Qué pasa en tu mente al besarme la piel
Cómo diablos me pides que me sienta bien
Si no sé lo que significo para ti
Ya no puedo fingir

Y sin una respuesta solo haces que
Yo dude más de ti
Yo dude más de ti

Porque si no me aclaras
Qué pasa en tu mente al besarme la piel
Cómo diablos me pides que me sienta bien
Si no sé lo que significo para ti
Ya no puedo fingir

Y sin una respuesta solo haces que
Yo dude más de ti
Y sin una respuesta solo haces que
Yo dude más de ti",La  Duda,
Yuridia,"Todo llega a su fin, no puedo dejarte ir
Maldita soledad, ah ah
Quererte es lo que amo más
Robaste mi corazón y estoy mal, no te puedo dejar de pensar
Me da miedo tu prisa y tú voz cuando dices adiós y me cuesta aceptar (esa es)
Porque quiero tenerte para mí
Has dejado un espacio dentro de mí
Y yo no, no puedo estar si tú te vas
Quiero que estés junto a mí
Yo quiero estar en su lugar

Tienes que entender
Que no fue mi intención
Es algo en mi interior, oh woh
No debo negarmelo
Es un desastre no ves, te lo dije una vez que podría morir
Siento pena por mi corazón, si me dices adiós y me cuesta aceptar, jo-oh-oh
Porque quiero tenerte para mí
Has dejado un espacio dentro de mí
Y yo no, no puedo estar si tú te vas
Quiero que estés junto a mí
Yo quiero estar en su lugar

Tienes que entender, que no fue mi intención",En Su Lugar,
Yuridia,"Tropezamos de nuevo
Sin encontrar la explicación
A los latidos del corazón

Se pararon los vientos
Y las manillas del reloj
Al oxidarse el entendimiento
Y el aire se contamina
Sin la palabra exacta entre los dos
Y el aire se contamina
Me conoces, ya me conoces

Y el aire se contamina
Y va surgiendo un nuevo mundo paralelo
Y el aire se contamina
Ya sé que tú me hiciste esclava del deseo
Ya sé que tú también bajaste a los infiernos
Ya sé que tú quererme te lo tomas como un juego
Ya sé que tú y yo vivimos en polos opuestos
Vivimos en polos opuestos

No te pido perdón aunque a veces te llore y
Te jure mil veces que nunca más
No te pido te calles para que me la guardes
Seamos sinceros y dios dirá

Ya no te pido ver
Es imposible mirar al pasado y dejar de pasar
No te pido que olvides y empezar de cero
Se bien que esa noche yo hice mal

Fue una noche de copas una noche loca
Bese otros labios olvide tu boca
Manche tu imagen me perdí yo sola
Y esa es la historia
Fue una noche de copas una noche loca
Bese otros labios olvide tu boca
Manche tu imagen me perdí yo sola
Y esa es la historia

Fue una noche de copas una noche loca
Bese otros labios olvide tu boca
Manche tu imagen me perdí yo sola
Y esa es la historia
Fue una noche de copas una noche loca

Vivimos en polos opuestos
Vivimos en polos opuestos yeah ah ah",Polos Opuestos/Noche de Copas,
Yuridia,"Sé que no eres feliz
Que ya no andas bien
Que has pensado en regresar
Sé que no resultó
Tú y tu nuevo amor
Lo que son las cosas

Yo ¿qué puedo decir?
Nada a mi favor
Si se fue contigo el amor
Yo al igual que tú jamás te olvide
Lo que son las cosas

Ésta vida sin ti no es nada
Ésta vida si tú no estas
Es desesperada
Equivocada, sin tu amor

Yo sé que no te importó
Irte de aquí me dejo llorando tu adiós
Sé que te quiero más que hace un año atrás
Lo que son las cosas

Ésta vida sin ti no es nada
Ésta vida si tú no estas

¿Que cuándo acabaría? Que nunca
¿Que si me dejarías? 
Y decías que no

¿Que si me cambiarías? Por nadie
¿Que si me cuidarías? Siempre
Amaba preguntarte 
Hasta que tu voz desapareció

Pero me acostumbré a escucharte y creer todo de tus labios
Dejaste muchas dudas en mi corazón
Me las pregunto y las contesto también yo

¿Qué cuándo dejaré de amarte? Nunca
¿Que cómo voy a superarte? No sé
¿Qué ganó con este coraje? Nada
¿Por qué cuesta olvidarte? Pues porque te amé

Yusef Lateef,"Though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
Well I'm so mad about him
I can't live without him

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

Days I knew as happy
Sweet sequester days
Olden days, golden days
Days of mad romance and love

Then gay youth was mine, truth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life
Forsooth, was mine
Sad am I, glad am I

Yusef Lateef,"Magic mirror come and search my heart
Can you tell me what you see
There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody

So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive
Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive

Yusef Lateef,"Little Lilly was oh! So silly and shy
And all the fellows knew,
She wouldn't bill and coo:
Ev'ry single night some smart fellow would try 
o cuddle up to her, but she would cry:
 
""Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
I'm beside him, Mercy!
Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ev'ry minute he gets bolder,
Now he's leaning on my shoulder,
Ma, he's kissing me!""
 
Lilly was so good, ev'ry body could tell.
You'd never see her roam,
She'd always stay at home;
All the neighbors knew little Lilly too well.
For when the boys would call, They'd hear her yell:
 
Ma, he's making eyes at me!
Ma he's awful nice to me!
Ma he's almost breaking my heart,
If you peek in, Can't you see I'm goin' to weaken?
Ma, he wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee.
Ma, I'm meeting with resistance, 
I shall holler for assistance,
Ma, he's kissing me!""

Yusef Lateef,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

Or it's quiet or it's mad;
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,

And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1961
Yusef Lateef,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,

Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day

And for adding to the music in me by worshipful listening
I love you because you're helping to make of the lumber of my life
Not a tavern but a temple
And out of the words of my everyday not a reproach but a song

Know why I've been blue

Remained beside me through my trials in this life of crime
We done fought so many times I forgot to count
I never hit you, not a coward, rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight?
Sippin' Alize and Cristal, whylin' every night, in my bedroom!
Promised that I commit to you soon
Tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room
Straight out the hood
We promised to be good to each other, plus I love you
So I know you gon' make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change in time
It's only 'cause I never owned anything that's mine
So I'm tryin you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police, I never call you bitch or ho'

Just keep your faith in God, knowin' you'll get scarred though

Father watch over lil' seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle, married my baby's momma
Made her my wife now, I'm tryin' hard y'all
Maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watchin' the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meanin' of forever and together we rise
If it would help our child grow, then together we'd die

I went from, nothin' to somethin' now they all wanna see me fall
And the player haters hate to see a thug nigga ball
And they say we hate the East coast, but that's funny
Got a lot of love for, any niggas gettin' money
I made a song about my enemies and niggas tripped
It was hip-hop until Tupac fucked Biggie bitch
Y'all niggas hypocrites and bitch made
Now either love me or hate me but real thug niggas get paid
Have me catchin cases all across the nation
I went to jail to bail to barely on probation
They got a player facin' three strikes, and we might
Just blast God bless the child that can get cash
But all these niggas turnin' and never learn
Got a long line of niggas player hatin' me but gettin' burned
Talk a lot of shit but youse a trick in drag

Gave you the keys to the jeep, offered my home as an open door
But then you picked a new direction, in the blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection, did you think I'd die?
I never got a single visit yet I carry on
All my old friends too busy now my money gone
Said I got raped in jail, picture that?

Yusuf Islam,"His wisdom flowed from Heaven's Book
Just like threaded pearls
Just like threaded pearls
He left his self to flee to God
And God sent him back to us

He was born to be the beloved
A will of the Divine
He was born to be the beloved
He was born to guide

He prayed all his nights alone
And stars and angels sighed
And in the day, he lead the way
With blazing words so bright

He was born to be the beloved
A will of the Divine
He was born to be the beloved
He was born to be kind

He taught the people to worship
Bowing to one God, bowing to one God
His mercy stretched from east to west
To every man, woman and child

He was born to be the beloved
A will of the Divine
He was born to be the beloved

He opened up the doors of love
For every heart parched with thirst

If sometimes I feel a little mad

As bold as he could be
To the place, he heard,
Where the good Prophets used to walk
High above this dark world

How the Truth was buried on the editing floor

I said, ""Oh boy!
I'd never say that!""

Yves Klein Blue,"Brother hold your head this way, 
And bustle to the front of the line;
'cause if they catch your eyes before you get inside
Well, you'll never be allowed. 
People got a name for us 
'cause we escape the strain of the days 
Oh we stretch at the sides and bend in the middle 
But we never ever break.

But if you're feeling that way now, 
Or if you ever feel so inclined -
Skip past the doors of boring forty somethings and rise. 
Oh, and if you want to lose your frown,
Or your name or even your face -
Lick up a dream that seemingly sings with whistling neon breath.

Come and have a drink with us,
A little wine or a nice champagne?
Oh thanks that's nice, and I would decline, 
But at night things seem to change.
People got a name for us, 
'cause we escape the strain of the days -
Oh we stretch at the sides and bend in our minds
But well never ever change.

And if you're feeling that way now, 
Or if you ever feel so inclined, 
Well, kick in the shins of all those fucking whingers and rise.
Oh and if you want to lose your frown,
Or your name or even your face, 
Lick up a dream that seemingly sings with whistling neon breath.

Sid was at the gates of dawn,
And Jimmy said ride the snake: 
So we bent our spoons and howled at the moon 
To find what science replaced.
And it turns out it ain't that much
Though I may have missed it in the haze -
Oh drips in the mind and fills up your eyes
But well never be the same.
(Shhh)
But if you're ever coming down,
Or if you ever take too much - 
Remember that's much better than never ever getting enough.
So if your want to lose your frown,
Or your name or even your face,
Lick up a dream that seemingly screams with rushing neon death.

All your spirits gone, and you are barley alive.
You hand me a smoke, though its like you hardly notice.
And its sad I suppose - When I look into your eyes you say:
It seems to go this way, no matter what's at stake,
Oh it seems to go this way with everything I start! 

(Solo)

So if you're feeling that way now,
Or if you ever feel so inclined - 
Skip past the doors of boring forty somethings and rise. 
Oh but if you want to loose your frown, 
Or your name or even your face -
Lick up a dream that seemingly sings with rushing neon death.

No, don't turn TV on,
Instead just turn me on
I'll light up like neon
Just a tiny section of your affection
In my direction will do, ooh
""You'll just love my embraces 'cause they'll fit like a glove
We'll be off to the races maybe""
Kiss me baby, let's make love
Don't just lay there.. honey do something
Don't just contemplate me
Prove that you don't hate me
Come on, ask you, late me
""Maybe moonlight works with me,
Come to groups with me,
Lips to lips with me, do""

Take a train, steal a car
Hop a freight, grab a star, come back to me

Swim or fly, only please, come back to me
On a mule, in a jet
With your hair in a net
In a towel when you're wet
I don't care, this is where you should be

From the hills, from the shore
Ride the wind to my door
Turn the high with the dust
Break the law if you must
Move the world, only just come back to me

Blast	you high, hear me call
Must i fight city hall
Here and now, damn it all, come back to me
What on earth must i do
Scream and yell till i'm blue
Curse your soul when will you come back to me?
Have you gone to the moon or the corner saloon
At your rack, at your room
Mademoiselle, where in hell can you be?

Leave a sign on your door
Out to lunch ever more
In a royce or a van, wrapped in mink coats or rain
Anyway that you can, come back to me
Hear my voice through the dim
Feel the waves on your skin
Like a call from within, come back to me
Leave behind all your own
Tell your flowers you will phone
Let your dog walk alone, come back to me

Let your tub overflow
If a date waits below
Let him wait for godot
By the rail,
Come by mail, cod
Par avion, par bateau
Dans une vielle, deux chevaux

Come by steam, come by gas
Call for free on a pass
On the drags and the glass, come back to me
Leave your bills all unpaid
Let your bed go unmade
Your souffle unsouffled, come back to me
Come by sail, come by freight
In a box or a tray,	keep your head on the plate
I don't care this is where you should be

Come in pain or in joy
As a girl, as a boy
In a bag or a trunk (shut up!)
On a horse or a drunk
In the flora or faun, come back to me
Come back to me, come back...

Je suis né dans la cité
Qui enfante les usines,
Là ou les hommes turbinent
Toute un' vie sans s'arrêter,
Avec leurs haut's cheminées
Qui s'élancent vers le ciel
Comm'pour cracher leur fumée,
En des nuages artificiels.
Et dans le bruit des sirènes
Des hommes vont, des hommes viennent,
C'est la grand'ville qui surgit,
C'est la grand'ville qui surgit.

Comm' c'est drôle

La sérénade des fauchés
Monte comme une mélopée

Et puis des ceuss' qui n'sont pas bien,
Et moi je les regarde viivre
Et j'trouv' ça drôle.
J'trouv' plus ça drôle.

Qui des quais jusqu'aux bateaux
Avec sa marche obsédante
S'amuse à cracher dans l'eau
On dirait un' drôl' de fête
Où se promène la tempête
Et le Bon Dieu qui est là-haut
Doit trouver ça rigolo.


Refrain

3. Mais il y' a dans la cité
Une fille à la peau douce,
A la va comm' je te pousse
Un' fill' toujours mal peignée,
Elle a sa rob' déchirée,
Mais j'ai trouvé dans ses yeux
Un bout de ciel égaré
Et qui n'appartient qu'à nous deux,
Je ne vois plus les usines,
Et je n'entends plus les machines
Qui donc se dress' sur la cité ?
C'est l'amour et sa liberté.

Refrain

Comm' c'est drôle
L'amour qui marche dans la rue,
Comm' c'est drôle
Deux coeurs perdus dans la cohue,
La sérénade de l'amour,
La sérénade des toujours,
Monte, monte sur la cité
Pour lui chanter sa mélopée
Et moi je suis là pour la suivre,
J'trouv' plus ça drôle.",La Grande Cité,1993
Yves Montand,"Refrain :
Sir Godfrey est l'homm' de Londres
C'est l'intim' des gens du monde
Son parfait humour fait les beaux jours
De l'Empir' Britannique
Il est snob à plus d'un titre...
A son ch'val il donn' des huitres
Et fuit avec horreur tout's les jeun's fill's en fleurs...
Cet homme, un peu à part
Pass' des heur's au billard
Sans le moindre p'tit accroc...
A chaqu' week-end il part
Pour la chasse au canard
Ou le golf d'un casino...
C'est l' genr' vieux garçon
Il tond son gazon par petits morceaux
A coups d'ciseaux...
Il tomb'ra sur un Ostrogoth d'un' grand' famille
Qui voudra caser sa fille...
Alors tout s'ra O.K. pour ce cher Sir Godfrey

Mais on ne sait guèr' que cet homme exemplaire
En réalité s'appelle Smith
Et que depuis toujours chez Smith
On est gangster de père en fils
Attaqu' à main armée, hold-up en tous genres
Vieille renommée, maison de confiance !
Eté comme hiver, aujourd'hui comme hier
On est fils d'Albion : on respect' la tradition !

Le brouillard descend sur Londres
Dans la nuit se glisse un ombre
Cell' de Sir Godfrey, le roi du Requiem Systématique
Il ne sort qu'à l'heur' du crime :
"" Sorry, Sir, si j'vous supprime ""
Il trait' tout's ses affair's dans les quartiers déserts
Oui, mais si par hasard il entre dans un bar
Quelque part dans le Soho,
Tous les mauvais garçons figés comm' des glaçons
Ont soudain froid dans le dos...
Sans dire un seul mot il fait son boulot
Un trou dans la peau, un coup d'chapeau
A ceux qui manqu'nt de polic'men pour les défendre
Puis Godfrey va se fair' pendre ailleurs...
Et sans pétard disparaît dans l'brouillard
Trois heur's qui sonn't...
C'est le moment Sir Godfrey frissonne...
Voici le client...",Sir Godfrey,1994

Ah comme il est bon de se revoir

Dans le vent porte au loin des souvenirs
Dans les plaines du Far-West quand viendra la nuit

Ils sont de New-York ou de Chicago Ya oh ! 
Bingue bongue ! bingue bongue ! ou du Colorado

Du matin au soir, dans l'immensité, yé é !

Mais, dès qu'arrive la fin du jour,
A leur campement ils font retour.

Le nez, le front, le coeur moyen,

Il se couchait vers les neuf heures
Et ne rêvait jamais à rien,
Heureux d'avoir sa montre à l'heure
Et sa femm' qui cuisinait bien.

Puisqu'il ne lui arrivait rien.

Du patron sympathique
Qui discutait politique
Avec l'agent flegmatique
Et pour nous deux
Un seul musicien
Paresseux,
Et le vent léger
Qui faisait voler tes cheveux.

Un grand amour était né dans la ville.
C'était le nôtre, dansant au matin,
dans le petit bal devenu tranquille.

De Paris

Le soleil
Qui est son vieux copain
Est aussi de la fête
Et comme deux collégiens
Ils s'en vont en goguette
Dans Paris

Et la main dans la main
Ils vont sans se frapper
Regardant en chemin
Si Paris a changé

Y'a toujours
Des taxis en maraude
Qui vous chargent en fraude
Avant le stationnement
Où y'a encore l'agent
Des taxis

Au café
On voit n'importe qui
Qui boit n'importe quoi
Qui parle avec ses mains
Qu'est là depuis le matin
Au café

Y'a la Seine
A n'importe quelle heure
Elle a ses visiteurs
Qui la regardent dans les yeux
Ce sont ses amoureux
À la Seine

Et y'a ceux
Ceux qui ont fait leur nids
Près du lit de la Seine
Et qui se lavent à midi
Tous les jours de la semaine
Dans la Seine

Et les autres
Ceux qui en ont assez
Parce qu'ils en ont vu de trop
Et qui veulent oublier
Alors y se jettent à l'eau
Mais la Seine

Elle préfère
Voir les jolis bateaux
Se promener sur elle
Et au fil de son eau
Jouer aux caravelles
Sur la Seine

Les ennuis
Y'en a pas qu'à Paris
Y'en a dans le monde entier
Oui mais dans le monde entier
Y'a pas partout Paris
Voilà l'ennui

À Paris
Au quatorze juillet
À la lueur des lampions
On danse sans arrêt
Au son de l'accordéon
Dans les rues

Depuis qu'à paris
On a pris la bastille
Dans tous les faubourgs
Et chaque carrefour,
Il y a des gars 
Et il y a des filles
Qui, , sans arrêt,
Sur les pavés
Nuit et jour, 
Font des tours
Et des tours
A paris !",A Paris [En Public],2001
Yves Montand,"I'm susceptible to stars in the skies,
I'm incurably romantic,
If they're told to me all covered with sighs,
The wildest of lies seems true.
Each time a lovebird sings,
I have no defenses,
My heart is off on wings
Along with my senses.
I'm a set-up for the moon when it's bright,
I'm incurably romantic.
And I shouldn't be allowed out at night,
With anyone quite like you.
But, oh! Your arms are nice,
And it would be awfully nice
If you turned out to be starry-eyed like me,
And incurably romantic too.",Incurably Romantic,2001

Le matin vous praît blême
Et jusqu'au bout de la nuit
Sans jamais dire je t'aime
Traînerez-vous votre ennui
Quand un seul regard de flamme
Tient le secret du bonheur
Quand il suffit pour votre âme
De rencontrer l'âme soeur

Sa bonne humeur et son esprit
Paris sera toujours Paris !

Les robes soient beaucoup plus sobres
Qu'il why ait moins d'fleurs et moins d'aigrettes
Que les couleurs soient plus discrètes

Les chinchillas et les hermines
Que les bijoux pleins de décence
Brillent surtout par leur absence
Que la beauté soit moins voyante
Moins effrontée moins provocante...

Paris sera toujours Paris !
La plus belle ville do monde

Sa tenue est encore plus jolie...

We'll be off to the races maybe""

Le monstrueux désert des rues...

Insensiblement tous mes rêves m'ont parlé de vous.

Où êtes-vous ?

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

La terre est basse et je vois le soleil si haut,
Que j'aimerais m'arrêter au flanc d'un coteau.
Mais la moisson va se lever pour nous demain
Et nous la brasserons à pleines mains.
La terre est basse et là-haut, le soleil si chaud,
Que je voudrais m'endormir au bord d'un ruisseau.
Mais le fruit mûr, faisant ployer ses branches un jour,
Se penchera vers toi, jusqu'à tes lèvres, ô mon amour !


Plus lourds s'en iront les chalands
Quand nos mains auront fait les moissons.
Et nous reviendrons à pas lents,
Sous un ciel tout vibrant de chansons.
Alors, les fiancés
Apparaîtront main dans la main,
Et nous irons danser
Dans les greniers fleurant le grain.

Et s'compromettront avec vous !

And no hero out of books

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him

If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late

I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

My lyrical energy bring out envy in most MC's 
Who listen to O, he didn't know me before

Verdict is in, the judge know my beef has cause

You may never find a MC well orchestrated like a symphony 
Some'll go down in history, some in infamy 
The infamy will be somewhat a mystery

My identity, will ring bells in all facilities

I'ma philosophize, analyze, no question 
If I die I'ma return like Jesus' resurrection

My love's here, it's no dream tonight

Make him feel, like he felt before
While the lights are low
Please, let the music flow
I know that the melody that made him mine
Will be the melody that keeps him close to me (love's theme)

Aimons-nous jour après jour

Deux mille ans de haine 
N'ont rien changé à l'amour

Aimons-nous quand même
La mort unit sans retour
Aimons-nous, je t'aime
Je te tuerai, mon amour
L'amour nous préserve
Des remords de nos tueries
On tue sans réserve
Par amour de sa patrie

On vit dans l'histoire
Lorsque l'on vit sans aimer
L'amour c'est la gloire
La puissance et l'amitié
Aimons sans contrainte
Aimons-nous comme il se doit
Resserrons l'étreinte

I need your strength, 
I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear, I miss so much.
 
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe.
From this old world I try to hide my face,
But from this loneliness there's no hiding place.
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell,
in darkness with memories I know so well.
 
I need your love more than before,
I can hardly carry on anymore.
My World Is Empty Without You, babe, 
without you babe,without you babe,
My mind and soul have felt like this,
Since love between us no more exist.
And each time that darkness falls,
if finds me alone with these four walls.

Er geht einsam, einsame Wege, niemand kennt seinen Schmerz.
Da er doch so verlockend scheint, glaubt ihm niemand sein gebrochenes Herz.
Oh er lügt wenn er sagt, dass er unnahbar ist, denn ich berühr ihn doch, wenn er mich nachts so Innig Küsst.

Wie ein Regenbogen,
Spannt er seinen Horizont um mich.
Wie ein Regenbogen,
So ungreifbar und unendlich.
Wie ein Regenbogen,
Voller Sehnsucht zieht es mich, zieht es mich ins Licht.
Regenbogen

Niemand den er, jemals sich opfert.
Keiner der seine Schritte längt,
Von den Regeln, die mir so bedeutsam sind, fühlt er sich in seiner Freiheit bedrängt.
Und ich weiß, ich kann gehen, er hält mich niemals zurück, doch ich will ihn verstehen.
Denn er fehlt mir zum Glück

Werden größer jeden Tag
Sie werden meine überholen
Und dann schau ich dir leise nach
Und irgenwann wachsen dir Flügel
Und der Wind ruft deinen Namen
Dann steigst du immer höher
Höher als ich jemals kam
Und dann triffst du diese Liebe
Herzen brechen, Herzen hallen

Ich will nur dass du weißt
Du bist nie allein
Und schau ich mal zurück
Muss ich sagen, ich hatte Glück
Ich hab gewusst du schaffst das auch
Pass gut auf mich auf
Und dann bin ich alt und grau
Und wenn ich fall, fängst du mich auf

If I could go on sleeping.

But every morning'
I wake up and worry
What's gonna happen today.
You see it your way,
And I see it mine,
But we both see it slippin' away.

You know, we always had each other, baby.
I guess that wasn't enough.
Oh, but here in my heart
I give you the best of my love.
Oh, sweet darlin',
You get the best of my love.

Yvonne Elliman,"Try not to get worried, try not to turn on to
Problems that upset you, oh.
Don't you know
Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine.
And we want you to sleep well tonight.
Let the world turn without you tonight.
If we try, we'll get by, so forget all about us tonight

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes.

Sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you, and anoint you.
Myrrh for your hot forehead, oh.
Then you'll feel
Everything's alright, yes, everything's fine.
And it's cool, and the ointment's sweet
For the fire in your head and feet.
Close your eyes, close your eyes
And relax, think of nothing tonight.

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes.

Woman your fine ointment, brand new and expensive
Should have been saved for the poor.
Why has it been wasted? We could have raised maybe
Three hundred silver pieces or more.
People who are hungry, people who are starving
They matter more than your feet and hair!

Try not to get worried, try not to turn on to
Problems that upset you, oh.
Don't you know

Everything's alright, yes, everything's alright, yes.

Surely you're not saying we have the resources
To save the poor from their lot?
There will be poor always, pathetically struggling.
Look at the good things you've got.
Think while you still have me!
Move while you still see me!
You'll be lost, and you'll be sorry when I'm gone.

Sleep and I shall soothe you, calm you and anoint you.
Myrrh for your hot forehead/
Then you'll feel

You used to still the show

To make up plans and find them all
The plans of being race
We have a little money
And we made a little time
And soon we broke forgetful
Of what we left behind

You know that it should have been me

Holding hands with somebody new

Instead of her standing by you 
You know that it should have been me 
Getting ready to say 'I do'!""

Speak now or forever, forever hold your peace""

Yvonne Hodges,"Well back in 1876 an ol' boy named Bell
Invented a contraption that we know so well
By the 1950's they were in everybody's home
There's a crazy little thing they call the telephone
Now there's one on every corner, in the back of every bar
You can get one in your briefcase, on a plane or in your car

So tell me why, haven't I, heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I said now darlin', honey, what is your excuse
Why haven't I heard from you

There's no problem gettin' to me
Baby you can dial direct
I got call forwarding, call waiting
You can even call collect

When the service man he told me that my phone was workin' fine
And I've come to the conclusion the trouble isn't with my line
I'm sure the operator will be glad to put you through
So dial zero for assistance if this all confuses you

So tell me why, haven't I, heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I said now darlin', honey, what is your excuse
Why haven't I heard from you

There better been a flood, a landslide of mud
A fire that burns up the wires
And thunder so loud with a black funnel cloud
A natural disaster I know nothin' about

Tell me why, haven't I, heard from you
Tell me why, haven't I heard from you
I said now darlin', honey, what is your excuse

And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory,2006

GIRLS
Have you met my good friend Maria, 
The craziest girl on the block? 

You'll know her the minute you see her, 
She's the one who is in an advanced state of shock. 
She thinks she's in love. 
She thinks she's in Spain. 

She isn't in love, 
She's merely insane. 
It must be the heat 
Or some rare disease, 

Or too much to eat 
Or maybe it's fleas. 
Keep away from her, 
Send for Chino! 

This is not the 
Maria we know! 
Modest and pure, 
Polite and refined, 

Well-bred and mature 
And out of her mind!

Oh, so pretty 
That the city should give me its key. 
A committee 
Should be organized to honor me.

And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

When you hear her call you across a crowded room,

Cause nobody come around when I not spend
I walk around this fuckin planet feelin boxed in
Smokin stoge after stoge like it's oxygen
When there was 10 of us we all ate from one dub
Let's turn the dirt to glory for Pac up above
Yak one love, I know you gotta be free
Havin conversations with you when there's nobody but me
I guess whatever don't kill me make me stronger

All the wrong in this world, taught me not to believe in things
Not even man, cause we all change daily
Best friends be tryin to bring each other death quickly
Only the strong survive
As long as I'm alive I ride
Hooked up with some niggas that I knew had my side
O-you-t-l-a-w-z
Me for you, you for me eternally

Cause the Don may be gone but he remains deep inside us
It comes out every time niggas try us

And all I got left is my Outlaw niggas
My cousins and my brothers and some Jersey drug dealers
I keep my faith in the Lord and stay strugglin
He keep on pushin me forward to stay hustlin
And when Pac died nobody never knew
Or gave a fuck on what the Outlawz was goin through
We kept your heads to the sky and our guns too
We had to ask straight for a dollar to split a cold brew
And through the process our family was still dyin
I got a grip of this shit, there's no complyin
And I'ma be the solid rock that I am, nigga
And I'ma give it all I got to raise my kid, nigga
I got the blood of Malcolm X in me
I got the dirt from the cemetery runnin in me
One way up and that's how we goin, nigga
Now put guns up, the world ain't friendly, nigga
And just wait till you get to hold reality
And just wait, I bet you try to up your salary
And these crackers be doin too much

Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in y'all face

[Slim Thug]
I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue that
22 that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

All y'all haters, can kiss our ass

[Lil Flip]
Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging 4's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And y'all haters, y'all can kiss our ass

[Tite]
I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

",Freestyle,
Z-Ro,"Comin' up as yungsta
Watchin' the OG's in the hood while they flossin' in they rides
Candy paint, chrome wheels, and black magic on the attire
Me, yeah I was lovin' it, but not old enough drive
Parkin' lot pimpin' from the passenger side
I use to walk everywhere I had to show up
Shoe hills, one down like wheel rubber, man I was about to go nuts
Hopefully I would blow up in these rap game man
My people roll swanga's, I wanted to be rollin' the same thang
Never had alot of work, but I was doin' what I could
Movin' nickles, dimes, twenty's, and ounces all threw my hood
Since I had a one yolla fines cash me up
Mean while thumpin' for a ride my homies pass me up
It's all gravy, when I'm able I'm a showin' all somthin'
From a hopte to a foreign, I'm ballin' it's all or nothin'
Treat my feet with' designer to fine sneak's when I leave my home
Only place you catch me walkin' is to my mail box's
Cause on the streets I be on crome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rollin' chrome

Huh, I started off with' a canary yellow cutlass supreme on bald tire's
Yeah I know I was out of line
But that was all I could find
Or should I say that was all I could purchase for what I had to spend
But at least I had somthin' to go from point A to B and
No more offerin' gas money to get a lift
Besides when your driven it's easyer to get a chick
So ani't no more parkin' lot pimpin' at the club I'm up in there
Seekin' little mama, with' thick thighs, I hope she let me in there
Like swim wear, pull up to the motel, and we'll go in there
Nothin' left to do but comit a sin there
And that was in my hopte, but when I show up in my big body with' the gloss
All of the boppers was boppin' I just could'nt shake'm off
Sixteen switches, tewnty-two inches, trunk goin' to war
They don't want to lay here with me, they want to lay in my car
I was lovin' it back then and still love it today
Except I'm not yellow cutlase no more, I'm 300 blue over gray, on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rolin chrome

Finally I'm in the mix, ridin' twenty four's or twenty six
My neck and my wrist lite, with' out me sellin' a brick
Tv's in the roof and the dashboard and I'm watchin' a flick
Rollin' with my pistol in my lap and I'm cockin' if
I spy somethin' suspicious in my rear view mirror when I'm creepin'
If you plan on jackin' me I plan on leavin' you sleepin'
I be in different vehicle cause I'm havin' thangs
King of the ghetto entertainment got me havin' change
You can smell it on me, even tho quite, the way I live it be tellin' on me
Don't get twisted I'm still a felon homie
Thinkin' you goin' to rob me that's a N O
And when I'm in N O I roll with god and as always Mr.Marsello
And they be with me when they in Texas don't par take it as a spy
Harlum nights in stores where they drop it like it's hot
So if your tryin' to call me and I don't answer my phone
I can't hear it cause my music to loud I'm bangin' on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on (holdin' on)
I'll keep rolin chrome (yaah)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (yes I am)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (I'm rollin chrome)
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on (is what I'm holdin on)

Everybody fin to die, by the hands of the dark angel adjust
Snatching your breath, till it dims up your chest
How much pain, can I manifest
When I come to wreck, ripping through your flesh techs
My killers you'll never see, invisible invisible are we
Unseen like ghosts, strike like infrared beams make toast
We smoke the most, but never bump the most
Our figgas unleash like ropes, around throats
Better feel the attack, cause we cloak in the image of smoke
Leaving motherfuckers broke like a king of jokes, mercy
I know not of a feeling, but the thriller
Of a killer gets my adrenaline rushing
Never stopping, watching niggas dropping
More breaking blood gushing, I done opened the wounds
As I destroy cities with typhoons, and masoons
Your doom has awaited, all your mercy's forsaken time to die
Gotta kill them all, every nigga fin to fall when I kill them all
Found them up in bombs, ywith stomach punches
Yelling and running, K of dynasty coming

[Verse 2]
Mortuless contender, Guerilla Maab member I be
It'd be an epidemy, hoes want to get rid of me
Fin to be, found dead and deceased
This ain't no game, ain't a damn thing changed
Cause I came, to bring the pain
Glock ass still fits, running on they head
while they play it, I rise up in chains
Hag in here, hag in here more deadly than anyone's intention
It had to be, more casualties
While I'm in more blemishes, than fatal inflictions
Slice them up like a wolverine, but I use a machete and a guillotine
want to stop like Akeim, on my god damn dream
And now mark and ass niggas, recognize my team

And tripping them niggas up, with a 4-5
Hit the ground and running bud, then I probably bumping in blood 
A fast thug fin to lose his life, motherfucking nigga from Texas
Steady with the dumb plexers, by the hand when I'm kicking your ass
And everybody better ball on
Cause I fuck around, and why'all gone and a nigga like me
Cause I'm blessed with a tight 22's, AK-47, 3-57, Mac 11
Balling and and a 25, bulletproof vest and a sharpened shank
Motherfucker your body gone stank, I'm flawless
Swinging and leaving them jawless
One of these niggas, are about to bleed
Running with the big dog, follow my lead
They following they mama straight, when we
Put him in the streets I'm a regular competitor 
To the niggas, that I want to act surely
Everybody want to live, let the early bird get the worm
Run up in the corner store bright early
Even though I be hanging with thugs
Giving mean mugs, and I do a lot of drugs till I pass out
When I smell a dirty rat, up all in my motherfucking face
I'm hunting they, motherfucking ass out
When I be stepping and pulling my whip
And I'm ready to go to war, with them niggas
That be stepping and pulling back, they fucking up grind
It's going down, load the clip in the gun and I'm making them run
A gorilla nigga evermore buck and he died, but who was the nigga
That's talking down, don't really want me to get an attitude
I'm slapping haters up out the niggas, that think of my trigger
Won't be getting no automatic beatdown, but that's what I live for no mercy

[Verse 4]
Walking the land, of a naked world 
Looking down, up on my enemies in vein
With a mind full of deadly games, I'ma serve your aim
Shouldn't of killed putting holes in your frame, feeling no remorse
As deadly force overcomes my thugs, so bare witness
Sense of relentless vengeance, and 24 victims of wickedness
Out the hills of homicide, cause everytime I pull a whip enclosed
I can hear the sounds of bodies, from the victim of 17 and reloads
Did you really believe, that you could platinum-sieve a nigga like me
I was born to murder the world, but killers and G's and evil deeds
It'll be a whole lot of fly bringing
Some saying, if you run up on me the wrong way
I'ma be forced, to pull a AK
Bust your ass in the head, when the lead spray
No I'm not lying, I know you the fourth guy
To a region in mouth, no time to shine
You the dead victim of reincarnated, man for real I show no mercy

Where is the love - 2x

[Z-Ro]
Nobody loves me, but I prefer to keep it like that
Cause most friends are falsified trying to steal out your stack
So I keep my partnas to a minimum even though I know half can't be trusted
The only feeling in the world might steal your girl if I know flesh was lusted
Nigga now who was to blame for the pain cause fucking with me nigga you get sprayed
Hardheaded that's like fucking a bitch with no condom
And knowing that hoe got aids, better be smart, better keep your distance
Ain't got elements from loose leaf pages
When I'm going off in the rage of furious chambers of twin gauges
My calico murders offending my mind and my mind is so ready to click
Better freeze, better not breathe all I want is the money
Remember you dead if you twitch, cause I'm a killa that's killing for cash
I show no car crash when I'm stealing your stash
Don't fill in the streets because I'm too fast
But never revealing what's under my mask
I'm making a dash, I jump in the Hoover and I smash
With a foot on the gas and then I'm off in the night 
A nigga was buried alive
but he really should of died dig him up his coffin too tight
A nigga was showing a busta love, but now it's hunting for a busta season
And he can't be the reason, to run in your crib and leave you bleeding

[Chorus - 4x]

(talking)
The question at hand is 
Where's your motherfucking love
I'ma do like that boy Al D said
I'm showing love to the ones that showed love back
Fuck friends, so Mexican D, Grady
You know where your love at

[Z-Ro]
I was raised to never let em see me sweat
And how to dodge bullets never let em hit my chest
I saw the ways of the wise and how to live in peace
But fate said we got to stand and fight the beast with open eyes
Which means I got to keep my glock, on a day to day basis
Always protect myself and no more catching murder cases
Niggas will try to erase me and that's a fact, but if I got to go
Nigga I be damned if my trigga finger isn't pulling back
I had niggas I was real with and use to chill with
Now they coming to me with the drama that I can't deal with
I think they out to get me but I can't let em, just like Pac and Spice 1
The jealous got me strapped, so when I go to spraying I'ma wet him
I had love for y'all, I use to cut for y'all
Nigga we was family I shed blood for y'all
But now you hate me cause of my progress, you want me dead
I'm waiting on you niggas you know my address
But if my name is on the bullet and I die, you got to
Lay it down one day guess who gone be waiting on the other side
Go on and pull your pistol from your belt, but no man
Can take my life away from me until I lay it down my damn self
Tried to kill me once and paralyze my mobility
Now that I can walk again don't even think about getting me 
Not saying I won't die, you hoes can try to murder me and get me
And if I kick the fuck it nigga, fuck it you kicking it with me
Cause I'ma be drama best to put to the rest cause you don't understand
That I ain't down with dying at the hands of another man

How it feels to lean
It's cough syrup
Or barre promethazine
Sticky green
And po up an 8

Or a Welch's grape
Sip the sweet taste
Hit the blunts ya rolled up
Now grab a firm grip
Of that hundred dolla cup
Maan hold up
Share some with ya friends
Don't give it to Moe 'cause
It's too muddy
Big Red lookin bloody
Like a blood transfusion
And too much drank can cause an illusion
Knees get weak
And ya eyes is hazy
Wit ya mouth wide open
Now ya lookin crazy
Drank makes ya lazy
Jus ask the Barre Baby
Still stand tall with the Drank Baby

Well I woke up
Early this mornin

Peeked out of the window

Smokin on the hay
That's the way it goes when ya ballin parlay
So I got up
And I hopped in the shower
Ya know a big dude like to smell good
So I took about an hour
Popped the cherry maan
With a playa bald fade

Boy hit the sweets

Fightin sleep

Headed to the tray

Hittin the swisha sweets so I gotta stay high

[Chorus: H.A.W.K., Big Moe, Z-Ro]",Po' It Up,2000
Z-Ro,"What's up baby, Mexican D hollering this
Just getting back with you, told you we was gone chill
Come through, blow something, smoke something
You know how we do it, keeping it real on this side
Letting y'all broads know, we too real

What's happening I see you capping trying to play that role like
You don't know me
Come into my world of diamonds and pearls cause you look a
Little bit lonely
I decided I wan to to cut, couldn't help but notice the shape of
Your butt
And the way you stretch just drive a player nuts, man what's up
Could I just talk to you for a second I don't want to take up
All your time
But see your 36, 24, 36, done blew my mind
I can't take it the way shake it to make me have to push up on
You
To see if we have anything in common, you see I like to smoke
Marijuana
Would you be interested in smoking a square, running my fingers
Through your hair
Go to the Residence Inn with a 3's and 10's coming up out of
Underwear 
See I'ma be chilling, I won't be hard, got a wife at home so
Don't leave no scars
On my back, cause Z-Ro penetrates so if you gone see stars
I'ma get the roof up out killing out when I have
Do a little wine and take a little bath
Sip a little wine to ease my mind then it's back to knocking you
Down
All you got to do is put me in the penn
Got to bet it won't sink, I'm around the way
Make you want to tell somebody cause I'm a square or something 
Keep it on the low and we could do this today

[Chorus]
Let's chill, so I could knock you down
Cause all that I want to do, is fornicate with you
Let's chill, and we can bump and grind
I want to get into you, that's all I want to do

OK, seen you peeping a storm, so I took the opportunity to jump
In my ride
And we could bump heads again and see we could go inside
With our minds, you got something that I cut for
The bald head and the thug in you, that makes me want to lust
You
You balling with your boys, while I'm funk deep with my girls

Diamonds glistening to the tip of my chrome just missing the
Curb
Hey love, what I got to give is probably more than you could
Receive
But we can compromise and bump many times my body's at ease
Did I shock you when I approached when I said let's chill
Or did I shock you when I didn't knock you for coming straight
Up and real
Show me a good time, make me feel like I'm in paradise
Me and you, one on one I ain't trying to claim to be your wife 
So let's just chill, and take time for two of the same minds
To make twice the hustle and grind and fornications that's on
Your mind
Won't you meet me at my place, I say around 10 and don't be late
Cause I want you to feel me when I say classified ladies want to
Chill baby

[Chorus]

I can feel your earth, wind and fire so retire to my rap sure
If you grin it means I win and then your skins have been
Captured 
If you one to five times and knocking five times of running away
Together
Bumping and grinding, smoking and leaning steady reclining up on
The lever
Get aqua tinted with each other as we feel the Mo City
These cats ain't having it when they do they thang and no never
Show pity
But if you scared, I mean you not alone
It might be the ghetto but I call it home
90 percent of the killers are cool with me
So it's cool to sit back and blow a bag with me
So if I said I wanted to be your better half, you know that I
Was lying
No disrespect but I want some sex, can a player get up in
Between the thighs
But if you say I move too fast, I'ma slow my role and romance
We can go to the Papa Do's and all of those fancy places and
Then slow dance
Under the candle light, sipping Dom Perignon
The stereo bumping our slow jam song
From 2 to 6 we ball in the mix and chains sex places getting it
On
Cause I'm a pimp baby, not a simp and I want to be the trick in
Your life
It's plain and clear that a g came here to put this dick in your
Life

[Chorus: x3]",Let's Chill,2000
Z-Ro,"I'sa rude boy like a domino, and finally cause it rolls
Soar like an eagle, from the porch smoke in my nose
And I bust it down upon the center, and feel it up with cess
And start fill licking roll up ganja, now smokers got test
Gangsta smoker, times is not joker
Ignite the kill, I wanted to puff and they taught me
One to one original feeling, watch me take the fondour
I'mma walk up to the sweet house, and start to rap on the door

I'mma get a box of phillys from out the sto', and come right back
Then I'mma roll a philly, fat as a finger and light that
Lemon lime hydro and regular pine, you know I like that
Under of the influence of sticky, there's no need to fight back
Cause I love it when I be lifted, all of my gears be done shifted
One deep in the rental car going off, because I'm talented and gifted
Scooping up nothing but playas, and we're thinking the same
Nothing but flipping and sipping, and running a train on Mary Jane
Love it mayn, rolling em and blowing em all day
Posted up at the Red Booth Inn, smelling good in the hallway
With a wet towel up under the do', but that ain't enough to stop the do-do
But like the Po-Yo I'm about to rep the logo, smoke on in a tinted out fo' do'

Nothing but, swisher smoking tonight
Anything that you want from me, gotta wait till I get high
I'm not capping but, only sticky green is on my mind
But if you wanna match your sweet, well I think we can compromise

I'mma huff and I'm gon puff, cause I done made it a habit
From point A to point B and even to point C, I'm searching for some cabbage
Hold up look up in the sky, is it a bird is it a plane
Naw it's slim and brown, and smelling so lovely it's Mary Jane
I'll admit it I'mma fiend, for nothing but coedine and killer green
With a 24 hour lean, I'm always smoking on the scene
Everybody wanna put me to the test, I'm just trying to ease the tension and stress
Inhale but I gotta let it go, congested in my chest
In an attempt to bust a lung, hydro ponics got me sprung
Going broke behind this woman, and willing to spend all my funds
I gotta get a fat sack for one double O, but lifted that's fa sho though
And like the Po-Yo I'm about to rep the logo, smoke on in a tinted out fo' do'

Nothing but, swisher smoking tonight
Anything that you want from me, gotta wait till I get high
I'm not capping but, only sticky green is on my mind
But if you wanna match your sweet, well I think we can compromise

I'm lighter than Al, trying to smoke myself into another dimension
Please light up that there, cause I really need to calm my nerves I be tripping
That's why I gotta stay smoking, but to keeping my balance is really a challenge
And I'm violently choking, hit the coat drop 85 mo' when I say fatter than a fat pack
Maybe that would be R-A to the N-K, everyday all day
Stimulating my mind, Guerilla Maab one deep and I'm one of a kind
You better not try to crush that love, better pass if you wanna live puff-puff give
On the cool I'm stuck in my buzz, I could poke on golds with red hair punk cause 
I'm blowing kill
Even if I'm on paper for pulling a caper, I gotta be blowing still
And you know it's real, burning kill
With a wet towel up under the do', but that there ain't enough to stop the do-do
And like the Po-Yo I'm about to rep the logo, smoke on in a tinted out fo' do'

Nothing but, swisher smoking tonight

[Hook: Tanya Herron]
Why, do we live this way
So many murders, where the children play
And it's about, to make me lose my mind
We're running out of time, too many of my people dying

[Z-Ro]
Day by day it's more impossible, to hold on
I'm going head up with the shadow of death, and getting stole on
Will I survive, is God gonna come and save me
I started out as a Christian, now look at how this world made me
I'm crazy, and I can't make it no better
Cause I can't stand none of my friends, my only love is for the cheddar
I remember, sipping on Tangaray and getting high
Down with eachother, long as we was barely getting by
We grown men, and all living in sin
Shooting a kite to my people, cause he in prison again
Letting him know that the streets ain't changed, still wicked
Plus I been burying so many motherfuckers, we bound to kick it
Up close and personal, cause niggaz be pushing my button
I handle my bidness, and exit they homes gangsta strutting
One deep, nobody's got my back
Motherfuckers just be hanging around me, because I rap
Trying to stab me in my back, and if they could they would
That's why I pack my twin bitches, cause I don't even feel safe in the hood
At least on lock, you know what the danger is and what's not
Free world you'll be evicted, when a coward bust shots
That's the life cycle, kick it with real niggaz
And never let the shife by you, because the devil is they idol
Man they tied up my nigga, and sawed off his head
The cold part about it, they ain't even take no bread

[Hook]
[Z-Ro]
My nigga Grady took seven shots, and one bullet hit him twice
Although he's blessed, my nigga just can't leave the thug life
You know it's fucked up, both of us was in class with honors
But soon would drop out, addicted to cash and marijuana
And the fast life, we bled the whole hood last night
Hard headed dumb niggaz, just trying to get they cash right
Hustling, hoping we can get a million
But like a chameleon, nigga the game done changed
Wish it would rain sometime, to help a nigga wash away the pain sometime
I shed ghetto tears daily baby, I can't hide the fact
Feeling like everybody's out to get me, so I don't hide my strap
I ride like that, with one up in the chamber
On my block if you ain't got a glock, you's in danger
Continuously head busting for nothing, my friends and my enemies
Nothing but recollection, as I remember the memories
If I could be like Jesus, I'd spread the love
But I can recognize the demons, so I spread the slugs
These motherfuckers say they love me, but I'm peeping they lies
Feel like jealousy and envy, when I look deep in they eyes
That's a friend for you, laced up with your girl and then try to
Spend your ends for you, and when it's drama they won't send for you
That's the reason Joseph, is one deep until he die
I ain't gotta wonder why, my people want to see me fly, fuck em

(Down here) we keep a chicken head up in the club
(Down here) my thugs they get nothing but love

I'm from the city of sippers, wood grain wheel grippers
Kilo shippers, candy coat car flippers
We ride 4's and vogues, with a mouth full of golds
Country niggas and hoes, down here is how we roll
When something's tight it's thoed, when we shine we hold
You got cash cars and clothes, you balling out of control
Switching lanes on swinging thangs, that's called swang and bang
The club packed from front to back, that club off the chain
You got candy rims and beat, then you got you a slab
You cooking chickens in the kitchen, boy you off in the lab
Boys that hustle they grind, and if your diamonds shine you blind
You making money looking good, then you showing your behind
You blow endo that's do-do, screwed up means slow mo
You ride big body Benz, you riding big body fo' do'

I'm trying to stack my green, I mean fill up my vault

Twinkies twist and crawfish, my wrist all icy
Better watch your wifey, down here we off the hook
You was smart that, better back-back take a look
I'm from the city where crooks, wear Cardiers and Rolleys
In Texas we partnas, in Louisiana they whodies
But it's the same thing, on this side of the Mississippi
Two hundred dollas a bottle, ain't talking bout Crissy
Talking bout codeine, baby fill up my cup
2002 Escalade, Billy grill on my truck
Now hold up man, top down in the Bentley
With a bad chick, in my tape Monica Lewinsky
Made a mill independent, can't touch me kids
Split your wig then hire Cochran, like Puffy did
(fiesta) fiesta, like my name R. Kelly
I'm the boss see the cross, hanging off of our bellys

[Chorus: x2]

I can tell that you boys, got the wrong idea
We some slab riding gangstas, get a car every year
(Down here) we like to ball, play above the rim
E.S.G., the young Don and a thug named Slim
(down here) we tolerate no type of disrespect
Have a bitch acting bad, on that do' and that X
(Down here) we push 26 sitting low to the flo'
And double deuces on a truck, when I crawl by slow
(This year) I'm gonna switch it to the platinum frame
Do shows with plenty hoes, that be screaming my name
(Down here) it ain't no telling when you talking bout us
Got rocks in both ears, 'cause that shit is a must
(Down here) we break hearts and leave punks for dead
We don't claim the blue or red, 'cause our city is FED

It's like tears doesn't matter to you, it's like you laughed at my pain

Put me in a position to pick up a pistol, and I'll blast in the game
I'm going crazy, being murdered by the hands of cancer

Auntie asked if I wanted to die, but couldn't understand my answer

See it's fucked up when you loving, they don't love you in return

Fuck around and wait till you get on your feet, and slug you till it burn

Niggas is flies yeah they over rise, but I hide in the dark

Cause where the fuck was these niggas at, when I resided in parks

Bitch I slept on the bench, ten feet away from the bullet proof fence

But at least, I ain't have to pay no rent

I'm thinking of espree, damn near positive that you regret me

But I pray to God, you'll never forget me, remember me

I represented for the both of us, how could you love me

And not trust me, somewhere hated now there's no more us plus

Sammy Lee it was a tragedy, your boo was found dead

Here's my shoulder for you my nigga, rest your head



[Chorus - 2x]

This is where they all fall down

Putting burners to they brain, till it bang

There's no way for the real, to maintain

This is where they all fall down

Pay your dues, cause you owe

When it's your time, God'll give you the go



[Den Den]

I sit back and put my thoughts, on paper and rhymes

Tripping on the situations, that I'm facing in life

All this shifeness around me, but I still prevail

Get caught some shit we done together, and I'm making your bail

Cut your tail, while you fall down homie

Plus I'm in the kitchen cooking, so your family won't come hold me

Fuck that phony shit, that these fake niggas on

I get that pony bitch, then I get that hustle on

Staying strong like ammonia, as I bleed the block

Leaving that bitch swollen up, like I beat the cops

Going rock for rock, breaking down every zone

95 hundred woofing, where these niggas be strong

Staying alone to my own, with my baby and wife

Plus I'm keeping the bread a nine, cause I'm guarding my life

Ain't no slipping in my game, doing a dance to make it rain

Put a pistol to your head, and ease your pain



[Chorus - 2x]



[Z-Ro]

I feel like I invented pain, might go any minute mayn, starting a bit of

robbery

Homicide and lean on they destiny, in an attempt to get the pain

Constant strain, here we go again another day in the life

If I'm blessed, can I just get one successful day in my life

My life is the prime example, of a good nigga gon wrong

And I trust no one plus I'm not friendly, so leave me alone

See I don't need a click of yes men, when I walk the block

My retaliation is only, when I chalk the block

I stay in a sweet leaf, each time I meditate on how to live

Nothing but negative everywhere I turn, ain't no more positive

Nothing but drama, cause drama makes the world go round

But pretty soon, it'll make the world go down

Just get a weapon of situation, if you starving then you hungry right now

I can't wait a whole pay period, I need money right now

So when I bleed the block I'm not gon bleed a lot, just enough to keep

The bills paid, and enough to keep some fiddles in a pot

[Z-Ro]
I thought I had a lot of partnas, but I've only got some
Since I can't depend on my niggaz, I put my faith up in my shotgun
Rolling around in my '78, reminiscing on the past
16 years old trying to get into Boomerang, smelling all our lil cash
Now it's like we never knew eachother, motherfuckers act strange
It's like they got intentions, on putting bullets up in my brain
Why they can't look me in my eyes no mo'
Even though I miss my T. Jones, at least mama ain't gotta to cry no mo'
I done seen my nigga get rich, leave the hood, make a lot of rich friends
But try to come back to the po' partnas, when all the richness end
Tell him to come watch me perform, but they don't go, and if I'm
Stranded and I need a ride, they say they coming but they don't show
Picture me walking down the feeter, everybody masking me up
Oh good it's that nigga from the hood, chunking a deuce passing me up
That's alright though, I gotta make a top flight hoe, smoking and thinking
When I get I want no nobody, but a Benjamin Franklin cause uh

[Hook - 2x]
Friends just ain't friends no more
Ain't no love, cause money is all we adore
Friends just ain't friends no more
I don't need you motherfuckers round me

[Cl'Che]
Most of these hoes say they your friend, but they really ain't down
Cause when you broke and got no ends, them same hoes don't come round
The main hoes that talk down, most friends turn to foes
That's just the way it go down, that's why I stay blowing pounds
Cause Mary Jane don't change she stay the same, help maintain
And ease the pain, stay free from the bullshit people bring
Cause the world is full of evil mayn
That's why I stay one deep, fuck these niggaz and these hoes
I be solo on my creep, no one in the passenger seat

[Den Den]
First he's riding high, now he busting Mack 10's
Watch you go from homie to foe, then try to come back again
There ain't no returning with the fuck shit, that's why I murder with one click
These fake ass G's I'm done with, selling my shit for one sill
But claiming you down to the ground bitch, bitch you ain't down with
Just another fake friend, trying to chop the Benz
Helping to plead my ends, looking for a win
Lying with a grin, trying to sneak back in

[Hook - 2x]
[Z-Ro]
Remember back in '97, we was living it up
If they had it and we wanted it, they was giving it up
Through it wrong together, I think we wrote our first song together
Matter of fact, we smoked our first zone together
Look at you now oh you a rich nigga, thinking that you running thangs
But you ain't running a damn thang but your mouth, cause you's a bitch nigga
Going against the grain, cause you done made a lil change
But I can't flip the script want to get rich, I gotta remain the same
I had visions of us balling together, pulling up at the Past at New Orleans
Together, everyday all day shot calling together, but now I'm only rolling solo
Don't get it twisted I still got love for my niggaz, but I don't fuck with em no mo'
Cause everybody want me to do, what they want me to do
And they want me to do it, but I'd rather stay full of embalming fluid
But you know what you can do for me, give me a whole lot of leave me alone
Cause the only partna I got left, got 17 partnas of his own and uh

And ain't got no mix to motion, is a for sho' thang
Don't fuck with Ro hoe, I dun' lost all of my love
Razor blade to the wrist, damn near lost all of my blood

Y'all just come around, 'cause I got them drugs
When all my drugs gone, nigga all my thugs gone
And I'm scared to eat, the last of the bread and the butter
Because after that, all the god damn bud gone
I'm a mo'fucking struggler, I wish I was a bubbler
Mama said that, it would it be days like this
But not a life like this, so I take a knife like this and slice like this
Take life like this, fuck around and I take my own life like this
Or click me a bitch nigga, in the windpipe like this
That's right bitch, I'm a ign'ant son of a bitch
And I do click quick, it might be halves and zones
To break a nigga bones, but never be stones and sticks

Now a victim of the blues cat
I got tired of motherfuckers, taking a nigga for granted
All I got is my mind, I can't lose that
I'ma use that, even though a nigga mind gone
It ain't lost, 'cause I know where it's at
Just on another level than boys, around here
For the paper stack, 'cause I'ma go where it's at
I sound like a (big nigga), but I'm a (lil' nigga)

Piss a nigga off and get that ass caught, late night
On the backstreets, hollin' oh Lord
It ain't no mercy, I still wanna see you bleed
Because, I don't give a damn no more
Niggaz see 3D-2, and but hollin' out fuck you hoes
Finally, I found me

It's still Guerilla Maab, and ain't a damn thang changed
I just peeped the game, and these niggas be shife
Over the years, I seen a lot of niggas turn fake
Riding thick on the cool, and then I have to erase
You see me and the Maab, done learned without a thang
Man most of these niggas, be around for the fame
It ain't no more love, therefore if you ain't kin
And if you get up in mine, you gon' meet your end
I'm one of a kind, I think you better check yourself
And it don't mean a damn thang, if I shake your hand
If I ain't too enthused, and I got on a mean mask
You better stay on note, 'cause I'll beat your ass
It's Guerilla Maab this, and Guerilla Maab that
I think you better get back, and shut the fuck up
For you straight step off, and get fucked up
Nigga Trey and Dougie D and Z-Ro, take nuts
So don't come around now bitch
When you showed everybody, all kinds of love
And I ain't got none left, didn't nobody wanna care
How we thug, that's why I'm fin to be alone till I meet my death
Everybody we was cool with, fuck you too
And everybody who was hating us, fuck you too
It just took a little time, for me to find myself
And that's why we getting rich off ourself

Man fuck, finally I found me
Man fuck you hoes, I found me
Man fuck, finally I found me
Man fuck you hoes, I found me

Better watch your back, and identify yourself
Nigga one mo' step, and I'ma cock back every weapon
I pack, fuck around and fry yourself
A punk ass patty melt, no remorses gon' be felt
When I be dealing, with a less than G individual
Nothing but a AK shot, is gon' be felt
I never did trust no bitch, and I don't trust no nigga
Fuck all of my associates, but in a life of a life
This motherfucker like me, you get what you suppose to get
Pussy in the middle of the fo'head, I wanna see my foes dead
And I smoke, one of these old busted up ass hoes
Old trailer trash ass hoes, I live life one deep
And I don't speak to the non-kin no mo', nigga they know
Coming around my neck of the woods, is a no-no
'Cause I got a .44, lay low please
Everytime I open my mouth, mo'fuckers would never believe
That's why a nigga trip a lil' bit, with a razor blade
And the reason, I wear long sleeves
Y'all can't help me, I don't want your help
I just want some, leave me alone
I don't wanna go to the club, I'm cool in the streets
Bitch, just leave me to roam
Don't call my cell phone, give folk don't give a damn
If I get one in my dome, fuck you dealing
Y'all don't understand my zone, finally I found me

Man fuck, finally I found me
Man fuck you hoes, I found me
Man fuck, finally I found me
Man fuck you hoes, I found me
Man fuck, finally I found me
Man fuck you hoes, I found me
Man fuck, finally I found me
Man fuck you hoes, I found me

This Ridgemont 4 forever, Z-Ro
The motherfucking Crooked, know I'm saying

You know I'm saying, so send the hoes to another nigga
You feel me, it's 2K1, bitch, forever

Z-Ro,"[Z-Ro talking]
Yes sir, Z-Ro, Lil' Keke, Screw to Mo City
CMG, KMJ, this how it go

[Chorus]
Sunshine, living in the ghetto daily trying to find
Sunshine, trying to make a million hustling got to dodge
One time, I keep my head up even though I feel like giving up
Sometimes, Keep your head up trying to find sunshine

[Z-Ro]
Man what happened to the sun on my lawn it's so gloomy and grey
I got a feeling 5-O gone try to do me today
Nothing but backstreets for me cause I don't need a vacation
Looking for front run up that seem the only compensation
The hood is on fire, other soldiers won't let it down
They ain't set tripping but out here jacking has been alive
Misery spinning what they clicking for no reason at all
Even intentions of stacking paper they pleasing them all
And outside, smelling like nothing but formaldrahide
It's an everyday suicide, R.I.P. to the ones that died
Wake up before you get caught up don't keep on selling your soul
Until your life fall up, you got to try to find

[Chorus]
[Lil' Keke]
We living in a world that's dirty and so shife
You trying to figure out this the game that's called life
These days is cold and got me searching for my soul
Like paper bags and lawn chairs man you unfold
I'm looking out my window for some, sunshine
I'm trying to give it up cause I swear it's my time
I five petreat and start thinking about my sins
Roll up another square and start thinking about the benz
Talent and skills is what I'm bringing
New homes and microphones got the cell phone ringing
Push play on the deck, to let my mind collect
And try to mash on the gas with no time to sweat
This the ghetto, and that's all I know
Another episode from the young don and Ro
If the family is tight, then everything's alright
So quick to catch flight for the sunlight, uh

[Chorus]
[Z-Ro]
Seem like I can't stand the rain prosecution and struggle up in my brain
Got to tell me slow down if you can see all of my veins
Cause I ain't having none of that riff raff to get back and blood
Keep my enemy close to me cause your killer be your 'cause
I wish I was, able to socialize with why'all
Instead of trading war stories and taking lies from why'all
It's how it be though, Lil' Keke and Z-Ro we on the grind 
Long as they talking about us, we know we staying on they mind
Don't hate us congratulate us, why why'all turning up why'all nose 
Cause it's been we be spittng straight be burning up why'all glow
Want to take it away from pin and pad and pick up a gun
You better repent my dog it's over, you done better try to find

[Chorus - 2x]",Sunshine,2001
Z-Ro,"Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
The ghetto motherfucking alarm clock
Wake up nigga

Lord forgive us for sinning, give us this day and our daily bread
Cause if a nigga don't call you back when you beep him, he might be dead
Look at this world we living in, everybody got a bad attitude and a glock
Seem like we living just to become a victim, of a random shot
Everytime I turn my back, another y'all motherfuckers turn and crack
It seem like just yesterday, a young nigga stepped up to the plate and
Learn to bat, military minded at a early age bread to live in a murder maze
I don't want to go to the early grave, a motherfucker like me
Ready to murder maze, I want to go to heaven but not right now
Bout to pushing infrared like dimes, what you want to do it like that
I can play eight to the Penn, cut your lights off right now
Mean what I say and I say what I mean, nigga like me don't play with a beam
When I pull my gun, then I'ma use my gun
And I ain't tripping, I'll put you in a murder scene
But I try to stay humble, and hold what I got
Never let a nigga know what I got, keep my bidness to my own
So don't bring none of that there, to my home
I love my people, and that's a fact
But I want to know, where's the fucking love at
I don't want to put a motherfucker, in the grave
But I will to keep on, keeping on busting back

[Chorus: x2]
Wake up before you get caught up
Don't keep on selling your soul, until your life bought up
And my eyes on the prize, and never fall off the straight and I roll
When you slip, hollow tips are sharper than an arrow

I decided August 31, 1999
There's no more time for fake partnas, there's only time for my grind
All of my friendships came about, because of the verses I say
That nigga Z-Ro got partnas, but what about Joseph McVey
Everytime I'm on the microphone, nigga want to tag along
Want to see me, when I do my song
Or when a nigga be smoking the marijuana, and the dope all gone
A nigga right back, all alone
I had to regulate, or be surrounded by fakes
At all times looking over my shoulder, but I came out of that as I got older
Cause I realized, if it's written scriptures don't lie
That's why I'm thugging cause life is a bitch, and then a nigga die
I rap about the struggle, cause balling is foreign to me
Z-Ro be t-shirt and Dickies, ain't no Ralph Lauren you see
Cause every dolla that I make, is a dolla well earned
And I'm putting it back in the game, to sco' some crack
And a strap, to dip sherms
Hopefully I can make it, to see the sun rise
Fiending for them back in the days, of hide and seek
And throwing mud pies

[Chorus: x2]

Bout to swang by that sun, is wait for me be right back
I'ma roll a optimoe fat as a wiener, and light that
Cause it seems I can't confine without, clutching a sack
Puffing the sho' dipping the black, or raping the track
And I be tripping and sipping, and pimping this rap
I'm writing my rhymes, through my fetty's no slack
I'm ready to the sell the, the better my chedda
Tell her to the fella, I doubts the shredder
A better competitor, I dwell I'ma get her
Better get fella, I sell-a my yella
To hella thoed nigga, that wreck accapella
The fella that tell it, nobody he got em
He got 'em and shot em, and don't talk about em
Plotted and followed, to get where I started
Out of my product, the plot of my problem
Got off my bottom, to talk to my father
My ceiling is ending, my ending is finished
These women keep grinning, to swim in my linen
I'm tilling my bidness, the bidness I'm tilling
I'm tilling my bidness, the bidness I'm tilling
What's up what's up, had lean in my cup
Been asleep ten years, and I just woke up
The alarm on slow, all my ten minutes up
Gotta make my bed, gotta watch my butt
Gotta clean my room, gotta iron my stuff
Gotta wash my car, gotta shine my buck
Gotta change my oil, cause the road is tough
Keep my eyes on the road, and don't slow up

[Chorus: x2]",Wake Up,2001

On the latest roll with my boy Z-Ro here
Z-Ro you ready ha, rock yeah you dropping that hot shit
You really dropping that hot shit ha, Z-Ro let me
Hear what you gonna sing for this one, come on

Three liter big red, got diluted nines fed
Able to make a bitch, want to suck my naked head
I get fly when I want to, graduated from corners
I know it tingle, cause your pussy marinated my sauna
If you capping I ain't tripping, cause I really don't need you
Probably say your pussy gon' be beat up, and having a seizure
Overseas vacation, Prime Co. communication
And radio stations, got us in regular rotation
'Cause the guns unloaded, lot of heads got exploded
Destined to be the throw deaf, if I'm properly promoted
Sewed it up like a sweater, financial back or go-getter
Then through your vest chest, with the talons in my Beretta
Stay one step ahead of, my competition they better
Fly down from overseas sign down, and get to chumping for cheddar
Twenty-six letters than Ro, if you ain't know now you know
From Ridgemont Four to Akapoko, I'm gripping grain in my flame

Sunday morning pulling out my bitch, I'm looking good
Nothing but diamonds around neck and around my wrist, I'm looking good
Doubles breasted tailor made, I'm Sacci'd down to the flow
And it don't matter, if you step on my wing tipped shoe
'Cause I'ma just go buy me some mo', (what it is what it is)

Rolly on me wrist, Sansun me wrist band
Twenty inch rims, on me suspension
Foreign replay, and not forge my stunna
Dressed everyday, in the latest fashion look
Boys the enemy, best respect the man
Listen to me, know it's rule number one
No buster ain't right, we told the game plan
You do, you better and change the wrist band
The way me flow, my retaliation
So listen to me boy understand, understand
It's a bezeled out wrist, and that I wear everyday
On the right hand-a, the Presidential Rolly
And it's crossed off, like a ton of ice on the tray
And the price start-a, my choice to lose security
If you don't believe me, ask your old lady
I know she saw it, from 'Poko miles away

Sunday morning pulling out my bitch, I'm looking good
Nothing but diamonds around neck and around my wrist, I'm looking good
Doubles breasted tailor made, I'm Sacci'd down to the flow
And it don't matter, if you step on my wing tipped shoe
'Cause I'ma just go buy me some mo', (what it is what it is)

Pull up to my bump, as I let it recline
Thirteen's easy five screens, it ain't no fucking with mine
They think I'm fucking with nine, but I multiplied it by fo'
It took some time, but I decided to throw my bitch on the 4's
The bubble-eyed Mazaratti, on a mission to meet Scotty
With bullets for your body, 'cause I'm living like Gotti
Pistol grip and a beam, plus a murdering team
Cash rule everything me, that there ain't nothing but green
Jumping in and out of line, moving slow as I want to
Smoking reefer bending corners, on twenty inch Yokohama
'Cause these niggas be hating me, when I be crawling down
So I'm like Paul Bugsy with a infrared, cause these niggas be falling down
Steady yelling out timber, from the first dance January down to the last dance
December better remember, put a big shell casing up in you
Make you weak like S-W-V, when I shine and grind like E-S-G
But I gotta get love like the Big Steve, throwed in the game like that P-A-T

These niggas want to see me off, they don't want to see me on but
Proof I'm ballin', I put a eighth
Of that white down in my hood, I can finish it by the mornin'
Re-up by noon, re-kick at night
Half these dudes doing bids couldn't live my life
And you youngn's in the hood want to be like P
Cause every new gat I cop it begin wit a P
Like, P-89 you niggas' P-92 shit
You know how dudes ""This Proof ain't for that bullshit""
And these hoes want to roll wit a G
But once I hit 'em wit that G, I have totin' the P, cause!

Yo I hear 'em callin, and every city I travel
Hoes get at 'em when they see a nigga ballin'
Keep the steel wit me, couple of killas from the hood
Who blew bail, but still they keep it real wit me
We ride out (and?) we find out (where?)
Your little address (and?) blow out your hideout (yeah)
Who want war? hoes they tellin' me ""E's you ain't right""
Like this year I'm goin' go South Pole
This for them haters think I'm slippin', I ain't
When I find 'em hiding I tie 'em, they be missin' like weight
But wait, lil nigga don't be missin' my point
I don't miss when I point, niggas get killed off point
And you see, I school a little you, forfeit the game
I was young, just like 'em, Jay taught me the same
But I see he hard headed, told em stay in his lane
Cause them OG's home and they layin wit K's cause

Screw (what's the deal my nigga)
Man, King Screw, dedicate this to you my nigga
We love you forever boy (straight up much love)
We ain't goin' never forget you mayn
Never forget the times we had (G love, know I'm saying)
Al-D and Z-Ro (ha) South Park Mexican

[Chorus: x2]
I'll never forget, the times when we crawled together
I'll never forget, the times when we balled together
I'll never forget, the love, hugs, smiles and tears
And the strength to help me conquer my fears

[SPM]
I'll never forget, the day we met
I was on Gravestone, trying to find a address
You told me that your wife, had just lost your baby
I never met a man, so hate free
Lately, I've been drunk as fuck
I open up a cold beer, as soon as I wake up
I live in Screwston Texas, that's my home
Banging Screw since 9-2, ask my T. Jones
When Fat Pat died, we was all alone
That boy was the coldest, on the microphone
Screw took it harder, than anyone thought
It's hard to be apart, from someone close to your heart
South Park from the start, all of a sudden
The whole nation, all bout the Screw Shop on Cullen
November 16th, I sat and cried
Cause that was the day, that Houston Texas died

[Verse 2]
I'll never forget true love see, it's gon last forever
Keep my feet on solid ground, so we could ball together
Since a young one never done one, stay true to the heart
You kept my head above water, gave me spark from the start
You put the mic in my hand, plus put your trust in me
Dodging cases being a G, you got me out of the streets
Gave me the capital of Texas, so I could throw away the pyreeces
Put a queen on my shoulder, when nights were cold as misses
Hustling smiles appear the tears, the tears from younger years
Until they find us riders, make sure you standing here
S.U.C. for L-I-F-E, Screw blew one with the streets
Slowed down originator, keeping the trunk on beat
My faith in G-O-D, putting the world up under my feet
Making imitators duketators, bow down and can't compete
From a G to a G, this here's for you to me
Staying down putting it down, screaming Screw for eternity

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
Whoever knew he would create a new sound, never been heard
Transform a simple name, into a household word
He gained fame but never changed, never switched gears
When you met him it was like, you been knowing him twenty years
Was never fake, blessed to make the rap scene elevate
Genius, watch that boy slow it down and still accelerate
God gave him a gift, and my partna knew how to use it
But the love I got for Screw, ain't got nothing to do with music
Cause when he left, the physical was consumed
But his spirit manifesting, everybody in this room
A real partna forever, I know I can never be him
But if I make him my example, when you see me then you'll see him
S for slowing it down, see cold creating
are stands for realer than real, and never hating
E forever lasting, effect never corrupt
W for the world, cause that's what he screwed up

[Verse 4]
Man I'll never forget, the difference time can make
Man I'll never forget, coming down in the 8
Man I'll never forget, we drunk the pint straight
We been free styling, since them old grey tapes
And then came the day, that we was making them G's
Had them niggas lined up, like we was slanging them ki's
But we ain't slanging D, we just moving C.D.'s
People coming to the shop, way from over the seas
But still we some G's, or should I say that we back
Coming down in a Impala, with the candy wet
Coming down MLK, with the music that bump
We was swinging and banging, steady popping the trunk
Say what's up to that Gator, Mafio and that Pat
I know why y'all looking down from heaven, watching over our back
When they mention Screwed Up Click, they goin' say that we done it
Man them boys done blew up, like the flight 800

DJ Screw player, I'll never forget
Represent S.U.C., forever my set
I'll never regret, the times we got blowed
On the road doing shows, all across the globe
It's your boy Willean, and I'm holding it down
Legendary status Screw, steady slowing it down
For H-Town for sure, we done lost a soldier
We goin' finish what you live, and I'ma put that on the Clover
It ain't over, pour and sipping the plain soda
Switching lanes over, in my black Range Rover
The Chemist that's right, I done shed some tears
All the car shows we wrecked, and bled for years
You one of my peers, DJ Screw you kept it real
You one of a kind, so you one out a mill
I'ma stay representing, South-side for live
And if S.U.C. get a deal, it's goin' be a hundred mill

[Al-D]
If nobody else, could feel my pain
It was you in my corner, through the heat and the rain
Can't call one time, you didn't make me smile
Took a fall in the Penn, boy you fed my child
Kept my name on fire, like I never left
Kept your eyes on my family, and never slept
Snatched my ass out the streets, and put a mic in my hand
Put my strap on the shelf tray, my fiends for fans
I was hard head misled, seeking for bread
Without the music in my life, I know I would of been dead
But the Lord sent you to me, like a guardian angel
When my feet was caught up in a tangle
So please smile for me, cause Screw you got me throwed in this game
I salute you with my fist, your name was never in vein
See the plack on the wall, all our dreams came true
And I'm still giving thanks to you

Say Q, man feel this here, I don't know why
These motherfuckers be hating us the way they do
Every motherfucking day, all motherfucking day long
Nigga can't get no motherfucking rest, that's why
I drink and smoke so motherfucking much
You feel me, get off my dick

[Chorus]
Why you be hating me
Day and night, baby
Mad at me, cause I don't buy
The dreams that you selling lately

[Z-Ro]
I needed to get up off my rump, and stack something
I was tired of walking around, ready to plack something
Big heads, screwdrivers, spark plugs to break the glass
Hold my bases of selling dope, anything to get that cash
I was getting grown faster, than average niggas
Bills and mouths to feed, I needed cabbage nigga
Did a little rapping on the side, but I was full time grind
Till they ran up and 50 one eleven, and shut it down
When I got out, I wanted to get some work and do it over
Instead I picked up a pen, and got to jotting in a folder
Niggas was bobbing they head, bitches was bobbing they head
The first time in my life, I didn't worry bout no feds
But I wasn't out the woods yet, round shife too
Niggas be killing eachother over lime light fool
Ain't with it fuck a million, I just want what I earn
But they don't like it when I holler KMJ because it burn

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
If you want to jam, you can grab a hold of my funk
But if you plan to take me off of my game, like I'm a chump
I won't punk about it, I'ma do my thang
Dumping on niggas from the turning lane
But it's burning man, cause that's how it go down
Niggas be trying to get you, when you live in H-Town
And you throwed, in the game
want to get you for your mouthpiece or your name
Have you giving up hits, having no change
Having more overdue bills, no strings
Not me, no more, it's a new day
I'm in a new ride, and it's looking too gray
Remember if you sew it, it'll read right back
So when you treat a nigga wrong, the heavens'll handle that

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
Got a name for myself now, selling them tapes
I still be traveling I-10, but I ain't selling no weight
No more, blue over gray four do', in and out the lanes
Steady keeping my melodies, running in and out your brain
But I need my money, cause ain't no working for free
If it ain't twenty-five hundred, no appearances from the Z
Man, got to get my feet man, got to be treated fair
Trying to put me on a back burner, I'm out of there
A veteran to the game, you can't do me like no hoe
When my crib got flooded, you didn't help me you let me float
Now you want to exercise your contractual right
But if you fuck me the first time, there ain't gon be a twice
Recognize ain't no hate in my heart, cause I'm a guard
I don't hate nobody, just hate it when times get hard
In my new situation, I'm having rich-nigga troubles
Without the switch, I'd have in a ditch-nigga troubles

[Chorus]",Hatin' Me,2002
Z-Ro,"[Z-Ro]
Forgive me for my sins, cause I'm not perfect
Just trying to get it like I live, but is it really worth it
Niggas done fell to my heater, never to rise up
Didn't really want to hurt nobody, please open your eyes up
Don't need no more blood on my conscious
Cause even though I'm a soldier, I feel pain
Got a nigga paranoid around partners, I feel strange
Watching my back, cocking my gat, strapped at all times
Punishing motherfuckers, just for crossing that line
My only company is lonely mess, cause most of
These niggas be fake, and I can't stand phoniness
Can't even look me in my eye, before they burn me up
Two to the head, but it ain't that simple why yall can't turn me up dead
Best believe retaliation is a must, I'ma bust with fury
Look at me laugh at my competition, flashing my jewelry
Death ain't around the corner no more, he up in my face
Its only natural to try to steal him, and put him back in his place

[Chorus: x2]
In case I don't make it, I want to tell my people I love em
Wish I could jump up out my casket, and hug em
Just in case I don't make it, I hope they keep on jamming my songs
A military minded motherfucker gone

In case I don't make it, I want to tell my people I love em
Wish I could jump up out my casket, and hug em
Just in case I don't make it, don't cry now, I'm still in your hearts
I hope I get to go to heaven, my Lord

In case I don't make it, I want niggas to know I never gave up
Z-Ro Vs. the World, and King of Da Ghetto is when I came up
People showing me love, people showing me hate
But I put the street with my business, and put mo' change in my safe
Special thanks to Eugene Brooks, it ain't another realer
Save me from being a drug dealer, but still a guerrilla
Death ain't around the corner no more, he up in my face
Only natural to try to steal him, and put him back in his place

[Mexican D]
A young Mexican brought up, in the wrong way of life
I had to do what I had to do, just to make it through the night
Hustling and robbing and killing, running the streets with no feelings
An aggravated motherfucker, that is ready as willing
So leave me alone, before I touch your dome
Or sending automatic 4-5's, to hit your home
Cause ain't no playing with me, I'm a down ass G
Showing no pity, from that Mo City

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
I've been going insane lately
Rolling with my gun off safety
Thinking everybody's out, to do me
Can't even relax, Mac 11 by the jacuzzi
Gangstafied, ever since then showing me love
And it don't matter where they at, nigga they gon hit you with the dub
But every night I pray to see, another fu-fu day
Even though sometime I fall off track, tricking with Mary J
Can't I get a piece of mind, everybody want to attack me
In the beginning they was strays, but now they busting right at me
Get up out my ride homie, don't want to ride with me now
If we rolling and I'm beefing, you can die with me now
Niggas around me dropping like flies, it got a nigga scared
Bullet proof and a automatic, come with making blood shed
So just in case I don't make it, tell my enemies fuck em
Wish I could jump up out my casket, and bust em

[Chorus]",Make It,2002
Z-Ro,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got
It's the sound of revenge",Outro,2002
Z-Ro,"[Chorus: Z-Ro]
I'm still a player, a confidential player
I'm just trying to do something right, so let me live my life
Even though I'm still hustling, I know you want to see me struggling
But at least I'm trying to do something right so let me live my life

[Tyte Eyez]
Lord knows I had my share of doing the wrong things
But a bonified player that finds the life in me
Casualties make us cry but still we got to mash
Keep my eyes up on the sparrow and mind, up on my cash

Penetrate, finish last maintain a steady pace
Keep the busters out your business and haters up out your face
In this last rat race, the lord some's got to come
Shrivel my signature I call it rapping refunds

The ones that criticize be the ones you call your friends
The ones that ride it out ain't gone always be your kin
But then, you got to know, if it's yours you gone get it
But also you got to know that everyday, ain't terrific

Precision about your plans, keep it real with your fans
Watching my baby boy grow to be a young man
My daughter got to know, from the jump you a queen
And f*** what them n****s say you tell them your daddy is a king

[Chorus]

[Big Moe]
Everytime I look around
These haters they be talking down
Big Moe that done bring more light
I even had a, had a harder time

But I'm still here still going strong
You can't believe what you hear in the song
About the year two triple o three
Whole wide world sipping drank with me

I got money but I'm still a little stressed
I thank the lord cause you know I'm the best
A little love set with the press
Why you want less cause through this

I guess it's best for me, to stay calm
And hold it down till the day that I'm gone
I got a white cup in my palm
Feel what a peach crush Mo-Yo's just a
Player, player, player, player

[Z-Ro]
Money, the rule to all evil that's what I need
Between the hours of 3 to 7, that's when I bleed
Motherf***ers gone making the block hot, so I stay and move around
Tyte Eyez and Z-Ro stacking paper, it's going down

Break the shop of a n**** that's short stopping my change
But me and him to the fullest ducking bullets at close range
Feeling crazy, like I'm a lose my life to a b**** n****
But while I'm here I be a rich n****

Nephews and nieces, niece cool clothes and chains and pieces
I break bread with my family when my record releases
Besides skills in the west, n**** got mouths to feed
Anything against the grain just light a finger spot over seas

Saturday morning as a youngster I ain't have no bike
And I ain't have no Nikes, but in the triple I'ma have more ice
Around my neck and my wrist with fern doors
Z-Ro, confidentially yours a player

[Chorus]",Confidential Playa,2002
Z-Ro,"[Z-Ro]
I'm sick of being lied to, giving it my all, you know I tried to
Maintain in the family is a must, I would of died to
Do anything for my peeps
But it seems they would rather see me sleep six feet deep
But when I'm on my feet somebody got they hand out though
That'll feel me broke the heat be hiding the rain watch me soke
That's the millennium love if you can pay your way, maybe you can stay
In the mean time they hate you everyday
Want to see me and my baby girl break it off
Haters'll stop they self-defense friends every ten minutes drop it's off
When three's company and four is a crowd
And my situation is seven everybody else can move around
Look at your friends and your friends peeping, they burn bridges
In they household, come into your home and try to repeat it
Got you looking at your people meaning shit
When it's over you're lonely talking about I should of seen that shit

[Chorus - 2x]
Take a look at my life, everybody around here so shife
No love, no sacrifice, fellas in the street ain't acting right

[Z-Ro]
Watch your enemies dog, keep them close like your block
Most of the ones closest to you cause they want what you got
Long as you spending money on them and your buying the drugs
They gone be down like four flats and ain't trying to budge
Say they love you everytime you rolling up the doe-doe
But when your ends don't spend they tend to leave you solo
I know, that's why I love Z-Ro, cause ain't nobody else gone love me
I think of myself, why'all don't think of me
I'm all alone but guess what, that's alright
Even though they use me for a punching bag, that's alright
Even if my woman don't want me no more, that's alright
I got Jesus and I can conversate with him all night
Give me a split that's what I'm asking
Cause I get reary ducking haters as they passing
I wish I was a sociable person, but socializing ain't for me
I want to die by myself in these streets cause that's love

[Mr. 3-2]
It ain't no love no more everybody about the dollar
That's why when I pass by the G-O-V don't holler
I pop my collar and don't follow nobody
Keep god first and don't need no killumanati
To put it on your mind cause I say on no pages
Stacking big faces and travel to many places
Sipping ski tastes straight out the gallon 
Why don't you take a lick and don't swallow ?
The games is backstabbing, crooked it ain't right
Friends or kin folk it don't matter we can fight
It's whenever when we were boss want to do
Cause I'ma pull dollar prime till I'm dead and I'm through

[Chorus - 2x]
[H2O]
A lot of friends turn to foes over money and hoes
I can't believe my best homie ain't my nigga no more
Remember days of playing hookie in the streets for fun
Now I'm getting dirty looks got me clutching my gun
On the one, I'ma shine like the sun my nigga
If I'm so low when I'm riding with some thugging niggas
Family members even say that I ain't use to shit
Cause I stay high all day straight abusing shit

[Z-Ro]
Cause lord knows Z-Ro ain't got no regular living
Even though I'm, trying I feel as if I'm headed to prison
Or headed to the grave, could it be I'm running out of time
Feeling hopeless, I lost my mama then I lost my mind
Will I heal in time, scarred up with bruise and shot
But see the pain is in my brain, hitting like a stash spot
My life, my life, full of drama and bullshit
We burn this out of my foes pull quick, where the love at

[Chorus - 6x]",Life,2002
Z-Ro,"[Z-Ro]
I'ma maintain, all about fortune, not the fame
Feddy, cold cash and a diamond ring, it's all about feddy when I
Rap sing
I'm sick of this struggling all damn day
Never see the sun cause skies stay gray
This for the little kids that can't go play
Cause everybody outside playing with an AK
Come around my niggas you bust you fuck around get lost
Better not set trip, fuck around get tossed 
I be a fool with that break them off 
Lay it down little daddy straight take them off
Yeah I'm living a sin when against the grain
You don't know Z-Ro you don't know my pain
Tears be coming on down like rain
It's a full time job, trying to maintain
Want to stay right but right be broke, a nigga can't eat with
Dreams and hopes
Steady be thinking of sell some dope, or trying to get paid from
Songs I wrote
In it to win it, don't plan to lose, got to be a real nigga fill
My shoes
Got to pay the rent, got to pay the light bill 
Got to pay the depend, deposit and pay dues
Me and that H-A-W-K, got to deal with stress when it come my way

But one of these days gone be out there
It's a bitch took a ball, ball and parlay
Until we make it we mash together
Ooint seven by the nine we blast together
South sive for live, S.U.C. for life, nigga we get cash forever

Keep maintaining, it's a burden up on my conscience just staying
Alive

I'm a real hustler stacking funds, riding around with a loaded
Gun

Some of my niggas that's on the run, with all that weed up in
Your lungs
Get your paper, get your dough, buy it off the show room floor
Go about this process slow, and feel the pain of my nigga Z-Ro
Over money I lose sleep, sell work, fuck sheep
Spit heat on beats, to make my, ends meet
Press hard on tablet sheets, everything else is obsolete
Victim of these ghetto streets, you don't work, you don't eat
I strive to, gain fame, struggle to maintain
Stay away from no names and flip bricks of cocaine
This rap thang's been good to me, feeds my, family
Forever keep my sanity, and do this shit for P-A-T
Must keep a leather head, for all my partners let's make em
Spread

All that, I say, I speak, the truth

Looking at this little light of mine, never did glimmer, never

Broke
Responsibility baby, taking a load off my little day
Steady be working her fingers to the bone, aching and tired when
She come home
Bout to pull a stunt, last of the month
Ain't no more work, just riding on chrome 
No rocks in my pocket the on my neck

And daddy East and West, Cancel Creek the dopefiends love me

Taking out contracts on hatas, with my beam and a mask

We can ball all day, four play in the hallway
Taking trips overseas, France, England, and my way
I'm the Don Datta, but you can't be my baby mama
Let me save you the drama, roll on like a Yokohama
We can, go half on the room, and half on a sack
And while you breaking the buzz down, I'ma be hitting it from the back
Bend over baby, I got something to show you baby
Turn around on your back toes up on the shoulders baby
Steady deep stroking don't mind me, just keep smoking
Bust a lot to break the serve and the soda water open
But you ain't my may thang, just a little something to the side
So don't talk when I'm talking on the phone, you keep quiet
Just open your mouth wide and let me put it inside
Smoke a sweet and to finish my cup and then it's time to slide
Don't worry about nothing cause it's confidential
Open up your runway for my ?con? to dent you

(Chorus - 2x (Billy Cook vocalizing in background)
All night long, all night
We be smoked all night
All night long, all night
As we flip and sip pink sprite

[Z-Ro]
Put a six in a Cris we gone sip on that
It's harder than a roll of quarters put your hips on that
Removing your thong, penetrate the pick and it's on
Still sipping and smoking stroking steady making you moan
I'm number 0 City Don, got a cottage by the barn
Automatic gauges vicious dogs roaming the lawn
You got to worry about nothing except for keeping me happy
And if it's with you than a bitch steady tapping and nappy

[DP]
Steady tapping and nappy, getting the headboards clapping
Hell shot, pussy with your man asking what happened
And no excuses out your mouth cause you've been riding with me
Arrange my soldiers, T-H-you-G
See you can tell from the smile and the way that you strip
Something ain't right, though nigga been all up in the guts
Better soak on some alcohol, and leave me alone
Bitch ask for the cash I get it

(Chorus - 2x)
[Z-Ro]
I need a thug bitch, a shop lift and sell drug bitch
But don't be tripping when I'm pimping in the club bitch
We can hit the telly and get under the sheets
Knocking you down till I move around back on the streets
And keep rolling, got to keep my benjamins folding
Then I'm coming back to beat it up until it's swollen 
Baby it's non stopping fix a nigga a plate
So don't worry I be coming to your house real late
Meanwhile I'm a soldier in the battlefield
I'm on a mission trying to get it, I'ma make a mill
With or without you, but if you down
Then we can do it together, drank rubbers and automatic rounds
But don't be tripping when I say I need space
I ain't cheating but it's some reason it's a knee case
I'm a block bleeder, you got to share me with the drugs and shit
But when I'm fucking you it's beautiful I love the shit

Z-Ro,"[Chorus]
Hard times, look over your peoples cause everybody dying
Osama Bin Loden is dropping bombs man, in a situation like this
How can I reach calm man, calm man, my nigga
This is hard times, like its so much gun smoke and see the stars
Shine
We living on dreams but is they coming true, what I'm gonna do
Make a million and pull a stunt or two, a stunt or two

Step into the world of a mob nigga, live in so much pain
The rain steady pumping me up, locked down on hard times
But I'm knowing that I gotta make it, running on my deadline
Giving out flat lines, cause if you think that I'm feeling
Fucking up by mine man, I gotta maintain
Its like everything that I had, it won't ever be the same
I feel I'm sicking home the cemetery
'Cause that's where all of my people rest
I can't take the stress, I'm fin to send it through somebody chest
That's why I walk around pissed off, strapped with a vest
I done been through a lot, ready to release the glock
Vicinities South, a brother on my Dickie, I be ready to ride
And I'm sick of this shit, I ain't fin to be hiding out, lately
Street life's got a nigga lost, will I wind up in a coffin
I don't know, I'm about to blow, I don't wanna take no mo'
But when I bust in a rush, you better hit the flow
Reality is a motherf**ker, that's what they was telling a nigga
That's just the truth, I lost my nigga Screw 
And Relay too and Andrew, now what about Danny Boo
That's fucked up, growing up in a childhood all alone with nobody
No mama no daddy, Z-Ro I see why these niggas can't relate to us
'Cause we them thugs of another kind
Making these niggas feel us two rhymes
'Cause if they lived the life that we live
They'd probably be broke down, crying and dying

[Chorus]

Living in the ghetto, everyday is a motherfucking test
And I just can't rest, gotta keep a vest around my chest
Seem like everybody wanna start a little plex
Nigga but not me though, I'm trying to focus 
On bigger and brighter thangs
Steady trying to come out the storm
From hurricanes, to heaven and lighter rain
Running away from the police

Nigga fuck peace, its all about war
Nothing but a A-K and a H-K and a Tommy Gun
Sitting in the back of the car, I just can't cope
Everybody is a suspect, even if you don't bust I'ma bust back
We down to ride and, all you little 
Bitches and niggas get off my nut sack
Been eighteen lonely years, since I buried my T Dogs
When I be shooting the breeze
But I'm still conversating like she ain't gone
You can take a look at this light of mine
Never did glimmer, never did shine
'Cause I resort to a life of crime
And I know I'm wrong, but I gotta get mine
Fools don't understand me, a nigga be nervous 24/7
Puffing on sticky, eyes redder than period candy
Look at my pockets, I might as well stop it
Because them hoes on flat, look in the freezer
And a sive, ain't nothing but a stomach, these are hard times

[Chorus]

Ro pass me the AK, one of these niggas
Fin to pay for everything that I'm feeling, ain't no more healing
To the head with lead, is the only thing I'ma be drilling
My nigga this hard times, and the way that it look
I don't think that it's gonna get better, the only thing that's here
Is to suck it up, inside I know that's why we not giving a fuck
Ready to bust, on anything this life feeling, like we on our last breath
I'm quiet as kept, my nigga don't start 
Or else somebody gon see they death
Or hate us like that, but this side of Trae it be like that all times
The only thing that I know more than pain, is pain and me never dying

Poverty stricken and headed to prison
Running because of the life, you looking for codeine
Or amphetamines, I got em at the cheapest price
Living by the rules of the street life, fin to get niggas
Better beat the street light home, after dark I par-park
Everybody be tripping, attempting to get rich
Dig a bigger ditch bitch bleed, I'm a motherfucking man
Trying to do all that I can, I always held my ground
And I never ran, got shot for taking a stand 
I need a plexing, because I'm stressing, losing my mind
Smoking Wesson, my head I'm pressing, hard times

Rule number one is to never tip a stripper
And I know a lot of why'all want to wish me trouble

Piece and chains that hang down low to my dang-a-lang
Stop that, cop that, I'm a baller baby
Got the rims that poke out on the prowler baby
I'm the same young cat that dropped the jewels on them

Still sip out the prescription bottle, with hydro on my brain
It help a nigga make it through the drama, swear to God
I be feeling like busting heads, and relocate to the Bahamas
But I don't want to be a runaway, I love my block
But I can't seem to put my gun away, friends be killing friends
So I don't make no ends, with nobody I know
'Cause if nobody gets nervous, then nobody's gotta go
That's the G-Code, and I will busting simply, then I will reload
Sick of all of this gun bumping, from you people
Turning a Christian into someone who is evil, Z-Ro

Turn me to a menace to society like O-Dog

It's a shame, the way they fuck around with my mind
It's a shame, the way they try to hurt me
It's a shame, the way they got me walking round with my nine
Raised on game, a soldier that's showing no mercy

When I wake up, I be wishing to find another way to make a living
Baking a cake, back in the kitchen got my palms itching
Scratch that with a fat stack, of Benjamin Franklin, y'all better
Back back trying to get my stack, I got a black mack in a black backpack
I know you jealous niggas, hate me cause I shine
They know I be rolling one deep, trying to follow behind
I gotta handle my business, by myself cause I'm alone
Really nothing to live fo', no more wife no more kids at home
Ain't that a shame, I'm losing everything I love
When they fuck up its okay, but when it's me they hold a grudge
You think I ain't know, you was fucking over Z-Ro
With Lil' Shannon around the time, your vehicle was reposed
My love for you was that of a mother, one I never had
I know we could never be again, I'm forever sad
But a hustler, gotta keep hustling
Until then, I-Ten drug smuggling

Sometimes I be wondering, if I'm ever gon' make it
Ducking and dodging poverty, am I ever gon' shake it
Every nigga I deal with, keeps saying they down
Why my money be funny, every time it be coming round
I told him tell 'em twenty-five hundred, he told em three thousand
Making me miss out on money, Sam gon' witness me clowning
When you give a nigga a inch, they try to take the whole ruler
After my inches, nothing but the forty-four rugger
Who am I, Z-Ro the Crooked I'm not a hoe
But instead of busting your head, I'ma go on and let you go
I'ma receive my blessing, better believe my weapon
Is a first, from the basic instructions before leaving earth
The bible, and if we follow it properly its survival
We gotta listen sometimes, even though we want to all shine
And glisten sometimes, remember we on a heavenly mission sometimes

Mean what I say and I say what I mean, nigga like me don't play with a beam
When I pull my gun, then I'ma use my gun
And I ain't tripping, I'll put you in a murder scene
But I try to stay humble, and hold what I got
Never let a nigga know what I got, keep my bidness to my own
So don't bring none of that there, to my home
I love my people, and that's a fact
But I want to know, where's the fucking love at
I don't want to put a motherfucker, in the grave
But I will to keep on, keeping on busting back

[Chorus: x2]
Wake up before you get caught up
Don't keep on selling your soul, until your life bought up
And my eyes on the prize, and never fall off the straight and I roll
When you slip, hollow tips are sharper than an arrow

I decided August 31, 1999
There's no more time for fake partnas, there's only time for my grind
All of my friendships came about, because of the verses I say
That nigga Z-Ro got partnas, but what about Joseph McVey
Everytime I'm on the microphone, nigga want to tag along
Want to see me, when I do my song
Or when a nigga be smoking the marijuana, and the dope all gone
A nigga right back, all alone
I had to regulate, or be surrounded by fakes
At all times looking over my shoulder, but I came out of that as I got older
Cause I realized, if it's written scriptures don't lie
That's why I'm thugging cause life is a bitch, and then a nigga die
I rap about the struggle, cause balling is foreign to me
Z-Ro be t-shirt and Dickies, ain't no Ralph Lauren you see
Cause every dolla that I make, is a dolla well earned
And I'm putting it back in the game, to sco' some crack
And a strap, to dip sherms
Hopefully I can make it, to see the sun rise
Fiending for them back in the days, of hide and seek
And throwing mud pies

[Chorus: x2]

Bout to swang by that sun, is wait for me be right back
I'ma roll a optimoe fat as a wiener, and light that
Cause it seems I can't confine without, clutching a sack
Puffing the sho' dipping the black, or raping the track
And I be tripping and sipping, and pimping this rap
I'm writing my rhymes, through my fetty's no slack
I'm ready to the sell the, the better my chedda
Tell her to the fella, I doubts the shredder
A better competitor, I dwell I'ma get her
Better get fella, I sell-a my yella
To hella thoed nigga, that wreck accapella
The fella that tell it, nobody he got em
He got 'em and shot em, and don't talk about em
Plotted and followed, to get where I started
Out of my product, the plot of my problem
Got off my bottom, to talk to my father
My ceiling is ending, my ending is finished
These women keep grinning, to swim in my linen
I'm tilling my bidness, the bidness I'm tilling
I'm tilling my bidness, the bidness I'm tilling
What's up what's up, had lean in my cup
Been asleep ten years, and I just woke up
The alarm on slow, all my ten minutes up
Gotta make my bed, gotta watch my butt
Gotta clean my room, gotta iron my stuff
Gotta wash my car, gotta shine my buck
Gotta change my oil, cause the road is tough
Keep my eyes on the road, and don't slow up

[Chorus: x2]",Wake Up!,2003
Z-Ro,"I know you haters better run, I'm coming for you
And everyday a nigga repping, and riding for Screw
I was keeping it in my chest, now I'm getting it out
I know you spectators in the game, better close your mouth
I got a lot of my time invested, up in this game
It's S.U.C. till I'm dead, ain't no need to explain
I'm in the Maab with guerillas, and we coming in packs
The only friends we got deep, and coming with black gats
So niggaz'd back back, I'm a man dude with a attitude
And I'm too quick to click, Lil' Trae is a damn fool
In my zone leave me alone, I ain't trying to be fucked with
Everything that I got, is everything that I want to roll with
Me and me and myself, you niggaz bad for my health
Now I'm pumped up like Superman, with a uppercut to be felt
I ain't playing with what I'm saying, you cats better start praying
For Deebo commits to spraying, and everybody be staying

[Chorus]
Why, these fellas talking down
Don't they know, why we'll ride
And make somebody slide, beware
Why, these fellas talking down
Don't they know, why we'll ride
And make these bustsas hot, beware

I'm chilling in my 1's, chopping game on my celly
My iced out cross, hanging down to my belly
Got your lil mama, butt naked shake her jelly
I'ma put her on a tape, and play it back on the telly
Boys hate to love the street show, when we showing up
I give me back the same middle finger, they be throwing up
They can't afford the pints, by the case that we po'ing up
Young in the game, it's time to start growing up
Get you some hustle, get you some grind
Show me some muscle, show me some shine
Fuck trying to crime, off another nigga name
It's just a matter of time, 'fore I run you out the game
Because I can't believe the nerve, of these hoes
Trying to use my nigga Pimp name, for benefit shows
Fin to start kicking in do's, with the macks
Trying to let that shit pass, now I'm coming for your ass fool

[Chorus]

It's the return of the mad rapper, industry nigga subtracter
That be greed up in the fists, that be clinched like a black panther
I'm sick and tired of you fakers, that try to twist up the game
So now you gotta see me, like the 84's that I swang
My glock I cock and I aim, my name you fin to respect it
You let me off in your world, then I swear to God I'ma wreck it
You must of thought I forgot about you, acting sue a crowd'll watch you
I gotta get that up out you, your people gon be without you
On top of that, niggaz be using my homie name
Saying the Screwed Up Click, so they can get them a little change
Hopping from dick to dick, and I ain't even gon say no name
I feel like I want to click, so now you gon feel my pain
I'm Trae, and I ain't bar nan nigga in this drama
Or mama, I weave and I swang sending em through a trauma
They tell me to let em make it, but really I ain't the one
Them bitches did it, so now they gotta see me when I come

Where the real niggaz at, cause I can't find none
Everybody be talking shit, when they be packing they guns
Quick to shoot a motherfucker, to keep they face from sweating
But when the laws come to bang one, snitching and telling
Be these ol' buster ass niggaz, killing all in they music
Showing a four pound around town, but never gon use it
I'm registered by my gangsta, you barely touching me G
Now feel you got the edasity, to come and see me
Fuck it whoever want to get some, can come and get dropped
I'm a grown man I don't get people sued, I get people shot
If you ain't shot, I wonder who gon be standing behind the trigga
Z-Ro the Crooked, cause ain't no love for none of these niggaz
Straight Profit to Presidential, trying to scandalize my name
They can't sell records without me, that's a god damn shame
I ain't to blame, why these niggaz ain't selling and losing weight
But I'm to blame, when I go off and get the bruising they face

[Chorus]

Make a nigga hot, yeeeah
Why you want to hate me, S.U.C.
You niggaz can't be meeee
My nigga T-are-A-E
And that's the way it's gonna be
Until a motherfucker take me
Me, and the M double A-be	
We gon be thugging
Until we see you niggaz to see

Straight up, it's my cousin Trae nigga
These bitch ass niggaz can't fuck with you

Z-Ro,"Too many times I done been hated on, by 5-0
Fuck your badge, I wish all of you bitches would die slow
I'm just trying to survive hoe, and feed my family
And I ain't killed nobody, but still rough is how they handle me
I ride one deep, suspended license and all
My middle finger out the window, screaming fuck the law
I know what you protect and serve, not a god damn thang
But give a nigga five years, for lessing the crowd mayn

I roll on 24's, so the Dopeman is what they get me for
And that's a shame, a nigga can't ride nice
Without getting harassed, and facing 25 to life
I wish I could make a citizen's arrest
Knock the busters in the hole, and blow the badges up off of they chest
Controlled substance on the ground, and it just had to be mine
Fucking with me about weed, and they look blacker than mine
Six months for getting caught up, with a soldier strap
They'll put the felonies on me, but keep your doja sack
That's why they proud to be, an American
What about my Negro people, look how they stare at them

So when my pockets lookin' low it's time to pay the suburbs
But this it I can't see my self at the bottom of the food chain
When a nigga hungry, and broke I go through some mood swings
Lay it down motherfucker I got kids to feed
I was on the block when it moved slow, all Z-Ro needed was speed
Do I suffer from greed? I gotta get some cash quick
Cause I look back on my life a nigga ain't never had shit
50-packin get me through the night, want get me but my profit
I gotta room but shit y'all them J's done kept on chopping

I eat on the block, and sleep on the block, then I retreat on my block
Goin out of town for birds about the piece on my block

Z-Ro,"[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
My nigga Redd been assisting me with holdin' my head
But I can't focus cause so many niggas in the street owe me some bread
And if you fuckin' with my mind lately, how could it be greed?
If all I want is just to touch whatevers mine baby
My forty-acres, and my new mansion, and my yacht
Might take a little time for me to see bigger living plus or not
But I want stop until I'm touchin' my figures, you better move(bitch)
Cause I be bustin' my nigga nobody knows all the trouble I been through
Been so broke and embarrassed couldn't afford a tooth brush fool
If it wasn't for my nigga Sherman Miller, me and great 'O
Offered me food when I was hungry, plus a place to lay low
Runnin' up and down Houston slangin' dimes and nickles
Performing for my hood niggas spittin' rhymes and riddles
Forever stayin' on our grind because of the shine it give us
And fuck jail, we didn't care how much time they give us

[Chorus: x2]
Everyday it's like I can't maintain
But still I feel I'm in it for the same thing
All I ever wanted is just to get my change
Living strength is my only type of mind frame

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
It's in my blood, it's in my body, it's in my soul
Gettin' paper been so important since I've been on my own
Don't nobody love me in this cold world
Fuck these bitches 'cause the hatred I got for my old girl
Is a motherfucker I ain't tryna' hear it, I ain't tryna' know ya
Unless you be a hustler tryna' come up on some mo' bucks
I'm like a male-nun with a rail gun
I'm so focused on my mail son I need a bail bond
Fuck you bitches, I love my riches go get it forward march
Cannibal in these killing fields tired of hangin' on this cross
Witness the J.Prince runnin' the south
Rap-A-Lot mafia like wide receivers cause we all be runnin' our route
I'm goin' long, it ain't no mercy for the weak better get strong
Cause it be crucializing everything that be goin' on try to maintain
Cause if you don't they pop you, drop you, and leave you slain mayne
Win it just to stay in the game (mayne)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Association bring about stimulation that's what I witness
Kickin' it with the jealous got me beggin' for forgiveness
This record label presidential think they live like me
Think they could jump in this rap game and survive like me
They living fantasies nigga tryna hold onto my name
But they can't sell records without me that's a goddamn shame
Hoe nigga get ya roll up, every time I flex you cats in check
Cause you can't lift it with you're on muscle, weak bitch!
Every time I speak bitch niggas steadily be plottin'
On removing me from my throne to throw me in the fuckin' prison
But it's all good I can take it cause I dish shit out
But me you've seen I'm havin' things in my dreams I can't get it out
God blessed the child that can double his fetti
Duckin' and dodgin' trouble cops and trouble times come get me
I'm tryna get a big ass piece so leave me alone
And live a life where I can leave both of my pistols at home

This is my wooooooorld
Z-Ro, king of the ghettoooooo

[Z-Ro]
Once upon a time, not long ago
There was a hustling motherfucker, with a cold ass flow
Everytime he hit the studio, his beeper go off
He left the beef to get his cheese, by selling people that raw
With a pistol on his right side, and one in his back
I-10 again and again, from running that crack
Girlfriend kept complaining, cause he never at home
So he told her deal with it bitch, or get the fuck on
It was money over bitches, on his mind
Plus all of his partnas, thought that he would never shine
The number be 15 and 5, up in the kitchen
He could do it straight up, or he could do it with a whipping
But then came a drought, and then he put his first album out
Decided to do it full time, cause record stores kept selling out
Still in the game, cocaine on top of the brain
From the studio to the streets, Z-Ro is everything

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
King of the ghetto, I'm sitting on my throne
Got a red light, sitting on my chrome
Ridgemont Texas, representing
With a taper fade, sitting on my dome
I mash niggaz, and I trash niggaz
When it come down, to the cash nigga
Beat that ass, in a flash nigga
Pistol play, and I'ma blast nigga
Gangstafied, from Goderhead
All day long, I chase my bread
But on the low, I don't fuck with FED's
Cause a snitch nigga, get dressed in red
Shut up bitch, she look so lie
But they don't know, she'll take your life
Not giving a fuck, or get fucked up
And end up dead, with your dick in the sky
Go my way, we gon have fun
Instead of happiness, we have done
About our business, corrupting our kidneys
All that codeine, weed and drugs
I'm leaning over, but still a soldier
Pimp my pen, like I'm suppose to
Nothing but the finest, light green doja
Got it from see-Note, from the Clover
Animal thug, I thug for life
So I ain't going, to the club tonight
Block is bleeding, I'm here for the eating
And supervising, my funds tonight
I scuffle and hustle, on my grind
No matter the weather, no matter the time
Roll out the red carpet for Z-Ro, this world is mine

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
Who that bumping, who that beefing
Hope you brought something, to put your chief in
Interrupting me, while I'm reefer chiefing
I'm a gangsta, not Erkle Steven
Cause I don't laugh, and I don't play
And no, is something that I don't say
I don't give a motherfuck, about your day
Hoe, get the fuck out of my way
I'm lean as fuck, and don't like nobody
My style of rap, is I'm like nobody
I let off fo' shots, and hit fo' bodies
OG with it, like Amas Rodney
Still in the game, as a MVP
Dealing with haters, that envy me
Fuck fabricated, and commercializing
I'ma bring my block, to MTV
Show love, and do all I can
For all my people, and all my fans
But motherfuckers, be hating me
For the life of me, I can't understand
Cause I'm cool as hell, till a hater get bold
Step out of line, fuck around get stoled
I must be, their motherfucking issue
Cause all these niggaz, getting drove
Up a lot, like a Volkswagon
I get a commission, for toe tagging
A slim killa, with a wide body
Polo top, and Polo sagging
I live my life, like I don't care
But every night, I be deep in prayer
Then I get off, my knees
And hustle, straight like that there

Z-Ro,"[Z-Ro]
Lately I've been going through more bullshit, than a bull fighter
So when I say my praises to God, one verse is like a full choir
My every thought is pain, strain and stressing me to death
Everyday is like a rehearsal, that's prepping me for death
I think I'm ready, because this world ain't no friend of mine
Only thing I qualify for, is murder and Penitentiary time
y'all should of shot me, in the jimmy instead
But I guess they was feeling eachother, to get head in the bed
Here I am, first born torn between heaven and hell
I tell my people so no to dope, but I let it sell
Need to practice my preaching, calling the kettle black
I know I'm on pot before or not, I gotta peddle crack
Ain't nobody got my back, except the laws when they on it
So I be going for broke, demolishing my opponents
Leaving no traces just blood on faces, believe that
HK I'ma squeeze that, you won't even want be back

[Hook]
I got through so much, so I try to stay fucked up
Because, when I'm sober I can't maintain
Even though I do my best, the only thing I earn is stress
So I, spend most of my days chilling with Mary Jane

[Z-Ro]
I can't focus, I'm losing my mind real fast
Dreaming and fiending for the day, I could make some real cash
Dropping album after album, platinum song after song
But it's like I ain't did nothing, cause the lights ain't on
How can I win, it's like everything I do is a motherfucking sin
It got a nigga, fiending to see my end
All of my friends are fake, they come around when I'm spending cash
But when I'm broke they out the do', with wheels spinning fast
Lonely, daily dodging the devil but he on me
Telling my people fuck him, cause he be working through my homies
Burning bridges, and I don't give a fuck
Remember y'all laughing at me, when I couldn't get a buck
It's all gravy baby, I got bigger hurdles I'm trying to jump over my residence
And my vehicle, is something I dump over
And it might not be much, but it's all I got
So when I paint it, promethazyne is all I pop

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
I'm on pre-trial now, and I can't smoke no weed
Cause if I catch a dirty, I'm facing T-I-M-E
My first time ever sober, it's fucking with my brain
Got a nigga with an attitude, I can't maintain
If you cross me I'll bring it to you hard, not softly
Living like I'm invincible, one day it's gonna cost me
When it's time to pay up, and I lay up in a grave
Bury me with a fifty sack, and a motherfucking 12 gauge
Hey, no love in my heart
Cause my homies was phony, straight from the motherfucking start
Why couldn't I get a ride, if I ain't have no weed, these motherfuckers
Ain't my people, they gotta be strangers up a reverend breed
So I bless the streets, with my smith-n-wesson
And if you beefing with me nigga, better get your weapon
You better pray that I'm codeine, and I'm just tripping
But I won't let you add up to my problems, I will leave you tripping

Houston Texas is my city, Ridgemont 4 is my block
I put my trust in no man, only my motherfucking glock
Cause she ain't never let me down, before
Fuck a gang I follow my bitch, cause she be busting rounds for Ro
Unlike my homies, cause they phony than a motherfucker
Even my broad, cause she might be fucking some other brother
Lord knows, that I couldn't take it if I found out
Premeditated, cause I'm about to let them automatic rounds out
A prisoner of my own mind, losing it swiftly
Clicking on motherfuckers, until the reaper come and get me
Fuck a friend and a click, and a partner in crime
Cause when you doing your bid, they won't be partners in time
I bet they be the main reason, why you locked up in a county
That's why I strive, to keep all the busta bitches from round me

When they thought I was leaving, they wanted to D-E-A-D me
Dropping salt on my name, saying I sold my soul
And these suppose to be my people, damn my people so cold
Why not be happy for a nigga, when he make a major move
Chill you playing with this game, but I've been paying major dues
I can't tell a motherfucker, how to fly a plane
If I ain't never been up in the cockpit, you feeling me mayn
I got a bunch of records sold, and y'all ain't sold shit
Your foreign's at a standstill, but my Houptie's on the road bitch
Beef with me nigga, and you can find out
How I murder niggas with my lyrics, I ain't gotta pull my iron out
Take it how you want to take it, i don't give a damn

Fucking with you pussies, cause it's time you be tampered with
When you see me look me in the eyes, and pull up your pamper bitch
My nigga named Tommy, say he's coming to get ya
His people gon be swinging, everyone of em'll hit ya
Holding on to my grudges, until my brain get a blister
I love drama so much, because my life is so rough
So when you see me out in public, don't you come at me wrong
Disrespect me if you ain't, hoe I'ma fuck up your dome

If they people want revenge, I never worry or wonder
When my motherfucking beef coming
Nigga this Rap-A-Lot mafia, head-n-chief coming
Everybody claiming they got guerillas in they click, why they be lying
When automatics start bucking, they turn them monkeys on the vine
Trying to get away, from the drama
But my barrel be spinning, like a set of Yokohama
I gotta blame it on my messed up childhood, this how I turned out
Hotter than first degree burns, unable to burn out

I hate the world, is the kind of attitude I got
But I could justify reasons, for any dude I shot
So I never be watching my back, Jehovah do it for me

Lane to lane dripping blue, puffing on coo-coo
Candy wetter than do, banging nothing but Screw
Reclined on buck, like I'm stuck in the mud
Ripping my mug cause I'm thug, sipping straight out the jug

Bout to knock my trunk off, with this shit down South
Knocking pictures off your wall, when I pass by your house
Know your spouse is your trojan, if you love her than get her
Cause she stuck on a G, like a god damn sweater

Crawling purple passion, up in my cup

Chrome glossing, big bossing flossing
Block to block spot to spot, no need for tripping
Still collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension
Twist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street
Waiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep
It's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale
Sparkling sun rays, making the game prevail
Jazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail

And we'll get it on, and we known to buy a house
And buy the block it don't stop, with shoes and socks
Bet the top drop, and let the bumper unlock
But me I'm rolling foreign, never ever alone
Swanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing
Paints I be pouring, and you know I'm so wet
Getting me a ticket from the laws, you want to bet
They can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy
Yes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit

At Dick Dall Middle School, all them niggaz would laugh
Telling me I would never make it, cause I rap too fast
I was desperately trying to find out, how to go from scraps to cash
Remember, how y'all use to chase me home from school
Just cause I sported corduroy britches, and Pro Wing shoes
I use to have a lunch card, cause them times was hard
Since the seven people living in one house, with no cars in the yard
I remember stressing so hard, I couldn't keep my focus
My only love was for extras, and overs
Fuck all you niggaz, don't make me slap the fuck out all you niggaz
If it ain't related to making paper, I ain't calling you niggaz
I bet Mo City remember, when I took it over with rapping
51-11 Ridgevan, moving that crack bitch I was stacking
Residuals redeemingly, I was raw mayn raw caine
Rapidly running my neighborhood, I was the law mayn
'Member when I dropped my first album, in '98
Fucking with Herman Fisher, but now that nigga hate me he's a cake
Suppose to be mad at me, tal'n bout I owe him some change

I remember the winters in the hood, no heat cold nights
No gas no lights, a ghetto low life
So my flow twice as strong, from the memories
I remember when my closest homies, turned to enemies

But when you in the quicksand, they frown cause your legs stuck
Yeah I remember that, so you remember this

So before, the reaper come and turn me to a memory
I endlessly spit the heat, for the people to remember me

Back in the gap, when I first hit the block
With my first 25, and a hand full of rocks
Posted up at Samantha house on the West, on the porch
Ready to give my nigga some work, or give him the torch
I remember telling my T, I wasn't going to college
And was headed to the streets, to get the rest of my knowledge
That broke her heart, and for that I had to go
So I went from the sidelines, to starring in the show
Everything came slow, and nothing came fast
Most times I was out of luck, and dead on my ass
But with the heart of a hustler, and the mind of a G
I came up, now I'm something to see Bun B

and my dawgs on the block'll ball 'til we fall
Plus Peewee woulda never got locked
Plus Greedo woulda never got shot
Plus Mello woulda still been here
With a white Kangol about to body rock the pen
Misty, then the rest of the click like
Full speed then runnin without a red light
Whole life I'll be one of a kind
Go deep in the wind I promise I got my head right
And I hate it's gon' be like this
I wonder why everything come to me like this
And if only fo' one night I finally get my smile
Lord, I don't wanna leave like this

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Z-Ro]
It'll be nice to have Emo and Jody and LL back
My nigga Best and his big brother E. Roy Love
Dem people ain't never comin back
But if only for one night
My nigga could make a decision he shoulda made
Make it where the situation turned out another way
And ain't a day go by
I don't wish I didn't have to miss my momma
This ain't livin my nigga this just drama
If only for the night when the storm'll live calmer
Cause seem like they wanna give a lifetime sentence
to a nigga with a pistol and a pound of marijuana
Wish it was legal to be in public wit'cha eyes red
I've seen a lot of B.I. cases go fed
Got pulled over, no seatbelt on the shoulder
Let to a 70 year stand and coda
If only for the dead nigga
Didn't have to wait to make a safe walk to the sto'
Just to get his niggaz and a six-pack {?}
But there never been a cakewalk to the sto'
Fuck around and see the head concussion
If the hood decide you gotta fake walk to the sto'
They fully fronted to everybody with animosity
Bitches'll take 'em 'fore they walk to the sto'
A nigga from the Southside, and a nigga from the Northside
And a nigga from the Eastside
Could all get along with each other, like we knew each other mother
No reason to wanna take our own lives
By losin a son, losin a daughter, losin a child
I'm battered by life, too rude to smile
I liked it better when I used to smile
If only fo' one mo' night

Z-Ro,"[Chorus: Ashanti] 
You came into my world and taught me thangs 
And I can't lie cause boy you did yo' thangs 
Feel like I'm floatin when I hear yo' name 
I think you made me fall in love again 

[Z-Ro - over Chorus] 
Okay 
Screwed Up Click 
Yeah 

[Z-Ro] 
Whenever you need a nigga call me up I'm on my way 
Sex or serious conversation, I'll listen to what you have to say 
This ain't gotta see about a wham bam thank you ma'am 
I'm not like these other fellas although I know you think I am 
Even though I kick it with a lot of - females 
I can honestly tell you that I ain't gotta - female 
But since I'm fresh out of jail you probably thank that I just wanna bone 
Hit it, quit it, then delete your # from my mobile phone 
Can't you see the tattoo reads one deep 
So I need only one lil' momma, one cup of codeine and one Swisher sweet 
Weight of the world is on my shoulders because I'm thuggin 
But sometimes even the hardest of us need some lovin 
And the first time with you is like my first time again 
Like rediscoverin rap music, writin my first rhyme again 
You say you feel like you're floatin, well I'm floatin too 
Everybody's leavin, now you know it's time for you and Z-Ro to do 

[Chorus] 

[Z-Ro] 
Now tell the truth; I'm like a mechanic when I work my tool 
So brace yourself baby so I can hit you with the mule 
Everytime I touch ya I'ma find a new hot spot, it's guaranteed 
I'm a thug nigga but still a romantic so pass the weed 
Now you ain't no dimepiece, you a whole dollar 
And I'd rather be givin you ""Fuck Faces"" 
Ain't tryin to pay these hoes no bother 
You see I consider myself as a king 
But I can't reach a comfort zone 'til I find myself a queen 
So we can rule together, it's picture perfect me and you together 
Go through our good and bad moods together 
Plus I'm concerned if you don't come home 
Long as you call me and let me know you alright I'ma stay offa ya phone 
Ain't none of that drivin by ya mama house or callin private 
The way you hug me when you see me let me know you my chick 
And I ain't scared to put that icing on your finger either 
You're my sunny day when it be rainin 
It's a blessin momma sing for the future 

[Chorus] 

[Z-Ro] 
Me and you is like a feelin that I get when I roll on 22's 
And I'ma keep you stylin when I'm shoppin for you 
Plenty ice, plenty clothes, plenty shoes 
But don't get it confused, I ain't trickin cause I'm pimpin 
But without you in my life I would be barely livin, mayne 
What we do in my arms is like doja to the brain 
I promise you like a drug you're much better than everythang 
Now if I was to try to hold in this love, I would choke 
Cause it's some potent shit like from Humboldt County on the West coast 
Yeah I think I fell in love again, it's on 
It's so real I feel I won't have to make another ""I Hate You Bitch"" song 

[Chorus] - 2X

Z-Ro,"[Talking] 
Hold up let me hit my Hypnotic 
Aight you rollin? 
I'd just like to take a minute to apolgize to my listeners 
I just wanna say I'm sorry for not havin any songs about happiness 
Or bein in peace and shit like that 
See I can only display my personal feelings and experinces 
And so far I ain't felt what happiness feels like 
And experinced anything but hard times and heartache 
So I apologize for not makin you dance 
I apologize for not havin any sarcastical songs 
You know that good feeling with e'm 
That put a smile on your face 
I ain't had nothin to offer accept for frowns 
So for that I'm sorry I promise if I could sing another song 

([Verse 1] 
I wish I could tell you my life is good but it's not 
I wish Missouri , city runners were cold, but they're hot 
So many situations to deal with, I can't concentrate 
A hundred homies and everyone is fake 
How can I make it out the ghetto it want let me go 
Seems like everytime I do a good deed, good deeds never return to 'Ro 
I gave up my last so somebody could have a start 
Then somebody got me locked behind bars 
What a way to show ya love back-homie you a friend for life 
For your crime I'm doin time in the Penn tonight 
It's bad enough I lost a family my luck ain't live 
Mama died when I was 6 and Daddy ain't have enough time 
To kick it with me-like I wanted him to kick it with me 
Now that I'm incarcarated you wanna come and visit with me 
But I ain't holdin no grudges Daddy I love you that's my word 
Even though you had me sleeping on a curb...I wish I had another song 

[Chorus] 
These are the days(these are the days) 
We cherish them because soon they'll be gone away(soon they'll be gone away) 
On to another place 
Pretty soon I'll be gone 
Twenty-sum odd years of calling God on this mobile phone 
If it wasn't for my life style I'd sing another song 

[Verse 2] 
I wish that I was ridin around in a Bentley 
But maybe Z-Ro living lavish just ain't meant to be 
Cause I'm the type of fella that'll give a bum a hundred dollars 
I'd rather help out my people instead of poppin my collar 
I wish that I could get a million copies sold 
If I'm broke I'd rather die I don't want no more poverty-growing old 
Sometimes I wish that I was somebody else 
Cause I can't even pay bills even though my CD's won't stay on the shelf 
Strugglin and I'm strivin and just barely strivin 
Bobbin and weavin-my last breathe time after time 
And it seems that I won't ever get no rest I'm exhausted 
Tryna make it-compare the price and pain is what the cost is 
Maybe if I was evil I'd be rolling in bread 
Until somebody with a pistol come and opened my head 
But my mission is keepin ambition 
I'm trying so hard even though my soul is scarred-oh Lord... 
I wish I had another song 

[Chorus] 
These are the days(these are the days) 
We cherish them because soon they'll be gone away(soon they'll be gone away) 
On to another place 
Pretty soon I'll be gone 
Twenty-summod years of calling God on this mobile phone 
If it wasn't for my life style I'd sing another song 

[Verse 3-singing] 
I wish that I could sing another song 
But my rhythm is too much pain 
Sunshine is the level that I think I'm on so tell me why it's so much rain 
Day to day it's a struggle in my lifetime 
To keep from tripping I be stayin in the trees 
No crimes committed so tell me why I'm doin time 
And won't nobody come and set a nigga free 
Sometimes at night I smoke a cig and sit back 
And wonder why the whole world hate me 
So much ambition I just gotta pull my wig back 
Wishing murder would come on and take me 
I wish that I could sing another song 
I'm tired of sleeping in rivers of tears all night long 
No point in wonderin why my people choose to do me wrong 
Stuck in this reality until my life is over and gone 

[Chorus] 
These are the days(these are the days) 
We cherish them because soon they'll be gone away(soon they'll be gone away) 
On to another place 
Pretty soon I'll be gone 
Twenty-summod years of calling God on this mobile phone 
If it wasn't for my life style I'd sing another song

Z-Ro,"You already know who it is nigga, 'King of Da Ghetto'
It's a new day and time but shit
It ain't all good but shit it ain't all bad no mo' either doe
Why'knahmsayin'? I'm tryin' to keep it civilized
But motherfuckers keep fuckin' with me doe mayne

In case you don't know my name, I'm 'bout to tell you my name
Z-Ro the crooked, 'King of Da Ghetto' all about my change
I remember when Joseph wasn't able to have thangs
Now I'm able to flip a 300-M and grab grain
There's some niggaz mad at me 'cause I got cash mayne
I'm the future of rap-a-lot, quit livin' in the past mayne
Remember flippin' with a brick, in the dash mayne
Now every time I roll up bitch give me bomb-ass brain

Probably be somebody, baby momma, I ain't ask mayne
Baby, daddy got a problem, we can hit the grass mayne
An asshole by nature, livin' in the fast lane
Stay rilla fo' reala, fuck with me and that's yo' ass mayne
Honor roll student, but I dropped out of class mayne
Ain't got a diploma, but got knots of cash mayne
To you haters I'm a waiter waitin' to serve somebody
I kill all you motherfuckers but I

Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just get me through my day
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone
Don't wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around
And bust your brain

I guess they never seen a guerilla when he stompin' and pissed
But they 'bout to see a young guerilla, whoop, they ass with his fist
I tried to move around, motherfuckers roachin' and shit
My attitude, fuck, watch how you approachin' me bitch
Asshole and ain't gon' fake it 'cause I had it by nature
And that's the result of everywhere you go niggaz hate ya
And I ain't trippin', I'ma catch one of them marks on the back street
With the black heat, slugs run up like a track meet

I'm an anybody killa, but everybody can get it
Servin' suckers in neighborhoods got it crackin' like a stick
I didn't come to hurt nobody but you bumped into mine
But we gangsters I pull a fo' and told you po' out that wine
If I wanted flex, I coulda got a strap at that moment
I'd rather keep ca-cash, ca-cash, 'cause I'm already wanted
I'm an asshole by nature, my flag's on the left side
Gave him a pass before I stepped [Incomprehensible] side

Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just get me through my day
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone
Don't wanna hurt nobody but a nigga might fuck around
And bust your brain

Now I don't wanna hurt nobody, but that's a lie
Cause it's a delight for me to bust a lip or black an eye
Or smoke a nigga like a syrup covered black 'n' mild
So don't fuck with me when I'm tryin' to make money stackin' piles
Some niggaz trie to rob me before, try to jack me now
Fuck Danny Glover, I'm the lethal weapon with maxi nine
Can't a nigga lavish any mo'?
Without a gang of niggaz and they kickin in his do'?

And nine times out of ten it'll be one of my friends
That'll lead me to my grave, murder me to get my ends
Do the crime and make a cape escape from my residence
But still show up at my funeral services 'n shit
I ain't fin' to let it happen to me, you gon' respect me
Ain't gon' be no bad actin' with me, homie
And to you haters I'm a waiter waitin' to serve somebody
I kill all you motherfuckers but I

Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just get me through my day
Don't wanna hurt nobody, just leave me the fuck alone

From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth
From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth
From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth

Hold up a minute, I'm the King of the Ghetto
Holding the rap game, like wood grain can't let go
You niggas'll never see me, I'm on another level
Stay ready to dig a grave, keep a gun and a shovel
And pouring gas too, if there evidence
Saw me in the rear view, now you wonder where I went
I'm a get you if I owe ya, visit ya residence
Lay the merk game down, and then I'ma hit the fence
Better keep my mouth closed, so they can't see the shining
They think it was Z-Ro, cause all they seen was diamonds
I'm cold as a deep freeze, with bags of ice in it
My 3-57 pretty, but ain't nothing nice in it
Too many bitches, and not enough rubbers
Got so many, all my real niggaz under the gutter
Watch a nigga full of life, light close like shutters
God damn, staying healthy is hard as a mo'fucker

From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth
From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth
From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth
From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth

I got diamonds all in my mouth, in my grill and in my jaws
Platinum teeth and princess cuts, my mouth is similar to a disco ball
I'm Paul Wall my smile is blinding, my ice is shining like a chandelier
I tend to brush my teeth with Windex, just so the glass house mouth shine clear
I got mo' karats invested with soup, I'm a Texas icon a People's Champ
Put on your shades when I commits to approach, my mouth is eliminating like a lamp
It got gold grills and platinum and ice, cause that's how it is in the Lone Star State
With a cup full of bar in a candy car, and we jamming on a Robert Davis Grey Tape

From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth
From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth
From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth
From the South
I got the diamonds in my mouth

Ever since 1999, I had diamonds in my grill
You just rapping that ain't platinum, homie you need to chill
Cause you embarrassing Texas, nigga you ain't trill
Nigga you been on my dick, way befo' you got your deal
These rappers finally get some fame, and think they got it locked
After your album flop, nigga you gon be on Koch
My gear clean, from my ear rings to my pinky ring
If you ain't spend thirty, tuck in your piece and chain (Southside)

If I'm looking agitated, bitch you better run hoe
I use to do the baguettes, but now I'm VS-1's though
Princess cuts straight up and down, Johnny done those
I got loud ice, just like Paul Wall
Shining down South, brighter than all y'all
When it's time to get your jewelry done who do y'all call
Cause you fellas ain't shining at all, check me out
On the first and fifteenth, I'm some'ing like a pimp
Even with a suspended license, still finna flip
Ain't no limit to this cash, ain't nothing I can't get
Five deuce Hoover cause, ain't nothing like a Crip
Ride with a Revolve', I don't fuck with clips
These roach ass niggaz, trying to make me bust my chips
But I'm not a bank, I don't even trust my bitch

Z-Ro,"[Chorus] 
Help me please 
I'm blinded by my tears and I just can't see 
So many devils tryin' to recycle my soul 
Cause in the ghetto where I'm from ain't no positive roles
Just niggaz and hoes 
Send me a sign 
Just to let a nigga know that he been on ya mind 
Mmmmmm

Hmm, shit just be so fucked up out here in these streets mayne 
You feel me? Straight up 
This is the sea of life, and I'm drownin' 
I know I can swim, but feel like I keep sinkin' down in 
These waters and I can't breathe, I feel like I'm gon' blow it 
I can see people holdin' a life jacket but they won't throw it 
Entertained by my struggle and they'd love to see me die 
Why not love to see me live instead of helpin' my family cry? 
Like a homeless person with a sign, I would work for food 
Ain't no shame in bein' helpless it's a part of payin' dues 
On an everyday mission tryin' to collect five's and ten's 
So many worries I promise my bones show right through my skin 
Fancy cars and a mansion? That ain't never been my goal 
A hooptie would be fine, plus somewhere warm when it's cold 
I know what it feel like, not to be able to call the shots 
Have a pen but no time to connect, all the dots 
Therefore I do what I can do and then get down on my knees 
Cause I can't make it by my lonely, Jesus help a nigga please 

[Chorus] 

Yeah, much love to everybody doin time 
Up in {?} state jail, you dig 
Seem like soon as I'm findin' happiness the joy's gone 
Kickin' it with Steve Francis, Mike Tyson and Roy Jones 
I waited my whole life to be somebody 
But now I've gotta get a visit just to see somebody 
I'm in this all white, reminscin' all night, 'bout my cousin Trans 
Wreakin' havoc in this rap game, so it's alright 
Grandmother and my Auntie gettin' everything they need 
Trae's an angel in my eyesight, a true friend in deed 
While I'm waitin' for heaven, I see hell and smell the flames 
God send Abraham to quickly snatch me from this pain 
I don't really wanna die, just need a, change of scenery 
I done see too many killings just like my vision is mean to me 
And my eyes don't like me, and my soul wanna leave me
I'm persecuted daily by my friends it ain't easy 
I do what I can do and then get down on my knees 
I have so many enemies, Lord would you help me please 

[Chorus] 


Nigga fuck Precinct Five, nigga and fuck Officer Thornton Berry 
Punk-ass bitches, uhh 
Tryin' to survive for me, is like chasin' the wind 
You know you ain't never gon' catch it so why bother lettin' yo' knees bend 
I try to stay around some realness, brothers and sisters holla if you feel this 
If hurt and misery is who you chill with 
Mo City my hood it forever be my block 
Never thought I'd see the day it'd hand me over to the cops 
Where the love from my homeboys, I love y'all too 
I was the tugboat to ya problems cause I drug y'all through 
Just one question dawg, how could you do me like that? I took your family in 
I put some cash in ya pocket, made you a man again 
But now it's like you never knew me 
Wouldn't take the fall for y'all so now y'all wanna do me 
I made it up out the hood and I ain't comin' back 
Unless I'm brangin' Lil' Boss to get a hundred sack 
Nigga I'm gon' do what I'm gon' do and then get down on my knees 
And make a couple of G's, but in God name, help a nigga to succeed",Help Me Please,2005

If somebody got a problem with me, come and address it 
If the shoe fits it then walk in it I'm talkin to Texas 
See I'm from a section where we kid each other for practice 
So I keep grenades and a chopper right under my mattress 
Please don't let the gold and the diamonds fool you 
I promise it's nothin for your family to lose you 
It's just when you speak to me watch ya tone, call the chief on the phone 
Bring the beef to your home, make you sleep under some stones 
Z-Ro the Crooked, but you faggots already know my name mayne 
Know you'd love to catch me slippin in the turnin lane mayne 
Fuck a rap tuck my strap right in back of my britches 
I'm just rappin to pay my lawyer for creatin a witness 
I done smoked somebody befo' and smokin's a bad habit 
They say it always take you to your casket, but fuck death 
Cause I ain't scared, bitch I'm ready to fly 
But until I go I'ma murk niggaz and get my fetti right now 

[Chorus 2X: Z-Ro] 
I'm a soldier, these stankers keep me reachin for my holster 
Sometime I feel my death is creepin closer 
But I'ma keep on thuggin like I'm 'posed ta, 'posed ta 

[Z-Ro] 
Look at the conditions I was livin in, I didn't have a clear vision then 
I needed ends cause there was no residence for me to sleep in 
Nigga the streets raised me, man they played me sometime 
But a real nigga regroup relax and take this back on his grind 
I was gifted with a sick grip game, and it stick to the spoon 
Plus I'm gifted at spittin make my vocals click to a tune 
Bitch I'm schizophrenic, I probably won't stick to this mood 
Hope I don't lose it 'fore I have to bring this brick to this dude 
I heard some niggaz got somethin to say 'bout me back in the hood 
Can't be Mo City, cause everyday I'll be back in the hood 
And we can scrap or we can take it to the straps in the hood 
You get your stuff or be murdered and won't be back in the hood 
Same way I stack the republic I'm just like that in the hood 
Bring to you a hat in public or a hat in the hood 
Niggaz say Rap-A-Lot ain't payin me like I ain't got nuttin 
If six figures is bein bent over, I'm lovin the fuckin 

[Chorus] 

[Z-Ro] 
All you niggaz that talk down, just might get walked down 
Become another statistic and down these war grounds 
Nigga pull up your hands, just look at each other 
But guaranteed to beat up a bitch he gon' wanna make me suffer 
So I shoot first, look at his head burst, bleedin 
And exit to dig a ditch that's even, give me the reason 
Promise I've been lookin to get some stress off 
I let the muh'fuckin mac-11 hack everything under the neck off 
Used to be a problem child now I'm a problem grown up 
I done done some evil shit and one day I'ma have to own up 
But when I say somethin homey I mean what I say 
I'ma murder you straight up or I can lean when I spray 
Z-Ro the ""fuck everybody"" nigga from Screwed Up Click 
Now I ain't gon' let you bend over to tie your shoes up bitch 
I'ma launch a Bernard Hopkins type of blow in your jaw 
That's the way I police my perimeter, Ro is the law

Trunk full of funk, I ain't never been a punk

Out the streets, of the Ridgemont 4
Not no bitch, and say I still ain't a hoe
Letting niggas know, everyday of the year
I pimp my pen, and I get my point clear
Why niggas wanna talk down, I don't know
Gotta take a trip to Akapoko, from the 4
With my 4-4 on my side, when I ride
Ready to do another homicide, in a pine box
And I'm gone, nigga old glory
I'm H-Town to Cali, just like Robert Ory
If I do a murder, flee the murder scene

Know I'm saying, I'll loose your grill

Looking gravy, looking real throwed
I'ma be the nigga, pulling over at the fucking cross road
With my K on my side, I'm ready to ride
And if I gotta go, it'll be a homicide
Me and another nigga, on the way to the Golden Gate
A nigga like me, can't wait
Just to make it, to another day
Gotta get the big pay off, so get the fuck out my way
When I come around your corner, so slow
It'll be the nigga, in the damn Polo
It's the rap lawing, jackers ain't barring
Why I skipped the slab, when I went straight to foreign
Said it like I said it, in the old school
Some niggas they be red, but Z-Ro blue
I come around your corner, but I ain't set tripping
But I will, wet niggas and wet women
With the calico, I had to let a motherfucker know
That I come around your corner, in a Lincoln four do'
A fox photo, cause I do it in a flash
Nigga watch out, cause that could be your ass
I rhyme so long, rhyme so strong
I flicks my bar, sip then I swoll' on
Get on, the motherfucking bench
And when the laws hit the corner, I hit the fence
They wonder where I went, they keep looking
I don't give a fuck, like Tyson I keep hooking
Or maybe like Lenox, I'm strong to the finish
I'm like the ghetto Popeye, but I don't need spinach
I'ma keep going, I keep on flowing just like the Nile
Million dollar mouthpiece, every time I smile
Look and load a, nigga ashtray
Every time he smile, he can turn the night to day
You can open up the pop, and let the smoke come out
We don't give a damn, bout a crooked ass cop
Crooked officer, crooked officer
Make a nigga wanna blow the badge, off of ya
Me and Dougie, my motherfucking brother
R.I.P., to my motherfucking mother
That's the Dorothy Marie McVay Matthew
There's ten toes planted, in my motherfucking shoe
I gotta be a man, hope you understand
There's nothing but the work, and the calico in my hand
On a corner on the Ridgevan, and I'm serving a fiend

Bout time, they opened up the do' for Z-Ro 
Cause I've been dropping hits, since ten years ago 
Trying to do it legal, and not slang yayo 
If I can't get it legal, to the corner I go 
I never took pride, in slanging cocaine 
Never could get a job, but needed some mo' change 
C.d.'s wasn't selling, because I had no name 
Nothing but a t-shirt, no piece no chain 
Too many times, I was ready to give up 
Run up in a bank, and say this is a stick-up 
Put my pain on records, and record sales picked up 
The tears I done shed, led me to the big bucks 
2000 and 4, I ain't broke no mo' 
Cause God is my life jacket, when I sink solo 
I went to a hundred thousand, from a whole fo' 
So all you haters hate me, as I make a little mo'

And ain't nobody gonna block out my shine (shine-shine)

My locker full of commsary, and my fan mail 
My city saying Z-Ro, what you gon do when you get out of jail 
I can't do no mo' pyrexes, no mo' scales 
Trying to make a million dollas, off my melody 
Couldn't see it coming, so I caught a state-jail felony 
F-1 bunk twelve, there resides the stars 
Special thanks to love, cause ""I Hate you Bitch"" climbed me to the top of the charts 
Being free, is like being on lock 
Niggaz still kick it with ya, but try to get some of what ya got 
I ain't never seen, so many feminine men 
Swear to God they holding in the world, but ain't nobody seeing dividends 
That ain't the life of me, I had to get it 
Might not be rich in the present, but I'ma be rich in a minute 
Cause I got three 'causeos sitting up high, rolling 24's

Jealousy and envy, play a major role 
Everytime a playa, try to get his pockets swoll

Even told homicide, I pushed the homie's wig back 
They don't wanna see, a nigga make it out of poverty 
When will they realize, God is running with me ain't no stopping me 
Probably never will, so keep on trying 
You can clip my wings, but I see happiness in the sky so I'ma keep on flying 
Until I find, a rested place 
So many battle scars, blood on my chest and face 
Whether I'm working or rapping 24/7, me and Satan be scrapping 
He want my soul, but I ain't gon let it happen 
Even if I lose my life, trying to chase my dream 
Whoever do me, gon have hell when they face my team

Bet they bury me with g-stacks, plus a platinum plack

Losing the way that I lose

Take a bruisin the way I been bruised
And you'll see why I don't care
Respect my mind - cause I'll kill you nigga
Bitch I'll kill you niggaz, you better
Respect my mind - cause I'll kill you niggaz
Cause I will kill you nigga
Cause I don't wanna feel

You bitch niggaz gon' lay, you won't catch me runnin
When - I load my AK, don't think I won't spray
You bitch niggaz gon' lay, you won't catch me runnin

I become a soldier when it's war time
That's all I really know cause all I've had are hard times
And ain't nobody bendin down with me, I'm on my own
Duckin and dodgin infrareds aimin for my dome
I got enemies in every state, city and hood
Plus my relationship with my friends ain't no good
Therefore I roll with Katie cause she's a bad bitch
One squeeze ten motherfuckers bleed and need a casket
No need to reload, I promise I'ma drop 'em all
Screamin ""Remember me?"" as motherfuckers stop and fall
Ain't no remorse, ain't no love in my life cycle
Cause when your family out to get you it be twice as vital
I'm not tryin to be a statistic of a thug war
Call me ridiculous but I won't hesitate to slug for it

So I'm paranoid and trigger happy until I leave

But Ms. Katie put mo' motherfuckers on the front page
If I gotta pull a trigger I'ma shoot to kill
Not tryin to hurt ya, I'ma try to leave you stiff as steel
Cause I ain't tryin to watch my back when I'm out in public
So when I blast that's yo' ass you went out and dusted
But I'm not tryin to send the wrong message to the kids
I'm just sayin even if you young they'll stil split ya wig
And I'd be wrong if I told you to let a nigga do ya
I practice what I preach and ride with much more then a Ruger
I guess the Lord'll deal with me at the end of time
I'm not a killer but motherfuckers gon' respect my mind
That's on my mama trust, nobody but friends to my kin
For the slightest disrespect I'll put ya spirit in the wind

And everyday I try to stack my grip and make three songs
I'm try'na get my mothafuckin' paper on
I want the new (bone?) and the new cell phone
I want the new two way pager and the new mansion home

That's the reason for my uncontrollable ballin' right now
Use to be scared to walk in the store I payed the price now
My life is to valuable for me to play with life now
Of course it's gon' be some niggas who think I done changed
They find me guility just because now I got diamonds on every thing
My mouth and my pinky ring, my wrist and my neck
I'm 'bout my business so give me my cash or give me my check
See I can biblically remember me and Trae on the block
Even more then hustlin' sometimes we had to lay on the block
Eat, sleep, shit, piss, pray on the block
To make it through the night to see another day on the block
Movin' rocks got us full pockets-plus knots in our socks

Yes, I was impressed, by the sex in her ass
W-U-I-S her, Versacci, down like Fran, dress her, bless her heart
She was a sweet-tart, but'cha never understood her point in our duo
Talkin' smart wit' all that ""you know"", comin' wit' he-say, she-say
From what she heard at the club, bout some chick that I had played on
Well bitch, you should have stayed home
She mad cause I done told her girl off, but the bitch was wrong, and you
You gon' let these messy ho's fuck yo' world off
I tried to love her man, but see love is one thang, and dumb is anotha'
Brotha', I'd be dumb to let her run thangs
I should've passed, but I was gassed, super-unleaded
And her nappy-headed ass gon' regret it, remember I said it
Cause I'm, in a sublime, new state and frame of mind
Cause it'd be a crime, for me to waste my time
My time

Before the booty had became yours?
If a nigga's sane flows, you know everything goes
Fuckin' in it til' it's colorful as rainbows
Sportin' furry Kango's, she can't go, rockin' paid shows
Paper hard to fold, plus I roll slick, keep talkin' shit
If you don't like me, it's most like-ly, cause I done holla'd at yo bitch
Why she so thick? Tellin' lies and ya said to be believin' 'em
But I make her feel like ""Uh-huh"", can you do it? ""Uh-huh""
But when I scoop her up, she know that I'm the one to make a slut-cum
Gotta man, he a lame anyway, mother-fuck that stuff
Mad cause I snuck that love, baby don't bust that slug
So go on head roll up that bud, so we can fuck
So wassup? Now we in the Suburb', submerged, watch a movie
Or bumpin' U-G, K shit, scoop a bitch or hit the booty
How the man, yea I knew g, but she don't usually, say shit
Cause the pussy make a motherfucka' wanna ball up and cry
Chicka-pow-pow, I love them thighs when I'm rollin' aside
I ain't gon' up and die, like the guy that we got high
Take away more than two hits, two blows
She heard my new shit, it was new clothes
New golds, carefully Herringbones, and cell-phones
But her friend home, now I'm freakin' two ho's
If ya girl be wit' me, somethin' nifty, she prob'ly wanna lick me

I find myself in a daze, sitting watching time fly on by
I tried to catch a grip, but somehow we keep moving on by
We came a long way, from playing hide-and-seek on the block
To bleeding corners on the daily, barely missing the cops
We turned to grown men, quicker than the blink of an eye
Some of us made it some of us didn't, but still we got by
What about the good times, ain't too many but I remember
Stadium Bowl, the rest of the clubs wouldn't let us in 'em
We was young, and plus our pants sag like Dubs
But we ain't care, cause half of the parking lot knew who we was
We came from riding on a bike, and graduated to a Houpe
Six deep with a grey cassette, trying to swang banging Screw
That was the days, but now we only riding with guns
Only understanding I got, is multiplying my funds
And moving slow in a drop, pass bops so grimey
Missing better days, hoping they could come and find me

[Hook]
I remember, being kids on the block
Pennies and my nickels, soon turned to a knot
I went from playing tag, to me running from the cops
Went from Tunker Toys, me swanging in a drop
Flying pass bops
I remember, being kids on the block
Pennies and my nickels, soon turned to a knot
I went from shooting water, to me loading up a glock
I came from the gutter, trying to make it to the top
Shit don't stop

I remember kicking it, with my niggaz in Middle School
In the hall full time, fuck class and all the rules
Late night, I was with the O.G.'s on the block
Curfew broke, but I was trying to stack me a knot
With my nigga Raw-C, Nick and the T-Head
Can't forget about the J2, and blocks we bled
Playing tackle football, while we on the concrete
In the house, imitating everybody we can beat
From the West to the North, with my nigga Pyrex
On the hunt for some bops, roaming through the projects
When I turned 16, Trae bought me a car
Four 15's, so the hood know who we are
Jay walking, so you know I'm walking it fly
T-shirt creased up, fuck a suit and a tie
Them was the days, I'll probably never see him again
So my main focus now, is for me stacking my ends

[Boss]
I was raised back in the 80's, I can tell ya bout the Smurfs
We was kids, we done traded our nurse for hard work
I can go back in the day, to playing get like me
In the hood looking for trouble, can you hit like me
I was a youngster in the street life, bailing through the street lights
First pair of G-Nike's, ask a nigga what that G like
I remember playing curve ball, and soccer
They got most of my homies chained up, in 5-by-7 lockers
The days ain't the same, in '79
Nigga was cool in '94, but now everybody walk in a shady line
25 years of keeping it real, wasn't hard for me
Living for the moment, to hit the gates for the Lord to see

I done came a long way, from cutting class
No more ducking hall monitors, now the FED's on my ass
Grown man shit Joseph Wayne McVey, I never thought I would say
That a state jail or prison, is a place I'd have to stay
I remember Saturday morning, cartoons and basketball
Half of the niggaz I was hooping with, in a casket y'all
The streets, is a graveyard
187's every second, please watch over my days Lord
I'm nothing but a Christian, I'm down with Jehovah
But this day in time, you ain't gon make it if you ain't a soldier
So God forgive me because I'm strapped, somebody might try to do me
The real world ain't like my block, this shit it like a movie
Make me wanna travel back in time, like Michael J. Fox
To when all my people was living, and it was love on the block
But ain't nothing but the future, bout to take place
It'll never be 1989 again, so nigga fuck friends

Pimp C P.A. Trill nigga
Polo fuck that Hilfiger
Made myself a ghetto star
On the slab, sippin' barre
Smokin' weed, sellin' white
Them other niggas shit don't come back right
That's how niggas get popped
Trying to get the cheaper price
Watch yo' paper, guard your life
Cause most these niggaz ain't livin' right
Keep yo' pistol, fuck a fight
Cause niggas out here jack every night

I never pull up in nothin' less than a four
And I smoke cigars, it ain't just for the show
I'm blessed from the do', and known for my stidile
I send a nigga baby mamma home with a smidile
You can have the bitch nigga, I ain't sentimental
Smoke weed and freestyle, no instrumental
Been out, lived through the wicked streets of P.A.

Head to the H, where the hoes will fuck three way
Two way, four way, anyway the Pro say
Never hear a hoe say no I won't, no I can't
Stop it and no I don't

Stay up in the club, let em know we still paid (still paid)
Reppin' for the Nouf from the cradle to the grave (huh)

Like a dummy when he peeing I'm a fool with the flow

[Chorus]

Haha, I can't stop I gotta make my nigga Pimp proud (R.I.P.)

Don't know how to act, we goin fuck the club up (club up)
We just like em so the gangstas niggas love us (cheah)

Z-Ro,"Hey son? 

Hey dad

Son who's your favorite rapper and who's your favorite rap group? 

You are 'cause you the real ice cream man and my favorite rap group is T.R.U. 
'Cause I'm true 2 da game, aha
I'm true 2 da game too son. You did your homework?
You got any studying to do? 

Yea dad. Studying this just how to be a true playa
Wanna ask me some questions? 

Yea son. Let me see this
Oh they didn't have questions like this when I grew up son
But I guess whatever 

It takes to make you be a man son. I'm all for it
Son, the first question is, if you rap about another 

Rapper on a record, what are you? 

You a sucka! 

Aha, you got that right son. Next question
If you hate another for being successful, what are you? 

You mean like, you rollin' in Benzes, they be like P.H.ing you 
The pigs be pulling you over cause you 

Be black and you be sittin' on triple gold
Like the niggas in the ghetto be hatin' on you cause you made it out? 

Yea son, what is that, what you call that? 
Dad, that only be two words. PLAYA HATA 

Huh, you got that right son. Look like you gonna past this test
But I got one more question for you
Son, if any man depends on another man and can't think on his own
Can't survive on his own, can't take good care of his 

Family, you know what I mean son
I mean, you were put in this world by yourself
You're supposed to depend on you 

And nobody else. I mean son
When a man can't function on his own and put his problems on another man
son, what type of man is that? What do you call that type of person? 

Dad, can I curse? 
Son, if you have to express yourself. Tell me, what type of man is that? 
That a punk ass bitch 

Hehehe, damn little P, you bout it, bout it, just like your daddy
Oh wait, one more question before I leave though 

What you want to be when you grow up? 
I want to be a G like you. A No Limit Soldier for life
Fuck you hatas, 'cause we have millions.",Intro [S.L.A.B.E.D.],2006
Z-Ro,"Say some people call me the Crooked, cause my mind ain't straight
Leave niggaz leaning to the side, like they need a V8
I tried to be a changed man, but my plan ain't play
Haters forced me, to put a gun back in my hand and spray
Was already dealing with, a bunch of those hoe ass niggaz
Niggaz-niggaz, hated by mo' bitch ass niggaz
Took a fall, got arrested then you bitches got bold
What you thought I wasn't coming back, to bomb on you hoes
I heard the rumors for myself, Z-Ro signed for ten
Here I am, it ain't safe to come outside again
For the record, fuck everybody I ain't got no friend
Nigga remember how you treated Ro, when Ro had no ends
That explain when you see me, why I reach in my pants
Pull out my pistol, let a fade nigga straight bleed in they ass
Yeah I'm back and let it be known, Z-Ro done made it home
Fuck with me I empty out my clip, reload and keep on

[Hook: x2]
Keep on, and I won't stop
Fuck with me, I promise I'ma make your breathing stop
I keep on, with my glock cocked
Living on the edge till I'm dead, screaming fuck the cops

[Z-Ro:]
Fresh out of jail, mayn
You niggaz, done fucked up now
Came back, to get my mail mayn
Playa don't make me, buck you down
I'm the King of Da Ghetto
And I'm here, to reclaim my throne
In a relationship, with a chick 4-4
And nigga my bitch, be blazing domes
If y'all fellas, wanna play game
I'm dumping, on every car I see
It's that time, when I play mayn
Brace yourself, R.I.P.

[Hook x2]

[Z-Ro:]
It's reprocussions, when you niggaz press my buttons too hard
Then I become a saint, by bringing you niggaz closer to God
Love nothing and slug something, everytime I breathe
Murder on my enemies, I'm the reason they families grieve
Please O.G. gorilla, original girl gone on
'Fore I beat your bitch ass, without ever hanging up my phone
Cause when I get wired up, niggaz get tied up
It be nothing but yellow tape, everytime I r-ride up
T-Ray, we use to be cool and kick it and thang
Understand you was in prison, and missing the game
Understand me when I tell you, if you cross me you could die
Might as well be a pigeon, cause your spirit fin to fly
If you wasn't on ""Keep on Watching Me"", you ain't a Guerilla
Trying to imitate a gangsta, that's when a gangsta come get ya
Run and telling toy soldiers in your army, the war's on
Catch em one by one and dump my gun, they cease to keep on what
",Keep On,2006
Z-Ro,"24/7, I'm in trouble for nothing
To the laws on the topic, of they daily discussion
Blood pumping and rushing, I gotta struggle to survive
I be rapping but I can do with a nine to five

Long as it be legal, I be willin' to try
All I need is a pair of wings, I be willing to fly
Trying to get a piece of the pie and ain't I taking I work for it
I be doing right, but I'm being punished on earth for it

What else can I do, to make it on this scene?
Seem like whatever I do, will get me up in prison
Never see me on the corner, never caught me with crack
Got a dream of leaving the ghetto and ain't coming back

Homicide detectives trying to threaten me with some time
Only thing I ever murdered, was college ruled lines
It's a patent punishment, in America's design
Arrested and incarcerated for other peoples crimes, it's so amazing

Oh, sometime, one time, stereotype me
Jewelry, jewelry and gold teeth
They swear, swear, I've got to be running drugs
But I am just a, just a man

Trying to stay Satan free
Through hell is where they're taking me
I swore, so amazing, to be a thug
A true, true hero under God's sight, from above

Everyday, everyday I see my people in poverty
And when I say my people, I mean everybody I see
And no discrimination, on Caucasian or Asian
Or Mexican, Samoan, lesbians or the gay men

Everybody got a day to die and they won't miss it
Better be ready for company when death come visit
Man, I wish Adam and Eve, wouldn't been in the garden
Now, the devil swinging at me, got me weaving and bobbing

Homies are being murdered by lieutenants to sergeants
Like weez, we uprooted just as soon we harvest
Searching for sunshines, suffocated by darkness
Looking for Gods, in the God's heavenly fortress

They tell me when I make it, there'll be no more pain
Ain't gotta be nervous, about somebody knowing your name
Everybody is your family, it's love around you
Even on earth, God is your upper when people down you so amazing

Am I cursed, while on this earth
'Cause I can't find, better days
But still, I give the Lord praise
Even though, though, these pirates request my blood

But I am just a, just a man, tryin' to, tryin' to stay Satan free
Through hell is where they're taking me
I swore, it's so amazing, to be a thug
A true, true hero under God's sight, from above

The weight of, weight of my stress is like a fifty ton boulder
Making my head heavy, can't be lifted by my shoulders
No wonder why my head down, I be thinking too hard
And be smoking like a tail pipe and drinking too hard

I decided to give it up and give it to God
Instead of living in the world, I'ma live in the Lord
Gave up cussing this time while I'm spitting my bars
With a vision of me in prison that vision is fraud

Investigators cookin', cookin' the case, cookin' too hard
I know they know, I didn't do it 'cause they looking for Claude
Nobody hollin' at me, got me feeling like an outlaw
Had a case against a brother but I broke it apart

No weapon formed against me shall prosper, if it's written
Even though machetes be cutting and guns be spitting
I got a Satan proof vest on, stopping the devil head on
With Jesus I'ma stop him but that's some'ing you can bet on, amazing

Oh, sometime, one, one time, stereotype me
The jewelry and gold teeth
Swear, swear, I've got to be running drugs

But I am just a, just a man, trying to stay Satan free
Through hell is where they're taking me
I swore, it's so amazing, to be a thug
A true, true hero under God's sight, from above

Z-Ro,"[Intro:]
If you love living your life, leave me alone
I live the life, I sing about in my song
They hate me unitl I'm gone, they hate
They hate me until I'm gone, if you love living your life, leave me alone

[Z-Ro:]
Fuck everybody lately, cause it was fuck me first
What's the reason for the season, of wanting to see me in a hearse
It really don't matter, because I ride or die for me
Even if they kill me, there's happiness in the sky for me
So if it's death around the corner, I can't stop it if I wanna
Jesus just let me empty my tip, and hit my marijuana
Yeah I seen it coming, nobody gon catch me off guard
Make em look me in my eye, before they break me off Lord
Excuse my attitude, but I'm use to negativity
My life explains my fuck everybody, on each delivery
Some say it's the drugs, others say it's a lack of love
It ain't gotta be a reason, crazy simply just because
Everyday of my life, has been a struggle and pain
So I perform with no emotion, no further need to explain
If you love living your life, leave me alone
Fuck rap, I live the life I sing about in my song

[Hook:]
Fuck rap, I live the life I sing about in my song
Nobody in the world loves me, they hate me until I'm gone
(what's going on), realizing I'm going crazy
Everybody watching me suffer, but won't nobody save me
This can't be life, I promise the world ain't shit
I never knew I'd lose my mind, and end up like this
Cause all I think is murder, realizing I'm going crazy
Wait till they get a load of me, it's fuck everybody lately

[Z-Ro:]
In my '73, rolling on top of the trails
Let down my window, and let my pistol excel
Disrespect me, revenge gon represent me like a thief in the night
So prepare, for permanent sleep in you life
I'm still a Christian on a mission, but my vision ain't clear
Looking for peace, but all I see is drama down here
So when the going gets tough, the tough pull the team together
Who ride, and get rid of our enemies together
But if you live by the sword, then you die by it
So when it's time for me to go, it ain't no need to cry about it
Cause I done done my share, of wrong doing
Exaturated resolvable situations, and left some homes ruined
Even niggaz, that call themselves friends
They'll be first to try to rob me, and then do me in
So if you love living your life, leave me alone
Fuck rap, I live the life I sing about in my song

[Hook]

[Z-Ro:]
(what's going on), realizing I'm on the edge
My every thought is aggravated assault, and get my bread
For the love of money, motherfuckers disappear
That's the very reason, Joseph McVey keep his pistol near
Come and get me, so you can put your hands on my riches
The only alliby I need to squeeze it, and ain't digging ditches
But if I gotta, kiss my freedom goodbye
I tongue kiss my ten millimeter, cause she didn't let me die
That's a down ass bitch, mayn
Unlike my friends, cause just to get some ends they ten to spit names
24/7-365, nobody at my side
They might hit me up, before they help me hide
So I roll by myself, or I roll with Trae
A.B.N. for life, focused on making the world pay
If you love living your life, leave me alone
Fuck rap, I live the life I sing about in my song

Z-Ro,"It's somethin goin on and I don't know if it's my fire from the block
Off the top I know it's somethin wrong
And I don't know who to trust so I gotta keep my glock
That'll flock tellin everybody move along
Shit everything ain't what it seem
Even the niggaz that I love to death shiest cause they playin for they own
Team
And I be wantin to try and do 'em some harm
Instead of leavin 'em to suffer, I extended my arm
Yeah I'm still runnin with the same ol'gang
No matter where a nigga run it's still the same ol'pain
Same cloud, same night, with the same ol'rain
Same heart still standin like I'm hard as a train and that's game
I thought this shit was too good to be true
Niggaz hate the fact that I made it and still come back through
But either way they still know where it's at
Niggaz hate it cause they hate me, and I'm showin it back

(I can feel it in the air)
I can feel it in the air
(I can feel it in the air)
Ooooh Oooh-I can feel it in the air
Ahhh yeah
(I can feel it in the air)

And I don't know what it is but if I'm patient for somethin'
Them niggaz not they two time me they bound to show what it is
I swear they hate like a ounce of dro
Too strong with a stence so I'm bout to blow
But if they want me then it's fine
I gotta baby brother that's still around that's gon be representin' mine
(Fuh real)
I know my son gon be okay T Jones, and Boss
And the rest of the click they gon see okay
And I can feel it in the air

Like my niggaz feelin' plex and I can see it in they stare
But they don't step in the square
So I assume they wanna stick me in my back
That ain't G them niggaz need to get it how they pack (they sheist)
Don't even bother cause I'm deaf when it come to y'all
Don't even act like we cool-don't try to speak at all
I should've seen it when my auntie said slow it down
'Cause it's a year later with too many fakers around

[Chorus]

I guess they mad at me who'da ever thought
My life I'd have 'em lookin bad at me
Nothin but love and that's a damn shame that's why I click
'Cause ain't nobody got a nigga back
Matter of fact if I lose I bet they move quick
The same ones who accept my help
Don't give a damn about the pain I felt unless it boost they wealth
But I'm a true solider quiet is kept
You know it's death before even if I get swept
Damn why the hood ain't made of G's
Because if it was then these cowards wouldn't be able to breathe
If it was then these cowards wouldn't be able to leave
Haters worse then a disease that's what I believe
I know my real niggaz feel my tone
If you ain't ninety-nine plus you ain't in my zone
Better feel a nigga vibe if I'm flippin' alone
'Cause I'm aware of my surroundings even if I'm at home

I use to watch you on stage gettin'money, lookin lovely
Got these niggaz offerin they pockets tippin you twenties
'cause you cold with that shit that you do...ya mood shocked me
Unlike these other hoes in ya crew you don't jock me
I'd like to get ya phone number just to see what you about
Call you for breakfast to get you out
And see if you just some eyes without a face
Let me see ya crib - take me to ya place
I wanna show you that it's mo'to me then fuckin on my mind
'cause in yo mind I bet you fuckin all the time
Come to find you only out tryin to go to school
And tryna go to school and pay bills is hard to do
I see you fool so go on and do ya thing
But when you tired of showin ya titties give me a ring
I like a woman gettin hers cause that's better
Then her tryna come up off mine I can't let her

[Chorus - Bun be sampled]
Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke [Repeat 4x]

[Verse 2 - Z-Ro]
Go on and let a nigga peak, go on and let a nigga poke
Give me some assistance as I manuver my long stroke
I hope you don't think I'm payin'for it that's the wrong hope
'Cause I know you wanna be Z'Rollin over chrome spokes
Bitch I know you wanna tell ya girlfriends how it was
To get hit from the back, in the back of the 'Lac by a thug
And to get ran through until you get carpet burns off the rug
And to get nutted on by nine niggaz with diamond grills and guns
And how you got on my microphone and sung a sixteen
Ya performance deserves a grammy check out my big screen
Most bitches don't know but you know what suckin a dick mean
Yeah the head was fed but what up with that in them jeans
I can see the pussy (?)lookin like a big bee
Make ya cycle start early my shovel be diggin deep
I don't wanna relationship, I just want me some relations
Go on and let a nigga poke hoe, and stop shuckin with my patience

[Chorus - Bun be sampled]
Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke [Repeat 4x]

[Verse 3 - Pimp C]
Bitch get down on me at the drop of a dime
Fuck all that are & be singin shit I ain't got the time
I'd rather bust yo'ass up with some screwed and chopped
Let me test ya jaws and let me stretch out ya cotton
I'm still Pimp see bitch, the name ain't changed
Puttin stick up in these hoes don't remember they name
'cause we tired of playin games with them booty lickers
'cause we jumped up in ya life, cause I'm a true dirt digger
So go on hit the streets, break them lame tricks
Then bring it back to daddy that's how you can get this dick
I need the cash first - and the ass last
And we can blow dro in the Benz while I smash on the gas
So let a nigga pimp, and let a nigga mack
And later on tonight you can get hit up in ya back...and get ya money back
But when I make ya pussy skeet bitch you gon'buy me a 'Lac

[Chorus - Bun be sampled]
Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke [Repeat 4x]

[Verse 4 - Juvenile]
I ain't tryna talk a hole in yo head
But I can tell you didn't excel what them hoes done said
Starrin at my neck and my wrist 'cause my shit is frozen red
And I look like a easy hustler so go ahead
Ya leavin the same way ya met me
You gon'be grievin if you sex me, while I'm schemin on the next piece
I'll poke ya cookie I don't give a fuck who know this
Who up in the area that aknowledge what a hoe is
All my warriors is lovin my rep
How I took it to the world from the project steps
Playin touch with my broad like my children
And it ain't like back in the days when we ducked behind buildings
I be a threat to tell a broad what I'm feeling
Especially if she poor and she need to be gettin no bullshittin
She ever fix her mouth for some money it's good with me
I ain't the one what you need is a stool pigeon

[Chorus - Bun be sampled]
Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke [Repeat 4x]

[Verse 5 - Petey Pablo]
If you think I'm a treat a bitch with high price drawls
Any differance then the way I treat the grandma's on
How many ways is there to say that you terribly wrong
Would you understand me better if I just said ""naw""
Fuck what another motherfucker told y'all
That's tipical talk when they dick hard
They just wanna little pussy mama that's all
It's like fourth down, two yards fuck it they goin for it
How am I payin'for it?, and how much you charge for it?
It ain't about being a whore that's what it's made for
Get ya paper baby fuck what the world say
Get ya bills paid....okay!

[Chorus - Bun be Sampled]
Go on and let a nigga peak, and let a nigga poke
Go on get naked for me streak, and let a nigga stroke

Yeah, now if you rollin' with me come now
I'm a gangsta I'll never put my gun down
I can't drive, girl, 'cause I'm high
I see ya belly ring plus you got a butterfly

Twenty eights when I roll out
Ten clear coats on my gold drop
What's yo name? Where you from, girl?
I got a presidential suite, you can come, girl

I got Cris by the case load
What the hell, ya ,baby, daddy in my face for?
Now I'm reachin' for my waist so

I'm feelin' ya style and ya classy ways
I want my child in ya stomach but not havin' my baby

And after this night I'm a dump you like a trash can

And all three of 'em ringin' from bad ass bitches that wanna bone
Take one or two calls, take one to the telly and take one home
Cuttin' corners barely missin' the curb, tryin' not to break her bone

I'm sittin' on choppa eighty-threes and fresh ass meat
A nigga tried to jack me for 'em so I opened up his chest last week
I'm rude as a mothafucker but I get nice when I receive head
Might fall off for a minute but I get back right when I receive bread

Talk up on somethin' short and thick, go straight to the bed with it
But on the low, low 'cause someones always watchin' like a Fed visit
Crucify the coochie then cut a couple of corners
Cruisin' with me in the Bentley soon as I borrow ya

Z-Ro,"Don't come around my way, cause I don't need a
'Nother fat weather friend, with a trick up his sleeve
Acting like you really my nigga, but he after my cheese
Y'all niggaz get me congested, move around and let me breathe
I remember when you niggaz, ain't want me to hit the weed
Now that I'm rapping, you see me and tell me to hit the weed
Thinking you can get a VIP pass, and get in free
But Joseph McVey, is enough company for me
Wanna kick it with me, cause I kick it with the high class
Y'all didn't wanna kick it, when I was down on my ass
In my cordoroy britches, y'all was in Louis Vatone
Laughing and pointing at a nigga, trying to ruin my fun
For using the millennium, or money by the ton
You niggaz ain't help me get it, I did it with no one
Fuck showing love back, I ain't showing none (y'all niggaz don't have to)
Come to none of my shows, or buy none of my tapes
'Cause who the hell should I support, I'ma still be straight
The less niggaz around me, the better I can concentrate
When I came face straight, or open up my chest plate
It could be ya death date, get beside yourself
We ain't cool, I think you better rewind yourself
Before a cemetery, be where you can find yourself
So beat your feet, and let the do' close behind yourself
I don't need no friend, I don't need no broad
Only thing I need, is the help of the good Lord
Trying to kick it, but motherfuckers sing to hard
'Cause I'ma be keeping it real, they gon be keeping it fraud
A hundred and fifty-two percent, are real with me
So instead of keeping my niggaz, get the steel with me
I can do bad one deep, so I chill with heat (fuck y'all niggaz)

I don't need no help my nigga, I can do bad on my own
And I don't need no company lil' mama, stop ringing my cellular phone
When I be down and out, nobody wanna come and kick it
I'm a nobody, until I can shine
So when my money is long, I don't need nobody to visit
Leave me lonely, like you did last time

I'm a asshole, and I ain't trying to be rude
But I don't really give a damn, about none of y'all
You use to hate a nigga tough, from way back in the day
First off, fuck each and every one of y'all
I be a loner on my own, alone hang with my chrome
These motherfuckers play, life so fraud
I peep game, to the T
'Cause I don't want nobody, to catch a nigga slipping on the Boulevard
And on the other hand, just to make matters worse
I feel, they want me headed to the grave
And I ain't ready to leave, I got my back planted against the wall
With a nine, about to misbehave
Same old shit, with a friend or a foe
Pack your shit, and get the fuck out the do'
Ain't no way, you hoes finna be a part of my life
A.B.N, is all that I know
You can try what you wanna, but I ain't gon fail
Look at me now, and all the shit that I sell
I'ma beat a nigga trunk off, coast to coast
And everybody who doubt that, can go to hell
Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong
And I don't give a fuck, cause I'm in my zone
All that hate you got, it only make a nigga strong
So I like how it feel, when I'm left all alone

So when my money is long, I don't need nobody to visit
Leave me lonely, like you did last time

You must of thought I forgot, when I was stuck on the block
And I was broke, everybody laughed a lot
And now the tables have turned, you niggaz fraud
And you know see Trae, with his foot up on the gas a lot
'Cause I don't trust you niggaz
Give me fifty feet, 'fore I rush you niggaz
Move it around, cause I don't fuck with you niggaz
To tell the truth, I'm allergic to you niggaz
Asshole for life, until a nigga fly
Nigga don't stop, better go on pass by
And hoes, don't call my cellular phone
The only thing, that y'all know how to do is lie

Why y'all niggaz wanna rob wanna steal, that ain't real
How the fuck I'ma kick it with you, you ain't gon get me killed
I done seen a lot of blood, on the battlefield
Even though I'm tired, I be climbing up the ladder still
Ain't nobody words gon hurt me, even if they dessert me
I'ma still be grubbing, and drink a drink when I'm thirsty
Just to be in my position, motherfuckers ain't worthy
So they feminine conversations, don't even disturb me
I'm a gangsta, don't need another nigga to grade me
If I'm in trouble, don't need nobody to save me
Steady losing composure, like my kon folk Trae be
I'ma handle my bidness, ain't nobody else made me

Matter of fact you got me hoping this relationship can last
Ask no questions cause I feel like I been granted my wish(granted my wish)
Been a long time since a brother felt like this (felt like this)
I'm not going to the club tonight I'm staying home
Me and my woman some Isley Brothers and sip this Patron
My homies they be laughin' at me telling me that I'm sprung
But I'm in the zone when it comes to lil mama cause she the one
What I really love about her she don't even need a man
But she follow my lead and respect the fact I wear the pants
And I got no problem hullin' myself cause she my queen
Half the time I spoil her half the time I'm tryin' to get her out her jeans
Z-ro still a gangsta he never been a romantic
He spends most of his time with semi and fully automatics
Although my baby been givin' me reasons to leave the streets
So instead of shootin' up the block I'm a take baby out to eat

Cause she my baby girl
I'm used to the wrong woman
Now I got my own woman

I don't ever want this to end.

She don't ever have to worry if I'm cheating
I'm on the way home to give that bottom a beating
Even though I'm what they call a rap singer
With business to handle I got time to Carat 
My woman neck and her finger (Yea it's that deep)
She there for me when life get hard for me
And if I get busted she willing to take the charge for me
But I can't see her with handcuffs on for me
Soon as they fingerprint
She go be there with my bond money
Feelin' like Martin Luther King Free at Last
I hate you bitch is a thing of the past
Not totally though I still got up a couple walls
But on the other hand I be feeing for her phone calls
And I'll be mad if I don't get it
I ain't to gangsta to admit it
So don't play with me when I'm stressing
I'll take yo shit and split it
Hell naw she ain't no hoe She my old lady
The one that's go gave 3 or4 of Z-ro's babies

And that lingerie she be wearin' be keeping the mood steady
Lord Heaven must have got robbed cause an Angel is gone
I'm guilty as charged Lord cause she all up in my home
Just let me keep her I'll protect her from the whole universe
I'll say I do in sickness and in health for better or worse
I'm a still kick it with all four homies alive
When I'm not in Europe letting baby shop until she drop
I'm the King and what good is a Queen if she can't rule with ya
Get out there like one of the homies and act a fool with ya
What's mine is hers she ain't gotta borrow nothing
Watch I'll buy her a beauty shop and a foreign car or something
And what's hers is mine. All I want is her heart
And of Course that secret hidden treasure when her legs come apart
And if I was to ever fall off my game she wouldn't leave me
She'd help me get back on my feet and back on my change!

Instead of my partner's helping me I was what they were laughing at
Can't approach the girl of your dreams with pro-wiens and wragger jeans
So wife five-four shirt with the collar, plus no dollar
It's been a long time since I slept outside, next door to my daddy house
Back then Darrell Louis would smack they Junior in my daddy house
I'm not trippin' I'm actually glad that they turned there backs on me
Fuck family and fuck friends too, It's just me and my strap homie
Yeah I was that nerd nigga yesterday the day I rapped homie
A pocket full of pencils but came a pistol in my lap homie
I was voted most likely to become a teacher
Everybody class is in session put'cha ears up and a mirror speaker

My decoration is candy coats and super posts

My mind frame is go get it with no excuse
If all that crying though help me, then tell me what's the use?
My hustle schedule is all night and all day
If there some paper to be made, then I'm on the way
My daily routine is stacking chains and hitting licks
I use my with stick go get it and stack them chips
The haters bumping they lips to try to throw me off
But my eyes on the green like I was playing golf

Never spend any of it on pussy, I'm a real player
Early birds get the worm, I'm up when the cock crows

I ain't going back behind the fences with the razors

Haters wanna see me fallin' off of my game
They hatin' cause when they see me I'm havin' thangs
Dig these blues, if you jack me, I'm jacking you back
24/7 on my clothes, I keep my hand on my strap

See I'm somethin' like a playa, somethin' like a pimp
Gangsta strut on when when I limp like this
Is re-turn of rapper slash the hood fella
Lookin' for a rap to get my groove back like Stella
Still got a sack of that A-1 good yella

My flow is a young Mike Tyson I put the hit on niggas
And even when I'm countin' off I still spit on niggaz
No super friends I smoke purple stuff alone in my room
That cush made me leave my body I was gone in my room
Mad swangas, to mo no blocks, I switch cars like socks
Either it's somethin' with the roof missin', or a hard white top

Remember me, I'm the one they laughed at in all my classes
Now what they spend on a house I blow on designer glasses
Even without a platinum plaque, this ain't cappin',
I'm just tellin' you what my life like, so this ain't rappin'
Don't you ever tell the captain, that my money ain't right
I'm a have to pay money, to spray money, cause money ain't right
No more throwin' no bodies, so I can stand on these streets
I got an army behind me, cause I'm the man on these streets

I did some time locked down, but now I'm back on these streets
Here to save ya'll from all this wack rap on these streets
I left ya'll with I'm still livin, provin' I wasn't dead
If you wonder why I'm out early, my lawyer got his bread
Much love to my industry homies, who didn't forget about me

But since I do business with Rap A Lot the feds watch me
But I'm like Shaq up under the backboards you can't stop me

I'm a hitman, whatever I'm aimin' at I hit man
After I hit her she can't stand up without a kickstand
Not a special kind of fool, just hit her with the mule
If she find the itch to set me up, I'll hit her with the tool

Watchin' the OG's in the hood while they flossin' in they rides
Candy paint, chrome wheels, and black magic on the attire
Me, yeah I was lovin' it, but not old enough drive
Parkin' lot pimpin' from the passenger side
I use to walk everywhere I had to show up
Shoe hills, one down like wheel rubber, man I was about to go nuts
Hopefully I would blow up in these rap game man
My people roll swanga's, I wanted to be rollin' the same thang
Never had alot of work, but I was doin' what I could
Movin' nickles, dimes, twenty's, and ounces all threw my hood
Since I had a one yolla fines cash me up
Mean while thumpin' for a ride my homies pass me up
It's all gravy, when I'm able I'm a showin' all somthin'
From a hopte to a foreign, I'm ballin' it's all or nothin'
Treat my feet with' designer to fine sneak's when I leave my home
Only place you catch me walkin' is to my mail box's
Cause on the streets I be on crome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rollin' chrome

Huh, I started off with' a canary yellow cutlass supreme on bald tire's
Yeah I know I was out of line
But that was all I could find
Or should I say that was all I could purchase for what I had to spend
But at least I had somthin' to go from point A to B and
No more offerin' gas money to get a lift
Besides when your driven it's easyer to get a chick
So ani't no more parkin' lot pimpin' at the club I'm up in there
Seekin' little mama, with' thick thighs, I hope she let me in there
Like swim wear, pull up to the motel, and we'll go in there
Nothin' left to do but comit a sin there
And that was in my hopte, but when I show up in my big body with' the gloss
All of the boppers was boppin' I just could'nt shake'm off
Sixteen switches, tewnty-two inches, trunk goin' to war
They don't want to lay here with me, they want to lay in my car
I was lovin' it back then and still love it today
Except I'm not yellow cutlase no more, I'm 300 blue over gray, on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rolin chrome

Finally I'm in the mix, ridin' twenty four's or twenty six
My neck and my wrist lite, with' out me sellin' a brick
Tv's in the roof and the dashboard and I'm watchin' a flick
Rollin' with my pistol in my lap and I'm cockin' if
I spy somethin' suspicious in my rear view mirror when I'm creepin'
If you plan on jackin' me I plan on leavin' you sleepin'
I be in different vehicle cause I'm havin' thangs
King of the ghetto entertainment got me havin' change
You can smell it on me, even tho quite, the way I live it be tellin' on me
Don't get twisted I'm still a felon homie
Thinkin' you goin' to rob me that's a N O
And when I'm in N O I roll with god and as always Mr.Marsello
And they be with me when they in Texas don't par take it as a spy
Harlum nights in stores where they drop it like it's hot
So if your tryin' to call me and I don't answer my phone
I can't hear it cause my music to loud I'm bangin' on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)

Z-Ro,"God Damn
When will a nigga get a brake
I work so damn hard but I never come up I do worse with ever breath I take
Sunshine is a luxury
Just to see another day is enough for me
Cause I'm livin' on borrowed time
Every school I go to it might be mine it might be mine
God Damn, I'm trying to hold on to my faith
They use to tell me it was going to get greater later later
Now it's later and I'm still I'm the same place
Anytime I get off the ground
Some crooked ass niggas pull me back down
Bald fade on my fade
Feeling helpless and it's written all over my face

Here we go again just to live another season
I keep my faith in god to peace these demons
Sometimes I win the battle it doesn't mean I win the war
I got to laugh to keep from crying good times I really wonder what they are

Even if I fell there's no reason to feel ashamed
Cause I use to lose I had an opportunity to play in the game
I can't be stopped 98 percent from the field
But they won't pass the rock
Even tho I'm wide open for the shot
Got me ready to scream fuck my team
Seem like the players I'm running with don't want me to touch my dream
With my own hands I'm tired of making money in the name of brothers
I'm trying to touch it with my own hands
Make me wanna rob a bank sometimes
But then I have to spend my life my life my life my life
Dunken one time
And end up back in the pen
So I'm stuck as starter paid as if I was ridin' a Benz
I know it look like I rich but it's not
I just how to take what I got and wipe it so it looks like a lot
Sometimes I wanna give up but when I look at my daughter
I got to survive

Here we go again just to live another season
I keep my faith in god to peace these demons
Sometimes I win the battle it doesn't mean I win the war
I got to laugh to keep from crying good times I really wonder what they are

To many niggas trying to take me off of my game
I'm trying to do something good but because I'm from the hood I always end up in these chains
When you see me in the town you ain't got to slow down I'm in love with my own company
Foney homies see me on the TV and I can see them coming to get me in my sleep
That's why I'm staying sucker free
Cause dealing with hard times is enough for me
I don't need no help my nigga I can do bad on my own
I'm so tried tried tried tried
I'm so tried tried tried tried
But I'm a keep on pushing

Here we go again just to live another season
I keep my faith in god to peace these demons
Sometimes I win the battle it doesn't mean I win the war

Z-Ro,"[Young Malice]
Where I'm from?
Killers go dumb
Usually deatch is the outcome
Welcome to the jungle
Where kidnappers hunt you
The streets they really want you
Serious
No smile on this block gives answers gets per curious
Good times disappears quickly back into a mist
Shoot I hardly ever miss
That means I'm accurate
Crack the pitch
Then pretty soon I have to switch
Scratching the itch with paper cuts on my index
The real riders shoot up blocks and screams ""who next?""
Like my nigga 2-Tech he totes 2-techs.
It been a beef before in Houston they called it ""plex""
They got to know the protocol 
I'm warning y'all
It gets deep
So deep the prison guards will put you to sleep
Rest eternally
No coming back
You OD'd
Overdose
This neighborhood got me comatose
Back up against the wall another statistic I know

[Chorus Z-Ro]
The streets always been my daddy
And mommy is the colleges
I'm a soldier and I'm about my mail
If I get busted I'm not about to tell
Because I'm a gangster
The streets always been my daddy
And mommy is the colleges
I'm a solider and I'm about my mail
I ain't trying to do right because I'm already living in hell
Because I'm a gangster

[Will Hen]
The gas prices are too high
Pay raises too low
I'm better off in the game flippin kicks like Judo
Or out somewhere pimpin getting money by the two hoes
That's why I'm in the lab with The Product spittin new flows
Feds watchin my hood entirely too much gunplay
Neighborhood basketball star slained last Monday
Raided the neighborhood kingpin last Tuesday
If this was going on in your neighborhood what would you say?
Given the opportunity to tell it to the masses
Low and middles class still carrying bus passes
Young girls giving birth before they hit the 9th grade
About to be a mom and can't even make cool-Aid
Who made this crack anyway?
Told this about this herron 
Sold us to alcohol and the guns that we care-on

[Chorus Z-Ro]

[Scarface]
It's like the ghetto got a heart and a soul
A mind of it's own
A hunger for a young cat die before he grown
A lust for a young girl sliding down the pole
She's always falling short on her goals
The street life is cold
It's either when you lose or you fold
Money is the root of all evil is what I was told
And everything that you thought you would leave there is a hoax
You put your faith in front of those demons and when the smoke clear
The truth appear
The fight for your life
The struggles of the wrong versuses right
And wrong won
The song sung
In the keys of reality 
When death crosses your path bloodshed tragically
So automatically you come to a close
And realize no matter what the key to the codes
I seen the hood swallow motherfuckers whole
Then shit them out in the system ain't never make it home
I know

Hold up (Hold Up), we jammin'

I can't let nobody hold me down-these ho's could never hold me (never hold me)
Cause I'm comin' down, playa surroundin' livin' these ho's fantasy
Cause I'm choppin' blades and playin' maze and these bitches they can't stand it (can't stand it)
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin'

Uh it's never too much the paper I make
These other pussy niggas ain't real them ho's fake
I'm Sweet James Jones when you come through bitch
I treat you good because you know I'm rich
I was in the ghetto-had nothin'
Sold a lot of records and grabbed somethin'
Now I'm goin' through movies in L.A
Playin' the game the way the hustlers play
And everyday I try to stack my grip and make three songs
I'm try'na get my mothafuckin' paper on
I want the new (bone?) and the new cell phone
I want the new two way pager and the new mansion home
In Houston cause that is my city
And them other pussy niggas they record sound shitty
When I see you in the town I'm a hit you up
You never could take my dream cause you niggas fucked up

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
I remember when I had to come up just to come down
That's the reason for my uncontrollable ballin' right now
Use to be scared to walk in the store I payed the price now
My life is to valuable for me to play with life now
Of course it's gon' be some niggas who think I done changed
They find me guility just because now I got diamonds on every thing
My mouth and my pinky ring, my wrist and my neck
I'm 'bout my business so give me my cash or give me my check
See I can biblically remember me and Trae on the block
Even more then hustlin' sometimes we had to lay on the block
Eat, sleep, shit, piss, pray on the block
To make it through the night to see another day on the block
Movin' rocks got us full pockets-plus knots in our socks
But now money be comin' in wadd's like blocks
Let's go half on a Yacht-I got the pot you got the chicken fried steak
I can't even hear you haters you've been muted by my paper chase

[Verse 3: Lil' Flip]
Who would've known that this rap shit would take me far
At 18 I had a fifty-thousand dollar car
I went from Jag to Benz but not the regular kind
Now I'm smokin' hydro not the regular pine
I spit one freestyle now I'm rockin' clubs
After ""Diamonds N Yo Face"" I was coppin' dubs
I had to make the transition from a boy to a man
So if you wanna 16 that's forty-grand
Rappers talk a lot of shit but you ain't stoppin' us
Look you don't wanna bump heads with a mafia (Huh)
Look you don't know shit about UGK
Or Mr. Fat Pat and Grey Screw tapes
I rep the Screwed Up Click peep the watch I'm wearin'
I'm the first cat in Houston with a black Meclaron
Lil' Flipper tote pistols for them none believers
Cause down here we poppin' trunks on Cadillacs and Regals (Oh boy)

[Pimp C:]
Uh! A lotta' shit done changed, dope man since you been gone
I did a whole lotta' good, I did a lotta' wrong
I made a whole lotta' change, I wrote a lotta' songs
Sometimes I felt weak, most times I stood up strong
Yeah I got three kids now, Natasha had a son
We ain't together no more, I guess we was just too young
To even try to start a family in the first place
But I get happy every time I look into his face
Ever since you went away, man it's been hard for me
Didn't know till you died, how much you meant to me
All the time and the patience you put into me
You showed me how to be the man that I was meant to be
Taught me how to play music and 'bout the melody
And to this day, I remember what you was tellin' me
You told me, ""Son, most of this rap shit is just noise""
""But if you put some music in it, you'll get rich boy""
That's why I stay up in the studio, up all night
I fuck with live musicians to get the groove right
Yeah I'ma rap star now, yeah you could say that
'Cause now my walls is filled with gold and grey plaques
Doin' shows and videos and makin' big stacks
But if it would bring you back I would trade all that
I wanna thank ya for everything that you did for me
I'm on my knees praying to God that you hearing me

I miss you (you know that I miss, I'm missing you)
I miss you (oh), I'm talkin' to you baby

I know you watch me up there and it's gettin' hard for me
When you get a chance, put a good word into the Lord for me
I been got caught up, got sent to the pen
I let ya down, I'm in a place I know you never thought you see me in
But all these things is happening for a reason
I guess God saved my life and put me up to see another season
And all my so-called friends don't even write to me
They don't go check on my momma, don't send no price to me
I'm tryna' raise my kids from a penitentiary
Stayin' on my knees, praying they don't grow up to be like me
Do you remember when my parents thing ain't worked out?
You let me and my momma come live in yo' house
Knowin' already you had too many people livin' wit'cha
You always treated me special, I never could forget cha'
Cook me breakfast and lunch and dinner everyday
You wiped my tears away, tried to explain why my life had to be this way
Always gave me the real, you never bullshit me
I wish I woulda' said thank you when you was here with me
My uncle miss ya and I know you know his heart is blue
But he ain't the only one 'cause Annie I miss you too

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro:]
A house is not a house if ain't nobody livin' in it
Tell me why black life isn't life unless there's prison in it
General population of super cell, or Johnny or some Jack Man
Powdered coffee, peppermint, peach cool offs, but a paint I wish I had that
And even more than my freedom, I wish I had somethin' else
I would give back everything I've accomplished 'fore this one thing and nothin' else
I ain't talkin' about a relationship 'cause broads bring too much drama (drama)
I'd even pass the chance to be a millionaire if I could hug and kiss my momma (momma)
I remember like it was yesterday, although I was six years old
""Momma what's wrong, wake up, wake up! Why yo' forehead hot and yo' hands so cold?""
""Who all these people up in our room? Auntie tell 'em put my momma down!""
I didn't understand what was goin' on, but it felt wrong 'cause so many people came around
I didn't have to go to school that day (that day), and everybody was buyin' me shit (buyin' me shit)
Tellin' me everything was alright but they was sad and cryin' and shit
Ain't that a bitch? My momma ain't never came back, I wish I could hug and kiss her
Even though Auntie and Grandma Dorothy raised me right, I still miss her

A real gangsta more than just a 7 letter word, 
A gangsta ain't ya clothes, 
A gangsta ain't ya hat, your watch ring your chain naw a gangsta ain't that,

Put a jacket on ya boy you ain't a gangsta yous a hoe,

That thats gangsta

Shit this your boy Z-Ro
F**king with Mike Dean, at www.thesenuts.net
We ain't gon sweat

[Chorus x2]
I hate you bitch, I hate you bitch
I hate you bitch, I never thought I'd say

Too many years, I done paid the price
Why you gotta put all this, drama in my life
And day after day, I'm on the grind for you
Living lavish drape you in karats, what I'm trying to do
But Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii'm, just a man
Trying to do all I can, but you act like you can't understand
Well I done sacrificed, and I done swallowed my pride
On the wrong road, trying to follow my pride
I was daddy for a while, though I've got no seed
But the kids, are my H-E-A-are-T
I've been dealing with a lot, so I've been losing my mind
Straight up acting before I think, barely using my mind
My freedom is on the line, and my sanity's gone
You picked a fine time to leave me, now this house ain't a home
I had no problem being faithful, I loved you so much I hate you
Because you left me, when I needed you the most
So now a bitch, is how I rate you
My female friends, making you wonder
Guilt got you feeling suspicious, from when you was creeping on
Me
On the under, but even still I held my head
Five kids and I fed em all, with moldy bread and spreads
Them was my motherf**kers, treated em like sisters and brothers
But somehow I fell out of place, f**king with they punk ass
Mother
I apologize, I wish I can turn back the hands of time
Wishing we could pillow fight, just one more time
But Ms. Ronda, wanna put them laws in my life
Although I'm happy, I never pictured you not at all in my life
Solo that's how I kick it, the rest of my days
But I wanna thank you for making possible, some of the best of
My days
I've dried my eyes, now and all they can see is the greed
You can have that jury, broke ass motherf**kers the seventh

[Chorus x2]

Too many years, I done paid the price

Trying to do all I can, but you act like you can't understand

If it's on the low, I love the sound of that
Plus if it's headbanger, I'ma sco' a pound of that

That's the only thing I know
I really can't breath right
I'm strangled by animosity from by own people
Lately it's hard to be nice
My face is frowned up everywhere I go
And I can't sleep nights
I'm in my ride tryin to find my foes (Why You Be Trippin Z-ro?)

They say my music won't make it, cause I don't rap cars and dancing
I rap pain, poverty and fraud romancing
Who gon represent for that brother on death row
And let him know whether he did it or not god has his back from the get go
A lil mama that's hustlin
Riskin her freedom
House full of kids and none of the baby daddies around
And she just tryn to feed em
Even if she's layin on her back for bread
Instead of talkin about her show her to earn it without opening legs
Why my people rather point fingers and turn up their noses
Showin love then strikin a match, ya ain't that so explosive
('stead of showin love, they strikin a match at anger so explosive)
And I'm guilty just like everybody else
So when I'm talkin to ya'll, I'm talkin to self
I know your tired of shown love and never gettin it showed back to ya
When all you need is a hug your people show they backs to ya
Well hear me when I tell you everytime the world in a devil dig shift (dis ya)
God is your homie, can't nobody in the world fuck with ya...

[Chorus]
If you feel like you wanna die sometimes you can release stress to this
Just keep God first in your life
Even when you feel like he ain't blessin it
If you get mad like I get mad
Then you be agged like everyday
But all u gotta do is learn to let go and let God handle it
Ain't nothin you can say...but
I don't give a damn
But all these fellas droppin salt on your name
I don't give a damn
But you can't pay your bills cuz your short on your change
I don't give a damn
Man I just saw your woman huggin and kissin another man
I don't give a damn
'Cause God got me & if u don't know you better ask somebody

800 days, minimum wage
About to lose your house if you don't get a raise
Just stay close to goin to work with the 12 gauge
You you see a new millennium
But feel like your in the stone age
Stressin every 7 minutes from livin with aids
Subtracting days from your life but because of the virus
You dying from worry and thangs you can't change
Be mad at satan, there's too many other name's to blame
Only God can bring forth rain to smother pain flames
And then the sun gon shine
No matter what the doctor tell you
The Lord decide when it's the end of your time
Just look at Magic
Ya it was tragic
But he's still at it
Lookin, functionin, and feelin fantastic
I know my people cry a river
And it's alright to cry
But don't commit suicide
You can't make it to heaven taking your own life
So repeat after me:
The devil ain't pimpin me
'Cause I can do all things through Jesus Christ who strengthens me!

[Chorus]

Look lil mama I can feel what your goin through
Your another diamond dancin at the player's club
Tryin to pay your way through school
And to the brother that's out jackin brothers who don better
Homie you ain't gotta do it like that
I know it's diffcult tryin to make it if you ain't havin cheddar
But what you gon do when brother's strike back?
And just because your white and I'm not
Doesn't mean tryin to plot on takin your last dime
But I know just because I got a diamond grill in my mouth
You thinkin I wanna steal dolla bills out your house
Even though u think I'm an animal I don't give a damn
A True Hero Under God, thats what I am
Whoo!

Z-Ro,"Comin' up as yungsta
Watchin' the OG's in the hood while they flossin' in they rides
Candy paint, chrome wheels, and black magic on the attire
Me, yeah I was lovin' it, but not old enough drive
Parkin' lot pimpin' from the passenger side
I use to walk everywhere I had to show up
Shoe hills, one down like wheel rubber, man I was about to go nuts
Hopefully I would blow up in these rap game man
My people roll swanga's, I wanted to be rollin' the same thang
Never had alot of work, but I was doin' what I could
Movin' nickles, dimes, twenty's, and ounces all threw my hood
Since I had a one yolla fines cash me up
Mean while thumpin' for a ride my homies pass me up
It's all gravy, when I'm able I'm a showin' all somthin'
From a hopte to a foreign, I'm ballin' it's all or nothin'
Treat my feet with' designer to fine sneak's when I leave my home
Only place you catch me walkin' is to my mail box's
Cause on the streets I be on crome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rollin' chrome

Huh, I started off with' a canary yellow cutlass supreme on bald tire's
Yeah I know I was out of line
But that was all I could find
Or should I say that was all I could purchase for what I had to spend
But at least I had somthin' to go from point A to B and
No more offerin' gas money to get a lift
Besides when your driven it's easyer to get a chick
So ani't no more parkin' lot pimpin' at the club I'm up in there
Seekin' little mama, with' thick thighs, I hope she let me in there
Like swim wear, pull up to the motel, and we'll go in there
Nothin' left to do but comit a sin there
And that was in my hopte, but when I show up in my big body with' the gloss
All of the boppers was boppin' I just could'nt shake'm off
Sixteen switches, tewnty-two inches, trunk goin' to war
They don't want to lay here with me, they want to lay in my car
I was lovin' it back then and still love it today
Except I'm not yellow cutlase no more, I'm 300 blue over gray, on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rolin chrome

Finally I'm in the mix, ridin' twenty four's or twenty six
My neck and my wrist lite, with' out me sellin' a brick
Tv's in the roof and the dashboard and I'm watchin' a flick
Rollin' with my pistol in my lap and I'm cockin' if
I spy somethin' suspicious in my rear view mirror when I'm creepin'
If you plan on jackin' me I plan on leavin' you sleepin'
I be in different vehicle cause I'm havin' thangs
King of the ghetto entertainment got me havin' change
You can smell it on me, even tho quite, the way I live it be tellin' on me
Don't get twisted I'm still a felon homie
Thinkin' you goin' to rob me that's a N O
And when I'm in N O I roll with god and as always Mr.Marsello
And they be with me when they in Texas don't par take it as a spy
Harlum nights in stores where they drop it like it's hot
So if your tryin' to call me and I don't answer my phone
I can't hear it cause my music to loud I'm bangin' on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on (holdin' on)
I'll keep rolin chrome (yaah)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (yes I am)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (I'm rollin chrome)

When you up, you up
And when you down, you down
But when you fall off
Just peep out who still come around
And ain't too many gon' hold you down
When you down and not on ya luck
But ima be right by your side
Even when that road get rough
I keep it cool when the streetz iz hott
And all your friends that soon forgot
They leavin you all alone to rott
But I'll be there till you back on top
I'm down wit ya wit no strings
No matter what, one hundred I'm willin to feed
I'm gettin that paper to feed my krew
And no matter what you goin through
I'm stayin true...

(Chorus)
(Z-Ro)
I know you been searchin for someone
To keep it one hundred
So tired of mixed love and bullshit
And keep keepin it comin
Damn right he came up from nothin
But now he's got money
And he's feedin his people
And now ain't one of 'em gon' ever go hungry

(Z-ro 2nd Verse)
Uhh...
I represent Mo' City until the day I die
I speak the truth even when I say a lie
Even lil babys know better than to play with I
Would be to lost and never found to say bye bye
Ya'll already know I got a lot of evil in me
But I got a lot of that love shit too
'cause I promise I'm in love with my ride
And I'm in love with what its sittin on
Bitch and my paints so blue
Thanks to Paul Wall
You already know I got love for ya bro
My cup empty yo cup
If you less pour some mo
My nigga T-faris and J-dawg
And even my old school nigga Fuck
When they show us hate
We gon' show 'em back love
Now but last year would've been a different scene
But ima let you make it 
'cause I'm really tryna keep it one hundred
So stay the fuck away from me please!

I know you been searchin for someone

Homie I'm different like a alien
Driven in that mothership
Its black its midnight
I'm sittin high up on that numbers list
Went from all this paper rain but now I'm never drowsy
They talk but I can't even hear the way 
They wisper 'bout me
Even if they doubt me haters I'm off limits
Blowin cake
Ohh yea I make desert for a livin
So many times I swear I spare my last one hundred
Like a grade in the class
Now that's extra credit

Z-Ro,"Ain't no such things as friends only associates
So if you run up on me I'm pulling my gun out of my holster bitch
I don't like watching my back so when I bust I'm a unload the clip
But I'd rather expect you just give me the respect I'm suppose to get
Gangsta shit

All my niggas is gone my damn bitch done cut
I got sum shit on my dome
Did they love me or what?
I'm one deep with my chrome like I ain't giving a fuck
If I got to do this alone fuck it that's wassup
They say it's lonely at the top an you
Gon' see who your real friends
No more fo doors I'm riding a coop benz
Keepin' it moving ain't focused on shit but not losing
If you don't fuck with me don't fuck with me
It's not confusing
And when you speak on my name watch the words your choosing
You soundin' like a hater to me it's so amusing
Instead of moving on trying to do your own thang
You recruiting for the we hate Slim Thug gang
But ain't shit change here mayne
I'm still the same
Life good up out the hood shit I can't complain
These niggas say they down, but they just pretend
I'm ridin' solo to the end
Fuck friends

Ain't no such things as friends only associates
So if you run up on me I'm pulling my gun out of my holster bitch
I don't like watching my back so when I bust I'm a unload the clip
But I'd rather expect you just give me the respect I'm suppose to get
Gangsta shit

Sometimes I wonder if god forgot about me
And would my people miss me if they had to do without me
'Cause anything ain't no love
A nigga you think is yo homie is runnin' up in yo girl every time you leave her lonely
Each and every time I leave my house all three of my guns is on me
Ain't none of you niggas is goin' to
Be kicking or punching on me
And I learned my lesson about callin' my homies when I need 'em
Out of eleven one and a half
Shows up and the rest I still ain't seen 'em
One deep till I'm on my back
Ya'll fellas out might be on my sack
I'll shoot a muthafucker
If a muthafucker jump out of line then I'm a put 'em back in line
2006 beretta, gloc 40 with hollows in mind
It's amazing how something so small can flip yo bitch ass anytime
I'm an og original gangster mayne organized general
Army ready to drop off chemicals
64 545 criminals
But it's business
Whenever I'm seen with a crowd that I'm not feeling
Enter the conversation and paper in my pocket I'm not feeling

Ain't no such things as friends only associates
So if you run up on me I'm pulling my gun out of my holster bitch
I don't like watching my back so when I bust I'm a unload the clip
But I'd rather expect you just give me the respect I'm suppose to get
Gangsta shit

I done seen a whole lot in these 26 years
Never thought I had peers that was undercover queers
Tell these snitches in my circle awhile back I would've murked yuh
I vouch for me an mine
'Til the gavel drop down
An judge gave my time since I hogged up
The ripper
The last time I heard from my niggas
Still in denial in the begginin' of my sentence
Two months turned to years and them years
Turned to bitches
Sittin' in my cell doin' sets of push ups
No money no mail that's okay that's wassup
Momma made a man but these streets raised
A soldier
Where they kill a real nigga make a mo daycloder
I never fold up
I'm a do my time bitch
I'm a make parole hoe
Get out and shine trick
You fuck niggas better stay out my way
I awready wanna blow off yo face
For violating the code nigga

Ain't no such things as friends only associates
So if you run up on me I'm pulling my gun out of my holster bitch

Now welcome to the city of game, piece of chains and swangs
Pop, trunk and bang, yeah I'm still here mayne
Born and raised on the stead block, braids no dreadlocks
Married to the hood, me and Scenic Woods wedlock
Acres Homes my home, I'm a Northside veteran
Repping H-Town, smoking, sipping on some medicine
Ain't nobody better than the boss when I floss
It's Slim Thugga motherfucker, still breaking boys off

Got plenty cheese plenty carats man we looking like some caterers
And it's looking like you haters and you fakes is imitating us
Shaded up, braided up, and I bet that truck be bladed up
Bentley still crawling on fo's so they ain't fading us
In the hood I'm a grinder, wood on the vinyl
TV, VCR, I'm laid back with your mama
You ain't never seen a grinder that grind the way I grind, huh?
Top of my drop still missin' as Osama

(Still breaking boys off, hmm) Candy painted with the gloss
You can hate but that's the way a player floss

The city where the boys flip the candy painted low
The city where they blow big killa and stayed blowed
Hustling ass D-boys got the game sewed
Where they sip that paint (sip that paint) and drip that paint (drip that paint)

Top down, lookin' for a head hunter
If it's in a mob, she can't be my baby mother
You know, I wanna fuck you bitch
But I know, I'm not givin' you one red cent
My dough, ain't helpin' you with your rent
I never been a trick, you oughta pay for the dick

Slidin' on a slab and all she wanna do was rape me
But payin' for some puss, girl, you must be mistaken greatly
You say you wanna taste me, blow and decapitate me
What you need ain't give me gravy, paid me, my dick ain't lazy
Trickin' is dead, holmes, she givin' me head phones
She thick in the red thong, I refuse to be led on
Cause I'm a leader, not a follower
She gon' be a squirter and a swallower
Late night gobbler
Big maniac, she a brainiac, just like she go to Princeton
In a Cadillac, fuck a battle rap, motherfucker, keep it pimpin'

No pussy could, but tell her put that throat up in your life
Got me a drug dealer ride, put liq' with coke up in her eye
Tryin' to charge me for that trash ass, pussy, she out of mind
Same thang I can get out her pussy, I'm a get out her mind
Money in my pocket, good, but it ain't comin' out of mine
If you pay for sexual favors, your trick ass out of line
And with every time I call her phone number (Number)
My neighbor is what she lay her head under (Under)
Ain't no fillin' child support on me unless a nig get pregnant
Bitch, suck it while I'm behind the wheel, that's why I'm drivin' reckless
She a head hunter

I don't love her, I don't want her, you can have her, I got another
Did it however which way I could've, then I kicked her up out the Hummer
Nothin' but a head hunter, and she wanna taste me
Bitch, pay me, this dick ain't free
I said on how she bring it back, so how the hell could I pay for that
Choose me, she know the scope, it's pimpin', no love for a hoe
Lucky, yeah, they love me, and they wanted me to hit it

Struggling hard, I'm trying to pay my bills

Watch my friends, and keep my enemies close

Still remain, to be the same old song

Finally we done made our way
Everything that come in the past, came today
I been looking in the future, for a brighter day
Trials and tribulations in life, I learn to evade
The sun is shining, every dog has his bone in time
And it seems to be, that my time is now
I remember, when they said I would be nothing
But now that nothing is something, and I be bringing 'em down
Sho' I'm a clown, nothing but the skill when I be wrecking
Up out of Texas, with diamonds all over my necklace
I keep they head checking, pass to profession
And can't nobody contest, 'cause that's the way we are a legend
You better count your blessings, 'cause I'm sick and tired of this thang
And while I be blowing my Mary Jane, I'm chilling with thugs
Sipping on mud, trying to keep my head long from slugs
Guerilla Maab on the rise, and we keeping it crunk

It was all a dream, other people said I would never be
Nothing, now collecting dividends to ride a Benz
Down I-10, dropping the top in the wind
With a friend once again, yelling out fuck friends
Bubble lens, when I be stacking my ends
Trying to see, could you really picture me
S3 with a JVC, 18's in the trunk ready to beat
Chunking deuce to hoes, and burning off on them freaks
I'm a ghetto superstar, and a certified thug
So all you certified scrubs, get certified slugs
Southside till I'm dead, gotta be moving they head
Gotta keep my head up, for my brother in the FED
This is dedicated to niggaz, who be turning they back
Slamming all of they do's, and burning off in they Lac

All I did was put a buzz 
In everybody mutherfucking ear, about the group I'm in
Now look at the candy coupe I'm in
I took a big six hundred to the shop, and told em candy blue my Benz
I put a bunch of money in my billfold, 'cause I'm real cold
When I'm on the microphone
Everybody want to kill, to get a piece of my mill
But I'mma weigh my skills, better surrender or bite my chrome
'Cause I'mma fight my homeboys, write my own bars
When it comes, to the pen and pad
Thinking about the swine I had, and everything I own
Could the shit wasn't bad, but in reality nigga
I was fucked up low life, living in sin
But I was given a chance, to start pimping a pen
Now Blockbuster, Soundwaves and Sam Goody's
Be running out of my product, and re-order again
And certify myself, half a million sold

A nigga want to plex, put his face all in the flo'

Only if he knew what I had to do to keep my mind right
I tell you I got 20/20 hindsight
See it in the distance, hieroglyphics keep the rhymes tight
My mind like, game recognize that
Real recognize real, still .45 strapped
Underneath the white tee, Zimmerman get shot down
Hero, it ain't nothing but a sandwich, call the cops now
Fuck the police, stop running
White boys terrorize nigga' neighborhoods, gunning
Down the innocent, and then the beginning ends
You was doing 50 in the 35, the ending is
You fit the description of the subject in this incident
We gon' have to take you downtown for some questionin'
Damn, a blessin in disguise if you ask me
I was just about to hit the highway with my last key
Could it be that maybe God is intervenes
With my life like he did so many times in between
A half a block away from the crime scene
A minute earlier and that was me, think
I've been knowing Ross since he was Teflon
Same nigga now it was back then, nothing stepped on
Dopeman, dopeman yelling
Cook it 'til it's rock hard, bag it up, sell it
Aroma so loud, so loud that you can smell it
Death to them niggas getting caught go and tell it

Every time I turn around, y'all got something to say about me
But y'all don't know a damn thing about me
Just what you see, that's what you judge me on
Every time I turn around the guilty be pointing fingers at me
Homie, I'm just trying to be all I can be
But not for free, that's why the fuck we roll, I need that

Can't even believe this day here, my nigga
I remember us sitting in the parking lot talking about getting money

Cracks in the wall, standing in the puddle
Sunny south Florida, a cold motherfucker
Ready for a war, barely wanna talk
Ballys on, my nigga, as they walking back and forth
Makes you wanna hustle, take care of my brothers
Raymond passed away, here's something for his mother
It never is enough, trying to show her that I love him
We were fishing buddies, breed the dog, split the puppies
Pictures on the wall, bitches we done raw
Niggas getting robbed, the only shit that we can solve
We all wanna get it, ball for a minute
Accept collect calls, tell our dawgs that we did it
Plenty money orders, that what uncle Kenny taught us
Keep your face clean when you're out here bending corners
Always keep in mind, you fall in love a thousand times
Regardless what we went through, I'm still right here by your side
Artificial homies, worse than the ages
When you parking all your cars, they wanna know the payments
Rose petals dripping on the casket
Baby boy done grew into a bastard
On that lean, you know I fuck her fantastic
Work white as Rita Ora in that plastic
Took shots, shed tears, that's war
Bust bottles on yachts, stand tall
Catch a case, don't talk, that's raw
Scarface, Rick Ross, big boys
Big boys, Scarface, Rozay, we big boys

Every time I turn around, y'all got something to say about me
But y'all don't know a damn thing about me
Just what you see, that's what you judge me on
Every time I turn around the guilty be pointing fingers at me

I was rollin' weed, they was snortin' blow
Such a cool breeze, heart so cold
Step up to the plate, where your money at?
Bobby Brown on cake with a hundred packs
New editions, Lisa Lisa
We were secret lovers, had to get a beeper
My Atlantic star, not a Notre Dame
Not a student loan, tried to motivate
Continental, my Bentley, this shit should be illegal
Selassie eye in the ghost, thousand bales of that diesel
Lord, go toe to toe with any pussy boy
Fuck, one time for facin' all the Boobie boys
26 inch plates on a 68
Where I'm from a half a key'll set a nigga straight
I just wanna make the car notes
Let mama make the pot roast
You should meet me at the car wash
Washin' all 8, that's inshallah

Speakin' for those squeakin' in them cell blocks readin'
To blacks, whites and Puerto Ricans
Brothers with those ankle bracelets, impatient for their releasin'
To make it back to the block, the hatred, the priest hit
Time sure flies, look how many years went by
My young niggas already need hair dye
Alcoholic faces, women bad as a mug
Gettin' fat as fuck
Fried food be addin' up, the system thrives off its victims
They ask how this economic collapse
Can affect people all over the map
Tea party for tax reenactment is whack
The past the past, yo, to my vatos out in the East Los
Nietas on the east coast, shouts to Puerto Rico
Dominican Republic people, rep I
Brown and black, we must get it together
The prison industrial complex a fuckin' set up
The Aztec, almac, African settled on this land from the get up
I changed my aim, who I'm gon' wet up
When violence is resorted, knowledge is distorted
Unless it's payback for brutality
I'm more or less with that, get back

So hard in these streets
Gotta pack a pistol plus talk to God in these streets
Go to church, Sunday, Monday, sellin' raw in these streets
Never took it home though, I left it all in these streets
Gotta do what I gotta do
I ain't promotin' no eviction notice on the door
Fuck it, I had to go for broke
Do what I gotta do

I couldn't agree with you more
Jealous hearted motherfucker
Never been able to fuck with me nigga, ever
Super solid from day one
Never put myself in a compromised position, I'm a chess player
And if I did I'd just shoot my way out

First born to my momma
I come from the place where you're promised
To die before your 21st
You'll be surprised what's underneath the earth
Dug dirt, I put bones there
All my enemies is gone now
I can't sleep through the cold sweats
Flashbacks, I'm a known threat
God fearing yet I'm evil though
I think deep, I believe in ghosts
Ever felt the hand of a dead body?
Then you know why I took my gun and head-shot him
War started over dope cuts
I put what I live by on both nuts
It's either him or me so I say fuck dude
I look him in his eyes and say FUCK YOU!

Fuck you, hey, I been running this shit so long
[?] is like ""fuck you!""
You niggas been throwing rocks at the throne
I'mma reach out and touch you
I ain't gotta put no money on your dome
My nigga, fuck you and everything you stand for
Hoe, bitch, pussy nigga, fuck you!

I live like I spit it
Raised by the war so my mentality is ""get it""
A life on the streets takes commitment
The power that you gain gets addictive
The money being made gets you bitches
A real nigga played the game like it's business
A weak nigga facing time, go to snitching
Plotting on his whole team cause he ain't wanna listen
If it was all good just a week ago
Take your motherfucking charge, there's your key of dope
We all wanna eat, gotta feed folks
To get [?] on the streets, call the G code
That's what we live by, die for it
I got homies standing firm doing time for it
We have 5K1 [?] killers [??]
We gon bust that nigga, fuck that nigga!

Fuck you, hey, I been running this shit so long

Hoe, bitch, pussy nigga, fuck you!

They jealous of me cause I shine bright
Grind strong plus my mind right
My gun loaded up in both clips
Jump out on me wrong and meet the four fifth
No shit, this is music you can drive-by
G's the only code we abide by
Blunt burning in the ashtray
Playing faggot games and now your ass chafe
Niggas wearing tight pants and high heels
Claiming another nigga's hood that is not real
I am still the hardest nigga being heard
Fuck he claiming he real when he ain't keep his word?
He ain't fooling me, my nigga, he is just a nerd
Nothing but a rap tune, he ain't seen a bird, word
I talk that shit that I can back, though
Cause that's in my boxing game, I'm in the back, hoe
Talk that big six but pack a double [?]

Man what happened to the sun on my lawn it's so gloomy and grey
I got a feeling 5-O gone try to do me today
Nothing but backstreets for me cause I don't need a vacation
Looking for front run up that seem the only compensation
The hood is on fire, other soldiers won't let it down
They ain't set tripping but out here jacking has been alive
Misery spinning what they clicking for no reason at all
Even intentions of stacking paper they pleasing them all
And outside, smelling like nothing but formaldrahide
It's an everyday suicide, R.I.P. to the ones that died
Wake up before you get caught up don't keep on selling your soul
Until your life fall up, you got to try to find

You trying to figure out this the game that's called life

Like paper bags and lawn chairs man you unfold
I'm looking out my window for some, sunshine
I'm trying to give it up cause I swear it's my time
I five petreat and start thinking about my sins
Roll up another square and start thinking about the benz
Talent and skills is what I'm bringing
New homes and microphones got the cell phone ringing
Push play on the deck, to let my mind collect
And try to mash on the gas with no time to sweat
This the ghetto, and that's all I know
Another episode from the young don and Ro
If the family is tight, then everything's alright
So quick to catch flight for the sunlight, uh

Seem like I can't stand the rain prosecution and struggle up in my brain
Got to tell me slow down if you can see all of my veins

Keep my enemy close to me cause your killer be your 'cause
I wish I was, able to socialize with why'all
Instead of trading war stories and taking lies from why'all
It's how it be though, Lil' Keke and Z-Ro we on the grind 
Long as they talking about us, we know we staying on they mind
Don't hate us congratulate us, why why'all turning up why'all nose

Tellin' you that you fine, but he ain't spendin' no time
I be pourin' wine, tryin' to, knock out your spine
Make you mine, from behind, to some slowed down ""Bump n' Grind""
His thang like a dirty Sweet, from off the street
My thang like a O' of indo, from Sacramento
Lately y'all been monkeyin', he, call you a bitch
Keep me all up in yo' shit, try'na dig you a new ditch
Now I admit, that he rich, and that his money is good
Got my dicked sucked in his 'Six, I'm fuckin' on leather and wood
I'm just a yougin' from the hood, with some dick if ya good
With him, you know that you shouldn't
With me, you know that you should
Go pussy thug, like a glove when I push and I shove
Knock a dime out the climb, cause I ain't makin' love
See yo' man the type of guy, to get jealous and hit'cha
But me, I lick ya where he don't, and suck real hard on yo' nipple
My game is sharp as a cicle, she love my pickle
And if you gave her a dime, nigga she gave me a nickel
So while you thinkin', she done jet, she got my dick on her mind

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well naturally, I have to be, dead serious, maybe not
Let me tell a tale about this broad that thought she played me out
Yes, I was impressed, by the sex in her ass
W-U-I-S her, Versacci, down like Fran, dress her, bless her heart
She was a sweet-tart, but'cha never understood her point in our duo
Talkin' smart wit' all that ""you know"", comin' wit' he-say, she-say
From what she heard at the club, bout some chick that I had played on
Well bitch, you should have stayed home
She mad cause I done told her girl off, but the bitch was wrong, and you
You gon' let these messy ho's fuck yo' world off
I tried to love her man, but see love is one thang, and dumb is anotha'
Brotha', I'd be dumb to let her run thangs
I should've passed, but I was gassed, super-unleaded
And her nappy-headed ass gon' regret it, remember I said it
Cause I'm, in a sublime, new state and frame of mind
Cause it'd be a crime, for me to waste my time
My time

(Verse 3, Twista]
Did you ever think about who's ass ya girl's was
Before the booty had became yours?
If a nigga's sane flows, you know everything goes
Fuckin' in it til' it's colorful as rainbows
Sportin' furry Kango's, she can't go, rockin' paid shows
Paper hard to fold, plus I roll slick, keep talkin' shit
If you don't like me, it's most like-ly, cause I done holla'd at yo bitch
Why she so thick? Tellin' lies and ya said to be believin' 'em
But I make her feel like ""Uh-huh"", can you do it? ""Uh-huh""
But when I scoop her up, she know that I'm the one to make a slut-cum
Gotta man, he a lame anyway, mother-fuck that stuff
Mad cause I snuck that love, baby don't bust that slug
So go on head roll up that bud, so we can fuck
So wassup? Now we in the Suburb', submerged, watch a movie
Or bumpin' U-G, K shit, scoop a bitch or hit the booty
How the man, yea I knew g, but she don't usually, say shit
Cause the pussy make a motherfucka' wanna ball up and cry
Chicka-pow-pow, I love them thighs when I'm rollin' aside
I ain't gon' up and die, like the guy that we got high
Take away more than two hits, two blows
She heard my new shit, it was new clothes
New golds, carefully Herringbones, and cell-phones
But her friend home, now I'm freakin' two ho's
If ya girl be wit' me, somethin' nifty, she prob'ly wanna lick me

Ain't nothing but a g thang baby
Turnel sets dried yellow bones crazy
Can't fade me, died lately
Pulling out the escallade or a mercedes
Trunk popper, show stopper, drank sipper
Rule number one is to never tip a stripper
And I know a lot of why'all want to wish me trouble
Went from swanging hoo-doos to a bentley bubble
Image is everything, diamonds in every ring
Piece and chains that hang down low to my dang-a-lang
Stop that, cop that, I'm a baller baby
Got the rims that poke out on the prowler baby
I'm the same young cat that dropped the jewels on them
Next year I'm about to drop 22's on them
From the Mo to the Fo, back to airport landing
Diamonds speak for theyself, Flex so outstanding

From me and Z-Ro and Lil' Flex at the grammy
Boss player from Texas, you could tell by the necklace
We gone break these hoes on four's now we frozen the Lexus
My protected, move around, get around
Come through show some round when we hit your town
It go down, whoa now, school slow down
Watch these fours roll down crawl down your block
Top drop, trunk knock, glock cocked
And these shops gone bop, it don't stop
Won't stop, how it go down

From the land of the trunk poppers where ballers blow tons

In search of a platinum plack trying to get stacks it just begun
If you talking down move around we ain't having that
East and West took it before but see we came to grab it back
Can't see us like cataracts, off in our natural habitat
That's the studio and bro you know ain't no more selling crack
Ain't nothing but rocking trash talking on down to the ain't that
Cause I'm a veteran to this here ever since the days of the Wave Band
When I was knee high to a grass hopper but now we roll on chppers
Me and Gene hovering over the ground in candy helicopters
Now we platinum status without driving a dodge stratus
Keeping it gangsta energy instinct with a heater to protect us
Man it's third coast, to me our music mean the most

To vital organs, forming your brain and tiny heart
The fetus, date of birth; until puberty finally starts
Adolescence, adult, then your elderly body rots
It was divine decree that begun the plan
But is diseased by the greed of the sons of man
Don't try to leave with the guns in hand
Understand: God's the one in command

Did we climb out of the sea?
Where did we come from, you and me?
Two legs to walk, and as you see
I'm not a man I want to be
People growing, my backyard (I'm growing in your backyard)
In my garden, in my heart (I'm in your garden, I'm in your heart)
Pink and purple, red and blue (See all the colors?)
On this sunny afternoon (It's a sunny afternoon)

Back before time was time and space was space
The ever-present eye divine so laced with grace
Decided it was time to try to chase, to chase
But what it would design, now life is taking place
Within itself, divided; now it takes some space
And it can't be found alive, the mind creates the state
Of ego, now what's mine is mine
OK, now hate will reign until the blind have eyes and lay awake in wait

How are the seeds in the ground?
How is my garden growing now?
A tender kiss, a little smile
The way a mother holds its child
Tasty little human beings (Tasty little human beings)
I grow them on the people tree (I grow them on the people tree)
I will eat them one by one (Eat them one by one)

Born in the ever-flowing life beyond the dirt
Tell me what the purpose is for creating the earth
(Maybe we created the planet as man's habitat
Be fruitful and multiply across the planet's back)
Well, why does hate exist?
The war and AIDS and shit?
If we're to be fruitful, why can't poor people pay they rent?
('Cause love and hate, both sides are conjoined
Physical forms have to deal with both sides of the coin)
Why do we die? (So you can live!)
Why do we strive? (So you can win!
But why did you defy every truthful word I recommend?)
My question back, why do you recommend an ode temptationing
(So I can test your patience and tolerance in the face of sin)
But why attest when you hold all the answers to the state we in?
(For you to bear witness of imperfections of mortal men)
So it's a lesson? (And a blessing
Journey back to where you been

Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio on

Well I was raised underneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night

And the radio up
I like to see the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Not where you live, what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind this I've come to know

Raise you glasses for a toast

The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice

We picked guitars and talked about how the glory days we missed 'em
And it didn't take too long to find the truth inside that bottle
Cast a-sea so long ago was a message from my father.

You keep your heart above your head and your eyes wide open
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean
Save your strength for things that you can change
Forgive the ones you can't
You gotta let it go

Looking back now on my life I can't say I regret it
And all the places that I ended up not the way Ma woulda had it
But you only get once chance at life to leave your mark upon it
And when a pony he comes riding by you better set your sweet ass on it

And keep your heart above your head and you eyes wide open
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean
Save your strength for things that you can change
Forgive the ones you can't
You gotta let it go

Like a sweet sunset in Georgia let it go
And like the fear that grabs a hold ya let it go
La la la la la la (let it go, let it go) let it go
La la la la la la (let it go, let it go) let it go

You keep your heart above your head and you eyes wide open
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold

An only child, alone and wild, he's a cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
But his heart was known to none
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music, denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once but his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline, a thundering, velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

Brothers' lives were different, for they heard another call
And one went to Chicago and the other to Saint Paul
But I'm in Colorado, when I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chosen and come to know so well

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band

Thank you for your music and your stories of the road
Thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go
Thank you for the kindness and the times when you got tough
Papa, I don't think I said ""I love you"" near enough

The leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument and his song is in my soul
My life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy to the leader of the band
I am the living legacy to the leader of the band",Leader of the Band,2017
Zac Brown,"When you heart's on the edge
Barely hanging on like a midnight cigarette
When the nights don't seem to end
And that lonely wind is singing you to sleep once again

I won't make a promise I can't keep
Like a river flows to the ocean deep

It goes on and on
Bound to forever
Even when we're gone
It goes on and on
We'll be together
At the rising of the dawn
It goes on

When your mind's on the loose
Slowly wearing out like a faded old tattoo
When the days all look the same
When that lonely wind keeps singing only you can ease the pain

That's the kind of bond that you can't break
Like looking up at all the stars in space

It goes on and on
Bound to forever
Even when we're gone
It goes on and on
We'll be together
At the rising of the dawn
It goes on

Digging through the sands of time to find my way back home
Your memory's the thing that keeps me hanging on
To know I'm not alone, we're stronger than the bonds of blood
Even on the darkest days together through the valley of the gun

It goes on and on
Bound to forever
Even when we're gone
It goes on and on and on
We'll be together
At the rising of the dawn
We'll be together
At the rising of the dawn",It Goes On,2018
Zac Brown,"Some saints have fallen from on high through cold stained glass 
The fire's calling, crawling down the burning match
Gold fires, the wicked bells they crash 
No grave to save me from my haunted past

Hey man, I know where the river goes 
Hey man, you will reap what you sow

You can find a way to take your heart and make it fly away 
So you can live another day without this pain 
Better loved and lost than never loved at all 
That's what they say a black heart is gonna pay for what's its done

Way down (way down) upon the cold, cold ground 
Come down (come down) the water's raging out

Hey man I know where the river goes 
Hey man you will reap what you sow

Zac Brown Band,"You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
With sweet tea, pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

And its funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind; this I've come to know
So if you agree have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast
To a little bit of chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank god for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring.
Salute the ones who died
And the ones that gave their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love
Like our chicken fried

Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes

Zac Brown Band,"I have lived in a junkyard
Where the weeds eat up the rain
If you get anything there even out of place
You know there's hell to pay

And he said ""you're as sick as you are lovely
And in need of a hand""
He tells me ""you are never worthy""
But I was just a child you see
That's my reality

He had a sick little girl
Dirty and hard
With a breast plate made of metal
She drives all day in her rusty Buick
Her feet don't reach the pedals
He got a jar of flies
His father's disguise
Where his heart should be
Her mouth is sewn together
She screams with those eyes
She screams with those eyes
She screams with those eyes

She's as sick as she is lovely
And in need of my hand, yeah he uses his hands
He tells her ""you are never worthy""
She was all alone you see
That was her reality

Yeah!
Well I should have been sleeping
Should have been dreaming
But I wake up to broken glass
There'll be one more
Empty desk in my homeroom class
I got an old bone pocket knife
Tight in my right hand
To save my poor mother from the junkyard man

He's as sick as he is lovely
And in need of a hand
He will know he's not worthy
When he dies alone you'll see
And that's his reality
I'm not sick, I am lovely
Hatred is the curse of man

And I will not feel unworthy
'Cause I have washed my hands you see
That's my reality, yeah",Junkyard,2005

Ask her to dance, go on son

Roll the dice and have some faith

Days would not be wasted on this drive
And I want so bad to hold you
Some of the things I haven't told you
Your mom and me just couldn't get along

So I'll drive
And I'll think about my life
And wonder why, I'll slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line
And I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride

A day might come and you'll realize that if you could see through my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
And a part of you might hate me
But son please don´t mistake me For a man that didn't care at all

So I'll drive
And I'll think about my life
And wonder why, I'll slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line

When he came across some boy sawin' on a fiddle and
Playin' It hott, then the devil jumped up on a hickory
Stump and Said ""boy, lemme tell you what;

I guess you didn't know it but im a fiddle player too.
And if you care to take a dare well,
I'll make a bet with you. And you play pretty good
Fiddle boy, but you give the devil his Due,
I bet a fiddle of gold against your soul to think im better Than you.""

If you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold,
But if you loose the devil gets your soul.

And fire flew from his fingertips as he reisened up his bow.
And he pulled that bow across his strings and it made
An evil hissin' then a band of demons joined in and it
Sounded Somethin' like this.

When the devil finished, Johnny said; ""well you're
Pretty good ol' son. Sit down in that chair right there
Lemme show you how its done""

Devil's in the house of the risin' sun.
Chickens in the bread pen pickin' out dough.
Granny, does your dog bite?
No, child, no.

The devil bowed his head now,
'Cause he knew that he'd been beat,
And he laid that golden fiddle down on the ground at Johnny's feet.

And all the places that I ended up not the way Ma woulda had it

Zac Brown Band,"Cried all night when you told me that I'd lost you
I died inside as I watched you walk away
And all this time I didn't doubt your reasons
But I can't heal

Now I sleep like a baby,
And all my dreams come true
'Cause the rest of my life has nothing to do with you

Pulled up my favorite chair at my favorite tavern
Turned to see you standing there with envy in your eyes
And I saved your life from 13 years of anger
But I broke every bone on the way home swinging at the sky

Now I sleep like a baby,
And all my dreams come true
'Cause the rest of my life has nothing to do with you

Stumbled in to find you cryin' in the kitchen
I argued with a broken heart and fabricated pride
And the battle raged for hours,
But I didn't have the power to make you understand so you turned and said goodbye

Now I sleep like a baby,
And all my dreams come true
'Cause the rest of my life has nothing to do with you

Now I sleep like a baby
And all my dreams come true
'Cause the rest of my life has nothing to do, nothing to do, nothing to do with you",Nothing [*],2010
Zac Brown Band,"I went down to Houston
And I stopped in San 'Antone
I passed up the station for the bus
I was trying to find me something
But I wasn't sure just what
Man I ended up with pockets full of dust

So I went on to Cleveland and I ended up insane
I bought a borrowed suit and learned to dance
I was spending money like the way it likes to rain
Man I ended up with pockets full of cane

What compels me to go?
Oh my sweet disposition
May you one day carry me home

What compels me to go?

Zac Brown Band,"I could tell that it was over
When her lips met mine
It was an emptiness in her voice
Hesitation when she smiled
She didn't have to say a word
It was just so plain to see
She had found what she'd been looking for
And I knew it wasn't me

I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

Sometimes I feel like a clown
Who can't wash off his make-up
All she wanted it was gone
Prince Charming I wasn't
But I would trade a thousand Babylons
To be in her arms tomorrow
But like tide her love has come and gone
And it's time for me to go

I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

Now she sees right through me
Should I hold on to what we've got
Is it just a waste of time

I saw goodbye in her eyes
I saw goodbye in her eyes

I know you got somebody new now
All my candles have burned out

Then I'ma roll one up
Like my name is Bob
Yeah I'm gonna party like I'm a Jamaican

And we can find somebody who can play the steel drums
And if you like this beat then everybody dance with me

Baby powder beach under my feet has got me rolling
And the breeze through crackling leaves like a daytime campfire burning
And the ship is off to sea
And the wake it is a churning
As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby

You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh and lose yourself again
As the Southern wind sings again a island lullaby

There’s a place the locals go and no one knows where to find it
And the river starts to flow inside the clouds of Misty Mountain
The water from this stone below becomes a blue-green fountain
As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby

You can jump right in
Let the music pull you in
You can jump right in
Oh and lose yourself again
As the Southern wind sings again an island lullaby

You can find me where the music meets the ocean
If you get the notion, stop on by and play a while
Simple tune to get your love light glowing
Keep your heart wide open
Disappear just like the tide
Let it roll on by

And jump right in
Let the music pull you in

Some put on a suit, but he ran the other way
Drums drown out the yuppies

'Cause the freedom music gave him was worth more than anything

They don't know
What they got
Until it's gone
Like it or not
You live on love
You try to do what's right
We're all here waiting for our silver invitation
To the big band in the sky

Rollin' down the windows
Trying hard to fight the sleep
Money's never much for a band in Tennessee
Another night of playin'
To a crowd with no ears
Wanna hear the songs they know
And fill their bellies full of beer

But they don't know
What they got
Until it's gone
Like it or not
You live on love
You try to do what's right
We're all here waiting for our silver invitation
To the big band in the sky

And when he closed his eyes
Fell into a dream that never dies
And when the thunder comes
You can hear his kick drum in the sky
Feel the rain
Fall from our eyes

'Cause we don't know
What we got
Until it's gone

Got his silver invitation

Zac Brown Band,"Had lips like candy
Hair flowing like water
Skin like velvet made
The whole damn world slow down
She was a preacher's daughter
Never did what daddy taught her
And the rebel in her soul
Brought her to me

The river was cold
And the river was wide
She flowed from the mountain
Straight across the great divide
And her heart ran cold
But her love runs deep
She's fire on the mountain
Wrecking everyone she meets

She's like rain when she rolls in
But that sunshine in her thunder
Makes the loneliest heart wonder
If the ride is worth the pain
Might not be stone clouds inside
Oh but don't you worry friend
She's coming around the bend
She's holding lightning in both hands

Lord please know
It's that time for me to go
The river has my heart
She's the keeper of my soul
On one side of the water
Sweet everlasting grace
The other side could end your life
Or steal your breath away

She's like rain when she rolls in
But that sunshine in her thunder
Makes the loneliest heart wonder
If the ride is worth the pain
Might not be stone clouds inside
Oh but don't you worry friend
She's coming around the bend
She's holding lightning in both hands

She's a natural disaster
She'll tear the land in two
She's running to be running
'Cause it's all she knows to do
She's a tumbleweed rolling
A river running wild
A hurricane blowing
She's the calm after the storm
Under an Appalachian sunset sky

She's like rain when she rolls in
But that sunshine in her thunder
Makes the loneliest heart wonder
If the ride is worth the pain
Might not be stone clouds inside
Oh but don't you worry friend

Zac Brown Band,"Can’t tell where the sky begins and the water ends
No clouds to hide the sun
Waves playing me a symphony upon the sand
I lay drifting on the ocean with this bottle in my hand

Sat down on the boardwalk for a little while
Your memory my company
Something about this place had a way to make you smile
You always loved this island breeze

The wind whistling across my bottle still can’t blow away the sorrow
That tomorrow you won’t be here with me
So I raise it up and toast the day we met
I won’t forget the way you love me, the amazing way you love me

It’s bittersweet, you see
You’re not here but I can feel you
Every memory is on the tip of my tongue
Close my eyes, see your face, hold on tight to yesterday
Praying when I wake, it was just a dream
It’s bittersweet

Doctor said there’s nothing we can do
Took my hand said take me home
To the only place with half a chance to take the pain away
Make me feel alive before I go

You said life is only borrowed
So let’s wash away our sorrow
That tomorrow I won’t be here with you
Go and live your life with no regrets and don’t forget how much I love you
I love you

It’s bittersweet, you see
You’re not here but I can feel you
Every memory is on the tip of my tongue
Close my eyes, see your face, hold on tight to yesterday
Praying when I wake, it was just a dream
It’s bittersweet

I brought you back just like you wanted
So you don’t ever have to leave
And when I poured you across the southern sky, I couldn’t help but to cry
I know you finally got your wings

Pillow talk by candlelight

Been looking for a melody

Gandhi said eye for an eye
Makes the whole world go blind

Know you get what you give
Love one another

That I’ll be leaving
Been looking for a truth
I can believe in
I got everything I need
Let this heart be my guide

I’m not saying I’m a wise man
Heaven knows there’s much that I’m still finding
Making my way down this winding road
Holding on to what I love
Yeah, and leaving the rest behind
For love, for music, for life

Know you get what you give
Love one another

We’re all in this world together
Life’s a gift that we have to treasure
Happiness, now that is the measure

I'd wish this moment was ours to own it

That made our wish come true, oh yeah (come true)

Is where I should be too

Zac Efron,"The day a door is closed
The echoes fill your soul
They won't say which way to go
Just trust your heart

To find you're here for
Open another door
But I'm not sure anymore
It's just so hard

Voices in my head
Tell me they know best
Got me on the edge
They're pushin', pushin'
They're pushin'
I know they've got a plan
But the balls in my hands
This time its man-to-man
I'm driving, fighting inside

A world that's upside down
Spinning faster
What do I do now? without you

I don't know, where to go, what's the right team
I want my own thing. so bad I'm gonna scream
I can't choose, so confused,what's it all mean
I want my own dream. so bad I'm gonna scream

I'm kickin' down the walls
I gotta make 'em fall
Just break through them all
I'm punchin', crashin', I'm gonna
Fight to find myself
Me and no one else
Which way, I can't tell
I'm searchin', searchin', can't find the
Road that I should take
I should! turn right or left is
It's like nothing works without you

I don't know, where to go, what's the right team
I want my own thing, so bad I'm gonna scream
I can't choose, so confused, what's it all mean
I want my own dream, so bad I'm gonna scream

Yeah, the clock's running down
Hear the crowd gettin' loud
I'm consumed by the sound
Is it her, is it love
Can the music ever be enough
Gotta work it out, gotta work it out
You can do it, you can do it

I don't know, where to go, what's the right team
I want my own thing, so bad I'm gonna scream
I can't choose, so confused, what's it all mean
I want my own dream, so bad I'm gonna scream

I don't know, where to go, what's the right team
I want my own thing, I want my own thing
I can't choose, so confused!, what's it all mean
