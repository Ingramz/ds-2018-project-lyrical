Miss Marie,"How can I be sure in a world that's constantly changing?
How can I be sure where I stand with you?

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
I wanna die 'cause you know I wanna stay with you.
How do I know?  Maybe you're trying to use me.
Flying too high can confuse me.  Touch me but don't take me down.

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
My alibi is telling people I don't care for you.
Maybe I'm just hanging around with my head up upside down.
It's a pity, I can't seem to find someone who's as pretty
 and lovely as you.

How can I be sure?  I really really really wanna know.
I really really really wanna know.  Oh.

How can I be sure in a world that's constantly changing?
How can I be sure?  I'll be sure with you.",How Can I Be Sure,2004
Miss Mary,"I had a dream,
A long happy dream,
That kind of dream you don't wanna wake up from.

I had a dream,
I thought you were with me,
Let's move away where nothing can touch us.

I had a dream,
And maybe you'd like to follow me,
To the country.
Where nothing really happens.

I have something you can call a weakness.
I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,
In this town.

I have a feeling,
It could be simple.
A horse and lake,
And then just the forest.

And you and me are riding from all the troubles.
From all the people,
All the houses,
We have passed,
They follow us,
But nobody can catch us.

I have something you can call a weakness.
I cannot breathe the air I so desperately wanted to breathe,
A couple of years ago.",Dreaming of You,2005
Miss Mary,"Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same
Will it make it easier on you
Now you got someone to blame

You say
One love
One life
When it's one need
In the night
It's one love
We get to share it
It leaves you baby
If you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well it's too late
Tonight
To drag the past out
Into the light
We're one
But we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness
Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much
More than a lot
You gave me nothing
Now it's all I got
We're one
But we're not the same
We hurt each other
Then we do it again

You say
Love is a temple
Love a higher law
Love is a temple
Love the higher law
You ask me to enter
But then you made me crawl
And I can't be holding on
To what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love
One blood
One life
You got to do what you should

One life
With each other
Sisters
Brothers

One life
But we're not the same
We get to carry each other
Carry each other

One

"Miss Mary, Sweets","Love you madly
Right or wrong
Sounds like a lyric of a song
But since it's so
I thought you oughta know

And that's for sure
Just like I said before

Good things come to those who wait
So just relax and wait for fate

Miss May I,"So why doesn't it all just come for us?*
Only the strong will survive
A future, a beauty, a happening.

Can't this be for all of us
Just a happy ending
Can't this be for all of us
Just a happy ending

Breathless bodies raise their fists into the air
These circles of hatred is all we will ever see
A curse given to the willing
Forever remember this
For our time is upon us

Apologies are for the weak
Wish and dream not only for what you are missing
Wish and dream for everything
Be by my side this was supposed to last forever, last forever
Yous wish and dream not only for what you are missing,
You are missing

The sky will be the same for both of us
It will rise and then it will fall
The sky will be the same for both of us
A curse given to the willing
Forever remember this
For our time is upon us
Apologies are for the weak",Apologies Are for the Weak,2009
Miss May I,"Wanted
For my time spent
Searching for the world.
I receive all I ever dream for,
In return all is taken away
Remember everything before tonight.
I remember everything before tonight.
These illusions that life is so clear
Have been cleansed from my thoughts.
Floating branches are the only things
Truly connected to the ground

Take me back to how it used to be
I'll never close my eyes again
How could I ever forget a place like this?
Somewhere that I can call my own
My eyes will never see where I'm suppose to be.

Take me back to how it used to be
I'll never close my eyes again
How could I ever forget a place like this?
Somewhere that I can call my own.

This is satisfaction
In it's most
Beautiful state.
Beautiful state
Surrounding me
Is everything
That is true,
Just let this be true,
Let this be

I won't forget this place
I won't forget, this is my own
I won't forget, open my eyes
I won't forget.

Six zeros
Dot zero
Here it go
Back to runnin' circles 'round bitches
Now we squared up
Hold up

Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care

Fuck the other side, they jealous
We got a banquette full the broads
They got a table full of fellas
And they ain't spending no cake
They should throw they hand in

Miss Pamela,"I was walking down the street the other day
A sight came before my eyes
It was a little hippie boy
I must have been twice his size

His appearance typefied his strange breed
Gaudy clothes, long stringy hair hanging down
I'd seen perhaps a thousand
In my early trips to town

As he walked on beside me on down the block
I noticed no unpleasing smell
He might have been on the weed or even LSD
But if he was I couldn't tell

So we walked together that way through this neighborhood
Finally he turned around to me and he
He said ""friend you know we're a million miles apart
But you know something?
We can enjoy the sunshine and the weather
So why don't we put our differences aside
And just talk to each other?
You see this box beneath my arm?
To you it's plain, it has no charm
But to someone dearest to my heart
This box has played a tragic part

This little one can't tell you himself
About his life and how he died
But if anyone else could speak for him,
I guess I'm qualified
This boy was in Chicago, he didn't know why he was there
He was with his family and friends and he didn't really care
You might have been one of those who saw
The struggle there on your television screen
The tragic thing is so much else happened

That no one else could have seen
A stranger handed this boy a dollar
To do a simple chore
To carry a package to a nearby hotel

And when he returned he'd get two more
But when he came back he sort of lost his way walking through the crowd
One of them things you ask yourself,
How the Lord allowed

But when he was found he was like he is now,
Dreaming sweet and still
And in his little hand was a crumpled dollar bill
Now you can take that dollar
Get four cents on it, compound it quarterly at any downtown bank

So they can back some hot new tank or atom bomb
Well, what I'm going to tell you now, you can stay or you can leave
You kind of listened to my story so far but just one more thing
It's the same for any hippie, bum or hillbilly out on the street

Just remember this little boy and never carry more than you can eat
Now could you help us sing this song, please

There will be peace in the valley for him now we pray
I will think of the little hippie boy that way",Hippie Boy,1969

I throw my hands up high
And have a party for one

I'm having a me party
A party by myself
A me party!
I don't need nobody else

I'm having a me party
I'm the first and last to show
There's no one at this party
That I don't already know

I'm not gonna sit around
By myself and wait for you
Haven't you heard
One is the new two

I'm gonna make a scene
I'm gonna make a fuss
Tonight I'm gonna celebrate with
Just the one of us

I'm having a me party
I don't need no invitation
A me party
I just love the conversation

Me party

A party for one, not two ,you do the math Frog
It means I don't need you

I won't lie,
There are times
When I wish I was with you
There are days when all this girl can see
Is a world that's made for two
At times like this I feel alone
And it's like nobody cares
But I only have to call my name
And darling I'll be there!

I'm having a me party
Haven't I seen me here before
A me party
I'm the last one on the dance floor

Me party
A party just for moi

This is solo mardi gras

Me party
I'm such good company

The day has come for us to say I do
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Nothing in the world means more to me than you

I've waited so patiently
I knew you were the only frog for me
Always knew this day would come
It's written in the stars, it's destiny

So how can something so right
Feel so wrong tonight
After all we've been through
Why do I feel I don't know you

We'll settle down and start a family
Have a mini you and a mini me
A little pink frog and a little green piggy
They'll learn to say hello, and say goodbye
We'll grow grey and old, and live the quiet life
Just you and I
Hand in hand we'll stay together
Forever and ever

So how can something so right
Feel so wrong tonight
After all we've been through
Why do I feel I don't know you

How can something so right feel so wrong inside
How can something so good, leave me feeling so bad
How can my dreams coming true, leave me lonely and blue
How come the happiest day of my life is so sad
How can I feel the high when I feel so low

After all we've been through after coming so far
Is this my destiny

Ich bin wach. Sirenen und Krach auf der Straße
Stechende Brust. Fiepen im Ohr. 10000 schwarze Schafe
Ach, es macht keinen Sinn - Augenränder bis zum Kinn
Mein Körper völlig am Ende, doch mein Kopf will gerade beginnen
Hau mich hin in das gemachte Nest, mach den Matratzen-Test
Schweißgebadet, fast wie 'n Wasserbett
Die Gedanken rennen durch den Verstand man
Ich will pennen, verdammt man, wo bleibt der Sandmann?
Meine Uhr muss kaputt sein
Denn der Zeiger dreht sich so schnell
Die Zeit vergeht zu schnell
Der Tag wird die Hölle, draußen wird's hell
Ich kriech' unter die Decke, versteck mich und verriegel mein Schloss

Öffne den kleinen unterm Spiegel versteckten Schrank in meinem Bad und sehe diese Pillen

Nur ein paar Träume stellen sich ihnen in den Weg
Und es tut fürchterlich weh, wenn der Hahn morgens kräht

Geh raus aus Instinkt, sauf mich mit links untern Tisch
Gar kein Problem, ich bin jung, hab Angst irgendwas zu verpassen
Ich bin Marsi, ich würde 8 Tage durchtanzen - würden sie mich lassen
Doch die Geier kreisen, Gedanken verpackt in Endlosschleifen
Von allen Seiten quietschende Reifen, oh mein Gott, diese Welt lässt mich leiden
Ich setz mich und nehm' diese Pillen gegen meinen Willen

Happy birthday, happy birthday

Sit and listen, sit and listen

I walked down the street on the sidewalks so cold
I walked down the street into the coat that folds

Why it should be thus all the day long;

Farther along we'll know more about it,
Farther along we'll understand why;
Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine,
We'll understand it all by and by.

Sometimes I wonder why I must suffer,
Go in the rain, the cold, and the snow,
When there are many living in comfort,
Giving no heed to all I can do.

Tempted and tried, how often we question
Why we must suffer year after year,
Being accused by those of our loved ones,

E'en though we've walked in God's holy fear.

When death has come and taken our loved ones,
Leaving our home so lone and so drear,
Then do we wonder why others prosper,
Living so wicked year after year.

'Faithful till death' said our loving Master;
Short is our time to labor and wait;
Then will our toiling seem to be nothing,
When we shall pass that beautiful gate.

Hear the last trumpet sound through the sky;
Then we will meet those gone on before us,
Then we shall know and understand why.",Farther Along,1963

Don't stand close to the candy man
He'll leave a big candy stick in your hand
He sold some candy to sister Bad
The very next day she took all he had
If you try his candy, good friend of mine
You sure will want it for a long long time
His stick candy don't melt away
It just gets better, so the ladies say

Mississippi Sheiks,"Was all the summer, and all the fall,
Just trying to find my little all in all
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

Was in the spring, one summer day
Just when she left me, she's gone to stay
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

An' you come here runnin', holdin' up your hand
Can't get me a woman, who can just kill a man
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

It have been days, I didn't know your name
Why should I worry and prayer in vain
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

Goin' to the station, down in the yard
Gone get me a freight train, worked some, got hard
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

The lonesome days, they have gone by
Why should you beg me and say goodbye
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world",Sitting on Top of the World,1992

I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1994

I been sippin' on Cavalli that shits so strong
Like Paris Hilton, gotta carry me home

Forgot where I parked, and lost my iPhone
Still lookin' good and pretty
Bad bitch in every city
Rocks, diamonds, I got plenty
Ice for the cup, now pour the Henney
Escorted in the club, I brought the whole team
Ain't no guest, it's a rock-star theme
Everybody lookin' of course it's the queen
They admirin' the crown, and the 10 caret ring
I'm known for pimpin' these rappers
I should get an Oscar award for my acting
When they actually think that I'm feelin' em
That's when I take they money, then I'm killin' em

Plus I'm gonna make it rain
So much money they think she's insane

With a 7 digit figga you should come in by the bar

If gettin money is a crime, then I confess
Ain't about money? I could care less
When you see us comin know it's time to collect
Niggaz be like, ""Here come the IRS!""
Kick down doors, shoot through walls
Queen Bee's a movement, fight for the cause
Got a bite that's bigger than ""Jaws""
With or without my boys, I still make noise

New York - when Kim say, ""Can you hear me now?""
That's when y'all turn it up
Midwest - when Kim say, ""Can you hear me now?""
That's when y'all burn it up
L.A. - when Kim say, ""Can you hear me now?""
Y'all make them cars jump
Dirty South - when Kim say, ""Can you hear me now?""
That's when y'all get it crunk!

My last album, some of y'all wasn't ready for it
Alright, I slow it up, put the brakes on for ya
I know what I'm doin, I ain't losin my mind
I'm just so advanced I'm ahead of my time
You all stuck at the back, I'm ahead of the line
Even in the dark, I'm still gon' shine
You'll see what I mean in 2009
I kick outer space raps - ILL RHYMES
Live guitars, nigga fuck cars
I'm tryin to buy a spaceship to get to Mars
Look out the window, and reach for the stars
It's a new day, Lil' Kim's in charge
Got a big dick, I'll bone you out
Like money in the bank, loan you out
If you ain't straight I'll comb you out
Lil' Kim and Scott Storch be zonin out!

Ain't wanna do it, but now I got to pop my collar
You actin like y'all real tough act to follow
I got medallions the size of a half a dollar
And about to buy my best friend a beauty parlor
I know y'all don't wanna see Kim on top
Please stop worryin about what I got
What the fuck y'all know about the Yonker Rock
When I'm cookin, keep your hands out my pot
Them boys ain't bad and ain't no bitch greater
Stop tryin to use me as a respirator
I'm the same bitch on the escalator
And I still ain't got no time for you fuckin haters
I might start my day at Piarage'
Or with a Mafia meetin at the Brooklyn Cafe
""Okay, y'all wanna play?""
Like 9/11, you gon' remember this day

When I go by, smoke in your eyes
So open your eyes, the joke's on you guys

Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I'll get my bodyguard, You'll get that booty scarred,
I'm a veteran which means that I've been
In the game too long Since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I float like a butterfly sting like a bee,
Spectacular on the M I C,
I go for broke, Never giving it less than the best
Many years in the game at your request,
You like the rhyme bite if you dare,
I get the paper so I don't care,
Fly that's me the epitome
Of what a real MC is supposed to be,
Fucking you up every time that I drop,
Fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the best and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you back off me and let my skin breathe,
Lyte is everlasting it's hard to believe
I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, don't plan to get down.
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun,
If you don't understand just say you don't(nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best,
West to East See East to West,
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive.
It's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics,
I got many witnesses who can back this
Ruffnecks from New York to LA
Been down with me since Poor Georgie.
It's '96, it's all about show and prove
And I'm about to make the ill type moves,
I guide the beat and ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you get out my shit, please let me be,
I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that,
Trying to get over like a fat rat,
But I understand, I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop,
It goes on, on, on, on
You see the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver,
Chillin with a pina colada,
Kidada hooked me up with Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, Don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit
Done
All on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you
You betta get down with your real crew,
Cause I ride the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Missy Elliott,"I know there somebody out there who had a nasty nasty friend 
Who wanna go around humping everybody
Can I get a hoe? You know what I'm saying? 
So I'ma talk about this one I had a fewa years ago

I had a friend named Cutie Tootie
Tootie turned tricks to get some Gucci
Known as loose bootie
Truly, she was a freak in the evenin'
And if she wasn't teasin', then give me one reason
Why she do dat? Always knew dat
She was hot as da nectar
Hector said he pecked her, disrespected her
'Cause he bang bang swang in his dingalang
Broke his back long range
And make the ugly bitch sing

Ooh ooh
Why you hurtin' me?
Tell me why more
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Why you hurtin' me?
Tell me why more
Ooh ooh

Cutie Tootie with her sight
And if she humped Ralph
She humped Bobby, Ricky and Mike
Tight, is the way she wore her dresses
Has she learned her lesson
From all the dick testing
Now I'm guessing
She's laying in a casket
In a yellow basket
For a Gucci jacket
Daggit, I wish she didn't do those nasty things
'Cause he made the ugly bitch sing

Ooh ooh
Why you hurtin' me?
Tell me why more
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Why you hurtin' me?
Tell me why more
Ooh ooh

Tootie didn't know the facts of life
Staying up in clinics
Loosy bootie made trife
Feeling, she got the heeby geebies
Quick to give you freebies
Underneath the staircase in Brooklyn
Neighbors out the window sure was lookin'
She greasy like chicken
I don't give a cotton pick and
She can do her thing
'Cause me and her don't hang
The ugly bitch sang

Ooh ooh
Why you hurtin' me?
Tell me why more
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Why you hurtin' me?
Tell me why more
Ooh ooh

So you know what? This should be a lesson for anybody
Who's hanging with someone who's dirty, nasty, stank
Once again going around humping everybody
Everybody and anybody and anything
That's why you make the ugly bitch sing",Why You Hurt Me,1997

How to be a player squeezin' on your tushy

Eating Rice-A-Roni with Toni Toni Tone
Keep Cindy Crawford, to me she's to boney
See another Rain, unless you know Missy
Clown suit on so don't you dare diss me

Now I'm gonna make my rap only eight bar
On this track Maganoo's the star
One of my favorite rapper's Nas Escobar
I listen to his tape driving in my car
Now let me get back into the groove
Tap the person standing next to you
Tell him or she to move side to side
And tell them to keep the party live to live

Boogie jumps me
Got to move my knees straight down to my feet
Down to my hands, clap, clap
Tell me where the party at? Where we boogie at?

Stealin' our beats like you're the one who made 'em
Timbaland's the teacher and I'm the one who grades 'em
Check the verbatim, F is how we rate 'em
How dare you make 'em, jus like we made 'em
And I won't play 'em, and I won't say 'em

Well I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled
Pop the same shit that got Tupac killed
Spit game to these hoes, like a soap opera episode
And punch a bitch in the nose, til her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate: girls, women and bitches
Smack bitches that walk up, and drop-kick midgets
Call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward
Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Comin' through the airport, sluggish, walkin' on crutches
Hit a fuckin' [*pregnant chick*] in her [*stomach*] with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out, and back out
Lookin' for some other thug, to beat the crap out
I'm bringin' you rap singers two middle fingers
I flip you off in French, then translate in English
Then I'ma vanish off the face of the planet and come back

Mad at you, had you mad at me automatically (one more time)
I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity
Who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following
It's so big, if I counted up all the freaks who follow me
I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world
Full of earl, head twirls every time the toilet swirls *flush*
Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up
I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up (SHUT UP!)
I made this rap game suspenseful, cause now I got a impulse
To give you insults wrote with a pencil (bitch)
And waste the paper on you, choppin' down the oakwood
Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin'
You motherfuckers are puttin' your words together for nuttin'

With the bullet holes and the exit wounds layin' next to you
(AHH!) Fuckin' mad dog, foamin' at the mouth
Fuck mouth, my whole house, is foamin' at the couch
Jumped out of the ninety third floor of a building
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground (KEEP FILMING!)
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped em in half
Suffocated the oxygen mask

Good riddance, to niggas and bitches bullshitting
I house MC's like baths and full kitchens, ready or not

Its two not one, Missy dot dot com, come once in the blue like free hot lunch
So once its on, turn it up, chickens flocking in
Shoppin at birds are us, murderous, don't blame me, blame the music
I write with napalms in my hands, flame the fuses, like ca psss, off you go
I'm nice batting, I practice when the park is closed
I'm that man who squats out of jeeps and vans
Jump to roof to roof on the TV cam, I fuck a model
I go out with the cheapest tramps, pussy have me tripping
Like Kima, Keisha and Pam, I remain cool like, like open house on a school night
Animal House getting thrown out for food fights, PPP strictly don't give a fuck
An Brick City niggas strictly don't give a fuck

Hang down to your knees, its mwa the don-wan, carry on, D.A.N to the danger

Now my arm close hang up, my crew is deeper than Karl Kani pockets
We don't buy bullets, we ask what size rockets, for thee occasion
One shot will have you ravin', like Simone when the four four is blown

Alright",Ain't Got No Dough,1999
Missy Elliott,"I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the Henny Rimmy
I didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind
It felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
Used to pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep,I took the keys to the jeep
Tell him ""I'll be back,"" go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, hoe hop
Raw top in my mans drop
Then this homey Jimmy, he's screamin ""Gimme""
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanel's, kept me out nice
Cold suckin' his dick, rockin' tha mike
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand
Somethin' that coulda made his ass a real man
Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy
the motherfucker never ate my pussy

[Chorus:
I don't want dick tonight, eat my pussy right
Uh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now

I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush and Avenue you
Had a weedspot, used to pump African black
He used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't cap
I used to see him, in the tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear he want to get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I ain't frontin'
The sex was wack, a four stroke creep
I jumped on his dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him
""I thought your ass was still sleepin.""
He laughed, told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?
I'll pass, nigga the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double plat
The only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me
Downtown taste my love like Horace Brown
Tryin' to impress me with your five G stones
I give you ten G's nigga if you leave me alone, screamin'

[Chorus:]

The moral of the story is this
You ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this
And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with
They ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this
I ain't with that frontin' shit
I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends
Me and my girls rock worlds, some big niggas
Fuck for car keys, and double digit figures
Good dick I cherish, I could be blunt
I treat it like it's precious, I ain't gonna front
For limp dick niggas, that's frontin' like they willy
Suck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me?

For the show stopper, this for the know nadas

And wait for me to finish performing backstage
Never have a nigga yawning

Get down, bitches, if he feel me, rich now

We got hits out nigga need big clout
Don't crowd my space if we dip out
Running with some other nigga face he don't trip out

You coming home to dishes and empty soda cans
I got your bitch up in my Rover man

In fact I diss her I'm a bolder man

When your ho put my stuff in the dash
Bust in her ass
To climax I come up with a nab

Niggas rushing, coming at us cause of status and props
Sucking and fucking, loving it when I put tha dick up inside her

Gotcha open wide

Just let me sell fifty million
Then I'll call it quits

How else can I say it
I don't speak
No other languages

You hear that beat don'tcha?
That's just Timmy talkin'
Go 'head throw dem bows
Fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us
Will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose
Ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just
Forget what we discussin'

Came from nothin'
Now you see it triples
I bet she slurp tonight
Lames hide your wallets
Hatin' broads
Clutch your purses tight

You with the wrong crowd
And if you feelin' brave then
Better sport that thong proud
And if you finally breathin'

Dat bitch, wrappin' her hair in Barbie pins
When the pressure's on, you'll find a bomb in your car
In your trunk on the road to Arlington

Yo, dat bitch, the one that'll take control
Brought me a 2 way when my pager broke
Dat bitch, that'll love to fuck, take it in the butt
When the Doc comes, she won't wipe it up

Dat bitch, that'll whip a car better than me
Yo, dat bitch, splittin' cigars better than me
Dat bitch, tattoos on her back an' arm
An' you see my name when the track is on

Dat bitch, that'll jump out dolo
With her toes in a pump with a shotgun pumped out
Dat bitch, that'll roll proper, two phones
One for tricks an' one for callin' the Doctor

Dat bitch, that'll give me brain when I'm thinkin'
Dat bitch, that's makin' me more insane than a ink pen
Dat bitch, that ain't scared to whoop her kids
Know to bail Doc out when my ass in the precinct

Hide me out at her father's house

Or just an imitator
Stealin' our beats like you're the one who made 'em

Check the verbatim, F is how we rate 'em
How dare you make 'em, jus like we made 'em
And I wont play 'em, and I won't say 'em

I'm not your smooth lovin, see me at Casbah thuggin
Hands where your Stove Top be stuffing
Never catch Tical hand-cuffin, I'm in your party puffin
Smelling like that Wu-Tang production
Cousin tried to tell me pussy come a dime a dozen
And when it come around I'll beat it down like percussion
Missy come and get me, I'm bout to call Doc
We can all meet up at Peanut's, I heard it was the spot
Somebody roll the weed up, push the car lighter, kick your feet up
Saturday Night, who got the Fever?
Brought the flavor, of Indonesia
Puff puff give type procedures
And this joint bumping out your speakers

Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I'll get my bodyguard, You'll get that booty scarred,
I'm a veteran which means that I've been
In the game too long Since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I float like a butterfly sting like a bee,
Spectacular on the M I C,
I go for broke, Never giving it less than the best
Many years in the game at your request,
You like the rhyme bite if you dare,
I get the paper so I don't care,
Fly that's me the epitome
Of what a real MC is supposed to be,
Fucking you up every time that I drop,
Fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the best and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you back off me and let my skin breathe,
Lyte is everlasting it's hard to believe
I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, don't plan to get down.
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun,
If you don't understand just say you don't(nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best,
West to East See East to West,
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive.
It's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics,
I got many witnesses who can back this
Ruffnecks from New York to LA
Been down with me since Poor Georgie.
It's '96, it's all about show and prove
And I'm about to make the ill type moves,
I guide the beat and ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

Would you get out my shit, please let me be,
I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that,
Trying to get over like a fat rat,
But I understand, I'm a woman in the land of hip-hop
And the shit don't stop,
It goes on, on, on, on
You see the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver,
Chillin with a pina colada,
Kidada hooked me up with Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, Don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit
Done
All on the catwalk, what they've ever done for you

You just pop the truck
Pull the car up and the line is packed, and you far
You tired a' waiting, you better be catch a charge like
""Move bitch, get out the way"", flash the bouncer to get out a payin'
And that sound make you want to get on stage
Oh, you gotta' ""move dem thangs""
Beat change, it's a Cool-a-Dre thing
That'll move your thang thang, remove your ring change the sound
Get your jewels all sweated up, the booze is deaded up
Anything goes bring it back, if you just catchin' up
The sound coming outta' the club - that's wassup!
And they let you up, finally, dancing it up
Movin' aroung, DJ Keith - I need that sound (da-mn)

[Chorus]
That new shit, that hot shit
Make you move shit, what's that sound?
That move crowds, that new sound
Make you can kick down, who's that chick?
That's Angie, them bambi's
Screamin' Angie, what's that sound?
And this Missy gettin' tipsy off the wiskey

2002 be sceered, cause I'm runnin' this shit this year
Haters 'n haters you better be clear
Or you'll be kissin' my pussy on the rear
What I'm talking 'bout, with my filthy mouth, from the Dirty South
Is a drug-drop, see'mon check me out
Ain't nobody does it easy-seezy
And ain't nobody got the dick to sling me (ow!)
God damn, what's that sound?
Didn't I tell you I'm about to shake it down
I'm no punk, but a killa like Cam
Get on the flo', yes yes mam
When I show up the club get cram
Insecure bitch watch yo man!
Me and Ang like butter on toast
I don't mean to boast, but we do
[Angie:] I need that yea

[Chorus]

Hello-oh? oh that's my ears ringing
I'm sitting here thinking that sound is still bangin'
As we leavin' the spot I'm still drinking
Gotta' leave cause the cops are still waiting
So we circle the block, as we workin' to blot
Then purposely watch, we so blingin'
And the truck is bright, light up the night
Blinking, as we stuck in the chair feel like we sinking
That sound still drowned the air waves
The echo in my head feel like a bear cave
So I sit back to the sound of this track
Playin' on my way home, I can't forget that
That beat when you hear from the street
Make you want to get on the floor and don't even speak
Cause it don't even matter who be around
Get, and that's DJ Keith, playin' that sound (I need that)

We brake down hoes, we brake down foes
Run through pockets just straight down yo's

Swallow my pride, let it ride
And parted, but this body felt just like mine

Missy Elliott,"Basically, can't fuck with me

I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
Find out my mental's based on instrumental
Records hey  so I can write monumental
Methods, I'm not the King
But niggas is decaf I stick 'em for the cream
Check it  just how deep can shit get
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad fish accept it
In your Cross Color clothes you've crossed over
Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Kross
Who the boss? Niggas get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
I be hectic, and coming for the head piece protect it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket, niggas want the ruckus
Bustin' at me bruh, now bust it
Styles, I gets buckwild
Method Man on some shit, pulling niggas files
I'm sick, insane, crazy, Drivin' Miss Daisy
Out her fuckin' mind now I got mine I'm Swayze

Is it real son, is it really real son
Let me know it's real son, if it's really real
Something I could feel son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal son, if it's really real

And when I was a lil' stereo (Stereo)
I listened to some champion (Champion)
I always wondered (Wondered)
Will now I be the number one (Tical hahaha)
Now you listen to the Gargon (Gargon)
And the Gargon summary
And any man dat come test me (Test me)
Me gwanna lick out them brains (It's like that)

Brothers want to hang with the Meth bring the rope
The only way you hang is by the neck nigga poke
Off the set comin' to your projects
Take it as a threat, better yet it's a promise
Comin' from a vet on some old Vietnam shit
Nigga you can bet your bottom dollar hey I bomb shit
And it's gonna get even worse word to God
It's the Wu comin' through sickin niggaz for they garments
Movin' on your left, southpaw em it's the Meth
Came to represent and carve my name in your chest
You can come test realize you're no contest
Son I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four
Nine three eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me aiy, give it to me raw
I've learned when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a hoe
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay da mo'

What, basically that, Meth-Tical, ninety-four style
Word up we be hazardous
Northern spicy brown mustard hoes
We have to stick you

Is it real son, is it really real son
Let me know it's real son, if it's really real
Something I could feel son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal son, if it's really real

I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin' cut your kneecaps off
And make you kneel in some staircase piss

I'll fuckin', cut your eyelids off
And feed you nuthin' but sleepin' pills

You motherfuckers

Fuck the hoe

Yeah, uh huh, okay
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Cris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lifted a hand
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Steeped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
All around the world on the microphone
Leaving the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me

Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache and it's not from tumors
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight

But I just got to slow it down for just a second
So bear wit me you know first before i do that 
I just wanna talk about how people always say
Yo thats too nasty and why your mouth so vulgar
Why why you gotta sing all these nasty records and all that
But I be representing the ladies and we got something to say
We been quiet too long lady-like very patient
We didn't get mad when Prince has his ass out
We thought he was gone turn around to the front 
And have the front out too but you know that didn't happen
We always had to deal wit wit the guy you know 
Talking about how they gone wear us out on records
And and you know I had to do records that strictly representing for my
ladies and and how to keep your man 
Keep his eyes from wandering looking around
And sex is not a topic that we should always sweep underneath 
the rug
And I'm not saying go out and do it but if you do
Strap it up before you smack it up, flip it, slow it down
Oh nooo Jimmy drop it

From the bed to the floor, to the sink to the shower
With her back to the bed and her legs to the sky

Missy Elliott,"In December 
Every sign has its own mode
I was in love with a Sagittarius
See the emotions he put me through
From Capricorns to Aquarius
They all got their different minds
The affection of a Virgo
Which sign matches good with mine?

I was in love with a Sagittarius, he blew my mind
He also had a flip side, too much like a Gemini
He was freaky like a Taurus the way he handled me, yeah
Flirtatious like an Aries, which sign is best for me?

Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh (yeah)
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, I love all y'all (yeah)
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh (hey)
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, I love all y'all (oh, hey)

I wish he was a Virgo (Virgo), the same sign as me (ooh me)
And know how to show me love 'cause I've been hurt by a Pisces
Rewind
I wish he was a Virgo (Virgo), the same sign as me (me)
And know how to show me love 'cause I've been hurt by a Pisces
I want him sexy like a Scorpio
The way he holds me close, yeah
Sensitive as a Cancer, every sign from coast to coast

Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, I love all y'all
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, I love all y'all

I can't explain why I love him
Bossy like Leos do
Got game like an Aquarius
Switch moves after he been with you
Fun like a Libra
He stays on my mind
He's so unpredictable (oh)
He reminds me of every sign

Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh (hey)
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, I love all y'all
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, I love all y'all

Every sign from the first to the last (woah, woah)
Every day of the month has its good and its bad (every day of the month)
I love you all, all twelve signs (I love you all, ah)

Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh (ah oh)
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, oh (ah oh)
Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus 
Gemini, Cancer, oh (say rough when he hug me at night)

Uh huh, every one of these signs 
You know you blowin' me away (oh, be rough when he hug me at night, oh)
No matter when you're born 
For sure with me you okay (say rough when he hug me at night)
I love every one of y'all 
No matter what sign you are (say rough when he hug me at night)
January to December, here's my open arms

I was in love with a Sagittarius (hey, da da da da da da)
I was in love with a Sagittarius (da da, na na, da da da da da)

Once upon a time in Kyla park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Cris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap 
No one lift a hand 
So he went about his bidness 
And devised the plan
Made a CD then he hit the block
Fifty thousand sold, seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone, three years later
Steped out the swamp with ten and a half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leaves your boobs smellin like Burberry cologne 
Still ride the chrome 
Got bidness in the kitchen 
Never home alone 
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll gimmie 
Ludacris, I look lord like Timmy 
Had the Clint East rumor
I got a head ache and its not a tumor
Get up on my lap get my head tucked tight
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bite
I'm hard to the core
Core to the right
You drop down turn around pick up hella clipe (ya)

Yo straight up, Missy killed that shit tonight foreal
I know I don't really care bout her being pregnant by Micheal Jackson
You know what we should do? 
We should go get her album when it come out, what she gon do she gon do, shh
Hi Missy! 
Hi Missy?!

You think I ain't knowin why'all broke Milli Vanilli Jay Jay fan wannabes ain't over here gossiping bout me? 
Yo how bout you buff these Pumas for 20 cents or your lights won't get cut off

Who gon roll up in the club and then report that next week
Just wanna see who I am fucking boy
Sniffing some coke
I know by the time I finish this line I'm a hear this on the radio

Yeah, uh huh, okay
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Cris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lifted a hand
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Steeped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
All around the world on the microphone
Leaving the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me
Ludacris I live loud just like Timmy
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache and it's not from tumors
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bight
Hard to the core
Core to the right
Drop down turn around pick a bale of cotton

Escaping from all ya fraudulent players
Last but not least, the heavyweight champion, Mr. Mosley

It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without some little nieces and nephews
To cover all the beats, and the rhymes I been through
Time's up, sorry I left you
Thinking of this, I keep repeating them hits
Like that Aaliyah, Timberlake, or Missy Elliott shit (Shit)
As you sit by the radio, hands on the dial tone
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Jump when you hear them speakers left it off (Off)
Mr. VA 'bout to set it off
Well I don't know what you heard, and I don't know what ya know
Well my folks don' told me, (YOU GOT IT! Oh)

When you say you love me, it doesn't matter
It goes into my head as just chit-chatter
You may think I'm egotistical or just very free
Won'tcha say I go tell it to, TIMOTHY!
People say I'm whack, but they don't tell me so
Let them pretend to be me, then they know
I hate when one, pretend to fantasize
Fact I despise, those who even try
Sweat between my thighs {*sniff*} never stinking
Yo dream is over, career sinking
I told all of you, like I told all of them
Whatcha say to me be, DICK TO YA CHIN!

I'm not a Puerto Rican but I do look up to Vagil
And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessing, being from them VA streets
I talk sense condensed in the form of a poem
If I wasn't writing rhymes I'd be breaking in homes
I'm kinda young, so my gun's my security
I'm not afraid nucca do what you gon do to me
I get paid when your record is played
To put it short, heh I got it made
I'm talented, yes I'm gifted

But I'm the realest from the fake
that's why I'm the hardest to hate
I live baby girl I've learned to love those while ther still awake
Sleep Sleep 
And prepare a place for those who are good in the projects and hood
Give to those who are misunderstood
I know like Lisa
Pac and Biggie and Jay and Pun are still No.1
There will be more of us to come
I am a leader a teacher I gotta
Like a single parent provider
Put in back those hip hop dividers
Like a preist with a back slider
I've sinned but I win
And anyone we've lost in life from 9-11
We'll be sure to see again

I'm rockin to the beat

See I don't want to say that this is the end
I'll end by saying this is where we?ll begin
Hip hop is a freedom of expression, not a freedom of depression

Can I make my one suggestion?
Look at how we?re labeled gangsta rappers
Is that their only impression? WAKE UP!
Rappers are craft art in a rapper?s sport

Someone like a game of basketball can't be taught
But yet we accept the name thug
Like that's fly
See how they covered our eyes?

Missy Elliott,"Hey yo, Nelly! This is fire
(What you talkin' about, girl?)
Let's make it hot for the clubs
(Missy!)

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
Down South girls got them real big butts!
Real big butts make ya man want to look (Oh!)
Back it up, flip it up, skinny girls
Love my guts, so fuck a tummy tuck
(Oh yeah?) Yeah! I shakes my butt
I shakes my gut like ""yeah, bitch what?""
Yeah I likes it rough, tough
Ask your man how I'm good in handcuffs
Me and Nelly came to rock the club
Pack the place, don't push or shove
Out of the club, straight to the crib
I'll let you know if the sex was good

[Chorus: Missy Elliott (Timbaland)]
Pump it up! {Show me love, G}
Pump it up! {Let me see what you working wit'}
Pump it up! {Let me see those big-ass hips}
Pump it up! {Pump it up}
This is how me and Nelly pump it up
Pump it up! {Show me love, G}
Pump it up! {Let me see what you workin wit'}
Pump it up! {Let me see those big-ass hips}
Pump it up! {Pump it up}

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
Down south players! We got that fire!
Get up on my booty, tutti-fruiti on the rooty
I'm a thick chick, skinny girls act snooty
No matter what your size, my big thighs'll do my duty
Look at the way my rump shake like a movie (say what?)
See my tight jeans and the coochie
Spend a little looty, you gotta WORK for the booty (Yup)
Me and Nelly hot on the track (Track!)
Nelly, can't no-one ever top that (Top that!)
Niggas we came to rock the club (C'mon!)
DJs better Pump It Up
Motherfuckers need to back it up
Cause we gon' tear the roof off the club

[Chorus]

[Missy]
You know, Down South chicks got big asses
And we a little heavy sometime, but when
You're from the South, we don't call that
""fat"". We call that ""big-boned"". Fo' sho

[Verse 3: Nelly]
Yeah, ma! I heard you like the magic stick
Me? I got the gadget stick, it's like ""Go, go, gadget dick""
You know, make you climb the walls and shit
I make her want to press pause and shit
Walk up in the party, girls swingin' they panties
They was doing that before I had them brandy's
I get a little freaky when I'm in my yammy
I may act a little freaky but I still got manners
It's Nelly, felony, and Missy Misdemeanor
Both going down, there's just to many heaters
Check the records, we got records that broke records in record time
I ain't talkin' about the records that they buyin'
Lyin', can a nigga keep up with me?
You see I, still standin' VI stackin' the ""Ride Wit Me""
You struggle to recoup
I struggle on which Coup' to ride in

See how we be stylin'?

A toy every girl must have a toy
The way it make you feel

So you best believe that

A toy every girl must have a toy

Every girl has a toy now baby
A toy every girl must have a toy
The way it make you feel (Uh see'mon!)

I used to wish that you would love me
And fantasize on how we used to be
Until I discovered something better than you
I don't need no need your loving
You want to come home late at night touchin' and feelin' all over me
But I don't need no help in pleasing me

Every girl has a toy now baby

Shit I ain't choose to rhyme
Rhymin' chose me
So I hit the track runnin'
Like a nosebleed
Life ain't great now
But it's much improved
Yo' album droppin' this summer?
That sucks for you
Cause this is Bubba's moment
I put my mother on it
I said my momma
It seems as if
I love her don't it?
So buckle up, 'cause
It's gon' get bumpy
I call my girlfriends Betty's
And my shits grumpies
That Bubba talk
Gotcha open wide
I giggle outside the booth
But ain't no joke inside
This is complicated
At least to y'all it is
Just let me sell fifty million
Then I'll call it quits
But until that day
Y'all in deep doo doo
I never once saw
You crank it 'cause
I just leap through you
What you need to do
Is just admit you love me
The South has
Always been Dirty
But now it's gettin' ugly

Though I am country
Don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin' bigger
With every song I hear
Cause y'all been bullshittin'
Spittin' that booty chatter
Out here for two days and
Came with somethin'
That truly matters
On goes the saga
Of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrah
If I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now
I hate it came to this
How else can I say it
I don't speak
No other languages
I'm fairly ripped now
So this the jimmy talkin'
You hear that beat don'tcha?
That's just Timmy talkin'
Go 'head throw dem bows
Fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us
Will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose
Ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just
Forget what we discussin'
This that new South
Take a picture of me
Cause I'm a fuckin' legend
And this is gettin' ugly

Now this thang is jumpin'
Ain't it somethin'?
What makes it special
This whole moment
Came from nothin'
Now you see it triples
I bet she slurp tonight
Lames hide your wallets
Hatin' broads
Clutch your purses tight
If you ain't tryin' to live
You with the wrong crowd
And if you feelin' brave then
Better sport that thong proud
And if you finally breathin'
Then sing this song loud
I'm glad I got you wet
I know you had a long drought
Don't worry about the law
They can't arrest us all
I had to crank couldn'ta done
Nothin' less for y'all
Forget your inhibitions
I wanna see you whylin'
And if Bubba dies tonight

[Intro: Missy Elliott]
We are the VA players
Love to the Neptunes and the Clipse
To ya bootleggers we breaking off both of ya legs
The underrated Maganoo, comin' with the unexpected
The run away slave I, Mistameanor
Escaping from all ya fraudulent players
Last but not least, the heavyweight champion, Mr. Mosley
[Verse 1: Timbaland]
It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without some little nieces and nephews
To cover all the beats, and the rhymes I been through
Time's up, sorry I left you
Thinking of this, I keep repeating them hits
Like that Aaliyah, Timberlake, or Missy Elliott shit (Shit)
As you sit by the radio, hands on the dial tone
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Jump when you hear them speakers left it off (Off)
Mr. VA 'bout to set it off
Well I don't know what you heard, and I don't know what ya know
Well my folks don' told me, (YOU GOT IT! Oh)
So, ""Up Jumps the Boogie"", let the record work (Uh huh)
And put me on like you red alert
'Cause it's the big bad Timmy, Maganoo, and Missy
Like THREE THE HARD WAY!, comin' straight out of Virginia
[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
DJ's in the mix shows you better go to the record store and
COP THAT SHIT! (Oh Lord)
And to the bootleggers giving em bootlegs
We breaking off both of ya legs, COP THAT SHIT! (Oh Lord)
Stop burnin' CD's for ya friend and I'ma say it again, nucca
COP THAT SHIT! (Oh Lord)
'Cause this the hot shit, out on the streets
So when you hear this CD go and COP THAT SHIT! (Oh Lord)

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
When you say you love me, it doesn't matter
It goes into my head as just chit-chatter
You may think I'm egotistical or just very free
Won'tcha say I go tell it to, TIMOTHY!
People say I'm whack, but they don't tell me so
Let them pretend to be me, then they know
I hate when one, pretend to fantasize
Fact I despise, those who even try
Sweat between my thighs {*sniff*} never stinking
Yo dream is over, career sinking
I told all of you, like I told all of them
Whatcha say to me be, DICK TO YA CHIN!
In one ear and right out the other
""Ayyio Missy you ugly!"" yeah ya mother
I don't pay attention, I don't concentrate
You ain't got the bait, that it takes to hook this, huh

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Magoo]
I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican but I do look up to Vagil
And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessing, being from them VA streets
I talk sense condensed in the form of a poem
If I wasn't writing rhymes I'd be breaking in homes
I'm kinda young, so my gun's my security
I'm not afraid nucca do what you gon do to me
I get paid when your record is played
To put it short, heh I got it made
I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
My uppercut boy that'll get ya lifted
You got cash? man stop frontin
Living off damn every record that you cutting
My name Magoo and I roll wit two stars
Every CD we split 48 bars
My name Magoo and I'm a supadupa star
Every other month I get a brand new car!

Motherfuckers better wake up
Stop selling crack to the blacks
Hope ya brought a spare for ya flat
Cain has sent me talking real facts
Down the hill like Jill and Jack
Got speak what yo weak mind lacks
Ya heard that? I'm creative to the fullest
""What you talking bout Willis?""
Cause you talk it never kill it
I hear but don't feel it
Thou ain't realest, ya just sweet meat in the village
Yeah I'm a Don Diva Don Niva
why yall not seen her, heater squeezed into a wife beater 
Yep I'm a top leader, I got the Martin Luther King fever
I'm a feed ya what you teacher need to preach ya
It's time to get serious, black people all areas
Who goin' carry us? It ain't time to bury us
Cause music be our first love, say 'I Do' let's cherish it

If you don't got a gun (it's all right)
It you makin' legal money (it's all right)
If you got to keep your clothes on (it's all right)
You ain't got a cellular phone (it's all right)
And your wheels don't spin (it's all right)
And you gotta wear them jeans again (it's all right)
Yeah, if you tried oh well (it's all right)
Emcees stop the beef, let's sell (it's all right)

[Verse 2: Missy Elliott]
Hip-Hop better wake up, the bed to make ups
Some of why'all be faker than the dragon make up
Got issues to take up, before we break up
Like Electra let go, Missy need a baker
I love Jacob, but jewelry won't fix my place up
Gotta stay up, studio nights to cake up
Now check my flavor, rich folks is now my neighbors
I got cable, now check out how I made my paper
Hip-Hop don't stop, be my Lifesaver
Like Kobe and Shaq if they left Lakers
I'm like an elevator DJ on the crossfader
Black people wake up I'll see your ass later

Anybody in my way, I wet them
I'ma be this way till the cops come catch 'em

Missy Elliott,"The day you pissed me off
I told Mike to pick me up
I told him you was buggin' and
I don't like to fuss
He said he would look out for me
If I needed a friend
He took me to his house and then he
Invited me in
Then we sat on the couch
He put his arms around my waist
Knowin' I need lovin' then he
Gently grabbed my face
He kissed me like a guy could never
Kiss a girl before
So you know what happened baby
I need to say no more

I'm just confessing
About the things I did
I might-as-well come clean
What you feel about that baby
I'm just confessing
Bout the things I did
I might-as-well come clean
What you feel about that baby
I'm just guessing
That you through with me?
'Cause I just came clean
What you feel about that baby
I'm just guessing
Are you through with me?
'Cause I just came clean
What you, feel about that

(Verse 2)
Remember the time you wondered
Where your money went?
I called my friends
And bought some clothes
And took them on a trip
I met a dude that had a jeep
And we talked all the time
He asked me bout my man
And you know that I had to lie
He thought I had no man
And I was chillin by myself
Don't get mad
'Cause I feel sad
That's why I must confess
Too many times I wanted to
Let you know my dirt
But every time you said
You loved me I knew it would hurt

I'm just confessing
About some things I did
I might-as-well come clean
What you feel about that baby
I'm just confessing
Bout the things I did
I might-as-well come clean

I'm just guessing
That you through with me?
'Cause I just came clean
What you feel about that baby
I'm just guessing
Are you through with me?
'Cause I just came clean
What you, feel about that

I was mad what was I to do
Never had any mind to play on you
Look at all the hurt you put me through
I can't tell a lie so
I'm tellin' the truth

I was mad what was I to do
Never had any mind to play on you
Look at all the hurt you put me through
You know, you know

And just admit that things ain't the same
Instead of making me think it's all good

I'm not into wifin - no sir

Get it tight but not too tight, it's all in the lick

Go 'head, do that dance, and you can feel free
To be you and just do you, everything's great

Just leave your car in the lot, so you can feel safe
We goin' party 'til six then take it to my place
Then later on I'll have a car bring you back safe

Oh yeah, jinglin' baby 
(Well let me jump up on that ding-a-ling baby)
Ooh, gosh, you a nasty girl, sassy
Picture me layin' you inside my classic pearls

I'm about to, uh, do it slow girl
Ooh, you in control, it's in your world
She on, I think I like ol' girl
Take it out, turn around
Charlie horse, shit, threw me off balance
Wildin', all I wanted was to show you my talent
To let you know on how I rep in Staten Island
This is the reason I came to you
So we can connect it then kick it was the thing to do
'Cause we don't need no representation
Domination, got them waitin' patient

Now this is the way y'all suppose to
To get down, y'all ain't right
Somebody say ""Aha! Ghost is back!""

Pull back the curtain, let me work your sermon
Playboy don't hurt me like a virgin
You seem real determined to put a hurtin'
But if you ain't slurpin', then you better off jerkin'
You got a lot of nerve, to want to serve my curves
My 36D, 36 hips
The way I shoot the gift, I swallow coke bottles
And you would swear it was Lil' Kim lips
Eh, I really like you baby
Do you know how to wife this lady?
Give me what I want, don't talk, don't touch
Unless you got a bank account that make my face blush
Now shush, in my bush
And I can give you what you want, make a whoosh
Just throw it, I'll show you how to push
Kinky sex, tie ropes around your wrist
Come on

Tush, tush, tush
Wanna slide in the bush, bush, bush?
(I'm on top, you like push, push, push
Keep it low like shush, shush, shush)
You wanna get up in my tush, tush, tush?
You could slide in the bush, bush, bush

Keep it low like shush, shush, shush)
You wanna get up in that tush, tush, tush?

Yeah!
This-this-this-this
This is an exclusive (let's go)
Mr. Meth, you're so Def, you put them other M.C.'s out to rest (that's right)
And they test (uh-huh), but they forget (yeah) how the M-E-F is so Def (let's go)

[Method Man]
Yo, uh, come on, come on, now
Big Meth attack soon as the track come on now
Zone out, with Sean Combs and bizzy-bone out (I see you in the club)
And by one, I'm gettin' thrown out
Mami, got her toes out, ain't one army can Blaze Johnny
Like Gwen Stafani, you know there's No Doubt
I'm trill, sick with it, it's like ill
That's the only way to explain these mic skills
On Homicide Hill, anybody asks is real
The more steel, the more bodybags to fill
Can I get, hit of that hydro, nigga
I tried to quit puffin' before, but I'm no quitter
If honey show me her buns, I'll show her my ones
If the bed rockin', keep knockin' and I'mma cum
Want some, take some, I get it crunk
Speak junk, I'll slow up your road with speed bumps

[Chorus: Missy Elliott w/ P. Diddy doing ad-libs]
When they play this in the club (say what?)
Go and tell that nigga, bump that (say what?)
Throw your hands up, like nigga, what? (say what?)
Ya'll don't really really want that (say what?)
And for whatever muthafucka, don't like it (say what?)
Tell that sucka he can get back (say what?)
Misdemeanor and Meth in your area (say what?)
Are ya'll ready? Come on, play it back (saw what?)

[Method Man]
You wanna front, what? Step up and get bucked
And if your feelin' lucky, duck, then press ya'll luck
Ya'll got me effed up, over tracks overreact
Once I start, like a bullet, ain't no holdin' me back
I'm all that and two mac's, ya'll fakin' jacks
When I cock back like Busta Bust and make 'em clap
Here I go again, who blow in like whirlwinds
Who kiss girlfriends, that kiss they girlfriends
Got to get it, and when I'm gone
Ya'll bury me with chrome, and tell hell I'm comin' home
I'm poison, see my skull and crossbones
Got aim like them kids in Iraq who toss stones
And I got drugs in my system, we thugs in the system
That put slugs in victims, Mr. M-E to F, bomb threat
As long as I ain't no game, there's no contest

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
Ticallion is phatter than your fattest chrome chain
I guess that should explain why I given the dope name
Ain't nothin' free, everything got a fee
How the fuck you got a car and ain't got a pot to pee?
I'ma grown man, so I do grown man things
Why take half, when I can have this whole damn thing?
It's Meth, baby, drop top, navy Mercedes
I'm number one like P.E. or Tracy McGrady
It's all good, everything I spit, all hood
And if ya'll gave me one wish, niggaz, I wish ya'll would
Who John Blaze? Uh, when ya'll gon' learn huh
When I burn son, stick a fork in him he's done
And ladies love to play, like Ladies Love Cool J
For the right CREAM, the'll do anything you say
She Ice Cream, I'm caked up with icing
Mr. Sandman, come on, bring her a pipe dream

Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?
All I wannah do, is touch ya
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby

Don't you know, I'm the ultimate?
To get this milk, you be fortunate
Just like tasting pussy with pork in it
People stop, when I'm walking in
I'm twisting, twisting, I'm back on ten
And I'm talking 'bout like Mase, come back again

My steez is immaculate
My paper stacking, keep tracking
I'm macing, y'all slacking, reaction
Make y'all dicks scream
I'm more gutter then golddiggers with figures
More bigger then Jiggas, and even Paris Hiltons

Damn sir, sniff me like a Coke
Thrillons, me won't give you none
Cintamelia, all you wannah do is sniff me
The ultimate rush, get high, baby

Damn sir, sniff me like a Coke
Three lines, me won't give you none
Cintamelia, all you wannah do is sniff me
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?
All I wannah do, is touch ya
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?
All I wannah do, is touch ya
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby

Now, Biggie Smalls is not the type to fall in love
When I just hit em' and forget em' and go handle my business
I like the kind who wine and dine, who grinding all the time
Your X girl was a 5, but you not let up on a dime

What is this with you? All you wannah do is lay around
And stay around and get mad when I play around
I like to lay, never work, put your money in my purse
To the mall, I'll go search matching shoes for my skirt

Tuesday, I saw you in a Z, but you still wannah get with me
Wednesday is the Benz day, that's what your friends say
Me and my friends, got your Benz
Attracting mens, and spending dividence, blowing like the wind

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?
All I wannah do, is touch ya
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?
All I wannah do, is touch ya
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby

So I guess, you think I'm slipping, 'cause I ain't flipping
Baby, I'm Big Poppa, ain't no need to be tripping
I ain't tripping or flipping, I'm just niggah sipping
At the bar tipping, with your money, can you pay the difference?

It seems like it's a waste of time, that's why I wrote the rhyme
I hear you jumping in every car except for mine
Niggah, I don't jump in cars, I'm a superstar
Face way too flaw, You should hang me on your wall

All I do all day is drink Tanguray
Thinking of a way to put a smile on your face
Make me smile, see them teeth, Milo, cut down to them feets
Chubby waste, my physique, me don't want a freak a leek

Should I wine and dine and put rings on your fingers?
While sex from the next man in the bedroom lingers?
Sex will never linger, hold up, put on your blinkers
I flow just like sprinklers, give your ass the middle finger

You'd better slow your role, baby
You ain't got enough dough to pay me
You know the pen number, just page me
When you're real, baby

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?
All I wannah do, is touch ya
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby

Damn Ma, I love you like a lot
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?
All I wannah do, is touch ya

Who would ever think that I would be giving up the goodies 
Walking round naked in a pair of pink footies 
Just like them hoes at the shows 
Half dressed clothes doing whatever who knows, nah I only get freaky with him 
No menaja twas not freaky wit them, its just me and my man 
Yes simply me and my man

I'm never insecure when we not together 
Even tho he tell me he in love wit Ciara

So, he treat me like his Cinderella 
Protect me from the storm like he muh umbrella, this fella deserve I'm a stellar, he be a rockafella, not jay-z n dane but the charm on a chain 
He platinum, take a roll lick his forty, e backing? 
Hit a stack and keep tracking ill fax them

Okay, my man, my man and nobody else's 
Damn right, I hope ya'll felt this 
Oh ladies round tha coasts 
Ya better get focused before you ever try to approach him

See when you in love you might have to fight 
Don't say you won't neva say you won't 
You might get real mad wanna act all bad act up in tha street 
A few chicks ya gotta beat 'cause they disrespect 
Clocking ya man from his feets to his neck 
Ya gotta let em know that's a no no 
Slap em real slow with a right blow which ever way you go but keep it gangsta 
Show these bitches that ya yank em, yank em point blank em top rank em

And you would buy me pink pretty under-weas
And I would moan cause you would make me feel nice
And you would make me feel like making love twice
What I'm saying, you the man, I'm in love
And I like when you do it rough

Since ninety-two I came to win and never lose
They try to stop a chubby chick from comin through
My belly out and sellin out these venues
My skills, will fulfill, those who drink booze
My attitude is super cool like I'm subdued
And those who fake I take on you and your dudes
I rule the streets I break 'em down with no tools
And Misdemeanor give the finger to y'all fools (HOLLA!)
Whoever doubted that I'm 'bout it check the news
And if you snooze on me this year your ass will lose
Cause I will bruise, my loose screws is like ooh

I broke up wit my ex I couldn't take his sarcasm
Everytime we bone I had to fake an orgasm
Moaning and groaning tried to make him feel manly
I'd rather use my toys, plus my hands come in handy

I finally told him that my heart was somewhere else
Whenever we sexed I wished that he was someone else
That dude that approached me at the bar the other night
That be the mister right and hot enough to melt some ice

I think I'm in love like Beyonce be with Jigga
It's not his major figure that want him to be my nigga
He got that magic stick that make my little pussy quiver
Juices running like a river slowly down my kitty litter

Boy I'm so glad I found a nigga like you
A thug like you to make a girl say - oh
Hope he feel as strong as my pohah do
With you by my side its like I'm drunk off booze

If you be my man only my man I wouldn't mind tasting your magic stick, magic stick
If you don't cheat or sleep around ain't nothing wrong wit tasting your magic stick

Entertain my guests in ""The Basement"" like Tigger

So the new school new school need to learn yo

[Mary J. Blige]
I'm Mary J. Blige, for a fact I don't rap
I'm known around the map to always make a comeback
I went through some struggles fightin with my ex-lovers
Stayed in lots of trouble, blessings then I had recovered
Had to pay them bills, the places I lived
Messin with them cats that's said to get I had to give
I had to tell them back up cause I was quick to smack 'em up
I didn't give a WHAT, Mary J. would act up

[Chorus: Missy & (Mary)]
Y'all don't really know my struggles
(I had two or three jobs I had to juggle)
And all them liquor shots from the pain I covered
(Struggling from the break-ups with my lover)
(Y'all don't know the half) Don't know the half
(I'm better off now that was in the past)
I had to take the good stuff with the bad
Now I'm (thankful for the little things that I have)

Missy be the name and y'all should already know
I been around long Scarface so cold
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yo she ya
Let me grab the microphone and I'm gone take it away

Every time I spit I blow one or two speakers
Top model diva but my name not Eva
Yeah I bring fever rocking classic Adidas
I'm straight off the heater ripping needles off the meter
Here I go, flip my flow
Back it up then I drop it low
It's a must cause I'm dangerous
I'll be a hassle on the busta call me angel dust
I talk shit di, didn't stutter
2005 MC's in trouble
You run for cover hide under your covers
Cause you gone need more protection than a magnum rubber

Stick you on the table with a plastic cup
Say grace, then eat ya ass up
Y'all just rookies, virgins, and nookies
Not my competition you skip or play hookie
Ain't nobody here that can tear the track up
And naw I ain't done rappin so shut the hell up
Keep it simple every time I flow
If you step to me I shall throw blows
Raise up like I's break nose
I ain't about talkin I'll lay 'em down slow
And for show y'all know
Misdemeanor got 'em by the neck low
Ice cold heart like zero below
If you wanna battle me then playa say so

[Chorus]

Let me tell you what I'm all about
About spitting hot rhymes on out
Yeah Pharrell did the beat oh yes
And the way he put it down he make it sound so (fresh)
I be the best don't second guess
When it comes to other rappers bout it boy get flexed
When I say I'm tight as wife beaters
Missy bout to teach you how to follow the leader
Hit the club in a blue two seater
Looking like I'm finna cock a nine millimeter
Get out with my high hill cuffs
Twisting my ass cause I know what guys want
Licking my lips like I'm taking him home
Teasing and teasing I'm faking the funk
Shaking my titties like I wanna bone
Bend over slow then I tell him I'm gone

Walk around looking like our shit don't stink
Ice by my neck so bright, watch 'em blink

Okay, now I got me a clear view
I like it when you get up and I'm loving ya hairdo
The way you cross ya legs, ass spread in the chair you
The way ya clothes skimpy, so it's easy to tear through
Appreciate my presence, while I shine wit' a barrel
I came up wit' cut diamonds, obscure in a rare blue
Shorty ain't checking for you, step to the way I do
Super senile, I ain't the one to compare to
Now she was saying

Wanna touch my nookie baby? Touch me right there

Bounce back, brand new on the scene what?
Took a little minute, I'm back with the re-up
Switched it up a little bit, back with a clean cut
Shorty's lost her head, see all the koochies I cream up
I love the way she in all over the girls when I'm teaming up
It's getting hotter in this bitch, windows are steaming up
Amazed by the pinky, neck, and wrist be gleaming up
How I dominate the scene, how a nigga be cleaning up
I see you liking everything, you see me and you
You frowning on your girl, like you ain't willing to share boo
The hotel ain't far, meet me there and if you
Ya girl looking like she wit' it, she can come in too
You get impatient Ma, show you just how the kid move
I'm bangin in the truck, and let her watch in the rear view
See we don't really care about the niggas who came through
Over there 'cause over here, see I'ma show ya how we do
So check it baby

See it don't matter what ya doin over there
See we gets it poppin, that's how we do it over here
That's if we toss bottles, that's how we do it over here
Check it, floss models, that's how we do it over here
Listen, rare throttles, that's how we do it over here
Check it, ice collars, that's how we do it over here nigga

I don't want a nigga laying up under me
That can't do for me
What I can't do for my muthafuckin' self

So when y'all see me in the street?
This is what I want y'all to do
Fix your lips, put 'em together nicely and say
Say it along, say it along now, say
""She's a bitch!""

I was walkin' real slow to the dance floor
He was lookin' at my ass and I turned him on
I seen him talking to his boy on the cellular phone
I looked at him and all he could say was
""Damn baby, bring it on""

I talk shit but I come through like a storm
I keep my piece so sweet, yeah nice and warm
And all he could feel, was this love baby

I don't give a fuck
About what they think, what they say
They can call me a freak
Call me anything they wanna name
I don't give a, I don't give a

I just wanna take him home
Take him to the house then turn him out
He ain't checkin' for you

All up in my grill
So he asked could he tag it
Two-timing from an ish like maggots

He tryin' to spit the game
What he had to say
Has anybody ever told you you look like Beyonce?

OK lil' boy want to boost my esteem
I said you need a rehab
Cause you look like a fiend

Don't want to start a scene
I ain't tryin' to be mean

You ain't get in between

Keep on looking for clean

Uh, yea, come on
We gonna do this one right here (I like this)
Lets just do it
See when I wanna do something I just do what I feel, ya know what I'm saying?
I just do it straight from the heart, so we can do it and do it
Lets go

Nobody never understood be better
A true friend forever
That's why I'm writing you this love letter
Despite my ways through every phase
You brought me better days
Withstood the craze
From the beginning Windy hill the black Lennon
When I was saggin denim, and let you get up in em'
Until I damage when I select it
Another ni**a but we managed to stay connected
When you expected to see me naked
I couldn't let it five years and your still respected
Now check it, give me a second to unwind
You'll find all the pain and misery that nearly blew my mind
Cant no fame and shivery compare to losing time
I'll explain my history aboard the cools at nine
Don't be late, cuz I would hate to cross the seven seas
In the windy breeze, without your fantasies
Lets Do It

Tell them haters that mad they cant do it like I do it
They used to call me fat, they used to say I'm ugly
But now im making records, groupies screaming that they love me
I got them dolla bills, I make a lot of cheese
Bet your bi**h cant do it like me
And when you see me in the club I'm lookin' fresh
And when you see me on the street I'm lookin' fresh
And when you see me on the town I'm lookin' fresh
I got my hair and my nails done and I'm so fresh
Baby, whatever you want to do, it's just so its up to you
Lets do what you want to do, Lets go

And I was once there, hanging from that very ledge where you are standing. 
So I know 
I know 
I know, 
It's easier to let go. 

But I will learn to breathe this ugliness you see, 
So we can both be there and we can both share the dark.

And into the light at the end of the fight.

Wore a cotton gown that blazed the night untold.

So heavy a heart for someone merely ten years old.

Her head with pounding voices from home.
Behind her was a vision, a painful apparition
Of a darker world that no-one should know.

The river will keep this friend.
Yeah somebody's bed will never be warm again,
No never again.

She dived beneath the water's icy skin,
Hoping the cold would kill the smell of angry gin,
And her eyes grew wider than they'd ever been
Just wishing the numbness to cut deeper with its pins.
And as her body lay there she decided to stay there
Till darkness came to pull her away.
And beautifully she sank as up river was the bank
Where some bodiless troubles would stay.

Somebody's bed will never be warm again,
The river will keep this friend.

There's a one way only mirror

I know all the rules I just can't seem to play it
You can tick the boxes, follow the equation
But the knife wont budge until you learn patience
I've got notes to sing I just can't reach the words
They're out on the ledge in the dark with the birds
But I'm trying to find them inside of you
Take my brain and break it in two

Out of the cold you take me

You save me

Melody, all I want is to remember what came before this winter
(Set me on fire)
Save me
Set me on fire

I've got a rock between my heart and mouth
I know how it got there but I can't pull it out
And the bones that once moved my fingers over keys
Are protesting in fist on my knees
Gotta find a way to unzip my skin 'cause this is a stranger's im living in

Melody, you're the only one who saves me
Out of the cold you take me

Missy Higgins,"He told her when she played,
Wings sprouted from her shoulder blades
And every bone inside her seemed to change.
So on her fingers moved, over notes she hoped would soothe,
His jagged soul caressing every groove.

Oh and how she longed to say, that she'd missed his troubled ways,
And if she could she'd do it all again.

'Cause sometimes every word has been used,
And there's nothing left to do
But hold the one you can't have in the sweet arms of a tune.

To leave only the bed in which they laid.
But an island is just there
Oh and when the world came flooding back
Oh the pillars underneath them began to crack

She's playing all the minor chords
Wishing so damn hard he'd kiss her like before.

And there's nothing left to do

So very nice
Give me your hands they're just like ice.

My mother will start to worry
Hey babe, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
Well maybe just a half a drink more
Put some music on while I pour.

The neighbors might think
Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink
There's no cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell.

I oughta say no no no sir
Mind if I move a bit closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride
I really can't stay
Oh baby don't hold out
Oh, but it's cold outside

I simply must go
It's freezing outside
The answer is no
Come over here and let me deep frost ya
The welcome has been
Lucky thing that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm.

My sister will be suspicious
Your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
I'm not worrying about your brother
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh your lips really are delicious
Well maybe just a cigarette more
Oh it's smoking plenty up in here

I've got to get home
Baby you'd freeze out there
Say lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I love when you touch my hand
Oh, but don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
What if you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay

That's good babe
Where were you going anyway?
I mean, we're married

I picture baby Jesus wrapped in swaddling clothes

If we close our minds with fear and ignorance we can't perceive these
Philosophies the universe is based on energy and continuous flow
This energy can be tapped and used we should learn
To use our power of deduction

We should know what to eat from our physiological makeup
We should know that destruction of great minds is monstrous
Because the emotion we posses is human
All these choices are a great lateral, a giant matrix up
A series of crossroads we must travel choose wisely

Mama please come put your arms around me
Cause where I'm standing life's so cold
Come and take on this peaceful journey
I won't be long before I'm gone

Mama please come put your arms around me
Cause where I'm standing life's so cold

I won't be long before I'm gone",Crossroads,1996

And baby no matter how high I climb
I'll always be two steps behind you
Cause everytime I look into your eyes
I see the pain that was caused
And baby I apologize
And that's why I...
I think that I should be the only one to love you
And you should be with me for the rest of my life
I think that I should be the only one to love you
And you should be with me for the rest of my life

I've been watchin' you all night and I can't stand

You're giving me an opportunity I can't resist

I saw you standing from across the room
And I like to get to know you without being rude
So just take my hand and let's move on the floor

But it's your fault I'm no knowing
cause you're not showing
Us correctly
How could you just neglect me
Still you expect me
To do better
With no idea about my task

What about us?

How are we suppose to know what to do

Is gonna be left to me
What about us?

But I know we gotta change one day
What about us?
Yeah it's true there's no way that we could
Ever make it without you
Still a young man
Seems like time has just flown past
I've grown up too fast
Being influenced
By what a TV might show me
The truth is what you owe me
Till I understand
Cause I know they deceived you too
I can't blame it on you
But I hope you see
Being a man only means
You're also responsible for me

Prevents me

So I can take a toke

Relax with phat tracks and a real fat J

Astounded from what it did
Sended me far above

Because my tidal wave's high
And thats no joke
Because Mista Grimm takes
Flight from the indo smoke

Ignition to remission
Blast off through the cos
Most of the voyage
I enjoy is just a cause
I sonic boom when
I return back to earth
Birth of a new rhyme
Will take no time
I'm prepared, papers
And a lighter to provoke
A comical scene to watch
Mista Grimm choke
Then gain composure
Compose a symphony
From C-H-R-O-N-I-C and Mista G
Mixed together nicely
Combining lick the linings vaula
A fat chronic sack
You can put in your jaw
H and R puff the stuff in ya lungs
Smokin' on the chronic
Gettin' straight sprung
Stretched, taken to the extreme feelin'
Dancin' on the ceilin' like vinyl
If ya hear me on some vinyl
I break em till they can't be broke
As I soak, in da indo smoke

Never smoke rock 'cause it's deadly

",Ebonics,1997
Mista Grimm,"I got an idea... 

I had a plan to grow indo' 
Therefore the outdo' was to be recreated, duplicated in a grow room 
Wanted to produce the kinda plant that you could display up in a showroom 
So beautiful, but yet stinky 
Stick to your thumb, index, middle, ring, pinky 
And the brain 
First thing was to provide setting for proper cultivation 
Discrete location 
Ten by ten foot spot 
Lit up by a thousand watt lamp, plus two air-vents for the air to circulate 
And ehm - I calculate 
30 gallons of water a week, I'm really into this 
Now all I need is some good fertilizer and some photosynthesis 
To proceed, after I choose the right seeds to fall in motion 
With a little love and devotion 
I can make the front cover of High Times 
I hope I never get busted and have to pay some fines 
For havin' a, secret garden, like Barry White 
I must not tell anyone and keep my lips sealed tight 
I got the grow room 

If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 
And if you're high already and can't take another toke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 

During the first stage of growth the seeds germinate slow 
Start a root system, sprout up some leaves, and grow 
Towards the light 
Make sure the temperature's right 
I was told by this one guy 
Watch your plants closely, beware of bugs and fungi 
They'll hurt your garden, they'll only interfere 
With the vegetative growth that lasts about two months to a year 
When full grown flowers bloom big buds and leaves 
Watch out for thieves 
People like to stash shit up their sleeves 
It's not been three months 
I'm tempted to break off a piece and roll some blunts 
I wonder what it is, is this some Skunk? 
I see some purple stems and orange hairs 
Could it be the Humble mixed with Maui? It's a hybrid 
Wow! Look what I did 
I got the green thumb 
Observe the superb herb 
Bushy branches, loud smell 
Like green pastel 
I got it on deck for all seasons 
And if anyone asks, it's for medical reasons 
I got the grow room

If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 
And if you're high already and can't take another toke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 

It's been over four months, time to get high 
Uproot the plants and let them hang dry 
In a cool room with dry air, for 2 to 3 weeks 
And I'ma be waitin' right here with my loose leaf sheets 
The lovely harvest, it came in different amounts 
Four trees, each one just a few grams short of an ounce 
I can't wait to smoke it, I know it's the bomb 
Been waiting so long, make me want to write a song 
I guess I'll sell 2 ounces and puff on the rest 
Find a recipe to sprinkle herb on my fillet of chicken breast 
Or some tea shot full of THC 
Hit the bomb, cut open the swisher sweet 
Then come off on weed 
Plant stuck to my fingertips as I try to break it down 
And when lit, the fruity herby taste is profound 
It have me buzzin' for a light year, and you best believe I'll have some seeds 
And be at it again, yes indeed 
I got the grow room 

If you ain't never had the homegrown that made you choke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope 
And if you're high already and can't take another toke 
Put your hands in the air and say: nope, nope",Grow Room,1997

[ VERSE 1 ] 

MC's   you need deeper concentration 

Cause wack rhymes and crews lead to non profit organizations 

I attack like anxiety with the variety 

>From the western society   baby 

Seeing is believing  but looks can be deceiving 

You might think you're coming with it  nigga  but you're leaving 

With lyrics I'm conceiving 

Morning, afternoon and evening 

You can't wait 

My shit's special like a .38 

(You got a problem?) 

I smoke some boo boo, now I'm spaced out like astrology 

Getting in MC's asses like proctology 

It's seems that everybody's going through a phase 

Thinkin they can bust, but they're weak like 7 days 

All 12 months for every ounce I get 12 blunts 

Get the munchies, eat up 12 MC's at once 

Thinkin that they wasn't, when they know that they was 

The one with the style young, they still got the peachfuzz

When I get stoned like Fred Flint I begin 

To smoke MC's like Marian, bury them 

Cause most be comin unnatural like a cesarean 

I wish my rhymes were meat and MC's were vegetarians 

Cause when it comes to biting, I don't condone it 

Besides, you couldn't manage my style if you owned it 

I got gruesome rhymes in my mind 

And they'll jump on a beat 

Infect it when the rhyme is injected 

Metaphors are connected 

Booty lyrics are deflected 

And the mic is intercepted 

Cause I never ever leave it neglected 

I'm tryina hold my position 

What kind of man would I be if my rhymes weren't in mint condition 

They say ""(Hey) Grimm's nowhere to be found"" 

But they catch me on camera beatin MC's down 

Always tryin to ponder what I'm pondering 

They need to find theyself, because they're somewhere lost and wandering

As we mix a little lyric and track 

Like coke and cognac 

Premium blend 

You're gonna need a driver, designated friend 

Cause I intend to seep in your system 

Hit hard, make MC's change agenda 

Disregard their rhymes, return to sender 

I got soul like Dr. Scholl eatin a bowl of neckbones 

I like my shit loud enough to where it blows your headphones 

If you hear any noise, it's just me and the boys makin hits 

Assassination other crews, posses, and clicks 

The main thing's to get down and say my peace 

Whoever disrespects, I'm Rushen like Patrice 

I'll never cease with the funky, funky vocals and beats 

Cause we need more rappers around flauntin new styles and speaks 

I know we're amped to get the money, cause we need it 

But if your lyrics ain't tight, the whole purpose is defeated 

You can't shine and be on top with the wack sound 

It's time to watch all the burnt out stars hit the ground",MC's Must Come Down,1997
Mista Grimm,"Waiting around a crew of thugs
That parade in blue and yelling 'cause
(Whats up? 'Cuz)
Ate by selling drugs
'38 snub in the waist, in case fools lose love

These days still the same
I can steal the flame, eyes kill with the pain
So I advise y'all to chill with the games
Entertain for the cheddar and the change

So fuck whoever in the fame, forever a man
Around my dogs, banging the pound, swanging the town
How we choose, now I'm aggravated and assault is my next move
Success means issues, so I guess it's time for me to disclude

Handle mines, we use pistols
G's move with the conscience
When we disaprove of that nonsense
Ex-cons with that gangsta gangsta gangsta shit
Here come another hit

I think it's time we do it, they said it couldn't be done
Still we making paper, still we having fun
I hope by now it's proven, Nate and Warren G
Tightest combination in the industry
Here comes another one

I can see us smashing up the shore past laws that's lost
2000 Ucon Excel, duel exhaust, TV screen, DVD, e-mail
Passenger, bad female, what the hell
Stash spot, with the hollow head shell
Niggas start trippin', I'm on the next tail

Hands free, callin' up my nigga Warren G
I pull strings, like Mya Landske
Bulletproof, emotint you can't see
Mr. G rollin' up weed, Afghani sense
Bad MC, Mike Fiend, you the know spinage

Like wintergreenmint, talk shit
Sleep with the fish, you cement
New residence, with no hesitance
It gets tints on the floor, staple center chick
Next to Denzel and Nicholsen, Phil Jackson whistlin'

I think it's time we do it, they said it couldn't be done
Still we making paper, still we having fun
I hope by now it's proven, Nate and Warren G
Tightest combination in the industry
Here comes another one

Mean mugs in the club, mean nothing to us
In South scene, me and the team trying to fuck us some sluts
Dying to fuck, I chuck us when we step through
Poppin' our collars with our nephews

Next to you, you got millionaires moving
Hitting the dance floor, stealing their groovin'
Doing they damn thing and ain't worried about a damn thing

But man, that's the celebrity ways
Poppin' a litty got some rappers scared of these days
Industry ways, that's how Hollywood pays

Uh, top dollar when I dip my Impala
In front of the club, make your woman wanna holla
(Holla)
At a playa though, what's your dude yo?

I keep it gangsta, I ain't trying to be rude hoe
Oh, you know how that shit go
Or give when cats get fed off the four or fifths

I think it's time we do it, they said it couldn't be done
Still we making paper, still we having fun
I hope by now it's proven, Nate and Warren G
Tightest combination in the industry
Here comes another one

It ain't nuttin wrong with you
Me and you (we do it nasty, nasty)

[Warren G]
I once knew a girl named LaShonda
Short little cute thing
With a pinky diamond ring
She was iceless
My game was so priceless
Givin her a facial
I was G'd up
From the feed up
Pushin the bent
With the midnight tint
Huh, heaven sent

[Mista Grimm]
I once met a girl in the valley and
Half black half Italian
Ass like a stalian
Coke bottles shake
As she likes to watch herself on tape
Breakin nuts shake, but wait there's more
She keeps my nuts in her mouth like a squirrel
Pranksta with a pearl
Held my balls so long
I call trouble when I'm with my girl

[Warren G]
There's a law for that
We ain't trippin, we hogs for that

[Damone]
I met this Puerto Rican named Sehonnie
She was as bad as Carmen
Chillin in New York and I cracked her in Spanish Harlem
Straight dime
Body bangin like a baseline
And the face fine
I had to spit dip waste time
Mr. Passionate
Everything her body was immaculin
The presence like a gift to men and got packaged

Fuckin fabolous
She say ""damn he fat""
Then I still fuck the ass (how you do that)
Push up on 'em till they fall to the plot, damn it
Uh, hog 'em while they fuckin roll, goddamn it
Call me fat boy with a fat dick to mash
To lick me baby and I might lick you back

Lickin you back
She's gaggin with a dick in her trap
And stickin is fat
I'll pull it out and tickle your cat

[Warren G]
I put the smash on her like Shaq
She want the cash on her
I ain't havin that
You need to check yo' trap
I got rose cap
G'd up, 213, please believe that

[Mista Grimm]
I stay pimpin in a bubble I Benz
With hoes stubbled up and cuddled in the back with my friends
I slide up on 'em like a cross fader
The hook up later
And serve this dick like a waitor
I ain't tryna date her

[Damone]
When it comes to bitches
I got more game than the olympics
I get up in their mind and analyze and twist this, psychology
For no reason I'm recievin apologies
Break her down mentally
Have her stockin and follow me

[Boss Hogg]
Trick be swallowin me
For a nine on the vein
'cause I'm the fuckin boss, she's my employee
I ain't hatin, I appreciate you freaky ass style
Yo nasty ass ?, eat a dick and smile

He's a disgrace to the species in to his face with some feacies

How many licks does it take to get to the center of a sucka

Big money swanging whips, cause we serve the most
We live by that G code, that's what gangstas do
On the grind stacking chips, with a gangsta crew
Down here sipping lean, that's that purple stuff
Staying thoed getting bucked, playas living it up
Game spitters riding big, is a habit y'all
Everything you dream about, we done had it y'all
We got money yellow hoes, wearing g-string clothes
Sport sweaters in the summer, cause our necks stay froze
Gripping grain having change, hanging low as your belt
If you want to be a man, go and get it yourself
Down here we do it all, break laws and ball
Ghetto stars for the cause, either stand or fall
We live it up cause we love it, playa deal with that
Tite getting it how I live, keep it real with that

Down South, yeah we ride on dubs
Abuse them drugs, and hoes don't get no love

From Houston to Huntsville, boys got ice in grills
We love to chill, and ride on candy paint
Sip on drank, and blow on that stanky dank

I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man

You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something

Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top

Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car

Man, I ain't never seen shining like that
Say H.A.W.K, what why'all use to do fool
When you was growing up

[H.A.W.K]
I use to sit and watch the Flinstones, Gucci rolls and herringbones
Bezel sets and baguettes, while talking on my cell phone
From Bo-Bo's to Air Macs, low cars to horse backs
Hoopties to Cadillacs, water guns to chrome gats
Levis to Guess jeans, black and white to big screens
Six by nine to 18's, Bumsalack to sipping lean
Regals with white walls, 20 inch with screens fall
Michael Jackson off the wall, to MJG and 8Ball
Screw house to wrecking flows, to BET on videos
Zig-zags and yellow bags, to Glad sacks and optimos
Fist fight to gun play, sawed-offs to a.k.'s
Spitting flows at talent shows, as the H-A-W-K
Riding on the Metros, pushing a six double O
Smoking cess to endo, fill it up with petro
Fixing on my lego, let go of my ego
Get in with my little bro, getting up when the rooster blow

[Lil Flip]
I remember Kangaroos and afro curls, always running after girls
Trying to sneak in Natural World, BB gun shooting at the squirrels
Candy red on tricycles, training wheels on bicycles
Sugar Daddy's, Pixie Stix, peppermints and side pickles
Loaded toes and Scooby Doo, some of the things we use to do
Roller skate now roller blades, Ivy Leagues to holding fades
Blow-Pop rings and diamond things, herringbones to bezeltines
Cadillacs to limousines, ironing jeans to being clean
GI Joes to Tonka toys, eating Willy Wonka boy
Riding in my uncle's car, wanting to become a star
Having dreams to be like Mike, hooping in my all black Nikes
Flying kites and shooting dice, sneaking in the movies twice
Staying up and watching Cops, walking outside in Michael socks
Being afraid of chicken pox, check my bowl on Magnavox
Running up and down my block, sweating cause the sun is hot
I use to ride the city bus, now I'm pulling Hummers out

[AP]
I remember brothers getting dumped off, in ditches and bayous
Boys gave head jobs, and all I saw was hairdo's
Pimps drove Lacs and dob hats, with chrome gats
Hustlers stack paper, with the players and macs
Police burns in the hood, because somebody just got jacked
Every girl I slam they call, I told em call me back
Haters got backhanded, because they were always talking smack
Instigators chit chat, and were known for spreading rumors
Ballers went from stabs, to buying more of consumers
I use to eat on tuna, now it's shrimp and caviar
I use to be a virgin, now I have menage tois
I use to drink on soda, now I'm sipping mixed with bar
I use to stay in the ghetto, now I'm a ghetto superstar
I recall when I couldn't rap, now my rap game's up to par
From then to now it's funny, Jabos to Armani
AP became a business man, that's all about his money

Back in the days I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But sometimes, I wish that I could be a kid again
I use to wear a swatch watch, now I only wear Movado
Went from bare foot on a bus, to holding keys to Monte Carlos
Now it's a big body Expedition, showing my naked ass provado
Went from hood to all good, shh playing a game like huh brah
Backyard nickel and dime that, now boys be moving birds
Use to carry my knife special, now it's gats and smoking sherm
Use to mix at house parties, freestyling to Whodini
Now I'm signing rappers to paid in full, eating shrimp and fetichini
Boy I use to ride big wheels, while wearing them Chuck Taylors
Now it's Jordans, Air Macs, even pink-green gators
Use to be sneaking in Lover's Land, or at the drive-in movies
Now it's Tinsel Town or Motel 6, where this hoe can do me
Use to watch freestyle the man, or Rap City on BET
Now I star in sitcoms, movies and got my own video show on t.v., what

Should of seen it I was right there, when a problem jumped off
Rounds got dumped off, leaving niggas bumped off
Always trying to get the hook up, leaving your girl shook up
Women breaking my pager, phone line you can't look up
We had ice on us, merchandise on us
Busting at other hoods, when they had a price on us
Listening to flow tapes, people saying rewind it
Pulling out my piece, and bystanders get blinded
From winter to summer time, there wasn't no leaving our block
When the laws made it hot, we was freezing our block
Man we got enough money, to make my neck look pretty
Cause we done made enough money, to make my check look pretty
Rapping at talent shows, saying phrase too frequent though
Niggas talk about Fasachi, we roll that in Regal though

Mistah F.A.B.,"Street blocks to tree tops, sweet spots found
The diction to detox, three packs now
He walks with, he talks like me, I'm sound
Conviction to beat knocks, from my head to my cheap socks
Underneath Living Legends Reebok's
I'm bound to free speech thoughts, seep around rocks
Volcanic or crack, hard to hold back
Go with the flow, know what you know and show that
Too relevant, but I go back like keggers on a hill, five on a dope sack
Smoke stack, think A-C, shrink wrap
Rap with a shrink before you and ink the tat
That's permanent, life learning it, pat
Never wanna see the world turn into a track
I ain't running no game, small time, no names
If we one in the same, you gunning for change

Amp, hit 'em with a one

Go on and count me in, now one, two, three

(Go on and count me in, now one, two, three, four)

Hey, I got this blues train running all through to my veins
Slave ships, middle passage, crack cocaine
Ten slap in the 'lac, corner boys ground packs
In the belly of the beast where the life go flat
But the music is the remedy, inhale my rhythm steadily
Perched on the curb, watch church converge
It's the meeting of the minds, at time, light occurs
How we cultivated words like they sacred herbs
Put it in your pipe and puff it, squares can't touch it
Rough and rugged, how you love it, with no budget
Independent game, man, with my slang tang
You can do the same thang, utilize your damn brain
Metaphors are mountains, countless bouncing
A multitude in viewed, clubs and houses
We rain like fountains to wash it clean
I'm in the back with my mug on mean, my whole team

Amp, hit 'em with a one
(Grouch, hit 'em with a one, two)

And Zion, hit 'em with a one, two

They feeling the styles

Let the beat give life to dead souls
The rhymes turn wienies to red bulls
The feeling is a whole 'nother level
The drums, the bass, the snares and the treble
So let it go, count me in, I'm on all corners
Winter, summer, spring, then I fall on ya
My mind-state define great, the crime rate
Got me irate, it's high stake, so why wait?
Move now, roll out
Hate it when hip hop's finest sold out
My gold out, but I'm pouring my soul out
I never change, only my shows get sold out
So, what's the science, don't be defiant
My music turn midgets to giants, just try it
Go crazy, riot, Grouch and Zion

Don't matter where we at, Miami or Vegas
Every time you ask me, yeah I'm a player
(Beotch) Cause I'm the life of the party
I got ten bad bitches, actin' retarded
I'm tryin' to meet a few new ones
What's up with you girl, maybe we can do somethin'

See my homie Short, layin' low-key
I strolled over to him, and passed him the bleezy
Dogg y dog, anything goes
Snappin' my fingers, crackin' at some hoes
What do ya know, I'm in The A gettin' play all day
A lot of y'all wanna ball and try to walk this way
Y'all want that shine-shine but that's all mine
I'm bonafied, qualified to have a hot damn time
Now listen, get the picture, and take a picture of me quick
See cause tomorrow I got a new city that I'm gon' hit

I do a show with Puff Daddy way out in South Miami

They doin' it big over there too, but you know mayne
