Romane Serda,"Toi que j’ai vu brûler
Sur des milliers d’hectares
Toi que j’ai vu cramer
Des millions de boulevards
Toi que j’ai vu cendrer
Des cheveux par milliards

Devrais-je te le dire
Devrais-je en sourire
Depuis quelque temps
Depuis exactement
Que le temps perd son temps
Je te cherche
Je te trouve
Te trouve en chloroforme
En chloroforme

Toi que j’ai vu traîner
Sur des milliers de pores
Toi que j’ai vu errer
En quête des quais des ports
Toi que j’ai vu signer
Des impacts avec la mort

Devrais-je te le dire
Devrais-je en sourire
Depuis quelque temps
Depuis exactement
Que le temps perd son temps
Je te cherche
Je te trouve
Te trouve en chloroforme
En chloroforme

Dans nos conversations
Un mot revient
Conservation
Un mot revient
Revient de loin
Mais on s’en tape
Toutes ces étapes
C’est la vie fatale
La hutte finale

Je te cherche
Te trouve
Te trouve en chloroforme

Romane Serda,"Dans mon carnet de velours
J’ai collé quelques images
Découpées avec amour
Dans des livres d’enfant sage

Petite fille d’autrefois
Sur une jolie balançoire
Une biche dans les bois
Une plage vers le soir

Dans mon carnet de velours
Quelques cartes postales usées
La Toscane au petit jour
Et le Nil en février

Souvenirs de beaux voyages
Avec toi mon bel amour
Ainsi au fil des pages
Je retrouve les beaux jours
Dans mon carnet de velours 
J’ai mis un peu de ma vie
Les images de toujours
Et surtout la nostalgie

Dans mon carnet de velours 
J’ai mis un peu de ma vie
Les images de toujours
Et surtout la nostalgie

Dans mon carnet de velours
Il y a ces fleurs fanées
Les restes d’un vieux bouquet
Que tu m’avais envoyé

Il y a la photo du Che
Et la plume d’un oiseau
De jolis timbres étrangers
Et de ta main quelques mots
Dans mon carnet de velours
J’ai écrit quelques poèmes
Que je t’ai toujours cachés
Mais qui te disent “je t’aime”

Une lettre de Papa
L’étiquette d’un bon vin
Que tu avais ouvert pour moi
Dans un bistrot athénien

Dans mon carnet de velours 
J’ai mis un peu de ma vie
Les images de toujours
Et surtout la nostalgie

Dans mon carnet de velours 
J’ai mis un peu de ma vie
Les images de toujours
Et surtout la nostalgie",Mon Carnet de Velours,2005
Romane Serda,"En un mot comme en cent
Commençant par cette lettre
Que tu as signée te saignant de ton sang

En un mot qui me dit
Que ce jeudi tu t'en vas
Sur un trésor d'îlot jouer les Vendredi

Où vas-tu, mon envers de moi ?
Là où je ne suis pas, où, dans quel endroit ?
Que va-t-il advenir de mon avenir ?
C'est Venise promise aux flots de soupirs ...

L'existence a des pas de danse
Un peu gauches et ça vous la gâche
Oh, je tangue, oh, je t'enguirlande
Comme un gosse qui casse et vous agace

D'ici, je vois le tableau,
Doux comme un Douanier Rousseau
Jouant l'ami des âmes et des animaux

Quant à moi, je me vois
Poster des mélancolies
Au destinataire des terres aux mille collines

Où vas-tu, mon envers de moi ?
Là où je n'irai pas, là où tu t'en vas,
Que va-t-il advenir de nos souvenirs ?
C'est Venise en prise aux ailes du désir ...

L'existence a des pas de danse
Un peu gauches et ça vous la gâche
Oh, je tangue, oh, je t'enguirlande
Comme un gosse qui tient jamais en place
Jamais en place ...

Te souviens-tu de nos partances
Sous des ciels mauves et étranges
On avait aboli la distance
Entre les songes et les anges

L'existence a des pas de danse
Un peu lâches, et ça vous lâche pas
Moi, dans ce bal, je me balance
Au bout de l'accordéon, je pleure même pas

Je pleure même pas
Je pleure même pas ...",Mon Envers de Moi,2005
Romane Serda,"Sans rivalité elle me donnait la main
Et l’on s’aventurait sous les chênes et les pins
N’imaginant jamais ni le mal ni le bien
Nous goûtions à tout sans penser à demain

Nous rêvions toutes deux dévalant les chemins
Que nous allions trouver les secrets des Indiens
Piétinant dans l’herbe la rosée du matin
Sans penser à nos vies au futur incertain

Petite sœur, joli cœur
Passe le temps, passent les heures
Je t’ai toujours en moi comme une fleur
Je t’ai toujours en moi, petite sœur

Petite sœur, joli cœur
Passent les jours, passent les heures
Je t’ai toujours en moi comme une fleur
Je t’ai toujours en moi, petite sœur

Ainsi s’est écoulée notre si belle enfance
Et nous n’étions guidées que par l’insouciance
Dans ce hameau perdu, ce petit coin de France
Nous vivions dans l’amour et dans l’innocence

Nous étions attachées par un sixième sens
Cette fraternité, cette reconnaissance 
Nous étions réunies par cette ressemblance 
Nous partagions les rires mais aussi les souffrances

Petite sœur, joli cœur
Passe le temps, passent les heures
Je t’ai toujours en moi comme une fleur
Je t’ai toujours en moi, petite sœur

Nos plaisirs n’étaient faits que de tout petits riens
Mon cœur en tremble encore aujourd’hui quand j’y pense

Petite sœur, joli cœur
Passe le temps, passent les heures
Je t’ai toujours en moi comme une fleur
Je t’ai toujours en moi, petite sœur

Petite sœur, joli cœur
Passent les jours, passent les heures
Je t’ai toujours en moi comme une fleur
Je t’ai toujours en moi, petite sœur",Petite Sœur,2005
Romane Serda,"Je ferai un feu de cheminée
Avec tout ce qui part en fumée
Et comme y a rien qui dure jamais
Ce n'sera pas trop dur à trouver

Je repartirai à zéro
Au premier mot au premier geste
Je mettrai ma peau sur ta peau
Jusqu'à en oublier le reste

S'il y a encore
Quelque chose entre nous
Pour faire qu'encore
Tout ça reste entre nous

Je ferai des empires avec rien
Et je n'ferai rien de ces empires
Je serai fidèle comme un chien
Et je t'aimerai comme je respire

Je me lèverai tous les matins
Avec la même idée en tête
Faire de chaque jour un festin

S'il y a encore
Quelque chose entre nous
Pour faire qu'encore
Tout ça reste entre nous

Je ferai une prison portative
Avec ce que l'amour a de solide
Et je t'y garderai captif
Rien que toi pour remplir le vide

S'il y a encore
Quelque chose entre nous
Pour faire qu'encore
Tout ça reste entre nous

Romane Serda,"Tu vois, j’ai vu tout ce qu’un ange a pu voir 
Des torrents de détresse et des ruisseaux d’espoir 
Tu vois, j’ai vu des beautés inutiles 
J’ai connu l’Everest j’ai descendu le Nil 

Oh mais tu vois, c’est toi 
C’est toi que je vois le mieux

C’est toi que j’ai dans les yeux 

Tu vois, c’est toi 
C’est toi que je vois le mieux 
C’est toi que j’ai dans les yeux 
Tu vois 

J’ai vu des choses très étranges 
Des glaciers disparus et la terre bleue orange 
Tu vois, j’ai vu jusqu’au lointain des îles 
Et j’ai touché des doigts des lèvres malhabiles 

Mais tu vois, c’est toi 
C’est toi que je vois le mieux 
Tu vois, c’est toi

Tu vois, c’est toi 
C’est toi que je vois le mieux

Tu vois, 
Tu vois, j’ai vu des êtres incroyables 
Des serpents de lune et des aigles de sable 
Tu vois, j’ai vu les grands rois de Sicile 
Et des couleurs cachées sous les brumes des villes 

Oh mais tu vois, c’est toi 
C’est toi que je vois le mieux

Romane Serda,"Fuir la ville impure
Qui n’connaît des saisons
Que cet automne obscur
Qui ne dit pas son nom

Abandonner la course
Retrouver la lenteur
D’une vie simple et douce
Dans ce possible ailleurs

Aller au sud
Voir le ciel aux millions d’étoiles
Illuminer les nuits gitanes
Chercher dans les ruelles d’Arles
L’ombre de Van Gogh ou Cézanne

Aller au sud
Boire à l’eau fraîche des fontaines
Croiser Fanny, Manon des sources
Marcher sur les pierres romaines
Et s’endormir dans la Grande Ourse

Laisser les rues trop grandes
La fureur et le bruit
Retrouver les lavandes
Et leur mauve inouï

Abandonner aussi
Les hauts murs des cités
Renoncer à l’ennui
Aux habits trop foncés

Aller au sud
Écouter le vent qui fredonne
Les mots du poète Mistral
De Nîmes jusqu’à Carcassone
Et accompagnent les cigales

Aller au sud
Pleurer les platanes abattus
Et voir les oliviers sans âge
Dresser leurs troncs noirs et tordus
Dans l’ocre de la terre sauvage

Aller au sud
Aller au sud

Et ne regretter rien 
Ni les gens ni les choses
Tourner la page enfin
De ces années moroses

Esclave des tourments
Dans cette multitude
Où ne règne pourtant
Qu’une vraie solitude

Aller au sud
Vivre de ce soleil encore
Qui coule en moi comme un torrent
Et qui teinte de cuivre et d’or
Ma peau, mes cheveux et mon sang

Aller au sud
Retrouver enfin mon enfance
Dans la moindre pierre des chemins
Et donner à ma vie un sens
À l’éternité un écrin

Aller au sud
Aller au sud",Aller au Sud,2007
Romane Serda,"Le macadam est luisant
Comme une peau de requin
Presque noir
Il est chaud comme un printemps
Sous le soleil qui revient
Dans le soir
Une brume évanescente
Semble monter doucement
Des trottoirs
Ma démarche est hésitante
Les flaques d’eau sont diamants
Ou miroirs

Le déluge a disparu
Sur la ville trépidante
Et sauvage
Il a balayé les rues
Sous les bourrasques violentes
D’un orage
Qui m’a prise au dépourvu
A inondé mes cheveux
Mon corsage
Mes sandales sont foutues
Et que dire de mes yeux
Mon visage

Mon amour, après la pluie
Me trouveras-tu jolie
Après la pluie, mon amour
Est-c’que tu voudras toujours
De ma vie
Le ciel redevient limpide
Le silence est revenu
Tout plomber
Et une douceur humide
Embrase les avenues
Désertées
Je marche vers la maison
Où mon parapluie, bien sûr
Oublié
Me dira ma distraction
Se rira de mon allure
Chiffonnée

Mon amour, après la pluie
Me trouveras-tu jolie
Après la pluie, mon amour
Est-c’que tu voudras toujours
De ma vie

J’aime ces journées d’avril
Et pour tous nos lendemains
Je voudrais
Déambuler dans la ville
Avec toi, main dans la main
Car jamais
Nous ne craindrons, réunis
Ni le vent ni les ondées
Les autans
Notre amour est à l’abri
Sous l’ombrelle partagée
Des amants

Mon amour, après la pluie
Me trouveras-tu jolie
Après la pluie, mon amour
Est-c’que tu voudras toujours
De ma vie

Mon amour, après la pluie
Me trouveras-tu jolie

D’un certain Robert Zimmermann
D’où ce prénom de gentleman

Ne sera plus écrit demain
Que sur le marbre du chagrin
Dans un cimetière parisien
Pas loin

Sera évoqué dans les larmes
Dans la douleur qui accompagne
Les souvenirs en filigrane
Des tiens

Bien sûr tu te croyais adulte

Perdu

Romane Serda,"Tu crois peut-être que tu lis
Dans le cœur des femmes
Tout comme dans un livre ouvert

Mais tu n’y connais rien, tant pis
Le fond de nos âmes
Est un jardin plein de mystères

Tu es mon ami, un peu mon frère
Alors je t’écoute
Mais sache que je l’aime aussi

Je la défendrai en enfer
Si tu fais fausse route
Si tu n’comprends rien à sa vie

Oui, je vous aime tous les deux
Elle et puis toi
Et vous savoir si malheureux
Je ne peux pas

Elle te quitte, c’est fini
Trop tard les regrets
Il serait temps d’en faire ton deuil

Une femme qui s’en va, oublie
Ne revient jamais
Mets un mouchoir sur ton orgueil

Elle ne veut personne d’autre
Si ça te console
Elle n’a besoin que d’être libre

Et peu importe à qui la faute
Les passions trop folles
N’sont pas toujours indestructibles

Oui, je vous aime tous les deux
Elle et puis toi
Et vous savoir si malheureux
Je ne peux pas

Je te prête un peu mon épaule
Et tu peux pleurer
Tu me fais tant rire parfois

Tu es le garçon le plus drôle
Des amis que j’ai
Que je compte sur mes dix doigts

Mais pour l’amour, la vie commune 
Tu dois bien comprendre
Que tu n’es pas le plus malin 

Que tu as encore quelques lacunes
Que tu n’sais t’y prendre
Qu’avec les cœurs sans lendemain 

Oui, je vous aime tous les deux
Elle et puis toi
Et vous savoir si malheureux
Je ne peux pas
 
Oui je l’appellerai demain
Et je lui dirai
Que tu souffres et que tu regrettes

Mais cela ne changera rien
Tu peux t’en douter
Tu renaîtras de la défaite

Oui, je vous aime tous les deux
Elle et puis toi
Et vous savoir si malheureux
Je n’peux pas

Oui, je vous aime tous les deux

Et vous savoir si malheureux

Romane Serda,"Elle est presque touchante
Dans ses habits chiffon
Limite décadente
L’arrogance à son front

Elle a la peau trop blanche
Les cheveux noir corbeau
Lolita d’outre-Manche
Boit sa bière au goulot

On la voit n’importe où
Dans les pubs, dans les bouges
Son sourire est voyou
Et ses ongles sont rouges

London, Glasgow, Dublin
C’est la même gamine
Guinness ou cocaïne
Tatouage et piercing

À ses pieds des Rangers
Une croix à son cou
Mini-jupe écossaise
Tee-shirt plein de trous

Chante un peu sa galère
Touche un peu la guitare
Dans un groupe éphémère
Aux rêves illusoires

Sur d’improbables scènes
Un public de fous
Elle rugit sa haine
Louve parmi les loups

London, Glasgow, Dublin
C’est la même gamine
L’espérance orpheline
Tatouage et piercing

London, Glasgow, Dublin
C’est la même gamine
Guinness ou cocaïne
Tatouage et piercing

Destroy mais debout
Elle arpente les rues
Cherchant un peu partout
Une impossible issue

Et lorsque tu la croises
Intrigué par son style
Alors elle te toise
D’un mépris indicible

Cette révolte vaine
Ces silences et ces cris
À dix-sept ans à peine
Ont le goût de l’ennui

London, Glasgow, Dublin
C’est la même gamine
La même vie de spleen
Tatouage et piercing

London, Glasgow, Dublin
C’est la même gamine
Guinness ou cocaïne

Romane Serda,"Je me plonge parfois le soir
Dans un essai de philosophie
Toi tu t’évades dans le noir
De ton Michaël Connelly

J’aime les couleurs de Matisse
Toi plutôt l’ombre de Michaux
J’aime la menthe et la réglisse
Tu préfères le café bien chaud

Je viens du pays des cigales
Les oliviers sont mon décor
Dans ta mémoire c’est le Mistral
Et presque autant le vent du Nord

Tout ce qui, pourtant, nous sépare
Tout ce qui fait nos différences
Enrichit notre belle histoire
Notre amour, notre connivence

Tout ce qui, pourtant, nous sépare
Tout ce qui fait nos différences
Enrichit notre belle histoire
Notre amour, notre connivence

Enfant, tu écoutais Brassens
Moi je chantais Rickie Lee Jones
Et nous avions chacun nos princes
Toi Bob Dylan et moi Lennon

Nous partageons parfois Godard
Mais tu préfères Tarantino
Je donne tout à ma guitare
Toi tu vis surtout pour les mots

J’aime marcher dans les forêts
Toi tu es fidèle au béton
D’ailleurs tu ne marches jamais
Que de la cuisine au salon

Tout ce qui, pourtant, nous sépare
Tout ce qui fait nos différences
Enrichit notre belle histoire
Notre amour, notre connivence

Tout ce qui, pourtant, nous sépare
Tout ce qui fait nos différences
Enrichit notre belle histoire

Romane Serda,"J’ai beau tourner dans tous les sens
Le sommeil n’est toujours pas là
Le lit est grand, c’est une chance
Tu peux dormir pas loin de moi
Moi qui, dans cette chambre immense
Compte les moutons pour enfin
M’abandonner dans l’inconscience
D’une nuit sans fond et sans fin

Je suis troublée par le silence
De cette maison isolée
Sur une colline en Provence
Où je pensais me reposer
Près de moi je sens ta présence
Toi tu dors comme un bébé
J’envie le sommeil de l’enfance
Qui a oublié de m’emporter

Encore une nuit blanche
À me perdre sans bruit
Encore une nuit blanche
À ressasser ma vie

Prendre un médoc pas trop confiance
Les ai déjà tous essayés
Me méfie de l’accoutumance
Si l’un d’entre eux pouvait marcher
Je sais déjà par expérience
Que j’aurai demain dans les yeux
Un vieux reste de somnolence
Et le blues des matins frileux

Je me lève sans assurance
Mes pas font craquer le parquet
Un verre d’eau pour prendre patience
Va finir de m’éveiller
Je retourne avec nonchalance
M’allonger dans le lit défait
La nuit s’enfuit, le jour avance
Les oiseaux chantent pour me narguer

Encore une nuit blanche
À me perdre sans bruit
Encore une nuit blanche
À ressasser ma vie

Tout compte fait je m’en balance
Dormir c’est mourir un peu
La vie est courte et ma vengeance
Sera de vivre des nuits de feu
J’ai dans la tête des romances
Où nous nous aimons tous les deux
Le sommeil c’est l’indifférence
Les nuits blanches me vont bien mieux

Encore une nuit blanche
À me perdre sans bruit
Encore une nuit blanche
À ressasser ma vie",Nuit Blanche,2007
Romane Serda,"Tu retournes maintenant chez toi,

Romane Serda,"T’es parti j’avais pas deux ans
Me laissant seule avec Maman
Et son chagrin
T’as préféré ta liberté
Aux douces chaînes d’un foyer
Bien trop serein

Vieux routard, vagabond, volage
Tu ne voulais pas vivre en cage
Alors adieu
Tant pis pour la femme et l’enfant
Tu as suivi les ailes du vent
Vers d’autres cieux

Soixante-huitard invétéré
Espèce de chien sans collier
La solitude
T’a semblé plus douce et plus belle
Que la routine un peu cruelle
Des habitudes

T’étais pas là, tu m’as manqué
Je me souviens d’avoir pleuré
Bien trop souvent
T’étais pas là, tant pis pour toi
T’as pas connu les premiers pas
De ton enfant

Tu es parti te reconstruire
Un présent et un avenir
Pour toi tout seul
Est-c’que ça t’a rendu meilleur
De ne vivre que pour ton bonheur
Que pour ta gueule

Tu ne m’as laissé que ton nom
Et puis aussi tes yeux marrons
Bien peu de choses
Mais nous n’aurons jamais vraiment
Le même regard sur les gens
Ni sur les choses

T’étais pas là, tu m’as manqué
Je me souviens d’avoir pleuré
Bien trop souvent
T’étais pas là, tant pis pour toi
T’as pas connu les premiers pas
De ton enfant

Tu oublies mes anniversaires
Ma vie ne t’intéresse guère
Pourtant parfois
J’aimerais bien un mot, un geste
Pour me faire croire qu’il me reste
Un vieux papa

Et si aujourd’hui j’ai trouvé
Des bras forts pour me protéger
J’ai toujours en tête
Le bon vieux temps des balançoires
Où tu ne m’as pas fait m’asseoir
Et je regrette

T’étais pas là, tu m’as manqué

Que je t’écris ce soir
Et voudras-tu connaître
Un jour notre histoire

C’est ton papa, peut-être
Qui te la traduira
À douze ans, à dix-sept
Enfin, quand tu voudras

J’y parle de ma vie
Et bien sûr de la tienne
Dans cette belle Asie
Aux frontières lointaines

Tu ne me connais pas
Je te connais à peine
Mais l’amour est parfois
Une invisible chaîne

J’ai reçu ta photo
Et j’aime ton prénom
Mon Dieu que tu es beau
Tu as les cheveux bien longs

Apprends-tu à écrire
Comment est ton village
Sais-tu que ton sourire
Me donne le courage

D’affronter les tourments
De ce monde en déroute
Qui laisse des enfants
Sur le bord de la route

Tu ne me connais pas
Je te connais à peine
Mais l’amour est parfois
Une invisible chaîne

Moi ma vie est tranquille
J’ai la chance insolente
D’avoir une famille
Attentive, attachante

Privilège suprême
Que, bien sûr, je te souhaite
J’ai un métier que j’aime
Et un toit sur ma tête

J’ai surtout, sache-le
De l’amour à revendre
Alors je t’en donne un peu
N’aie pas peur de le prendre

Tu ne me connais pas
Je te connais à peine
Mais l’amour est parfois
Une invisible chaîne

Si le peu que je donne
Te permet de manger
Et d’aller à l’école
Mon bonheur est entier

Un jour, à la Sorbonne
Tu viendras étudier
Je rêve, tu me pardonnes
Mais j’aime tant rêver

Pourvu que ton enfance
Soit une île aux trésors
Je t’embrasse en silence
Je t’écrirai encore

Tu ne me connais pas
Je te connais à peine
Mais l’amour est parfois
Une invisible chaîne",Tu Ne Me Connais Pas,2007
Romane Serda,"Voilà combien de jours, voilà combien de nuits
Voilà combien de temps que tu es reparti
Tu m'as dit cette fois, c'est le dernier voyage
Pour nos cœurs déchirés, c'est le dernier naufrage
Au printemps, tu verras, je serai de retour
Le printemps, c'est joli pour se parler d'amour
Nous irons voir ensemble les jardins refleuris
Et déambulerons dans les rues de Paris
Dis, quand reviendras-tu?
Dis, au moins le sais-tu?
Que tout le temps qui passe ne se rattrape guère
Que tout le temps perdu
Ne se rattrape plus
Le printemps s'est enfui depuis longtemps déjа
Craquent les feuilles mortes, brûlent les feux de bois
À voir Paris si beau dans cette fin d'automne
Soudain je m'alanguis, je rêve, je frissonne
Je tangue, je chavire, et comme la rengaine
Je vais, je viens, je vire, je me tourne, je me traîne
Ton image me hante, je te parle tout bas
Et j'ai le mal d'amour, et j'ai le mal de toi
Dis, quand reviendras-tu?
Dis, au moins le sais-tu?
Que tout le temps qui passe ne se rattrape guère
Que tout le temps perdu
Ne se rattrape plus
J'ai beau t'aimer encore, j'ai beau t'aimer toujours
J'ai beau n'aimer que toi, j'ai beau t'aimer d'amour
Si tu ne comprends pas qu'il te faut revenir
Je ferai de nous deux mes plus beaux souvenirs
Je reprendrai la route, le monde m'émerveille
J'irai me réchauffer à un autre soleil
Je ne suis pas de celles qui meurent de chagrin
Je n'ai pas la vertu des femmes de marins
Dis, mais quand reviendras-tu?
Dis, au moins le sais-tu?
Que tout le temps qui passe ne se rattrape guère
Que tout le temps perdu
Ne se rattrape plus",Dis quand reviendras-tu ?,2018

But were seen by the Good eye of the mean Billy Green
And he screamed at the top of his lungs They're on the run

Than be stuck up in a cell

So they chased the endless summer Though it came with the pride
They wouldn't stop running till They found a paradise
But the sheriff finally found them with his eyes seeing red
So the lovers had to shoot him down and fill him full of lead
They were finally free To find a place to lay their head
And when they finally did he looked at her and then he said

But that's because I know it is
If yo plane land with one hydrolic
Then get at me man cause I'm something special
You know I'm blessed
Like all the greats Noah, Moses, Jesus, Mary
The list goes on
If you believe in them
They'll believe in you
And you know
I've been given talents that people dream of man
You best believe I'm gonna use it to then best my ability
But you know for me
Patience is the key man
Cause if you look back at any great
I don't care if its Micheal Jordan
Or Micheal Jackson
Jesus, Mary
If read all there life stories
You know that life wasn't always easy for 'em man
They had there little ups and downs
I know, I know its crazy that they came out on top huh
Listen to this
Sooner then later
Everybody will be presented witha gift... in life
The same will be done with you

Nobody get money quite like I can
Couple shows couple million like the bank in my hand
Couple cars couple women boy you can't understand
How kid could be such a grown man
And I'm a winner baby I can't lose
And the winner is platinum P. Miller shoes
In the summer is a CL5, I'm so alive
Eyes wide open when them dos start to rise
I'm on another level iced link chain
I'm sprung like T-Pain
When they lookin at the puzzle mo press then Fort Knox
Either you wit it boy cause we won't stop
I got the whole streets backin me, whole club jumpin to it
Richie Rich Imma move it right before its Guttar Music
So hard to stand when I'm comin trough yo hood
I keep em around like I'm up to no good

[Hook: x2]
I'm the baddest alive you can see my clothes
You can see my cars you can see my chain
I'm the baddest alive how I get that dough
How I rock them shows how I do my thing

[Verse: girls]
I'm the king of the thrown yo kid killin the game
Well I take off my shirt your girl screamin my name
They say (I love Richie Rich) I say I love em the same
Keep the love like a pimp you see the ice on my chain
They say I'm doin my thang and I know I'm doin my thang
All the way to the bank boy gettin the change
No stoppin me I'm the hot combatable LeBron James of the game
First P. Miller to ride the street
Now who the baddest alive its no evident
No other then I keep the hood president
No one better then cold I'm a veteran
Leavin tha game with the flu and no medicine
Been raised by the number one hustler
I've been gettin it every since my days as a youngster
So don't rep the clues just cause your confused
Look whose winning the rap game you gon lose

I'm gon do what mama said
But ya'll ain't gonna tell me how to live my life
I might be young but I got bread
I'm straight form the hood so I ain't afraid

[Verse 1: Romeo]
Pops was a hustler even sold drugs
So it was only right that his son be a thug
Girls show me love and these niggas just mug
I'm the prince on the block
And I never sold drugs
H-O-O-D that's were I rep
Gotta keep the g up
White tee I got prep
Most thugs don't dance they just 1, 2 step
Pops danced with that stars
Yea he changed all that
Fear no man I'm the meaning of a beast
God's Gift to this earth teach others like a priest
The game is looking tasty and I think its time to feast
Don't rock adidas only P. Miller on the feet
Hard to sleep hearing bullets on the east
Hang with gorillas don't blend wit the streets
Mama said never give up you can make it
God blessed you don't let them haters take it

[Hook x2: Romeo]

[Verse 2: Romeo]
Mama said whatever don't kill you will make you stronger baby
But that's hard to believe when kids going crazy
A ghetto in the sky I think why to belive it
What about Santa what about Jesus
That's how I felt when I lost little Fred
Crazy how all the good guys end up dead
These need to stop all the pictures in my head
Martin Luther in my dreams with a bullet in his head
Brought up by a solider
I can't be scared
Got the whole hood behind me and the man upstairs
Life's like a test you know your gon stress
People think they know you best
Let the pain off your chest
Do you, never follow the rest
I making millions never got in know mess
Hater said this, hater said that
Through the ups and the downs
I know my fam got my back

I remember when, let me turn back time on Big Ben,
Let me tell you about the story from start to end,
Release the ink from my ballpoint pen, when it touches the page,

It reveals the message that I send,
Are you listening, let me tell you about my first and only christening,
My eyes all glistening, with the innocence of a blank page,
Life is like a blank page, enjoy the beef, the strife, the rage,

Wait... let me turn the page and continue to verbally burn the page,
With fire flows that are capable of burning down the stage,

From lemonade to alize, its all gravy, baby.
Remember when we used to say, ain't always gonna be this way
From lemonade to alize, its all gravy, baby...

Back in my school days, they was the cool days, school was the good old days now,
I tend to leave my teachers amazed they never knew my hard work paved the way,
When I talk about back in the days, the hard life, everything will be all gravy,
If I play my cards right, that's right, mother said keep close friends tight,

Keep frienemies in the distance, in the night,
Wait... let me turn the page and continue to verbally burn the page,
With fire flows that are capable of burning down the stage,

I go deeper than the graves
Where they bury the foot and mouth sheep

Take a peep

Dont screw up your face all bent

Dont let me get dark
Dont let me go in the boot of my car 
Thats in the car park

Until
I make a mill-

With my lyrical sounds them
Turn up the speaker then
'Cause i wanna go deeper then-a
Let me go deeper then

I wanna go
Back in the days when i never had nothing then
Never had enough money to buy all the sweets in the shop
So i put back some of them
Life was harder then
Hey afro, never go barber then
Grew up in a single parent family
Without no father then
So my mum took up harder then

Mum gets 10
Shes like one of the ravers them
up there chilling in V.I.P with her friend X2
Dont bother them then

Y en esta batalla yo saldré ganador
Mi corazón es el culpable
De que por ti tenga una pena de amor
Tu mayimbe esta cantando
Deja el jueguito y no me hagas un plantón
Linda y difícil, eres mujer
O quizás sera por ti timidez
Ay dime mami, decide ya

I work so hard at what I do yet I get so criticized
That I'm starting to feel it maybe my actions they're wrong

Whats in your heart?

Bueno Padre I mean
There are so many things that I'm not even sure si estoy bien o mal
Por ejemplo I can bye affordable clothes, y todavía lo sirve bien
But no I need expensive clothes you know top designers, the best of the best
I don't know I mean is this wrong, is this a sin

No hombre está loco, your talking to a guy who wears the same clothes everyday
Si padre pero hay mas, I can reach my destination flying commercial but I choose to fly private
I mean is that a sin

The sin would be to fly coach
What?
Va apretado ahí, that is the sin
Hm,
Te gustan las muñecas?
I don't that way that I play with muñecas
You are, are you into the ladies?
Oh yeah claro me gustan todas, es pecado eso

Well I'm in the music business, so you got the altura
Wait a minute? are you Romeo?
Yes father

Romeo my son you got the formula and they can never have the formula
Because they don't live like you live and they don't know what you know

Here's what I been suggest
Yea
I want you to go out there

O caliente como agua de la fuente
Tibio, tibio como un beso que calla
Y se enciende si es que acaso le quieres

Tu amor despierta y lava su carita
De rosas me salpica
Y sin saber es una vía láctea
Que gira y me da vida
Tu amor lo guardo dentro de mis ojos
Como una lagrimita
Y no los lloro para que no salgan
Tus besos de mi vista
Dime si mastico el verde menta de tu voz
O le pego un parcho a mi alma
Átame al pulgar derecho de tu corazón
Y dime como está mi amor en tu amor

Frío, frío como el agua del río
O caliente como agua de la fuente
Tibio, tibio como un beso que calla
Y se enciende si es que acaso le quieres
Pudiera ser un farolito 
Y encender tu luz
(Para encender mi luz)
Hasta que quieras tú
Frío, frío como el agua del río
O caliente como agua de la fuente
Tibio, tibio como un beso que calla
Y se enciende si es que acaso le quieres","Frío, Frío",2013

The King is back

No te imaginas el placer y honor que es tenerte como amigo
Cuantos años recorridos
Yo soy tu hermano y un soldado en devoción
Los golpes en la vida son muy crueles y aveces sale herido
Aquel que no lo ha merecido
Anoche fui testigo de una traición

Vi a tu esposa con un hombre cariñosa
Los primos no se besan en la boca
Lo que te ha hecho es un delito
Y sus besos son malditos, falso amor

La vi bien sospechosa cuando entraba a un motel
Con gafas y peluca, el traje rojo de Channel
El que le diste pa' su aniversario, la muy descarada

En tu propio BM lo monto y con el se fue

Y le tire dos fotos para prueba que es infiel
Mientras le das el cielo ella con otro se estruja en la cama
Lo que te ha hecho es un delito
Y sus besos son malditos, falso amor

Gostoso

Hay amigo mio
No sea palomo
Es una barbara

Abran paso, his daddy is back
Hay mis hijos

Ella te engaña no comprende el concepto de ser dama

Por estar sonando cancioncitas de amor
Melodías que relatan lo perfecto
Quizás a esos cantantes no le han roto el corazón

No creo esos versos,
Y sirvo de ejemplo
Que el amor no debería de existir
No hay un febrero
Que yo este contento
Y envidio al que sea feliz

Azul, tengo el alma en amargura,
Yo no se lo que es ternura,
Los horóscopos me mienten y la bola de cristal
Eh perdido la esperanza
Aquí tiro la toalla
El romance y la pasión no es para mi

Yo por amor escale muchas montañas
Sin temor a una avalancha y me caí
La televisión me hace daño,
Que mueran las novelas de amor
Y que el DJ pierda su trabajo,
Si me suenan cancioncitas de amor

Y el carajito de la flecha me caí mal

Así aseguro que es infame lo que alegas

Solo me detiene pensar que me dejes
Se acaban y no las pruebo, chamacas cooperen, cooperen

Yo te hago travesuras, mami hasta el amanecer
Tengo lo que hace falta para hacerte enloquecer

Romeo Stodart,"She loved me once, loved me twice
I broke her heart and left her reeling
I could not look her in the eyes
I could not face, where this was leading

I know that I should lose her now
It's true, I don't deserve her
And though I love her 'til I die
I know that I must leave her

She said, ""No, our love goes deeper than this""
She said, ""No, our love goes deeper than this""

Sent a rose a blackened rose
To atone for my mistreating
When she pressed it
To her breast, it pierced her flesh
And left her bleeding

I know that I should lose her now
It's true, I don't deserve her
And though I love her 'til I die
Now I must desert her

She said, ""No, our love goes deeper than this""
She said, ""No, our love goes deeper than this""

Even though there's poison in each kiss
She said, ""No, our love goes deeper than this""

Ti guardo nel silenzio 
Di questa nostra stanza di un hotel 
Fuori piove e intanto ti ripenso 
Al tempo che ho vissuto 
Insieme a te 

Caro amore 
Sembrava un'avventura in riva al mare 
Due nomi sulla sabbia 
Che il mare di settembre ha cancellato 
Eri donna passione e sentimento 
A volte il mio tornamento 
Eri tu ma l'amore è forte 
E non si ferma 

Neanche quando il mondo sembra cada giù 
Mi domando se veramente il nostro è un grande amore 
E dopo tanto tempo ancora 
Una risposta io non ho caro amore

Caro amore 
Insieme andremo avanti avanti finché il cuore ce la fa 
Anche quando si spengono I ricordi 
E l'argento nei capelli 
Ci sarà sul tuo viso 
La nostra storia un giorno leggerò 
Son pagine di un libro che insieme abbiamo scritto 
Per chi vive per amare 

Caro amore
Sembra ieri scrivevi 
Con quel fare da bambina 
Due nomi sulla sabbia che il mare di settembre 
Non ha mai più rubato

Di un paese che sogna e che sbaglia

Guardi lontano e perdi un po' di ciò che sei

Mafia, droga e gente che sta male
E la colpa di chi mai sarà?

Quel buco nell'ozono fa rumore

Quel modo di vestire un po strano con le mani sul piano.
Tu soltanto tu col trucco o senza niente sempre tu
Con la semplicita dei tuoi perche
Col muso per un vecchio rancore o col sorriso migliore.

Un'alchimia di solitudini e colori
L'attesa è già più rosa
Bianca l'idea che sposa
Davanti a lui la chiesa

Poi respirò l'incenso quindi capì l'immenso

Ma perchè questa notte
Alle ore più lunghe
Che non passano mai

Ma perchè ogni minuto
Dura un'eternità

Quando il sole tornerà 
E nel sole io verrò da te
Un'altro uomo troverai in me
E che non può più fare a meno di te

Quando il sole tornerà 
E nel sole io verrò da te
Amore amore corri incontro a me
E la notte non verrà mai più

Ma perchè
Ma perchè I miei pensieri
Sono sempre gli stessi 
E non cambiano mai

Ma perchè anche il silenzio
Sta parlandomi di te

'Cause my heart; oh, my heart still belongs to you

Ron,"Ti avevo visto angelo
Cadere in mezzo al traffico
Poi alzarti e piangendo
Con gli occhi guardare in su

Ti ho vista dietro un angolo
Cambiarti in fretta l'abito
E camminare
Ma che fatica non sai dove andare
E sopratutto non voli più

La strada bagnata sembra il cielo
Gli occhi delle case le sue stelle
Notte fonda che mistero
Che malinconia
A forza di guardarti
Sento gia' che sarai mia

Possiamo farci compagnia
Tu senza ali io senza fortuna
Che differenza c'è
Povero angelo povero me

In mezzo a una città che russa
Una città parcheggio
Tra facce sconosciute
Noi camminiamo ci fermiamo
Senza accorgerci arriviamo
Al centro esatto della musica

Ed è una musica che colpisce
Questa musica ti guarisce
Ti riporterà lontano
Per ricominciare il volo
Ma io sto qui e rimango solo
Con una luce che svanisce
Il cuore a pezzi e i suoi pezzi
Nella mano

Povero cuore
Povero e mio
Come vorrei provarci anch'io
A volare
Salire sempre piu su
Volare dentro un angolo
Cambiarmi in fretta l'abito
Ed imparare
Ad non avere tristezza
A non saper dove andare
A salutare e non tornare più

Volare come un'elica di una aeroplano
Poi passare sull'america che
Da qui è così lontano
Conservare un po' di forza
Un po' di fiato
Per volare nella musica
Che ancora nessuno ha mai suonato

E sotto una città che dorme
Una città parcheggio
Senza parole senza coraggio
E allora giù in mezzo al traffico
Per vedere cosa succede
Per scoprir se per un attimo
Qualcuno mi vede

E ancora giù fino a quell'angolo
Con un grosso batticuore
Con gli occhi un po' bagnati
E il cuore al posto del motore

Ron,"Ti ho guardato e per il momento
Non esistono due occhi come i tuoi, ah
Così neri, così soli che
Se mi guardi ancora e non li muovi
Diventan belli anche i miei

E si capisce da come ridi che
Che fai finta e che non capisci, tu non vuoi guai, ah
Ma ti giuro che per quella bocca che
Che guardo diventa rossa
Morirei, morirei

Ma chissà se lo sai? 
Chissà se lo sai? 
Forse tu non lo sai
No, tu non lo sai

Così parliamo delle distanze
E del cielo e di dove andrà a dormire la luna
Quando esce il sole
Chissà di come era la terra prima che ci fosse l'amore
Sotto quale stella, tra mille anni
Se ci sarà una stella, ci si potrà abbracciare? 

Poi la notte col suo silenzio regolare
Quel silenzio che a volte sembra la morte
Mi dà il coraggio di parlare
E di dirti tranquillamente
Di dirtelo finalmente
Che ti amo
E che di amarti non smetterò mai

Così adesso lo sai, oh
Così adesso lo sai

Ron,"Cosa hai sentito ragazzo di miele quando hai lasciato il tuo banco di scuola
E la tua storia cosi cominciava e quanta neve che ha fatto da allora
Cosa hai sognato ragazzo di strada quando tuo padre un gigante sembrava
E assomigliargli era la tua maniera per ringraziarlo del bene che dava
Accendevi una stella rovente con un ferro la tenevi distante
Imparavi a memoria I tuoi dischi la puntina era di diamante
Ed avevi la barba di grano e ora il grano si è fatto grande

Cuore affamato di carezze di cani
Di amori puliti come quelli dei cretini
Cuore assetato di belle parole
Cuori in alto mare per una frase detta male

Con la tua sciarpa ragazzo di neve e questa nebbia che va fino al fiume
Nella tua testa hai mille parole che si congelano in una canzone
Che cosa hai visto ragazzo di specchio piccole rughe entrate senza permesso
Aprile foglie di amori volare rondine partono per un altro mare
Nelle scarpe o sulle labbra il tuo cuore che hai dato indietro 
Il tuo cuore che era fragile cuore di vetro

Cuore affamato di carezze di cani
Di amori puliti come quelli dei cretini

Con l'unico vestito ogni giorno più corto
E benché non sapesse il nome
E neppure il paese
M'aspettò come un dono d'amore fino dal primo mese

Compiva sedici anni quel giorno la mia mamma
Le strofe di taverna
Le cantò a ninna nanna
E stringendomi al petto che sapeva
Sapeva di mare
Giocava a far la donna con il bimbo da fasciare

E forse fu per gioco o forse per amore
Che mi volle chiamare come nostro Signore
Della sua breve vita è il ricord, il ricordo più grosso
È tutto in questo nome
Che io mi porto addosso

E bevo vino

Io che qui sto morendo e tu che mangi il gelato

Tu corri dietro al vento e sembri una farfalla
E con quanto sentimento ti blocchi 
E guardi la mia spalla
Se hai paura a andar lontano, puoi volarmi nella mano
Ma so già cosa pensi, tu vorresti partire
Come se andare lontano fosse uguale a morire
E non c'è niente di strano ma non posso venire

Debbo parlarti come non faccio mai 
Voglio sognarti come non ti sogno mai 
Essere l'anello che porterai 
La spiaggia dove camminerai 
Lo specchio che ti guarda se lo guarderai
Lo guarderai 
Vorrei essere l'uccello che accarezzerai 
E dalle tue mani non volerei mai
Vorrei esser la tomba quando morirai 
E dove abiterai 
Il cielo sotto il quale dormirai 
Così non ci lasceremo mai 
Neanche se muoio e lo sai 

Tu, tu non mi basti mai 
Davvero non mi basti mai 
Io io io ci provo sai 
Non mi dimenticare mai",Tu non mi basti mai,2018

Nineteen-ninety-eight, damn I can't believe it 

Whoever thought, throughout the drama, we'd live to see it 

So many of us done lost lives to the streets 

As we reminisce I'm pourin liquor for the deceased 

Thinkin bout the times that I spent with many of em 

Hopin that the Lord let me see the millennium 

Trapped in this ghetto main, seekin better days 

Fightin for my conscience, tryin to shake these wicked ways 

I know it's wrong but it's hard to change 

All my life, all I ever knew was hustle and game 

Lookin for answers ever since I was a adolescent 

Faced with rejection, early age stressin 

But now ten years later with doodoo respect 

I'm bustin million dollar raps and six digit checks 

Showin love to my peeps and my love don't change 

Here's a toast to you fakes, huh, here's to better days

Touch a meal ticket, shake a spot for good 

Never, I still got love for the neighborhood 

And even though now it's infested with gunplay 

on most days like Bootsy I can't stay away 

Cause if I shook like y'all shook on me 

Then whose gon' stay and guide the way for the lil homies? 

I can't turn my head on my folks 

so I stay visible in these streets and try to give hope 

Born in the ghetto, raised in the ghetto 

Got love for the ghetto, I can't forget the ghetto 

How come everytime we get some change in our can 

we run away and try to move out as far as we can? 

I know that jealousy's the devil's greed but you worse 

than a devil when you turn your back on these young G's 

Now feel every word that I say, hear my cry 

as I struggle out of thirst and search for better days

Another day another dollar, it feels good to look around 

and see I'm surrounded by real riders 

Childhood comrades I ran with for years 

Shared the same beer and tears over the same peers 

Player haters swearin that all we all G's 

off each others strength with these, regulates the same cheese 

No jealousy we all family like Sister Sledge 

Lace each other with game, so I can spin beer cans 

Watch our kids grow together, as we get old together 

Loc I mean this, let no one come in between this 

Keep our business among us, behind doors and eyes closed 

on those we consider as foes 

Outsiders never exposed to your hustle 

Plus I'm, never been one likely to trust em 

No negative association, just dedication

We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it cool down now

We meet every day at the same cafe
Six-thirty I know she'll be there
Holding hands, making all kinds of plans
While the jukebox plays our favorite song

Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones

Mrs. Jones got a thing going on, we both know that it's wrong

Please stay right by my side
Two can be one
The righteous way to go
Been a while but no
I'll believe if I'm told so
You're second to none

The question is what do I know about love
They ask me all the time do I know about love
Naturally I say yes but I don't know shit
'cause if I did I wouldn't be in and out of relationships
Why? Do I get caught up in eye candy
A few days I pound she ain't nowhere to be found
Everyday I pull so many dimes
I need to change my middle name to one line
'cause I got so many one liners
I try to tell her I was ready to go all the way
But she couldn't be patient with me
And now look at the end result
She ain't here to get these roses I brought
But I'ma keep my self-esteem up
And keep looking for some real love
You know its true what they say
Love's as precious as a rose
Will I ever find a rose I don't know

It's been a miracle from what you've done

Been a while but no
I'll believe if I'm told so

I seen it coming way before we got here
You want me to put you over my whole career
My career was here first and its here to stay
Don't trip girl you're still a prior life and
Movie sets, rhyming, singing, and world tours
If I ain't got a rose in my life then what's it all for
You think I wanna be in private jets
Laid up in five star hotels by myself
Nope I want a rose to share with
The blessing of a backbone but I can't stay alone
I come home to a home cooked meal
A manicure pedicure without seeing a bill
Am I describing you I don't know
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life living single
Patience is a virtue that's the way that it goes
The question is will I find my rose is that you

It's been a miracle from what you've done

My moms taught me not to wear emotions on my sleeves
So when I leave please believe I'ma leave man
I'm not a charity case
But you might have to donate some love tips and show me the way
'cause if I really knew it all
You think y'all would have to talk to me about how to love and all
Naw I'd be on top of the world
At twenty seven with a wife, pregnant, and white picket fences and shit
It's cool I'ma get there soon
Running around in the yard having fun with my little ones
Thinking to myself I had my share
There's gonna be women everywhere
Not like the one I got here
Independent, fine as hell and got her own career
And if I ever needed her
She'll be right there
Is that you damn

I feel like I got something
But at the same time I don't
It's lonely out here

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh

Ron Blake,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel

You can catch one in the gut, and go down
The silencers work to muffle that sound
Snuck through tools and on the low down
Gangstas give it up, what
Big cups of Goose stay filled-it up, we stay four wheeled-it up
I would talk to shorty but her ass ain't big enough
Her friends look like the type that'll just give it up
From abyss to gecko, stay bumrushing them hoes like Joe Klecko

Excuse me, I'm locked in here
Why is the song still going? I'm locked in the booth!

I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me, but there's no one to love me

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream

Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball

For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Ron Carter,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely

I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

He found an eating place in town,
He read the menu through and through,
To see what fifteen cents could do.

One meatball, one meatball,
He could afford but one meatball.

He told the waiter near at hand,
The simple dinner he had planned.
The guests were startled, one and all,
To hear that waiter loudly call, ""What,

""One meatball, one meatball?
Hey, this here gent wants one meatball.""

The little man felt ill at ease,
Said, ""Some bread, sir, if you please.""
The waiter hollered down the hall,
""You gets no bread with one meatball.

""One meatball, one meatball,
Well, you gets no bread with one meatball.""

One meatball was all he had,
And in his dreams he hears that call,

So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know,1993

How high can you fly
You'll never, never, never reach the sky

He feels tired and he lays on his bed
Hopes the men will find courage in the words that he said

May God give you strength

Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",Birth of the Blues,2003

Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in the moment this order's tall

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

Come on skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted
And then who the hell was I?
And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines

Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?",The Fool on the Hill,2008
Ron Goodwin,"Earth in shadow, restlessly hold
Labour's waiting, in silent hope
For the promise, it longs to know
What heaven holds

Then the angels, in holy haste
Lift their anthem, Your Saviour lays
In a manger, in humble form
Your King is born

Hail the prince of heaven comes
Angel choirs sound the call
For this babe wrapped in a cloth is
The incarnate word of God
All the kingdom and its power
Resting now in this child
Prince of heaven
Jesus, hope of the world

This means mercy in fullest form
Loving-kindness forevermore
Son of David and Son of God
He is Christ, the Lord

Hail the prince of heaven comes
Angel choirs sound the call
For this babe wrapped in a cloth is
The incarnate word of God
All the kingdom and its power
Resting now in this child
Prince of heaven
Jesus, hope of the world

King of glory, we gladly greet
Born in wonder and majesty
Forever worthy, the earth will sing
Oh, prince of heaven, we worship Thee

King of glory, we gladly greet
Born in wonder and majesty
Forever worthy, the earth will sing
Oh, prince of heaven, we worship Thee

We can know Him, this prince of peace
In light of mercy, confess our sin
Lay our burdens at Jesus' feet
And with gladness sing

Hail the prince of heaven comes
Angel choirs sound the call
For this babe wrapped in a cloth is
The incarnate word of God
All the kingdom and its power
Resting now in this child
Prince of heaven
Jesus, hope of the world",A Hard Day's Night,2017
