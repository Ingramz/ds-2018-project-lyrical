Baba B.,"Here I am, playing with those mem'ries again,
And just when I thought time had set me free,
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me.
Holding you, a feeling I never outgrew,
Though each and ev'ry part of me has tried,
Only you can fill that space inside,
So there's no sense pretending, my heart is not mending,

Just when I thought I was over you,
And just when I thought I could stand on my own,
Oh, baby those mem'ries come crashing through,
And I just can't go on without you.

On my own, I've tried to make the best of it alone.
I've done ev'rything I can to ease the pain.
But only you can stop the rain.
I just can't live without you, I miss ev'rything about you.

Just when I thought I was over you,
And just when I thought I could stand on my own,
Oh, baby those mem'ries come crashing through,
And I just can't go on without, go on without,
It's just no good without you.
Without you.
Without you.
Without you.
Without you.",Here I Am,2003
Baba Brooks,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town

Baba Brooks,"The buzzard took the monkey for a ride in the air
The monkey thought that ev'rything was on the square
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back
The monkey grabbed his neck and said, ""Now, listen, Jack
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top
Ain't no use in divin'. What's the use of jivin'?
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top""
The buzzard told the monkey, ""You're choking me
Release your hold and I'll set you free""
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said
""Your story's touching, but is sounds like a lie""
Straighten up and fly right, straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right, cool down papa, don't you blow your top",(Straighten Up And) Fly Right,2004
Baba Saad,"Unterm Strich gibt es auf dieser Welt nur 2 Arten von Menschen, 
Du hast die Schwätzer und die Macher. 
Die meisten sind Bloßschwätzer, die können nix als labern. 
Aber wenn alles gesagt ist, 
Dann sind es die Macher die diese Welt verändern 
Und wenn sie das tun verändern sie auch uns weswegen wir sie nie vergessen. 
Zu welchen gehörst du ? 
Schwätzt du nur rum oder stehst du auf und tust was. 
Denn eins kannst du mir glauben, alles andere ist gequirlte Scheiße.

Halt deine Füße still ich bin zurück, 
Jetzt wird gefickt junge sdoppela neues Album neues Glück, 
Setz die Messlatte hoch, 
Rap die ganz krassen Flows bin in Topform 
Ihr bringt nur noch Pfandflaschen raus Baba Saad 
Ich bin weder feind noch bin ich dein Kamera, 
Mikrofon Massaker mit Songs die sonst keiner hat 
Kill dein Rap seit Jahren ich pack die Freshness auf Beats 
Hab hier absolut kein Platz, weil du lesbisch aussiehst. 
Es ist 2013 ich zerleg wenn ich das Mic nehm' 
Rapper können heim gehen und einsehen 
Das ich absolut der beste bin in meiner sparte 
Ich piss' auf dein Ghetto geb' ein Fick auf die Straße 
Ich mach nie wieder den Kragen hoch, scheiß' auf Lederjacke 
Ich hoff' du Missgeburt erstickst an deiner Nase Koks 
Sdoppelad Dresscoat ist Dopeness 
Und wenn dir dieses Album gefällt dikka kauf es!",Intro,2006
Baba Saad,"Du hast gesagt ich bin nicht gut für dich.
Warum kommst du bei mir an?
Warum willst du mich zurück?
Warum nennst du mich dein Mann?
Denkst du, wenn du von mir weißt, dass ich mich interessier',
Mir werde scheißegal, sogar wenn du Bitch krepierst
Es gibt Sachen, die man nie ändert kann
Eine Nutte, bleibt 'ne Nutte, so wie du ist bis ein Leben lang.
Ich hab gesagt, das du Schlampe dich verpissen sollst
Und hab es ernst gemeint, hast du nicht ein bisschen Stolz?
Ich hab deine Sippe beleidigt, und jetzt willst du mich zurück, du Nutte
Nein, ich verzeih nicht
Du hast bei mir nix verloren um zu finden,
Das einzige was du jetzt machen kannst ist verschwinden
Was du kriegen sollst ist irgendso ein Bassad,
Der dich behandelt so wie Scheiße, ja du hasst das
Mehr als Wahr die Tun, eh spiel' nicht den Engel,
In der Hölle sollst du innerlich verbrennen

Ich hätte nie daran gedacht, das du so bist,
Du Misststück, ich wünsche, das du tot bist
Ich hasse dich, du bist 'ne Hurre, 'ne Blamage
Und ich wünsche du würdest verbluten an ein Tagen

Ich hätte nie daran gedacht, das du so bist,
Du Misststück, ich wünsche, das du tot bist
Ich hasse dich, du bist 'ne Hurre, 'ne Blamage
Und ich wünsche du würdest verbluten an ein Tagen

Südländische Nutte, es ist egal was du jetzt von mir sagst,
Es ist mir auch egal, das du mir mal wichtig warst
Du kannst erzählen was du willst, ich war der erste,
Der dich gefickt hat, verweist du noch die Schmerzen
Ich musste was gestehen, du warst nie gut im Bett.
Lern von deiner besten Freundin, sie ist nicht wie du ein Brett!
Hat dich das verletzt, egal du Bitch verreckst
Hab ich dich nicht mal gesagt, ich gewinne in dem Fang
Du hast mir nicht geglaubt, du dachtest ich komm wieder an.
Merk dir eins du Nuttentochter, ich bin nicht wie jeder Mann.
Ich hab mein Stolz und jetzt fickst du mich bestimmt nicht.
Hol die Jamila an, das ganze Land beschimpft dich.
Du bist nur eine Rattentochter, die auf nett macht,
Deine Zeit ist abgelaufen. Wer frisst den Dreck, Schatz?
Deine Ehre, ja ich fick sie tot,
Jeder weißt es, ich bin nicht dein Habibi, du Missgeburt!

Ich hätte nie daran gedacht, das du so bist,
Du Misststück, ich wünsche, das du tot bist
Ich hasse dich, du bist 'ne Hurre, 'ne Blamage
Und ich wünsche du würdest verbluten an ein Tagen

Ich hätte nie daran gedacht, das du so bist,
Du Misststück, ich wünsche, das du tot bist
Ich hasse dich, du bist 'ne Hurre, 'ne Blamage
Und ich wünsche du würdest verbluten an ein Tagen","Jamila, Pt. 2",2013
Baba Saad,"Baby es ist wahr für mich hat jeder Tag ein Happy End, 
Wenn du mir dann am Abend vor dem Schlafen gehen ein Lächeln schenkst
Ich hab in der Nacht den Song für dich geboren
Weil ich dich liebe ohne dich bin ich in Krisen voller Zorn sag
Was ist mein Leben wert? Wenn dein Herz nicht jeden Tag für mich schlägt
Es ist unmöglich und nicht schwer
Jeder Atemzug von mir ist für dich bestimmt
Neben dir bin ich unschuldig wie ein kleines Kind
Alles was ich dir erzähle ist auch ernst gemeint
Und dass ich für dich sterben würde ist auch ernst gemeint
Dieser Song ist wie ein Antrag
Ich will dass du meine Frau wirst ich versteh ja dass du angst hast
Aber das brauchst du nicht
Denn was ich fühl' ist echt

Als ich sagte du bist anders hatte ich damit recht
Keiner kann mir geben was du hast
Ich werde zum reichsten Mann der Welt wenn du lachst
Und deine Augen wenn sie glänzen unbeschreiblich
Ich bin nicht einfach gestrickt ja das weiß ich
Aber für dich würde ich die Wolken ausradieren
Damit die Sonne scheint mein Schatz ich will keine außer dir
Ich kann mir mein Leben ohne dich nicht vorstellen
Ich reiß mein Herz für dich raus kann ich vorstellen
Das ist das Herz von mir
Das ist das Herz von Saad
Dieses Herz hat dich geliebt seit dem ersten Tag
Und bis es nicht mehr schlägt es gehört nur dir
Auch wenn du es wegschmeißt
Es gehört nur dir
Nimm es an, denn du hast es dir verdient
Bis der Tod uns dann scheidet bleib ich in dich verliebt",Seit dem Ersten Tag,2013
Baba Saad,"Ich kann zu dieser Sache keine Eckdaten nennen
Nur versprechen, irgendwann wird dieser Drecksladen brennen
Ihr Dreckshurensöhne müsst für eure Taten g'rade stehen -
Ich rauch' 'ne Kippe, während Flammen euch den Atem nehmen

Ihr schreit laut
Und obwohl ihr keine Promo macht
Doch ihr stößt bei mir auf taube Ohren, wie mit Ohropax
Ihr kleinen Hurensöhne widert mich so an
Keine Waffen : Doch ich hab das Magazin in der Hand

Yeah
Hassreden hier
Hassreden da
Seit über 10 Jahr'n ihr Fotzen und das geht nicht klar
Ich schör :
Ich werde bald persönlich nach Konstanz maschier'n
Hätt' ich Araber geschickt, wäre sonst was passiert

Demnächst wird sich jeder dieser halbstarken Krüppel wundern
Wenn ich komme, läuft es ihn'n eiskalt den Rücken runter
Ich hoffe echt, dass dieses Treffen bald zu Stande kommt
Schick' die Nutte in die Hölle, dann wird sie ?

Ich will euch brennen sehen

Keine Sorge, wenn ich fertig bin hol' ich den Leichenwagen
Keine Frage
Dass ich solche Fotzen vernichte
Wenn ich lese, was ihr schreibt
Muss ich kotzen ihr Bitches
Yeah!

Stellt euch einmal vor, dass euch ein Unglück passiert
Denn Leichenteile werden euer Grundstück verzier'n
Und fick' die Entschuldigung
Weil's nichts mehr zu reden gibt
Sag!
Wer zeigt mich an?
Hm?
Wenn keiner mehr am Leben ist

Sowas findet hier erst recht kein Gehör
Ich fick jeden Formation bis zum Chefredaktuer
Ja
Und jetzt wird es ziemlich eng
Guck' ihr lehnt euch zu weit aus dem Fenster
Weil eure Missgeburtenfirma brennt

Keine Gnade für behinderte Nutten
Ja ich mach' das alles ohne mit der Wimper zu zucken

Ja auch ich kann nicht supersicher sagen , was der Morgen bringt
Außer eine Sache: Das das keine leeren Worte sind

Baba Saad,"Endlich bin ich über dich hinweggekommen, Jamila
Um dich zu vergessen zog ich wie behindert Kokaina
Hab mich selbst gefickt und es nicht mehr gemerkt, wurde zum Drogenopfer
Was ein Scheiß, Alter, wegen einer Hurentochter
Als ich fast gestorben bin hast du nicht angerufen
Es war dir scheißegal, du wolltest mich nicht mal besuchen
Ich weiß das du an dem Tag in einer Disco warst
Wie eine Ehrenlose sagst das es nicht so war
Weißt du eigentlich, dass ich an dem Tag dein Blut verlangte
Doch ich wollt nicht in den Bau rein wegen einer Schlampe
Die Drogen, die ich wegen dir genommen hab waren genug
Als ich wach wurde war 'ne Frau, es warst nicht du
Obwohl ich schon erwartet hätte, dass du kommen würdest
Doch du warst am Lutschen wie 'ne Nutte in 'nem Bonzenviertel
Keine Sorge, nein, ich weine dir nicht hinterher
Ich will dir nur warum du heute hier sein musst erklären

Jamila
Bis heute hast du Glück gehabt, Glück gehabt
Du Nuttentochter ich hab die Geschichte satt, Geschichte satt
Jamila
Sag mir was ist bitte mit dir los
Jamila, Jamila
Das ist dein 

Jamila
Doch heute hast du kein Glück
Du Nutte, dein scheiß Lächeln hilft dir kein Stück
Jamila
Sag mir was ist bitte mit dir los
Jamila, Jamila, das hier ist dein Tod

Wie bereits erwähnt
Es war 'ne Frau da, es warst nicht du
Sie hat sich um mich gekümmert, das mit jedem Atemzug
Obwohl ich sie zu dieser Zeit nicht geliebt hab
Doch jedes mal als ich sie gebraucht hab war sie da
Eines Tages wurd ich endlich wieder gesund
Sie sagte mir „Hoffentlich wird irgendwas aus uns“
Jamila, wegen dir dacht' ich jede Frau ist 'ne Bitch
Doch ich hab mich geirrt, diese Frau war es nicht
Komisch, aber mit der Zeit lernt ich sie zu lieben
Auf einmal war es vorbei mit den Schmerzen und den Krisen
Zwei Jahre später hab ich sie zu meiner Frau gemacht
Du Schlampe hast es mitbekommen und jetzt aufgepasst
Du hast dich schlecht gefühlt und wurdest eifersüchtig
Das sie von mir schwanger war, darauf nahmst du keine Rücksicht
Also dachtest du Nutte du lauerst ihr auf
Jamila, du wirst heute sterben für den Tritt in den Bauch

Jamila
Bis heute hast du Glück gehabt, Glück gehabt
Du Nuttentochter, ich hab die Geschichte satt
Jamila
Sag mir was ist bitte mit dir los
Jamila, Jamila
Das ist dein 

Jamila
Doch heute hast du kein Glück
Du Nutte, dein scheiß Lächeln hilft dir kein Stück
Jamila
Sag mir was ist bitte mit dir los
Jamila, Jamila, das hier ist dein Tod

Denkst du ich hab mit dir Mitleid?
Du sitzt hier und weinst
Bettel mich nicht an, du Hure, denn darauf gib ich 'nen Scheiß
Du hast mir mein Kind genommen, drum nimm ich dir dein Leben
Du solltest eigentlich wissen warum spielt man nicht mit Ehre
Jamila, Jamila, hat gelebt wie 'ne Schlampe
Deswegen wird Jamila sterben wie 'ne Schlampe
Guck mich an, während ich die schlachte wie ein Lamm
Nutte, wenigstens wurdest du geschlachtet von 'nem Mann

Jamila
Bis heute hast du Glück gehabt, Glück gehabt
Du Nuttentochter, ich hab die Geschichte satt
Jamila
Sag mir was ist bitte mit dir los
Jamila, Jamila
Das ist dein 

Jamila
Doch heute hast du kein Glück
Du Nutte, dein scheiß Lächeln hilft dir kein Stück
Jamila
Sag mir was ist bitte mit dir los

Baba Saad,"Ich erzähle euch jetzt mal was ich fühle
Das hat nichts zu tun mit Deepness oder Gangsterattitüde
Nein ich wollte einfach Danke sagen
In den ganzen Jahren seid ihr treu geblieben
Gruß an jeden hier, der standhaft war
Meine Karierre schien für kurze Zeit echt angeschlagen
Viele waren verwirrt, weil von Baba Saad lang nichts kam
Jeder eurer Mails hat mich immer echt gefreut
Wenn wir uns nicht sahen sprach ich übers Internet zu euch
Ihr kennt meine Facebook-Seite, Ihr habt sie geliket
Fragt mich was bei euch passiert, es wird wieder Zeit
Zu wissen wie es euch geht, denn das macht mir sehr zu schaffen
Wie meine Hauptschlagader seid ihr mir ans Herz gewachsen
Jung oder alt ist im Grunde doch gleich
Es gibt viele Stationen, doch für uns gibt's kein Halt
Jeder Fan hat eine Frage, also muss es auch 'ne Antwort geben
Meine Saadliner folgt mir zum Nachtgespräch

Auch wenn jeder in der Szene meinen Namen vergisst
Kann ich sagen, dass ihr immer da wart für mich
Das ist mehr Wert als Bares und Klicks
Ich sag es wie es ist
Danke an die besten Fans der Welt

Vieles lief schief, doch auch ich habe gelernt
Ich versuche euch jetzt die momentane Lage zu erklären
Oft werde ich gefragt: ""Saad, Deutschland oder Libanon?""
Ich weiß es leider nicht, weil ich beide Länder liebe Punkt
Warum ich mein Leben hier niemals bereue?
Gott gab mir was ich brauche
Hab Familie und Freunde
Ob ich jemals erfahren habe was Liebe bedeutet
Ist so schwer zu sagen, doch versuchs auf Neue
Blonde Haare, grüne Augen
Dein Aussehen ich arisch deutsch
Welche Sprache ich kann? Arabisch und Straßendeutsch
„Saad, warum sind die meisten Rapper solche Hurensöhne?“
Weil ihr Mütter kleine Huren sind, die Hurensöhne
Deswegen bin ich lieber Einzelgänger
Doch Mister Massaker hat auf der Straße noch die meisten Männer
Wenn ihr wollt, dass ich auch euch eine Antwort gebe
Geht auf meine Facebookseite, folgt mir zum Nachtgespräch

Baba Saad,"Das geht an jeden meiner Fans der bis heute noch zur Schule geht
Scheiß auf Schule-Themen, ich will nur das du verstehst
Dass es wichtig ist das du deine Patte machst
Also sei nicht abgefuckt, sieh' verdammt nochmal das du dein Abschluss schaffst
Grad in Mathe muss ich stets um gute Noten bitten
Denn wie willst du Vollidiot ohne Wissen Drogen ticken?
Modeflittchen werden oder Koka sniffen
Wenn du gute Kurse hast mit Prozenten 
werden sie sogar Schore spritzen
Lern' doch Fremdsprachen, 
oder haben meine Jungs nicht verdeutlicht
dass nicht jeder deutsch spricht?
Anatomie hat mein Kopf gefickt, wobei es lustig war zu wissen, 
Junge, wem man welche Knochen bricht
Hoffentlich checkst du das, Ethik darauf musst du kacken
Solche Fächer nutze ich nicht einmal um mir Luft zu machen
Nein du brauchst auch keine guten Noten in Geschichte schreiben
Denn allein durch deine Taten wirst du schon Geschichte schreiben

Dann kommt er halt paar Stunden zu spät
Ja man so gesehen verlief es für mich ohne Regeln
Mein Zeugnis war egal ja, denn ich kann keine Noten lesen
Nutz ich nicht, geographisches Wissen ist ganz cool
Damit du Opfer weißt in welcher Hood du bist
Aber Bio hab ich echt nicht begriffen
Da ging's um Grünzeug aber nicht um Blättchen zu kiffen, häh?
Doch in ? ging's das erste Mal um Gangstergeschichten
Hab zum Messer gegriffen und nach etlichen Stichen
Meine dumme Lehrerin dann aus dem Fenster geschmissen
Denn in Sexkunde zeigte sie mir hässliche Titten
Hatte ein schlechtes Gewissen, so als hätt' ich beschissen
Doch von der Schule musste ich mich letztendlich verpissen
Aber versuch meine Message zu blicken:
Zieh' die Schule lieber durch, denn nicht jeder wird ein Rapper im Business

Baba Saad,"Sie haben mich schon früher einen Dickkopf genannt
Weil sie merkten, dass mein Leben nur aus HipHop bestand
Ich die Regel und Norm in jeglicher Form
Nur missachtet hab, ständig gingen sie gegen mich vor
Schon in der Schule, als ich im Büro vor meinem Direktor saß
Hat er gesagt „Du bereust das mit dem Rap nochmal
Denn im Ernst, das ist doch kein Beruf“
Aber ich hab nur gedacht, Alter komm, du bist schwul
Meine Klassenkameraden dachten immer, dass ich dumm bin
Unsinn, und ich wusste, was dich nicht umbringt
Macht einen nur stärker, also arbeit' ich härter
Selbst wenn ich weiß, dass es gar keinen Wert hat
Was sie alle so reden, manche lieben, manche hassen dich eben
Und genau das ist das Leben
Und ich laufe lieber Jahre durch den prasselnden Regen
Als mein Herz an eine falsche Sache zu geben wenn du ihnen glaubst

Sie haben immer nur gesagt, was ich nicht kann
Gesagt, dass ich nichts kann, du wirst kein Glück haben
Wenn du ihnen glaubst, denn wenn du ihnen glaubst
Kann es sein, dass du dein Leben verbaust, Pläne gehen nicht auf
Wenn du an irgendjemand anders deine Seele verkaufst
Wenn du immer nur auf sie und ihre Regeln vertraust
Sei ein Mann und nehm' die Fehler in Kauf
Denn es ist aus, wenn du ihnen glaubst

Es war nicht nur das Verhalten, nein, mein Aussehen sollt' ich auch ändern
Die meisten Leute sahen mich immer nur als Ausländer
Doch ich blieb ich selbst, nein, sie hatten sich geirrt
Denn der Araber in mir konnte das nicht akzeptieren
Nein, es wurde echt schwer
Und mit der Zeit habe ich drauf geschissen mich mit Worten zu wehr'n
Ja, der ganze Hass machte in mir etwas kaputt
Und das erste mal im Leben hab ich ein Messer benutzt
Ich hab zugestochen, jeder Lehrer hat es prophezeit
Anfang beim Direktor und das Ende bei der Polizei
Ohne Scheiß, ich hatte stets ein gutes Gewissen
Man gab mir eine Chance, doch ich hab die Schule geschmissen
Und jeden scheiß Tag hoffte ich auf morgen
Denn für mich und die Familie konnte ich als kleiner Junge noch nicht sorgen
Doch heute kann ich sagen, ja, aus mir ist was geworden
Dabei schrieb ich nur paar Songs und so schoss ich halt empor

Sie haben immer nur gesagt, was ich nicht kann
Gesagt, dass ich nichts kann, du wirst kein Glück haben
Wenn du ihnen glaubst, denn wenn du ihnen glaubst
Kann es sein, dass du dein Leben verbaust, Pläne gehen nicht auf
Wenn du an irgendjemand anders deine Seele verkaufst
Wenn du immer nur auf sie und ihre Regeln vertraust

Baba Saad,"Womit habe ich das verdient mein Volk ist am sterben
Meine Landsleute halten aus gefoltert zu werden
Manche werden Verfolgt manche werden umgebracht
Und genau deswegen entwickelt sich unser Hass
Wir sind Menschen so wie ihr es seit
Keine Scheiße Terroristen Junge ich will das es jeder weiß
Es gibt Leute die uns fragen was wir hier verloren haben
In diesem fremden Land das kann ich euch genau sagen
Wen die Amis kommen um uns zu bombardieren
Danach tun sie so als wäre nix davon passiert
Und uns keiner helfen will dann müssen wir halt fliehen
Über Hunderttausend tote was zu viel ist ist zu viel
Dieser Obama ist der größte Terrorist von allen
Er tötet Kinder töten Frauen nur um nicht zu fallen
Es geht um Geld, um Müll. um das uns dies
Lieber Gott sag mir womit hab ich das verdient

Womit habe ich das verdient fragen sich meine Landsleute
Leute es liegt immer noch in eurer Hand heute
Womit haben wir das verdient das wir jetzt am Ende sind

Sagt mir wieso wird immer noch geschossen in Beirut
Es hat sich nicht geändert seit dem ersten Teil
Das wir in Frieden leben wollen scheint wohl schwer zu sein
Der Bruder meines Vaters ist immer noch nicht zurück
Wo sind die Menschenrechte hin sag wo ist das Glück
Und die Tränen meiner Mutter kommen immer wieder
Nicht jeder Araber ist Kämpfer bei der Al qaida
Im Gegenteil meine Leute sind auf Frieden aus
Weil wir der Meinung sind das unser Land den Krieg nicht braucht
Wir wollen nur Leben den es wurde schon zu viel Gestorben
Warum freuen sich kleine Kinder heute nicht auf Morgen
Weil sie Angst haben ihren Vater zu verlieren
Erzähl mir ist es richtig das soetwas noch passiert
Es geht um Macht es geht um das und die
Sag mir Lieber Gott womit habe ich das verdient

Baba Saad,"Dreh' dein Wort so oft du willst, versprochen
Du bleibst zu weich
Nur Haut und Fleisch ohne Knochen
So falsch
Wie vor dem Fick das Gummi durchstochen
Hälst dir immernoch ein' Rückweg offen
In Geschichten wie Rambo die Ochsen erschossen
Doch du bist nur Wasser, das verdampft, wenn ich koche
Du Ghettotourist, rein kriminalitätsfern
Alles was du bist, leider realitäsfern
Digga, deine YouTube-Videos machen dich nicht echter
Plastik-Waffen, Monatslohn 
Fotos, keine Gangster
Die Anonymität ist im Netz immer frecher
Denn höchstens ein schlechter Verbrecher
Postet seine „Dreckstat“
Schmutziges Geschäft bringt dir kein Respekt ran
Sondern nur wenn du kämpfst, auch wenn alle anderen wegwaren
Denn das Gesicht zeigt sich erst, wenn es schwer wird
Gibt es keinen Ausweg mehr, werden sie ehrlich

Was?

Es ist immer das selbe 
Ich seh nur Internethelden
Die Stricher denken echt, dass ihre behindert gestellten Images helfen
Leere Worte, haben kein Gewicht
Doch ohne Maske zeigt ihr nicht euer wahres Gesicht
Und sie kommen nicht klar und kommen grad mit Kommentaren, die offenbaren
Sie sind Schauspieler, die sich in der falschen Rolle sahen
Ich komm' mit Kontra K, du hingegen kommst mit Pommesarmen
Da unter deiner Jacke statt 'ner Waffe Haut und Knochen war
Und in eurer Welt fließt kein Blut, sondern Steuergeld
Ficke die ganzen Rapper, denn sie wollen es selbst
(Dicker Realness)
Und wenn du Hund nicht spurst
Dann fick' ich dich Nuttensohn und deine Kunstfigur
Von echten Gangstern seh' ich nicht mal 'ne Spur
Es wächst euch über den Kopf wie eure Hipsterfrisur
Genau das was ich nicht abkann
Schreib' nicht was du von mir hälst
Ich weiß, was du von mir hältst, Nutte
Nämlich Abstand

Baba Saad,"Nicht zu sterben war der Lebenstraum
Also sind wir aus der Heimat abgehauen, doch im Herzen blieb der Zedernbaum
Jahrelanger Albtraum, ich dachte, dass ich nie aufwach'
Bei dir war's ein Spielcoup, bei mir war es ein Kriegsschauplatz
Gefühlskalt gezwungen, früh reif zu sein
Auch nach der Flucht war es im Asylheim nicht leicht
Unser Hab und Gut abgezockt, lebten in 'nem Rattenloch
Schliefen auf Matratzen, hatten weder Bett noch Lattenrost
Drum macht' ich nächtelang kein Auge zu
Labert mich nicht voll, als hätt' ich mir das selber ausgesucht
Endlich ohne Grenzen, predigten Schablonenmenschen
Scheiß auf diese Fotzen, sie waren nie gepackt von Todesängsten
Und immer mehr formte sich Zorn
Ich brauchte keine Rolle spielen, verdammt, ich wurd' in sie geboren
Aber scheiß drauf, ich hatte nicht mal einen Cent Support
Hab' mich durchgebissen, alles andre als gesetzkonform
Skrupel vor nix, Jugendgericht
Bewährungshelfer, die dir sagen: „Du bist gefickt!“
Sag, wie kann ein kleiner Junge bei dem Leben noch normal bleiben?
Er hat für mich nix getan, nun kann ich auf den Staat scheißen
Ich helf' mir selbst, wenn mir niemand helfen kann
Meinung' gehen auseinander, die Familie hält zusamm'
Und auch wenn ich weiß, dass das nicht jeder versteht
Aus diesem Grund zog mich mein Weg stets ins Bremer Café
Eines Tages lernt' ich JokA kenn', er war schon ein Flowtalent
Alles nur durch ihn, ich bin stolz darauf, ihn Bro zu nenn'
Bis auf Hass und Schmerz hat gar nix existiert
Also habe ich mein Leben auf der Straße reflektiert
Das erste Mal Redestoff gab es dann bei egj
Die asozialen Araber sorgten für ein' Medienschock
Damals war mein Rap Gangster, ja, und immer noch
Fick' ich jeden Krüppelrapper, der mir in die Quere kommt
Denn ich war nie ein Rapper und auch nie ein Privatschüler
Ich hing lieber ab mit den Clanbrüdern
Nie war ich ein Staatsdiener, nie war ich ein Arschkriecher
Nie war ich jemand, der groß redet, nein, ich tat's lieber
Tickte Yayo, ich war nie ein Grasdealer
Apropos: für Fotzen gibt es nie wieder Saad-Feature
Willkomm' in der Vergessenheit
Man spuckt niemals in die Hand, die einem was zu Essen reicht
Viele wollen jetzt den und den mit dem Baba hören
Doch ich chill' mit Amar, ihr mit Amateuren
Hasta la vista, 3 regelt, wenn es sein muss
Nehmt es bitte wörtlich, wenn ich sag': „Ich wünsch' euch Hals- und Beinbruch!“
Hier zählen weder Namen, noch Nationalität
Hansestadt Bremen - so asozial, wie's geht
Im Orient auf Karawanen oder auch auf Marktbasaren
Meinetwegen auch in der Türkei auf den Strandanlagen
Auf kubanischen Hanfplantagen, Landpassagen
Oder auch bei den Jamaikanern mit den Rastahaaren, ah
Ja, und auch bei den Katalanen
Wissen sie bescheid, Junge, Mikrofon-Scharlatan
Auch in Tokio in irgendeinem Mangaladen
Und selbst im Puff, Nutte, kannste deine Mama fragen
Wer ist Deutschlands Gangstaraps-Eins?
Die Antwort ist glasklar: jeder wird dir Baba sagen
Was für Italienisch? Ich bin Libanese
Ich brauch' kein' Anzug, man erkennt mich ganz gut
Ich brauch' kein weißes Hemd, nur ein' Benz und meine Fans
Ich brauch' kein' Siegelring, guck ma', wie real ich bin
Brauche kein gegeltes Haar, es ist meine Lebensart
Ich brauch' kein Machtgehabe, tut nur das, was ich sage
Küsst meine Hand, das sind mehr als nur Straßensongs

Baba Saad,"Mein Leben als G hat 'ne Serie verdient
Aber Baba Saad ist nun mal nicht medienaffin
Ich will nicht mit euren Möchtegern-Star-Reportern reden

Haben Gangstarapper jahrelang am Hungertuch genagt
Ja, sie rappen, dass sie sich in Straßenkämpfen schlagen
Aber blasen Schwänze, solang', bis sie Magenkrämpfe haben
Du bist ein schräger Typ, ich bin ein Schlägertyp
Deine Mutter bläst geübt, du weißt, was ihrem Ehemann blüht

Mann, das ist kein Deutschrap, Dicker, das ist Gossip Girl!
Manche denken ernsthaft, dass sie Straßenrapper sind
Doch sind circa so straße wie 'ne Schlagersängerin
Wenn ich etwas will, dann mach ich's mir nicht umständlich
Aber diese Szene hier ist grundsätzlich unmännlich
Ich zeige nicht vor solchen Schlappschwänzen Furcht
Ach, was sag' ich da? Ihr geht nicht mal als Kampflesben durch!
Deine Butterflys sind out, guck, ich steche mit Policemessern
Und du Piçrapper siehst am Ende aus wie Heath Ledger
Guck, wie ich dein' Arm wie ein Wattestäbchen brech'
Du hast ein Genick, das knackt, wenn es Nackenschläge setzt
Noch 'ne Ohrfeige - zack, sind da Backenzähne weg

Unter deinen Augen Schlafsand unter meinen schwarze Schatten
Kreislauf erschöpft erstmal pushen und Espresso trinken
Auf die Straße einen Weg aus diesem Ghetto finden
Yeah willst du Leben musst du Luft zum atmen lassen
Doch wie soll man ruhen bei all den Drogen und den Straßenschlachten
Hatte kein gemachtes Nest nein ich stand vor Trümmern
In solchen Zeiten hörst du den Teufel ins Ohr flüstern
Andere sagen werde endlich mal erwachsen
Denkst du ich würd dieses Pulver Nächte lang zum Spaß verpacken
Es sind nicht die Nasen von früher die mich wach halten
Adrenalin sagt Ich darf noch nicht abschalten
Der Lila schein sorgte dafür dass ich Paras hatte
Deshalb hab ich Nacht für Nacht in der Stadt gehustlet
Jeder will dir rein reden scheiß auf diese Labertaschen
Wenn das hier ein Traum ist lass mich bitte aus dem Schlaf erwachen

Ich bin wieder mal schlaflos bin ich ehrlich hab ich's gar nicht versucht
Ich bin wieder mal schlaflos keine Sorge alles ist gut
Schlaflos schlaflos
Schlaflos schlaflos

Schlaflosigkeit keine Seltenheit
In meinen Augen Kampfgeist in deinen Augen Selbstmitleid
Kreislauf erschöpft füll den Magen nur mit Dopamin
Hier gibt's nichts geschenkt du musst dir dein Brot verdienen
Achtundvierzig Stunden wach ich kenn den Preis
Versuch mal ruhig zu schlafen wenn du weißt dass das Geld nicht reicht
Die Müdigkeit hat bis heut nicht meinen Willen gebochen
Für Jungs wie uns führt der Weg straight in die Gosse
Stark sein in der Not fällt nicht jedem leicht
Red nicht über mich wenn du nichts von meinem Leben weißt
Man seit ich denken kann bin ich auf Schlafentzug
Und gar nichts wird sich ändern bis zum letzten Atemzug
Glaub mir du würds't niemals gern an meiner Stelle sein
Ob einer von uns dieses Leben will ich kenne kein
Übermüdet aber fokussiert hab ich die Welt bereist

Baba Saad,"Während man mein Einkommen auf ganze Koksplantagen schätzt
Währ' manch Rapper froh wenn er einen Leasingwagen hätt'
Ich wär klein geblieben wenn man an seinen Niederlagen wächst
Will ich Gewinner sehen chill ich in 'nem Spiegelkabinett
Vom totgesagten zum so gefragten, selbst erkämpft
Ich hab mich nie hochgeblasen rede weiter bis du meine Faustknochen spürst
Oder bis dir Fotze mein Erfolg das Maul stopfen wird
Ich hab was zu verlieren aber keine Verlustängste
Weil ich Pläne Umsetze mach ich Umsätze meine Grundsätze
Ich mach was ich will kack auf Nutzrechte
Gegen ein paar Araber hilft dir keine Schutzweste
Warum eine reicht doch du zwei Fäuste kriegst
Ich fühl mich schlecht wenn der Sieg nicht eindeutig ist
Tut mir leid ich kann mich in Rage nicht beherrschen

Doch dein Gewinn ist nicht vorhanden mein Gewinn ist maximal
Schlechter Verlierer kann sein dass es zutrifft

Du suchst bei den Rockerbanden Schutz
Weil du Opfer sonst mit den Cops verhandeln musst
Einzelkämpfe kannst du knicken denn Verstärkung ist hier
Heißt wir können nix außer die Beherrschung verlieren
Ich bin Straße kack im Internet auf deine Hasswelle
Meine Feinde suchen noch vergeblich meine Schwachstelle
Ich geb jedem Spast Schelle bevor ich ihn absteche

The message is unchanging, go ye into all the world
And share the love of Jesus far away or door to door
You see, just like somebody told you that Jesus loves you so
You must tell someone, who will tell someone

Until the whole world knows 
That each one can reach one
As we follow after Christ we all can lead one
We can lead one to the Savior
And together we can tell the world that Jesus is the way

If we each one reach one 
So will you go and labor
Will you hold high your light
One by one and two by two
We can win our world for Jesus Christ 
And each one can reach one
As we follow after Christ we all can lead one
We can lead one to the Savior

Babbie Mason,"There was a holy hush all over 
As I walked into the room
And as I stood to see Him face to face 
I was gloriously made new
There was a great and awesome presence
And a light as bright as any day
And as I bowed to kneel with the angels 
I heard the Spirit say

All rise, All rise
To stand before the throne 
In the presence of the Holy One
All rise, All rise
As we worship the Messiah

Babbie Mason,"Beside my bed there is a lamp
And in that lamp there is a lonely moth
He’s got one night, he’s got one life
And one thing on his mind, and that’s the fire

He doesn’t care from where it comes
He only knows he’s got to run
Toward the brightest promise in his eye
Now he’s circling to the ground
His wings have burned, he’s falling down
I just watch, and wonder how we carry on

It was a world I never made
I just fell into this old parade
They told me it’s my time to shine
And they got ways to light me up at night

They didn’t care from where I came
It seemed they lost their pride and shame
Looking for a fire of their own
One last ember hits the ground
The wood’s all burned, it's ashes now
If you look up to the moon, you’ll help me carry on

Old man in a bar tonight
He sits down on a stool to watch the fight
He says “One last drink to light me up
And then I do believe I’ve had enough”

Chasing dreams that end in pain
I’ve chased the sun, I’ve chased the rain
But nothing ever seemed to fill my cup
I see the angels circling now
I feel the moon behind the clouds
That’s the kind of fire I’d be proud to carry on",Carry On,1997

Though sometimes we don't see

When don't see His plan
When you can't trace His hand

He sees the master plan
And he holds our future in His hand,
So don't live as those who have no hope,
All our hope is found in Him

We see the present clearly
But He sees the first and the last
And like a tapestry He's weaving you and me,
To someday be just like Him

I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'ma sixteen year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you something now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rapping
Money, money, money, money what's happening
I'm coming up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with
You know how we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill

'Cause it takes two to do this dance

Two to really get the feeling of romance

Take a nap or a nip by yourself
You can get into debt on your own

How can I get so far gone
When can I move on
Dreading a world that'll never go on
If I took the time replace
Only mine erased
'Cause I feel as if I'm here but I'm gone

(Mr. Doctor)
I heard a lil' tale about to children sittin on the kitchen floor
They eatin mayonaise out the jar and they moms out smokin dope on the stroll
Man, you believe this
Life is complete for them
And it ain't no emotions, only instinct
And that's how they'll be raised by the streets
A boy and a girl
Just up the boulevard from your world
Oh it ain't all gravy where you at
'Cause that's where he gon' go to jack
Catch his first case at, become a disgrace at
But not in this world up the boulevard
I'ma see to hit that liquor, starts so easily
The difference people in my life are dyin and I see this
My question is, to what lengths do we go so that they live
'Cause I'ma reach this
My locc's mean everythang to me, life is an odysea
But sometimes, you don't step up and take the reigns
Man, the world'll play you cheap, should I ride

I'm picturin kids cryin, a head firin up dope over the stove
Family car gettin repot because they couldn't cover the note
Nobody knows what's to eat because there's no groceries
And the baby suffers from a rash 'cause he hasn't been changed in over a week
The oldest keeps things together, by scramblin up some powdered eggs
She's only 5, so why her mom can't keep them pimps from out her face
How could they rape in that arrestin
The mother won't admit, but she's molested, diseased and infested
With wing worms, both of her legs covered with ring burns
She cleans up, but whoever heard of some clean germs
I seen the, hurt in her mama's eyes, she tramatized
Been beat up, ever since her father died, no harmonize

(Mr. Doctor)
It's hard for me to talk about the good things in my life
With all the things I did for stripes
And the way I made my gramps and my mama cry
This life is real, and I ain't got time to care about you
Just sell smack to you, and sell crack to you, and sell a sack to you
Never give back to you, unless you know me and you owe me
And never worry about your dreams, that's you the bigga the lil' homie
Here to corrupt you for sho', like my pops did and he did it wrong
Now he lost everything he owned and he lost everyone he knows
Here to corrupt you fo' sho'
Like a ??? showin you the ropes
And introduce you to all kinds of good stuff like alcohol and weed smoke
And dice games, take you to places you may die
And the whole time we rollin, I'ma say, man, this the real way to survive
Understand this

Elles s'éprennent de lui
Ça ne le surprend pas
Et elles se levez la nuit
Pour se faire parfumer
Entre leurs jolis doigts

Ah ce qu'il adore se pendre à ses barreaux
Pour faire croire qu'il est vraiment
Le grand roi des pectoraux

Le problème c'est qu'il voudrait qu'on l'aime
Comme s'il était vraiment un homme
A qui on chuchoterais

Elles se foutent de lui
Ca ne le surprend pas
Quand il danse la nuit
Comme s'il jouait sa vie
Entre leurs jolis doigts

Une nuit moi j'ai trop forcé la dose de parfum pour cunnilingus
Qui se prend de plus en plus pour un homme

Il se mit à lécher tout son corps
Pour se laver car vous savez
On est jamais trop coquet

Il se mit à danser
Ça ne nous surprend pas
Comme un grand possédé
Mais hélas ?
Son corps alcoolisé
S'est fracassé contre les barreaux de sa cage

In the southern part of BX, can old school it like a T-Rex
Ya well advanced connect dance with thoughts
Deep like Barry White's throat box
I bet you those cops mix
Double high tower my power grants me the chicks
The blows the cars and enemies that want to spar
You want to see it no matter who you are
Yeah I'm bound to ground you like that
Put they ass on a mound and introduce em' to a baseball
Face tall, brag about it like teenage sex

Sinin' above all who are why'all to boast
Stayed calm and all came to me to host
My vocab grabs many, long to cultivate raps
It's gettin' filled moms jack penny
It used to be unknown around the way
Now my bix became a bouqet
Every nose in it, fillin' up seats like a session in a Senate
Been a minute since ya heard the souls
So the soul gon' cost ya three
All ya people want to front like the soul don't hold control
But it don't mean shit to me
Plain to see that a song like this been what ya all missed
Come on, genuine adrenaline from off the wrists
We run the interference throughout the game clout
Can't be denied the bout for the title
Throw up ya guns and hold the pose like an idol
Bring it back to the draw

Pas de caresse non,
Pas de caresse

Tchador Woman rêve de cohortes
De klaxons d'escadrilles sans escorte
De profanation,
D'accélération

Laissez passer les dames
Laissez passer les dames
Avant qu'ça pête, avant qu'ça crâme
Laissez passer madame

Tchador Woman incante, incante
Les berlines emballées, les étoiles filantes
Pas d'antidote, non
Pas d'antidote

Tchador Woman rêve de carjacking
D'accidents volontaires, de fuite de gazoline
De tonnerres de tonneaux
De boite noire de turbos

Laissez passer les dames
Laissez passer les dames
Avant qu'ça pête, avant qu'ça crâme
Laissez passer madame

Laissez passer les dames
Laissez passer les dames
Laissez passer madame

I give my arms and my legs to the game I'm ahead of the game
I dead any mane if he said anything 
But it's cool, as long as nigga paid when he came

Cut it just a little bit but the drain stay the same yeah
Young Wayne and the pain and the stain still remain
On the chest where the four made a mess yes
I'm still here in the flesh twenty one year old legend 
I'm a live way after my death

[Verse 1: Juvenile]
You ever had corns on your fingers from squeezing the mack to much
Nigga be rhyming the dice game where me and lil wack grew up
Tripping stolen strip cars for a living
Stayed away from home when ever they was bitchin
We used to rush the customers for sales when they pull up in cars
Until undercovers started putting us behind bars
Menace to society is all we watch
In the back seat straped with the throw away glocks
I got some partners in the business never seeing the light
Your people would gota cocking if your cheese be right
You know I've been holding it down playa you a dog
I'm a real nigga I ain't gonna stop accepting your phone call
I'm a blow and toss a hoe for you, like I'm supposed to do
I'm serious and focused to you, know I am over do
The first nigga to park a Rolls Royce in the bricks
While I fly private jet out of town by a bitch

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
Tryin to be here to see my seeds, when they have they seeds
Long as I breathe ain't nothin in this world that they can't be
Yeah I done fucked up, slipped and sniffed that coke
Started tweakin and broke in them people house next do'
Shot a nigga for smokin rocks on my mom back porch
Damn near graduated and got on that dope
My, work is an art, I am better than smart
Homey I hustle with a strategy that's never been taught
I can make the coke flip, I can make a hoe strip, I can spray the whole clip, 
I take nothing from no bitch
I got the money in the case, 45 in the waist
Pitbulls in the yard so stay away from my gate
Could you believe a nigga feelin like he still ain't ate?
Huh, y'all don't understand you shoulda seen my plate
Would love to give you some credit, but even you said it
Be serious about your money and right now I'm tryin to get it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Baby]
I'm on a mission lil' daddy
Put this paint on the caddy
Nigga ridin threw the hood and we blowing on candy
Stay G'd up from my head to my feet
I was raised in the 3rd that's the heart of the streets
Saw death and crime for the first same time
Them rims don't shine just a vision of mine
Put this shit back together cause I stay on the grind
Nigga know I gets me I stunt all the time
For the dead and the gone, the young and the grown
O.G. mother fuckers who be getting it on
Niggaz stunting and they shining bling blingin all the timin
I hold my hood down for the shit that I'm driving
Nigga thug to death, remember the projects
Juve came back now you bitches upset
Nigga know how we getting it cause we getting it on
Keep it coming, keep it getting, bitch my money is long

[Verse 1: Juvenile]
He gotta be in too much 'bout everything that he touch
Out of the roof money get packed up and moved in the truck
Kill me if you feel I ain't worthy
I inherited skills from murky niggaz that's as real as my Saints jersey
I stand here posted in the worst of times
Knowing niggaz after me, gonna rehearse my grind
I'm not a prophet, but I could teach you how to cock it and pop it
And how to put some money in your pocket
You see something you like go 'head and cop it
But watch it, niggaz gone knock it
Trying to get you for your paper when them bitches is jockin'
You might do lil' daddy like that, but this is not him
Don't look for your people to help you, my niggaz done shot them
My people done told me I could roll
I got a reputation for beating niggaz and hoes
Stickin' to the G code, 'tees, 'rees, and 'bows
Pop a Ex, smoke a blunt, if you believe it then Whoa!

Poor niggaz be eating pork, rich niggaz be eating steak
I'ma get me a Porterhouse nigga, you just wait
You couldn't step on my toes if you was standing 6' 8""
It's mister 400 bitches so get that shit straight
You better talk to your hoe 'fore I put dick in her face
Look, I'm wild Magnolia, she better get in her place
I ain't a law abiding citizen, I gets ignorant
I got a trail of niggaz telling cops what I did to them
I ain't lookin for no poppers, ain't looking for no partners
I'm looking for mo' choppers to get rid of mo' problems
All I got is my ball and my words
My momma, my daddy, my chil'ren, my gun, and my herb
Shit, they got a lot of killers I know
But ain't too many gon' make it to see 2004, whoa!
[chorus x2]
[Verse 3]
I tried to play the backround as mcuh as I could
Cause all the big mouth niggaz be gettin knocked in the hood
Remember them lil' niggaz? they done grew up now
So 'ret street and marching turned into a clocked up dump
We scam on shit because we love that sound
We not concerned about waiting unitl the night come 'round
Hey lil' mama I'm a gorilla, let me pipe that down
(puffing sound) yeah, you like that now
I'm a professional, the mountaineer of the streets
I got old timers paying close attention to me
I could get your shit split for the minimum fee (yeah)
Fucking with them niggaz, got a ten for a ki'
Got a few princess cuts on the watch and the piece
I'll put it on your ass for a profit, capiche?

Ain't nobody selling shit nigga
Unless it's for me

You ever had corns on your fingers from squeezing the mack to much
Nigga be rhyming the dice game where me and lil wack grew up
Tripping stolen strip cars for a living
Stayed away from home when ever they was bitchin
We used to rush the customers for sales when they pull up in cars
Until undercovers started putting us behind bars
Menace to society is all we watch
In the back seat straped with the throw away glocks
I got some partners in the business never seeing the light
Your people would gota cocking if your cheese be right
You know I've been holding it down playa you a dog
I'm a real nigga I ain't gonna stop accepting your phone call
I'm a blow and toss a hoe for you, like I'm supposed to do
I'm serious and focused to you, know I am over do
The first nigga to park a Rolls Royce in the bricks
While I fly private jet out of town by a bitch

Long as I breathe ain't nothin in this world that they can't be

Started tweakin and broke in them people house next do'
Shot a nigga for smokin rocks on my mom back porch
Damn near graduated and got on that dope
My, work is an art, I am better than smart
Homey I hustle with a strategy that's never been taught
I can make the coke flip, I can make a hoe strip, I can spray the whole clip, 
I take nothing from no bitch
I got the money in the case, 45 in the waist
Pitbulls in the yard so stay away from my gate
Could you believe a nigga feelin like he still ain't ate?
Huh, y'all don't understand you shoulda seen my plate
Would love to give you some credit, but even you said it
Be serious about your money and right now I'm tryin to get it

Saw death and crime for the first same time
Them rims don't shine just a vision of mine
Put this shit back together cause I stay on the grind

For the dead and the gone, the young and the grown

Crack's in the deal that's twenty mill you thought I have gone mad
Naw I had to gone grab the spida at the red light,
Blue florescent head light, you better get your bread right,

Now I'm in the kitchen with a beacon and a blender, 
Low key in a rental, with them thangs in the fender, 
See I full time grind January to December, 
Put that snow in the summer got it lookin' like the winter,
I'm goin' back to Cali, I gotta get that light green, 
Mexico valley, you know they got them pine trees, 
18 wheeler, now I'm on I-10, on my way to Memphis,

Bitch niggas gon' whine, and hustlas gon' shine, 
Everybody say they trappin' but most of these niggas lyin',

Hop out the passenger side of my back, 
Under my nuts was two ounces of crack, 
But in my palm I had that chromed out mac, 
Shinin' on them bitches cause nigga I'm 'bout that,
Flip a quarter bird to score a whole sack, 
Pull up in the club in a old school 'lac, 
With a bitch ridin' fly so hide you love that, 
It's grind time, nigga been about that, 
We flippin' birds let them hoes go to sacs, 
We livin' large with the garbage bag flats, 
Want the money and the power, real niggas gon' stack, 
And ridin' fly, 25's on the back, 
Plushed out nigga keep a few stacks, 
Out the hood, 'bout money that's that,
If you ever cross the line best believe you gettin' whacked

I'll cook anything from a ki of coke
To a gram of that boyd

Like brand new Hot Boy Reeboks
On my blocks stepping 'em up
With grams and rocks
If anything been scoring from me
It was ten a ki
I let my l'il round hustle
As long as they score for me

Look if I pull up on the block
Knowing the set was mine
No more hand-to-hand contact
I'm known for supplying
Since I opened up this set 'chere
This how it's gon' be
Ain't nobody selling shit nigga
Unless it's for me

[Baby]
All I know is crack slanging and block hanging
On the corner [in] front the store
Doing my thang
These niggas know my game
How I do my thang
Water whip I can't do
But whole thangs I slang

[Lac]
Now I'ma pay all my foot soldiers

[Lac]
If I pull up dressed in all black
With a boot in my mouth
Cause a nigga didn't pay 'Lac

Put something in my street sweeper
And run in his house
Knock a hole up out his pa chest
And a tongue out his ma mouth

Too many disrespected
And lived to sang it

Type of nigga who'll bat a bitch
And then wait on her pa
Type of nigga who'll do a snitch

Still buy up the bulk
Like Rob Deniero, Rob Banks
And bang out with the law

Look here I come from the projects
And the ghetto streets

I'll pull up at Washington [and] Six
In a six
I'll slide out quick

I push a lavender Porsche Carerra
Seat sprayed leather
The top goes off and on
To floss with the rainy weather
The seats they ain't customized
They made by Ricarro
A ruby red CF5
I'll cop by tomorrow

[Baby]
For catching me on the interstate drunk
Running the law
With a bitch in my lap
Tasting my balls
I don't like when they too much
Act like they stuck up
Leave Atrice nut up

You ever had corns on your fingers from squeezing the mack to much
Nigga be rhyming the dice game where me and lil wack grew up
Tripping stolen strip cars for a living
Stayed away from home when ever they was bitchin
We used to rush the customers for sales when they pull up in cars
Until undercovers started putting us behind bars
Menace to society is all we watch
In the back seat straped with the throw away glocks
I got some partners in the business never seeing the light
Your people would gota cocking if your cheese be right
You know I've been holding it down playa you a dog
I'm a real nigga I ain't gonna stop accepting your phone call
I'm a blow and toss a hoe for you, like I'm supposed to do
I'm serious and focused to you, know I am over do
The first nigga to park a Rolls Royce in the bricks
While I fly private jet out of town by a bitch

Long as I breathe ain't nothin in this world that they can't be

Started tweakin and broke in them people house next do'
Shot a nigga for smokin rocks on my mom back porch
Damn near graduated and got on that dope
My, work is an art, I am better than smart
Homey I hustle with a strategy that's never been taught
I can make the coke flip, I can make a hoe strip, I can spray the whole clip, 
I take nothing from no bitch
I got the money in the case, 45 in the waist
Pitbulls in the yard so stay away from my gate
Could you believe a nigga feelin like he still ain't ate?
Huh, y'all don't understand you shoulda seen my plate
Would love to give you some credit, but even you said it
Be serious about your money and right now I'm tryin to get it

Saw death and crime for the first same time
Them rims don't shine just a vision of mine
Put this shit back together cause I stay on the grind

For the dead and the gone, the young and the grown

Crack's in the deal that's twenty mill you thought I have gone mad
Naw I had to gone grab the spida at the red light,
Blue florescent head light, you better get your bread right,

Even when his dog got signed, I had my neck right

Ey ya hold up, pick a restaurant Chows or Chin Chin (5 stars)

All my shit paid for
And why should I rent a house
When I can buy it and write it off?
Make it my Florida home for the summer
'Round winter time just rent it out

I met the Birdman with the Bird layin', 
Got a twenty piece, brought it back to north Memphis charged twenty two a piece, 
Now I'm in the kitchen with a beacon and a blender, 
Low key in a rental, with them thangs in the fender, 
See I full time grind January to December, 
Put that snow in the summer got it lookin' like the winter,
I'm goin' back to Cali, I gotta get that light green, 
Mexico valley, you know they got them pine trees, 
18 wheeler, now I'm on I-10, on my way to Memphis,
I gotta get my hands in, 
I come from the north where gangstas gon' grind, 
Bitch niggas gon' whine, and hustlas gon' shine, 
Everybody say they trappin' but most of these niggas lyin', 
I told slim, told stunna I'm waitin' for my time, 
Either robbin', or poppin', click clack I shot 'em, bullets burryin', brr I got em'

Get what they lookin' fo, keep what they lookin' fo, 
All they gotta do is tell me what they lookin' fo, 
I'm da dopeman, dopeman
I'm da dopeman, dopeman

Back where I started on my set in black, 
Hop out the passenger side of my back, 
Under my nuts was two ounces of crack, 
But in my palm I had that chromed out mac, 
Shinin' on them bitches cause nigga I'm 'bout that,
Flip a quarter bird to score a whole sack, 
Pull up in the club in a old school 'lac, 
With a bitch ridin' fly so hide you love that, 
It's grind time, nigga been about that, 
We flippin' birds let them hoes go to sacs, 
We livin' large with the garbage bag flats, 
Want the money and the power, real niggas gon' stack, 
And ridin' fly, 25's on the back, 
Plushed out nigga keep a few stacks, 
Out the hood, 'bout money that's that,
If you ever cross the line best believe you gettin' whacked

[Chorus]

Get what they lookin' fo, keep what they lookin' fo, 
All they gotta do is tell me what they lookin' fo, 
I'm da dopeman, dopeman
I'm da dopeman, dopeman",I Got Them,2007

He was talking shit we put a clap into that boy

Whoa, yeah, malicious, yeah
I heard they snitchin' on a player man say it ain't so
Even as a young'n they consigned me to blow
Witches claims why I'm worth my weight in gold
While they was taking baby steps from an 8th to an O
Word in the streets that can envy as me
Enough ice on that watch to make a nigga lose sleep
Magnified face help the bitch see clearly
9 on the waist hit the bitch up severely
I'm know for the flip of that coke I ener
I'm heavy in the street like the 7 series Bimma
Man, hit 'em with the Nina man
Or that 4/5th guaranteed to lean ya man (Whoa)
I'm the reason that your block is vacant
Malicious will hit ya just to make a statement

Shit one, Dro one nigga flood the block
If I don't go to jail niggas birds gone flop
Nigga sittin' on the toilet bitch get off the pot
The bird just landed so the hood gon' rot
New whips, big chips the Prada Gucci shit
But mami your fly Benz the wide skinny lips
She takes my flight she holds my weight
While the po-po staked out from state to state
It ain't nothin' to a baller baby
Pay the cars, big money, heavy weight, bird man, hood boss
Baby steppin on my line I'll show a little somethin'
They callin' you don't come out 
Then the black crow will touch ya (touch ya)

Had to make a shirt match my ox blood colored Porsche
The rims match of course
Blood hit his Timbs it reminded me of them
Glistenin' wrist on chiller
Gun in the same palm of gorgeous killer
I put this on my lord my niece was 4 when she felt chinchilla
I past the shore for that shit that made fiends rise from the dead like 
Thriller
Gangster, hustler
At night still found time to kiss my mother
Live like I'm dreamin' kick my feet up
Gun pulled my waist remind me of my demon
So quite ya yappin' fore I get to clappin'

"Baby ""Cash Money""","I see your dirty face, high behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time and you do your crime
Well you made your bed, I'm in mine

[Chorus]
Because when I arrive
I bring the fire, make you come alive
I can take you higher what this is, forgot?
I must now remind you let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world, to the world to the world
And you take your time and you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours, I got mine

And the tops and she gonna rock 'til the camera stop

And Samantha (rock) and Amanda and Tamara

Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can fuck you up, I can fuck you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground, Weezy

Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll fuck ya, period, like the reminder
