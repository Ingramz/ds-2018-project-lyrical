The Shocker,"Nigga, I'm bustin me locs, but I'm hittin em down with jokes
Y'all niggas on the rope, got your ho on da scope
Bitches watching me, jockin me, nigga blockin me, cockin me
Cause I'm the HARDEST motherfucker, out here rockin
I got the game in shades, got the niggas in blades
I got them hoes on a raid, because the nigga gettin paid
I've got, niggas from coast, slangin my dope
Got niggas and G's, and rollin keys keys to record sto's
Get paid wit fatals, niggas harder than Cato
Nigga turnin the tables, but niggas livin like potatoes
Get chopped up in game, niggas runnin my name
Master P up in chain, is he dead he's a man
But I be bustin, hustlin, niggas ain't trustin
I'm a soldier, that's why niggas ain't trustin
No bitch or no nigga, ho or no sucka
Fiend or no clucker, but ready to hustle
With boulders, bigga than yo' shoulders
Runnin from the rollers, gone on that doja
Cause cowards despise, soldiers we ride
Killers with attitudes, but ready to die
Cause chickens get plucked, hoes get fucked
Turkeys get stuck, and niggas get cuffed
Ready for combat, my gat with my hard hat
Strapped with my crew and my niggas and all that
Down for whatever, niggas straight rowdy
Ask any motherfucker in America they'll tell ya, we bout it
Soldiers out there tech, bustin don't think
Lose ya life if you blink
Fuckin with them soldiers on the tank, cause

We No Limit soldiers, I thought I told ya

Let's get ready to rumble, them niggas stumble
Hit em with left blows
Fuck it got death blows
Ready to got to war? Let's go!
We killas and realas, drug dealers and killers, fuck it
No Limit soldiers, close your eyes
Now picture me foldin dollar bills
I stay fuckin Tru, nigga fuck it, nigga do ya
Nigga I come to life and I scare all y'all bustas like Freddy Kruger
Gangstafied nigga, true to the game nigga
Stay fuckin pullin triggas, fuck up all y'all niggas
Cause I'm so fuckin T-R-U, representin I thought you knew
Cause killas killas killas
That's all I be around, nigga fuckin fool
About face, this No Limit soldier
One to the two to the three (hah hah)
Nigga I tried to told ya
Everybody quiet, while I load up this rifle (attention!)
Now all my soldiers start fightin
It's time to go deep cover
Lethal Weapon like Danny Glover, smother like jelly
Really, go deep like Jim Kelly
Fuck it, all y'all bustas open up y'all belly
Think we playin bitch, well we ain't
I heard we had drama motherfucker
Put up the Benz and now we drive the tank
Cause all I want to be was a soldier
All I want to be was a soldier, soldier

We No Limit soldiers, I thought I told ya

I'm a No Limit motherfuckin soldier till I die
We run this place, and I say the same shit, with a gun up in my face
I ain't scared to die, bitch like I said before, ho
3rd Ward, I'm from that motherfuckin Calliope
Projects supported worldwide by drug dealers
Transformin wimpy ass niggas into killers
Taking over, worldwide, doin shows oversea
Bringing bitches to the telly, put them hoes upon they knees
Gangstafied, like my motherfuckin homies Kane and Abel
No Limit, the world's number one fuckin rap label (worldwide)
Competition get smoked like we smokin blunts
I take a playa hata and knock out his fuckin fronts
Dope slanga, now I'm slangin CD's
A million records (platinum), it used to be some quarter keys
TRU tattooed on my back bitch thats my click
Ready to hop into some motherfuckin gangsta shit
I say No Limit loud, cause we ain't scared of nobody
Organized by P or should I say, John Gotti
Real niggas, put ya guns up if ya feel me
But if ya talk shit, bitch ya betta kill me
Like Skull I'm a hoodlum 4 life, I told ya
We be some motherfuckin No Limit TRU soldiers

We No Limit soldiers, I thought I told ya

Hard times got my mind on cock, and massive thoughts be the plot
Top priorities the family dope and royalty
My loyalty, fiends with a gang of true niggas
No colors, just a bunch of ignorant motherfuckers
Trust my pen is an infa-red
Hollow-tips be my lyrics dipped in venom when I send em
They split ya head (pssssh) wide open
My rhymes on fire blood, but you can't smoke ne'er a one
Don't try to come, don't even touch the mic
My shit so tight, it's more correct than right, when I recite
Absolutely, you booty-ass hoes and niggas
Perpetratin behind water gun triggers
Hurry up and figure out that studio Gotti's catch hotties to the mouth
Who got that clout, don't act surprised cause it's that bitch from the South
Mia X hoes, you don't want no problems
Get so much respect, even yo' niggas call me momma, the biggest one
To come stompin out the N.O., the crescent
Testin, chin-checkin, wreckin when I'm flexin on your WHOLE crew
Who wants to go to war with this lyrical arsenist
Ya talkin shit, I'll having ya runnin for the thesaurus, cause I'm walkin wit
The big dogs without hesitation, Unlady Like as ever
Full of, verbal annhilation
Escaping, po-po's chasin, want ta catch me but they cain't
I made em think, and now they too scared to run up on the tank
No Limit, you can start it, but we niggas is the hardest
To deal wit, keeps the steel, and the plastics to peel wit
In reach, so we can touch yo' ass
And leave a bout it scarf on ya face, we soldiers

What's up niggas?

Fell this nigga
It's real (explosion)


[verse one]

Flippin' the the game
Niggas that got that 'cane
Murder mr. dopeman still in this rap game
It's 1997, my niggas gone to heaven
Rest in peace 2pac from master p, doin' 2-11s
187 khadafi, murder
Puttin' niggas in six foot motherfuckin' gurters
If you fuck with this tru clique
Nigga you gettin' your wig spilt
Who run this gangster rap?
(no limit runnin' this!)it's 'bout to be it
187 khadafi
Jumpin' on ghetto dope with these gangster topics
Still makin scrilla
Your neighborhood drug dealer
Ice cream slaingin'
Tattooed up real nigga
In the rap game pushin' quarters
Flippin' the water, from texas to florida
Choppin' game to the knuckleheads
And spittin voodoo on the motherfuckin' chichenheads
Down south hustlin', to the west coast
Got nigga choppin' game, I mean this rap shit in to dope
Puttin' them in packages, independent spittin' shit
Standing on stages with bullet-proof vestes, lookin' for other cliques
But who gon' be the next nigga to die in this rap game
Or drop a hit on the wrong man?
'cause they talkin' shit about other niggas
Now it's a war zone, in this rap game

(chorus)
But they can't stop us tru niggas
They can't stop us tru niggas
They can't stop us tru niggas
They can't stop us tru niggas

[verse 2]
'cause if y'all kill one, they'll be a million other niggas in line
With ghetto dope, bustin' ghetto rhymes y'all
Running from the one time not mines
Posted up, hostin' up like soldiers!
Down south huster, throwin' bolders
Ready to block like a football player
Got these 17 rounds for y'all haters
So jump on this ghetto shit and come get this wicked shit
And jump up on this rap game and watch a nigga spit
Killer, murder topics
Put my goals if y'all think y'all can stop it
Hardcore bangin', hangin' slaingin'
Nigga down for whatever that's why we bangin' on wax
Into traps
Got beats by the pound like niggas slaingin' sacks
In the 'hood, up to no good
Got niggas bout it, from baton rouge to st. louis
To cincinnati
Got niggas lined up in atlanta like addicts
Gotta have this gangster shit
This real shit
>from this motherfuckin' tru clique
Ain't givin' up, living raw
And if we die, fuck it, sell my 'dro
To the next gangster nigga
Rest in peace easy-e., but I'm out here makin' scrilla!
So fuck y'all white laws
And y'all motherfuckin'.....police cars!!
Comin' through with gangsters and killers
Long like the motherfuckin' drug dealer
'97 to 2000 a.d. little kids wanna be me
'cause I'm bout it, I'm rowdy
The government and the press, them motherfuckers want me outtie
For runnin' my own shit
Niggas sellin' their company like the slaves sold their souls to 30 cents
Break bread
Don't you know 15 percent of what you made?
You a sucker, a clucker
So stop rappin hardcore, you hip-hop motherfuckers
And stay true to the gizzame
Be about your paper, nigga fuck the fizzame
Third ward nigga, runnin' the hill
It ain't no limit to this gangster shit, blunt smokes and keepin' it real

Y'all can't stop us tru niggas
Y'all can't stop us tru niggas
'cause if y'all kill one, they'll be a millon more tru niggas

[slikk the shocker]

Look into their face, niggas afraid of me
Look deeper into their eyes, they scared, yeah y'all busters scared of me

Run shit like ki-jana carter
Tell 'em, I'mma be there watch (? ? ? ) like the french quarter
Down for whatever
Bow down nigga never
Buck like a beretta
Wet you up like bad weather
Got fangs like a cobra
Now I got range like a rover
You don't fuck with us whether you fucked up like a hangover
From the city where busters lie
From the city where suckers die
Make way for p and silkk, two of the baddest motherfuckers alive
Bitch it's your time
Bitch I want the whole nine
Bust one line, and make niggas change their whole rhyme
I'm the shocker
Yeah, I got them

And it's on

Looked out the window 

it must be the giggidy first of the month 

cause everybody in the ghetto is smilin' and dressed up 

Little kids havin' fun in my neighborhood 

And fiends walkin' up, talkin' bout its all good 

See I'm a G, ????? I got that 2 for 3 

And y'all a know that I slang, that I-see-E 

And everybody in the ghetto use nicknames 

Like V-90, Master P, Boz, and Big Man 

My little homies posted up 

some hang, hang, and some slangin' 

Others gang bangin' 

I'm tryin' to make it out the hood with this gangsta rap 

And stay TRU to the game, and put the town on the map 

But haters hate me and niggas try to talk shit 

Cause I done made, a dollar out of 15 cents 

On the curb, posted up with them bouldas 

And servin' fiends, A-1 yola 

And still tryin' stay true with my frist meal 

Cause in the ghetto, you got money, you might get killed 

And stayin' TRU to the game, is a part of life 

And if you don't player, you might lose your life

Askin' me why I be hustlin'

Ball till I have it all, I want the whole while

Why I hang with the same ol' niggas 

That's what they ask me 

I be like, I'm the same ol' nigga 

But 'stead, right now, I gets my sacks free 

I gots to stay TRU fool, about my motherfuckin' mail 

I'll be a rich ass nigga, y'all gonna be visitin' me in the jail

Man I'm layin' low like the eyes of a danked out china man 

Stayin' gangstafied 

While I'm tryin' to make a million 

But politicians run for office 

They rather me bust a cap in a rat, cause they both gonna try and stop 

this 

Gangsta rap is what they call it 

But I gots to come with the realness 

So all my folks can feel this

[Mr. Serv-On] 

Now I lay me down to sleep 

I pray the Lord that my momma will never weep 

and let her live in peace and stop spendin' a hundred G's up in her sleep 

When will it stop 

I guess when they leave me lyin' on the block 

With tears on my glock 

A pocket full of lemon drops, laughin' at crooked cops 

I guess I'm doin' what I gotta do 

As long as I stay TRU, until they put me through 

I know its a shame, things'll never change 

I hope I live long enough to see my daughter spell my name 

I'm TRU 2 Da Game

[Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick] 

How do I say goodbye to what we had 

The good times that made us laugh outweighted the bad 

I thought we'd get to see forever 

But forever's gone away 

It's so hard to say goodbye to my homies 

[Master P] 

y'all niggas smile for my ghetto heroes 

So many homies gone  trying to ball till they fall 

Now I'm left with nothing but old cards 

and a bunch of pictures on the wall 

RIP tatoos nigga, just to show you that we real 

But I still can't believe that your dead fool, and how you got killed 

And on your birthday me and my boys visit your grave 

And I remember when you first got high 

and the first time you got laid 

And I'm going through a thing, Kevin nigga, what should I do 

I never imagined living life without a nigga like you

We shed so many ghetto tears, see time is crazy 

And every sunday grandma go to church 

she said she gotta pray for her baby 

And ah, your little son, he look just like you 

And momma going through a thang, but she gonna pull it through 

And ah me, see and Silk we got a little money but that don't mean shit 

Cause I burn all that shit up nigga, just to have you again 

And it's real out here, all you niggas that's goin through some pain

Now look, I couldn't imagine life without you 

I just sit here wonderin why 

But the law of life, and god placed us here 

and said everybody must die 

Ended hard trying to move on but still I try 

Even though we got money, judgement day 

just some things we can't buy 

Even though you gone, I never let you move on 

Cause every time i think about you 

I sit back and write your name in a song 

Now ashes to ashes, and dust to dirt 

It's kinda spooky when one day I see your face on a t-shirt 

I just pray to god it's hard wishing it would get better 

And why it take a death or a funeral to bring our family together 

Now look, we done lost a brother, your son done lost a father 

Life ain't promised us so tell somebody you love them 

You'll never know whether they'll be here tomorrow

Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Hit the spot with the most hoes at the sideshow, abouts to plot
Spin donuts, you know I'm macking, a straight up nigga
Catch me spinnin', you can tell I was there cause I clocked smoke when I was finished
I seen five-O, and man he tried to sweat me
Thinkin' he'd be nice and all cause I gotta 185 in the hood

Master P: 

Somebody musta' told these hoes I was a muthafuckin' rapper, 

but will they jus' tell them hoes that I was a muthafuckin' 

captain? 

All the bitches I done broke fo' they bank, 

I got so many cocktales I need a muthafuckin' fish tank. 

I got hoes like acorns fallin' outta trees, 

No Limit niggas don't say hoes, 

ain't no caps that be floatin' in the breeze... 

Fiend: 

Now, Now, Now P, all the time, I done put in work 

I ain't know, I was livin' next door to Captain Kirk. 

kepta smirk on his face, lookin' like drug swappin', 

come to find out, some bitch holdin' his money down hostage. 

Got keys to his cottage, done changed the law and the act, 

and all he get to do, is eat that funky hoe from the back. 

On top of that, 

the bitch fat!!! 

Makin' a career off this nigga, 

and all his homies gone, because they can't get it clear to this 

nigga, 

go figga, 

all she wanted was that man to change, 

but if it was me, I done been done slapped that bitch in the brains. 

Chorus:

Captain Kirk, I want to have yo' baby.

Verse Two: [Silkk The Shocker] 

See I met this bad ass trick, 

I mean this bad ass bitch. 

Tellin' her friends about month go by see I'ma be like buying her 

shit. 

I bought her lunch the first time, 

but see there trick that's nuthin' but game, 

I hit it one time and they be callin' back, 

talkin' bout' ""Silkk, why you do all that playin'?"". 

And she had the nerve to tell me, 

if I ain't a fuckin' trick I'm worthless, 

I told her Bitch if you ain't suckin' dick, 

then none of yo' clit defeats the purpose. 

Figured she had game, tryin' to fuck a young balla nigga like my mind, 

I figured lookin' at me she see nothin' but dollar signs. 

Simply, a bitch might give you some weed, 

a bitch might give you a buck, 

man, but since you my boy you 

better use a condom, before you try to fuck. 

Take the game from this show bug, 

'cause Silkk ain't no love. 

I give'em a little somethin', but at the end I 

take'em back and get the most love. 

And ain't no beam'em up Scotty, 

ain't no savin' hoes that ain't puttin' in no work. 

It all depends on TRU niggas like us, no Captain Kirk (Bitch freeze), 

all you ghetto hoes get yo' Lee Press-On Nails, fix yo' wig, 

bring yo' Bebe kids 'cause the Ghetto Enterprise is leavin' in

Her children the cities fell
Battlin' golden' platinum 
Friends of terror and endless bloodshed 
Pity was not spared for no man  woman  child or rapper 
And believe 
For his rap was felt by everyone 
And this time when trust had no meaning 
Family and friends who survived destroyed one another
Decide to the world 
Love, peace, and brotherhood
Soldiers, high ashes to survival 
To open up a path to reality 
For some, judgement 

[Verse] 
The devil took the straps off my nigga legs 
The Virgin Mary came when my homie bleed 
Too many fuckin' thieves and enemies 
The vultures pecked the mouths for the green cheese 
I watched his soul leave his clothes left him cold 
On these streets, anything goes 
He was on the road 
It took 'em ten to do him in 
The killas fled, damn, but they'll be back again 
He was Polo'd down with the matchin' socks 
I mean stuffed like a turkey with a half a key of cooked rocks 
The reaper came and took him 
I saw the tears from my baby mama's eyes over look him 
As I walk through the shadows of death 
Where no rapper or no man can spare no breath 
The kingdom of freedom is all they said 
Why the shackle and chain? 
My homie's life slaid
From the cradle to the grave every soldier shall ride 
Bite the apple of eternity(uggggHH)

Now who's to say if it's the beginning or ending 
Start to finish 
Losin' or winnin' 
I'm trapped in a whole world of sin 
Who's to say your life is worth more than mine 
Should I give my heart to the President so he can live and I can die? 
Now my whole life I was scared 
The only judge is god 
But why do I (we) live by these man made laws 
Ten commandments they say do not steal or kill 
But I lost too many niggas and some say they split my wig for meal 
Heaven, leadin' up to the steps 
Everything I do wrong in my days is leading to my death 
And even though I never see 
I believe there's a god 
But I hate when your best friend turn to your enemy 
When times is hard 

[Chorus x2] 

[Verse] 
As the sand slowly poured 
I see flashes of life 
Time started ticking it's the end of my life 
Blind fo' his eyes when he look at god 
Behold no man or your life destroyed 
He took many prophets and poured to the kingdom 
Big ones and small ones 
Good ones and mean ones 
As the angel came the ghetto from hell 
Some words of the piece cause they didn't know no better 
So they sold to the pitch-forks of the fire 
Do g's go to heaven or just young niggas retire 
Crosses burned cause they souls was scarred 
Hoping for a second chance but ain't none 
Cause it's your final call

You was a high school queen 

Met me sellin' ice cream on the corner went double-up servin' Fiend 

Even though I'm a thug, ya love me 

If sex was a game, we'd a play rugby 

I got you flyin' first classes on planes 

Jumpin' offa' trains 

Takin' cruises on boats, sippin' champagne 

Rollin' out the red carpet when they see ya $10,000 mink coat 

That's why them hoes want to be ya, but they can't 

Taking trips in Land Cruisers 

Droppin' off cash to the bank 

But they don't know what you just seen 

The shit i done put you through 

The penitentiary tension you done take for ya' boo 

The FED's harass you 

The lies you don't told for me 

And when i went to jail you found a way to visit me 

Runnin' up ya phone bill 

Sometimes the kids didn't even have a decent meal 

It ain't no limit to this ghetto love 

Even though i mighta' slangin' drugs 

You still showed me love 

That's why I'm here for ya', Boo 

But just remember (uuuhh) that gangstas need love too

And man I can't lie 

'cause i'll be hustlin' , hangin' wit my homies all night ch'all 

I'll be hustlin' from the morning to the night fall, aight ch'all? 

It's kinda hard tryin' to stay clean 

Tyrin' to chase dreams 

Tryin' to make it happen 

But this rappin' ain't what it seems 

Know what i mean? 

Now through thick things ya' stood beside me 

When I was on the run, you hide me on the real 

Tryin' to make a mil but on the real 

That's the type of love money can't buy 

I need someone who could be trusted 

Take this hundred g's in case a nigga like me get busted 

Ya' blame it on my mob lifestyle 

My thuggish-ruggish friends 

Ya' keep tellin' me 

My foul lifestyle gonna have to come to an end 

Ya' gotta' realize I ain't tryin' to be no broke fart 

I'm takin' the chances now 

'cause it's gonna be hard for our future sons and daughters 

I'm tryin' to take trips to Reno 

Cash chips like casinos 

Live life as a high roller 

Silkk the Shocker make moves like Valentino 

I only got one chance, so I got to take it 

If you could just be patient 

Diamonds inside a 20 just for waitin' 

Yo' mom think I'ma thug she don't like it 

But you still sneak out and see me 

Ya' friends think I'm a ghetto thug 

But this is ghetto love that they can't see, G 

I know when it rains it pours and one day it gotta stop 

and when it do I'ma be sittin' on top

Fade Out.",Ghetto D,1997
The Shocker,"I want ya'll to play this at funerals in the hood
'Til all this black on black crime stop
Some say the blind lead the blind
But in the ghetto you never know
When it's gon be yo time

Sitting in the ghetto thinkin' 'bout
All my homies passed away (uuunnnggghhh!)
Candy painted Cadillacs and triple gold
That's how me and my boys rolled
How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me
My best friend's gone
And I'm so all alone
And I really miss my homies
Even though you're gone away
I know you're in a better place
And I hope to see you soon someday

I used to hang with my boy, even slang with my boy
I used to bang with my boy, goddamn I miss my boy
We started out youngstas in the park throwin' birds
In your hearse, damn it's sad to see my nigga in the dirt
The game got me workin', got me perkin', never jerkin'
Still blowin' dolja fo' ya 'cause I know you're up there workin'
Your little baby's cool and ya baby's mama straight
But today's a sad day to see your t-shirts with your face
From the cradle to the grave, from the streets we used to fall
In the park you liked to ball, put yo name upon the wall
In the projects you's a legend, on the street you was a star
But it's sad to see my homeboy ridin' in that black car
A lotta soldiers done died, a lotta mothers done cried
You done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire
Why soldiers ride for yo name, leave it vain
Some Gs never change, damn they killed you for some change
Smile for my homie Kevin Miller my boy Randall
The ghetto persons that lost their loved ones to these ghetto scandals

Take a minute to smile for the dead (uuunnnggghhh!)
Smile for the dead (RIP 2Pac, Makaveli)
All my homies who done made it to the crossroads
(Biggie Smalls)

How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me
(It's like I can't believe you gone)
My best friend's gone
(Sometimes I feel like I can't go on)
And I'm so all alone
(Everytime I see something you done left
I really miss my homies
(It just remind me, more and more of you, dawg)
Even though they gone away
(I just keep reminiscin)
I know you in a better place
('Cause I know you alright)
And I hope to see ya soon someday
(And I keep smilin, knowin I'm a see you in the crossroads]

We used to grip on the grain and flip them candy toys
But I'd give up all that bullshit if I could get back my boy
Off in the club smokin' weed 'til 3, hollerin' at the hoes
Spendin' $4000 on me on gators and clothes
When I turned to rap, he had to chase the game
Nigga told me, ""C, leave that dope, 'cause rappin' is yo thang""
I ain't gon' even lie, some nights I ride and cry
Wonderin' why the real niggas always the ones to die
So I just smoke my weed and try to clear my mind
I wish that I had the power to turn back the hands of time
I wonder if there's a heaven up there for real Gs
For all the niggas in the game that be sellin' ki's
I keep my memories, try to keep my head strong
But baby it's hard to be strong, when yo main homie gone

Even though you gone away
(Even though you gone, you ain't never gon' be forgotten)
I know you in a better place
('Cause as long as I'm here
You gon' live through me and other TRU playas)
I really miss my homies
Even though their gone away
I know you in a better place
And I hope to see ya soon someday

I'm just sittin' here dazed thinkin' about all the times we had
Thinkin' about the past, some was good and some was bad
Remember Dante? It was a group of us, just a group of five
Now three dead, one in jail, it seem right now I'm the only one alive
To all my soldiers before me, may y'all rest in peace
When He took three, took my soul, just the bodies
He at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me
Wishin' I could rewind time like demos
Me and you gettin' girls, writin' down numbers like memos
Makin' million dollar bets, makin' all our money stretch like limos
Even though I smile, it's sad, but they say gangstas can't cry
But if I close my eyes and visualize me together then I suddenly wanna smile
See you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up
You never seen your child, but he's here to remind us
Even though you was wrong, I never could believe that that was true
You was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos
See me and P and C forever gon be ridin' and thuggin'
Rest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it
And rest in peace to my brother
We gon' miss you

I know you in a better place
(Every time I get on my knees)
And I hope to see ya soon someday
(I pray for you, I'm glad you in a better place
I hope I see ya soon, ain't no more killin'
Ain't no more fights, and ain't no more tears)",I Miss My Homies,1997

Look at all these haters surrounding me every day
hatin on a baller but they can't stop my pay
stop all the hatin I can't take it no more
I'm just tryin to get mine you best get yours so what you hatin for

Verse 1: Master P

Pop the lock on the benz with the keys 
To high to see his own enemies
his baby mama with him in a short skirt 
his last ride was in a car, i mean a black hearse
his friend took his life for the mighty dollar 
then ran through the alley must have been a coward
No more hit 'em up like in the old days
homies scrab with Mack 10s and AKs
that's why I roll by myself I mean I'm a loner
cause haters be all up on me
tryin to sniff you out for your cheddar and your cheese
and the same niggas want to blow on your weed
set you up for a caper 
don't want to see you make no money then take ya
gotta figure out how to get what you got 
cause haters be the same niggas on the spot

Chorus 

Verse 2: Master P 

How do hatin get started?
It started by the jealous people 
and they get mad over the things you have 
and the things they'll never have
Tell me if you hustle it really ain't hard to get 
You can get yours I got mine so stay out my mix
I heard you spreading rumors 
I'm really not impressed
I tell you only one time 
with my scrilla fool don't mess

Verse 3: Fiend

I only get with a few cause these bitch made niggas is actors

non-packers
I'm strapped like P
or see
they ask for me 
capture me 
but I'm going out with a blast
I put that on some cash 
I'm standing last 
for some ass
y'all young crazed punks are trippin 
don't hate me nigga just go ahead and credit my ??
I'm admitting 
that I'm not only on the thwat
but I know i got stopped 
on tha ??
and its understood that I'm not 
one of the best niggas that ever lived
but I got some advice to give 
and that is

Chorus 

Verse 4: Silkk

I wonder why they hatin for?  Probably cause we got G's,
mad cause we makin moves, cause we got keys
But really I can't fade them
Cause truly you need haters up on you to know you'se a motherfuckin playa
I know y'all gonna kill me in a matter of lies 
I got friend that will turn to enemies in a matter of time
I know most of my niggas can feel me 
when I say TRU niggas will never try to kill me
But keep my eyes up on  my enemies  I gotta watch my friends
like when I'm sittin on top or ridin in a benz
Why don't y'all go out y'all's ass up and get something 
don't worry about how i got mines
always tryin to point a finger and say that's not mine.
and kill me 
it kills me 
its digusting cause I got a few G's
they try to rob me
but they know they won't touch me
smile in your face and talk shit behind your back
but I just can't call it or catch

Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
We live for weed and money

(repeat 8x)

(Master P verse 1)
I stack greens like cheese
Smoke weed with g's
Sell cream to fiends
And roll with beams
Playa haters can't take me, hungry bitches can't break me
God you made me, but ain't no man gone fade me
Got me deep in this game, some niggaz don't change
Have mercy on P, just tryin' to have change
In my pockets I'm knockin', the feds can't stop me
Most hoes they jock me, I got knots in my pockets
Caviar and bitches, 6-4 and switches
Champagne and riches, but cooking keys in kitchens
Mansions with marble floors, knocking off chocolate hoes
Boots with ignition, Ferraris and drop rolls
I live with killers, dealers and TRU niggaz
No Limit guerrillas, mercenary killers
Beat's by the Pound, haters get clowned
Gone worldwide, but true to the underground

(P and Silkk)
Blow coheva blunts, keep e'm rollin' up
Got your bitch fiening bro, P meaning what

(chorus 8x)

(Master P verse 2)
I scream with riches, tag teaming with bitches
96 we went gold, haters thought we was finished
97 went platinum, now they screaming NO LIMIT
TRU niggaz don't fall off this only the beginning

(P and Silkk)
Coming up for what, making hella bucks
Niggaz getting bumped or what, counting cash up
Got this game sewed up, niggaz straight up no cut
But ya'll couldn't fuck with us, ya'll couldn't fuck with us

(Master P)
Swingin' like Titanic, niggaz see us and panic
After big bucks no whami, on our way to the grammy
Ya'll couldn't fuck with killers, they call us dealers
Niggaz livin' for scrilla, banking with peelas

(P and Silkk)
Army fatigues, niggaz straight like g's
Livin' like soldiers with g's, soldiers at ease
Slangin' fuckin' tapes like keys, swang 'em just like keys
From Richmond to New Orleans, we be ballin'
Keep them bitches down on they knees, keep 'em on they knees
Got them smokin' on our weed, but not for free

(chorus 8x)

(Silkk)
Ya'll live for bitches and blunts
I live for weed to make money
Man I want so much cash when I wake up in the mornin'
I can't even much count it
Silkk the Shocker, or should I say
The black Frank Nitty see,
Oz's to make g's
The mayor gave me and P keys to the city
Livin' an American dream
5 karats on my pinky ring
Ladies wanna make love to me
Niggaz wanna look at me all mean
But it's aaight cause you still wonder
I don't want your old lady
But she still flip me the number, I wish she'd flip me some money
See um, it's aight to have cash and thangs
Ghetto millionares to live fashion man
600 we gonna be smashin' man
But since I can't spend no bitches
So I need some cash and thangs

From A place where dark days are common
Wild brutes
These dog days are coming
To a few this may be uncommon
Daily politics but ain’t no house of commons (Nah)
Born leaders 
Sworn survivors 
From the gutter 
In the grit is where you’ll find us
Separate the weak from the fighters
Presented as the minority with mass destruction behind us
No rest for the wicked round ere
Souls lost like the wicker man’s here
And I swear they got wicked man ear
Dem A gwarn wicked like they nah care (uh)
I can’t blame them
Looks like hope has forsaken brave men
Look to the skies and pray, Amen
But no rest for the wicked no days end

No rest for the wicked round here

No rest for the wicked round here

Verse 2:
This coming from a place where dark days are common
I walk through the grounds of sodom 
They say reap we saw the fruits of your labour
But it’s like these laboured fruits are rotten
Death on the path
Till death do us part
Death of the heart
(Callousness) 
Baring the scares of the pain of my past
through the apathy translate in these bars
Locked in a cage fight
Face to face with my consequences 
From decisions that I made 
I
Felt like I would fall by the wayside 
And not make it through the raging fire
It’s thin line between love and hate
Fear and Faith 
I situate in a lukewarm state
(Lord help me)
No rest for the wicked till we feel death embrace

Chorus : 
No rest for the wicked round here
No rest for the wicked round here
And I still Feed the Ghost.
No rest for the wicked round here

Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead

Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

The feeling right, the Paris night
Did it's best to please us
And strolling down the Elysee
We had a drink in each cafe
And you
You talked of politics, philosophy and I
Smiled like Mona Lisa
We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
Our last summer
Memories that remain

We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass
By the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret
Oh yes
Those crazy years, that was the time
Of the flower-power
But underneath we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance
Like we were dancing our last dance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame
Our last summer
Walking hand in hand

Paris restaurants
Our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day, worries far away
Our last summer
We could laugh and play

The family man, the football fan
And your name is Harry

I'm gonna humor you 
With the act of conversation.

From the sleep deprivation.

Or are you waiting for the last dance?

You're pocking your skin you're trying to get me in 
You?ll shoot me through your eyelids just to get me to your brain 
The faster I can go there and ease your pain In your vein 
I just slither like a venoms snake and it's great 
I can't wait to end your heartache 
I slowly cross the blood brain barrier 
Give birth to morpheme finds to open your receptors 
You have a sensation; you're calling it a rush 
The intensity because you had all my drug 
And the faster that I find to open your receptors 
The more intense the rush is, it feels even better 
You might have a warm blushing in your skin 
Have a dry mouth or happiness in your limbs 
You might be nauseous, vomit, have severe itching 
But it's worth it nothing beats this here feeling [Chorus x3] 
You got problems in your life 
I can help you through it you tried to dump me once before but you couldn't do it 
You had insomnia, muscle and bone pain 
Worse than when you tried to leave my cousin named Cocaine 
You were vomiting, restless, had cold flashes 
It's just you and me no one knows you're an addict 
You're psychically dependent on me now. 
Don't you see that? 
You would die without me in your life, believe that I've infected your heart and collapsed you veins 
I?ve done sever damage to your brain 
Because of me you?ve had bacterial infections 
A small price to pay that's the cost of my affection 
The high is wearing of you're drowsy for a couple of hours 
My affects have got your mental function all clouded 
You heart rate drops you respiratory system slows 
You're slowly fading as a victim of my overdose 
You needed me but don't you see I don't need you 
There's a lot of people in this world that need me too

I left you dead in your own vomit on the kitchen floor 
I didn't care about you; you're just a bitch to me 
I know you cheated on me with my brother

There ain't nothing in this world gonna slow me down

Yeah that's right
You can't stop me 
I'm just gonna keep going 
I'ma keep ending more lives, infecting more people 
This ain't never gonna stop

And I have lived alone
I live on an island 
And I waken to the dawn
A long time ago
I watched him struggle with the sea
I knew that he was drowning
And I brought him into me
Now today
Come morning light
He sails away
After one last night
I let him go.

My name is Calypso
My garden overflows
Thick and wild and hidden
Is the sweetness there that grows
My hair it blows long
As I sing into the wind
My name is Calypso
And I have lived alone
I live on an island
I tell of nights
Where I could taste the salt on his skin

Salt of the waves
And of tears
And though he,pulled away
I kept him here for years
I let him go

My name is Calypso
I have let him go
In the dawn he sails away
To be gone forever more
And the waves will take him in again
But he'll know their ways now
I will stand upon the shore
With a clean heart

And my song in the wind
The sand will sting my feet
And the sky will burn
It's a lonely time ahead
I do not ask him to return
I let him go

When I close my eyes,

When the last man dies for just words that he said,
When there's shelter over the poorest head,
We shall be free.
When the last thing we notice is the color of the skin,
And the first thing we look for is the beauty within;
When the skies and the oceans are clean again,
Then we shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free.

When we're free to love anyone we choose,
When this world's big enough for all different views,
When we all can worship from our own kind of pew,
Then we shall be free.

And nobody walks a step behind;

The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of peace on earth

And in despair I bowed my head
""There is no peace on earth,"" I said
""For hate is strong and mocks the song

Outside the cabin door

Sailed off on a wooden shoe
Sailed down a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew

Now where are you going and what do you wish?
The old moon asked the three
Well, we're going out fishing for herring fish
That live in the beautiful sea

And some silver and gold have we
Said, Wynken and Blynken and Nod

The old moon laughed and sang a song
As they rocked in their wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew

While the little stars were the herring fish
That lived in the beautiful sea
Now cast your nets wherever you wish
Never a feared are we

So sang the stars to the fishermen three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fishermen home

T'was all so pretty a sight it seemed
As if it could not be
And some folks thought t'was a dream
They dreamed of sailing the beautiful sea

But I shall name you the fishermen three
Wynken and Blynken and Nod

Now Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes
And Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee one's trundle bed

So close your eyes while mother sings
Of the beautiful sights that be
And you will see the wonderful things
As you rock in your misty sea

Introductions aside, let's move right along,
You can all sing along at the sound of the gong.
(Sound of the gong)
Once upon a time, about a week ago,
All of a sudden, trouble started to grow.
Alarm was buzzin', I was snoozin',
S'posed to get up now, but I was refusin'
To let reality become an intrusion,
'Cause in dreamy-dream land, I was cruisin'.
But the buzz kept buzzin', my head kept buzzin'.
Gave the radio a throw, and heard an explosion.
(Homer: D'oh!)
Opened up my eyes, and to my surprise,
There stood Homer, and his temperature risin'.
I was chillin', he was yellin',
Face all distorted, 'cause he was propellin'.
It wasn't what he said, but more of his tone,
The usual jive, put your nose to the grindstone.
I said ""I'm real sorry"" but that didn't cut it,
I started to protest, but Dad said
Homer: Shut it.
Get up. Mow the lawn. Move it. On the double.
'Cause if you don't, you're in deep, deep trouble.

Back: Trouble.
Deep, deep trouble.
Run into trouble.
Bart: Where's your sense of humour, man?
Back: Deep, deep trouble.
And they go a little something like this.

Bart: So I'm in the front yard, mowin' like crazy,
Sweatin' like a pig and the sun is blazing.
Homer's in the driveway, getting in the car,
With Mom and Lisa, hope they're going real far.
The dad yells
Homer: Bart
Bart: and I go Yo
He goes
Homer: You done yet?
Bart: and I go No.
So he goes
Homer: Oh! You're too slow.
Bart: So I step on the gas, to speed up the mow.
Didn't see that sprinkler underneath that tree,
Wham! Ccchhh! Pssshh! Raining on me!
I go Whoa, Homer goes
Homer: D'oh!
Now you can't go to the boatshow.

Bart: This is my thanks after working my butt off?
Homer revs the motor and they all start to putt off.
Soaked to the bone, standing in a puddle,
No-one needs to tell me I'm in deep, deep trouble.

Lookin' at the sky with my sunshades on.
Now I've never ever claimed that I was a smarty,
But inspiration hits me, lets have a party.

Called up my posse, they were here in a flash,
They brought all their pals, we started to thrash.
There was romping and stomping, an occasional crash,
A fist fight or two, and Nintendo for cash.

We raided the fridge, dogs raided the trash,
I got a little worried when the windows got smashed.
The next thing you know, Mom and Dad are home,
The kids disappear and I'm all alone.

Everything's silent except for my moan,
And the low, bluesy tone of a saxophone.
They look at me, then they go into a huddle.
Get this sinking sensation I'm in deep, deep trouble.

We rounded the corner and came to a stop,
Threw me inside Jake's Barber Shop.

I said, Please Sir, just a little off the top.
Dude shaved me bare, gave me a lollipop.
So on my head, there's nothing but stubble.

Yes sir, it's worse than I thought
Each morning at nine, they trickle through the gates
They go home early, they come in late

Reeking of cheap liquor they stumble through the day
Never give a thought to honest work for honest pay
I know it shouldn't vex me, I shouldn't take it hard
I know I should ignore their capering with a kingly disregard, but

Look at all those idiots
Ooh, look at all those boobs
An office full of morons, a factory full of fools
Is it any wonder that I'm singing, singing the blues

They make personal phone calls
On company time
They Xerox their buttocks
And guess who pays the dime

Their blatant thievery wounds me
Their ingratitude astounds
I long to lure them to my home
And then release the hounds

I shouldn't grow unsettled
When faced with such abuse
I shouldn't let it plague me
I shouldn't blow a fuse

But, look at all those idiots
Ooh, look at all those boobs
An office full of morons, a factory full of fools
Is it any wonder that I'm singing, singing the blues

What happened? Where are the instruments?
I believe they call this a breakdown, sir
I can't have any breakdowns here
What if there was an inspector around?

Oh, I'm a little out of practice, sir
I said do it, so do it, do it, do it
Yes sir

Yes, excellent
Well done

Oh, sorry sir
Thought I had my mojo working

Drinking water, as if it's free
Oh, that's Homer Simpson, sir
A drone from sector 7-G

Yes, well, call this Simpson to my office
And stay to watch the fun
If he's 6 feet when he enters
He'll be two feet when I'm done

It brings a ray of sunshine
To my unhappy life
To make him kneel before me
And slowly twist the knife

Is it any wonder, that I'm singing, singing the blues

Terrorizing people wherever I go,

Fixin' test scores to get the best scores.
Droppin' banana peels all over the floor.
I'm the kid that made delinquency an art,
Last name Simpson, first name Bart.

I'm here today to introduce the next phase,
The next step in the big Bart craze.
I've got a dance real easy to do;
I learned it with no rhythm, and so can you.

So move your body if you've got the notion,
Front to back in a rock-like motion.
Now that you've got it, if you think you can,
Do it to the music--that's the Bartman.

Because I put mothballs in the beef stew.

Sitting by myself, confined to my room.

Till Lisa starts blowing that damn saxophone.
And if it was mine, you know they'd take it away,
But still I'm feeling good, so that's okay.

I'm up in my room, just a singin' a song,
Listen to the kick drum, kickin' along.

How old-fashioned, pure romance
Shared a kiss and shared the dance
Shared the body and bouquet
We'll taste the wine another day
When you and I are close enough for love

Not just lovers, more than friends
Who knows where one starts, one ends
Tracing lights through sleepless nights
That I'll remember always, always

Long goodbyes and tearful looks
Hold up well in poems and books
But you and I have life to hold
The greatest story ever told
Not perfect yet but close enough for love

Not perfect yet but close enough for love

Communicate, pull out your party piece

You run for cover so discreet, why don't they:

Do what they say, say what you mean

But then one thing leads to another.

Passes in and out like a scent
But the long face that you see comes from living close
To your fears

Dominique was in the backland

And the lost sheep to the fold

There was nothing left to eat

Come on let it rain on us
With the oil of Your anointing

On Your word that said we'd prophesize
And being strong in faith, flesh we defeat
And the Gospel in our mouth we set the captives free

Speak once again of my love, my own.

The Sisters of Mercy,"When it's passing strange
And I'm waiting for the train
Caught up on this line again
And it's passing slowly

Killing time but it's better
Than living in what will come
And I've still got some
Of your letters with me

And I thought sometimes
Or I read too much and I think you know
Let's drink to the dead lying under the water
And the cost of the blood on the driven snow

And the lipstick on my cigarettes
Frost upon the window pane

Nine while nine
And I'm waiting for the train

She said, ""Do you remember a time when angels?
Do you remember a time when fear
In the days when I was stronger
In the days when you were here""

She said, ""When days had no beginning
While days had no end when shadows grew no longer
I knew no other friend but you were wild""
You were wild

Frost upon these cigarettes
Lipstick on the window pane
And I've lost all sense of the world outside
But I can't forget so I call your name

And I'm looking for a life for me
And I'm looking for a life for you
And I'm talking to myself again
And it's so damn cold it's just not true

And I'm walking through the rain
Trying to hold on waiting for the train
And I'm only looking for what you want
But it's lonely here and I think you knew

And I'm, and I'm waiting
And I wait in vain
Nine while nine
And I'm waiting for the train

And I'm waiting
And I wait in vain

And I'm waiting for the train

The Sisters of Mercy,"And yes I believe in what we had but words got in the way
And only yesterday, as I was leaving, Lord knows I've tried to say
But I've heard a million conversations going where they've been before
Seen the way that careful lingers undecided at the door

And all I know for sure, all I know for real
Is knowing doesn't mean so much
When placed against the feeling, the heat inside
When bodies meet, when fingers touch

All my words are secondhand and useless in the face of this
Rationale and rhyme and reason, pale beside a single kiss
And I've heard so many things, I fail to understand at all
I'd settle anytime for unknown footsteps in the hall outside

And all I know for sure, all I know for real
Is knowing doesn't mean so much
When placed against the feeling, the heat inside
When bodies meet, when fingers touch

Because the world is cruel and promises are broken
Don't try to tell me anything, don't try to tell me
You'll be true to me, you know the real truth is never spoken

And I know the world is cold but if you hold on tight to what you
Find you might not mind too much though
Even this must pass away

And memories may last for years but
Names are just for souvenirs
Some kind of angel, let me look into your eyes

Don't give me why's and wherefore's reason or surprise
I don't care for words that don't belong

And I don't care what you're called, tell me later if at all
I can wait a long, long time, before I hear another love song

Come here I think you're beautiful
My door is open wide
Some kind of angel come inside

Come here I think you're beautiful
I think you're beautiful, beautiful
Some kind of angel come inside

Come here I think you're beautiful
I think you're beautiful

Come here I think you're beautiful

A lighthouse keeper in the desert sun
Dreamers of sleepers and white treason
We dream of rain and the history of the gun
There's a lighthouse in the middle of Prussia
A white house in a red square
I'm living in films for the sake of Russia
A Kino Runner for the DDR
And the fifty-two daughters of the revolution
Turn the gold to chrome
Gift...nothing to lose
Stuck inside of Memphis with the mobile home, sing:

Mother Russia

Mother Russia rain down down down
Mother Russia

Mother Russia rain down

And the idiot wields the power
Where the chosen hold the highest card
On the field of honour where the ground is hard
So the highest hand is joking wild
And the house soon fold and no one stand
I put my finger on and dialled
The tower, the moon, the gun and
Nine nine nine, singer down
Cloudburst and all around
The first are last, the blessed get wired
The best is yet to come

And the meek'll inherit what they damn well please

Jaded and hopeless
We let it fall through the cracks

It divides and it cuts
You gave in and I gave up
Through glares of disgust

Jaded

Why did it come to this?
My heart's been ripped apart
Torn by your poisoned lips

How could it get this far?
Why did it come to this?
Our souls are ripped apart

The wounds of love forget the oath

Bitterness the soil, resentment the stone
A grave of shallows filled with her bones
Buried my heartache, buried my hope
My soul now dies with her down in that hole

Run aground by trusting signals
You were sending me
The streets are filled with empty faces
Nothing here is new
It's just the same in other places
I have journeyed to
I was the first across the water
The last across the land
I walked out of the silver mine
My pockets full of sand
Alone inside my head
Alone inside my room
I feel alone inside my head
Alone inside my tiny little world
It's not my life in those old pictures
The ones you threw away
For I was always someone else
And always far away
Walking in the darkest places
Where the mission meets
Waiting for the ground to open up
Beneath my feet
Alone inside my head
Alone inside my room
I feel alone inside my head
Alone inside my tiny little world

Were the two he left you with

Oh Lord I never felt so low
Now the skirts hang so heavy around your head
That you never knew you were young
Because you played chance with a lifetime's romance
And the price was far too long

I watch the way the sun sets
Until the night's inside you
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me

So out here to the east of Eden
I let salvation be

Would it ever be there for me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
Had to walk with me
I watch the way the crow flies
I know it always seems so easy
But if I see it in a grey sky
Can I be sure about the way it leads me
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I call upon the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden
I watch your soul run free
I was waiting, I was watching
Would it ever be before me
And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me
I was waiting, I was watching

And I found that hope and a lucky card
Were all I had to walk with me

Some pass like the flash of a spark
Who knows where all our days go
Out here we lie together
Outside the thunder gathers
Why care about the weather
It always ends in dark
I looked west in search of freedom and I saw slavery
I looked east in search of answers and I saw misery
Some days I just don't worry, I let it walk through me
Some days I walk into the very depths of me
So out here to the east of Eden

With a place right where you wanted and the ones to fill it to
But some blows break the spell
That it hits you every day until you need to hit as well
It's just a shadow of the man you should be
Like a garden in the forest that the world will never see
You have no thought of answers only questions to be filled
And it feels like hell
It all seemed fine for you
Till the struggle of ambition turned in violence upon you
Sometimes a landslide comes
If you're hiding in that avalanche you need a place to run
It's just a shadow of the woman you should be

I know there is enough for everyone

And there's never been a hand
Did we ever have it good
While we lived in Eldorado did we find the gold we should
If it really was the truth
Why are faces filled with anger that should only shine with youth
It's just a shadow of the people we should be

There will be blood among the corn and heroes in the hills
But there is more to come my boy before you've had your fill
Men will come and rape the soil as though it were their own
And they will bathe their feet in oil as I have bathed my own

All this will pass
All things must come
Just as I tell you here

Stones will stand together as if searching for the stars
And all come crashing down again before they reach too far
She turned to face the setting sun, I turned to walk away
But then she called my name again and beckoned me to stay

All this will pass
All things must come
Just as I tell you here

She told me of the famous sons who write their names in peace
Yet be cut down before the time has come for our release
Just as I tell you here
Even now I wait for the coming day
Even now she waits in the dawn
For the tales she tells, for the gifts that she will sell
For the sight she knows, for a vision that still grows
With the dream in her eyes no one's seen

I listened for so long that day that I can hardly tell
If what she said was heaven sent or brought to bear in hell
That men of hope would stand alone and still be cast a lie
Just as Romans cast them on the day they were to die

Leave your home?I am no fool
Take up arms?It left me strong

Have no fear?Now I must try
God will be?With braver men
Take the vow?I know it's right
Praise the flag?The good fight
We're at war?I'm on my way
We will win?Why do I pray
Sons of men who stand like gods
We give life to feed the cause
And run to ground our heathen foe
Our name will never die

I wait here in this hole
Playing poker with my soul
I hold the rifle close to me
It lights the way to keep me free
If I die in a combat zone
Box me up and ship me home
If I die and still come home
Lay me where the rose is sown

The winds of quiet change
If you could see what I must see
Still hidden in the rain
But when the thunder rolls
It comes and covers up my soul
And you will take my hand
And be with me in wonderland
I am an honest man I need the love of you
I am a working man
I feel the winter too
If you could hear what I must hear
Then nothing would replace
The fifty years of sweat and tears
That never left a trace
But when I look at you
I see you feel the same way too
And you will take my hand
And be with me in wonderland
I am an honest man I need the love of you
I am a working man
I feel the winter too
You still remember other days
When every head was high
I watched that pride be torn apart
Beneath a darker sky
With innocence within ourselves
We sing the same old song
And you will take my hand
And make believe it's wonderland
I need the love of you
I am a working man
I feel the winter too

The Skyliners,"I'll close my eyes
And make believe it's you
If other lips
Should speak of love divine

The stars were mine
But I reached for the moon 
And found all too soon
It was not to be mine

I'll close my eyes
If you should pass me by
With someone else
Maybe who loves you too

I may be lonely, but
When I see the moon's blue light
I'll close my eyes
And make believe it's you

Heaven sends
A song through its doors
Just as if it seems to know
I'm exclusively yours

Knowing this
I feel but one way
You will understand too
In these words that I say

I'll close my eyes
To everyone but you
And when I do
I'll see you standing there

I'll lock my heart
To any other caress
I'll never say yes
To a new love affair

Then I'll close my eyes
To everything that's gay
If you are not there
Oh, to share each lovely day

And through the years
In those moments
When we're far apart
Don't you know I'll close my eyes
And I'll see you with my heart",I'll Close My Eyes,1999
The Skyliners,"Come on along and listen to
The lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo
The lullaby of Broadway
The rumble of a subway train
The rattle of the taxis
The daffodils who entertain
At Angelo's and Maxi's

When a Broadway baby says good night
It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight
Until the dawn

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
Hey

The band begins to go to town
And everyone goes crazy
You rock a bye your baby round
'Til everything gets hazy
Hush a bye, I'll buy you this and that
You hear a daddy saying
And baby goes home to her flat
To sleep all day

Good night, baby

Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day

The Skyliners,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais

The Skyliners,"I knew the time had to come
When I'd be held under your thumb
I'm like a pawn in your hand
Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie
For what happens there's no excuse
I put my own head in the noose",Nevertheless,2013

You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past

That rapture so supreme

The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine

Bout your shawty and I tell them bout mine

Even though I'm not your man, you not my girl
I'ma call you my shawty
'Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad
I beat his ass for my shawty
And we ain't did nothin that we ain't supposed to do
'Cause you my shawty
Baby girl you know I be home, keep me on the ring tone shawty
Sing it to me girl

Soon as I seen her, shit told her I'd pay for it
Lil mama the baddest thing `round here and she already know it
I pointed at the donk and told her this supposed to be yours
Showed her a couple stacks and told her I'd let her blow it
The hottest nigga in the city baby you can't ignore it
I showed her I was a real nigga and she went for it
First time I [called ?] her shit, she ain't even know how to throw it back
Now she an animal, I got her sex game right
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like
I told her I don't usually do this, I don't fuck on the first night
'Cause after I beat ya baby I'm liable to fuck up ya whole life
I gotta train her, now she suck me with ice
I call her my lil bustie baby cause she keep it tight
Whenever I tell her to bust, ain't gotta tell her twice
Whenever I wanna get off she know how to get me right

Whoa w-w-whoa shawtyyyyy
Whoa w-w-whoa whoa whoa whooooa whoa whoa

I love to show her off, cause all the dope boys want her
Know why they wanna beat [badly ?], look at all that ass on her
Look how that pussy sit up in them shorts, you gotta want her
Love when she act like she bo-legged and bend the [corner ?]
She proud to be fuckin me, cause I'm stuntin on `em
It feel good to be fuckin a real nigga don't`uh
Ain't called her in two days, gotta let her mind wonder
But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her
That's why I don't mind breakin her off, cause she aint with the drama
If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil mama
You know she gotta be somethin, cause I done beat [her under ?]
[?] snatchin [?], I'm tellin ya, I promise
I exposed her to real, and now she hate lame

If we don't fuck with ya pussy nigga then keep floatin.
We gettin loose a lil bit, but everybody focused.
Cause everybody on yack and every body scopin.
Keep a unit in my face and back against the wall.
And hand on fire in case I gotta get off.
Ain't nothin over here for ya but problems dawg.

Now if you ain't respected by the streets, then pussy nigga move
'cause this section over here reserved for the goons
And we ain't friendly over here so give us some room
We ain't hard to find nigga just follow the fumes
Any nigga can't hang over here 'cause we got rules
Nigga look like he wanna do something, then do her too
Better keep your feelings to your self and stay cool
You needa handle you're liquor pussy or get blue
Last nigga that played tough, he made the news
Gettin of on the bitch in the club, ain't nothin new
'cause every nigga over here 'bout whateva its on you
'cause hoes only ones that ridin and fightin nigga shoes
Just 'cause it look like we ballin nigga don't get fooled

The Slapping Suspenders,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Of pioneers and pirate ships and Bob Dylan
Of people wrapped up tight in the things that will kill them
Of being trapped in a lift plunging straight to the bottom
Of open seas and ways of life we've forgotten
I keep having dreams

Amy worked in a bar in Exeter
I went back to her house and I slept beside her
She woke up screaming in the middle of the night
Terrified of her own insides
Dreams of pirate ships and Patty Hearst
Breaking through a life over-rehearsed
She can't remember which came first
The house, the home, or the terrible thirst
She keeps having dreams

And on the worst days
When it feels like life weighs ten thousand tons
She's got her cowboy boots and car keys on the bed stand
So she can always run
She can get up, shower, and in half an hour she'll be gone

I keep having dreams of things I need to do
And waking up and not following through
But it feels like I haven't slept at all
When I wake to a silence and she's facing the wall
Posters of Dylan and of Hemingway
An antique compass for a sailor's escape
She says you just can't live this way
And I close my eyes and I never say
I'm still having dreams

And on the worst days
When it feels like life weighs ten thousand tons
I sleep with my passport
One eye on the back door
So I can always run
I can get up, shower, and in half an hour I'll be gone

And come morning
I am disappeared
Just an imprint on the bedsheets
I'm by the roadside with my thumb out
A car pulls up, and Bob's driving
So I climb in
We don't say a word
As we pull off into the sunrise
And these rivers of tarmac are like arteries across the country

All the stations 
That we should have reached by now.
Where we haven't read the script,
And our tender wings are clipped.
And we're scared we might be
Letting someone down.

When nothings really wrong.
And then we smile

And say we're fine.
We're drifting through 
Our middle days,
And creeping,
Into middle age.
And setting in our ways

And now it's time

To decide
Now it's time 
To draw the line
In the sand
And ask 
What's more important than
Days like today,

So grab some beers
Call your friends,
And meet us here
In the summer park
With me and my friend Dan",Dan's Song [#],2014
The Sleeping Souls,"Just give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
And I can fuck up anything, anything.
It was a wonderful life when we were together,
And now I've fucked up every little goddamn thing.

Amelie lied to me, this was supposed to be easy.
I found the one damn person to help me fall asleep in the night.
But sleeping gets tiring, and dark reminds me of dying,
And as long as this feeble heart is still beating,
You will find me rushing through every room, switching on all the lights.

The problem with falling in love in late bars
Is that there's always more nights, there's always more bars.
The problem with showing your lover your scars
Is that everybody's lover is covered in scars.

Things got fractious, and I felt faithless,
At that moment just before the dawn when everything falls apart.
But baby I didn't mean it, for things to get desperate.
I let slip my guard, let go of the rudder,
Now we're drifting in the current away from one another.

So give me one fine day of plain sailing weather
And I can fuck up anything, anything.
It was a wonderful life when we were together,
And now I've fucked up every little goddamn thing,
Every little goddamn thing.

I've been skirting round the rim of doing something
Brave, and not just standing, but jumping in,
Of making circles into squares, of laying down
The bare facts like a burden I can't bear.
And I can almost find the words, but I can see the way you'd
Fold your hands, speak my name like a curse
Upon your pretty lips, the pressured white behind your fingertips.

And when you see me for all that I am
I couldn't make mistakes to make a difference any more.
I'd throw myself down on my knees, at your hands,
And beg you for forgiveness for my fuck ups and my faults.
And maybe you'd relent and return my hope for our forever,
Lift up your precious hands, and then bring yours and mine together,
So just give me one fine day of plain sailing weather.",Plain Sailing Weather [#],2014
The Sleeping Souls,"God dammit Amy, we're not kids any more.
You can't just keep waltzing out of my life,
Leaving clothes on my bedroom floor,
Like nothing really matters, like pain doesn't hurt.
You should be more to me by now than just heartbreak in a short skirt.

You kind of remind me of scars on my arms that I made when I was a kid,
With a disassembled disposable razor I stole from my dad,
When I thought that suffering was something profound,
That weighed down on wise heads,
And not just something to be avoided,
Something normal people dread.

God dammit Amy, well of course I've changed.
With all the things I've done and the places I've been
I'd be a machine if I had stayed the same.
But you're still back where we started, you haven't changed at all.
You're still trying to live like a kid, like you can always have it all.

You know you kind of remind me of scars on my arms that I hid as best I could,
That I covered with ink, but in the right kind of light they still bleed through,
Showing that there are some things I just can't change no matter what I do:
The tell-tale signs of being used,
Of being trapped inside of you.

You're a beautiful butterfly
Burned with a branding iron
Onto my outsides into my insides
As a simple sign:
To show off your ownership.
Burned into my naked skin,
Onto my outsides into my insides.

It's not even love any more,
It's just a claim upon my soul.
It stains my skin, yeah it's on my breath,
And I'm ashamed to get undressed
In front of strangers in case they see
The tell tale signs that you have left all over me.

God dammit Amy.
You'll always remind me of scars on my arms that I know will never fade.
And it's not like it's something I think about each and every day -
I just occasionally catch myself scratching them, as if they'd ever go away.
But these tell tale signs are here to stay, and in the end you know that's OK.
You will always be a part of my patched-up patchwork taped-up tape-deck heart.",Tell Tale Signs,2014

The Small Clubs,"Let's talk about a criminal procedure 
Throw out the idea of illegal seizure
Put a rope around somebody's neck 
Let's hold some bastard up for example
Take his blood and a urine sample 
Feed him garbage and make him pick up the check

[Chorus]
Well, here it comes here it comes, here it, 
Here, here, here it comes again (twice)

While you were sleeping the neighbors crept in 
Saw you were naked and called it a sin

The next thing you know... it's the next thing you know
Men they poked their heads in your kitchen door 
Smelt something burning and they were sure
It must be the flag you were burning that's what they swore

[Chorus repeat]
They tell you the preacher was hypocritical
What they don't tell you is that he's typical
What he stands for is totally mythical
And as they lead him away he'll pray for you brother
With a bible in one hand and playboy in the other
Imagine what he does to his mother

[Chorus repeat]
They tell you they want to give the right to life
To millions of jerks who will live by the knife
Who'll beat up their children and beat up their wives
Now don't write poetry it's an offense 
Unless it falls to the right of the fence

You'll wind up a victim of zero tolerance 
Let's hold some bastard up for example
Take his blood and a urine sample 
Remind him that man belongs down a man hole (three times) and then

Have I just become a thorn in your side

Making good use of weaknesses, horoscopes, rumors and facts
Inspired by the needles and pins and the pains in the heart
With no control over the chemistry that brings us then tears us apart

Now we're as hard, as hard as nails
Laugh at the butterfly that's just been impaled
We're always running and don't know what we're running from
We're always sweating bricks
The only time the world makes sense to us is when we come
Love is a burning, love is a burning, love is a burning question
On the tip of your tongue, baby baby

I'll endlessly make you and endlessly become remade
I'll endlessly search for your heart with a carnal switchblade,
As we thrash in the heat in an effort to beat up the world
Then we loose our identities replace them with diamonds and pearls

Don't be as hard as hard as nails
You might be born to win and then your heart fails
Get on my wavelength understand my driving force

It's sin and sin alone
I wouldn't lie to you unless I had to of course
Love is a burning, love is a burning, love is a burning question

Don't answer no
Don't make me take a look just let me off the hook
I've seen the future of rock and it sucks, yeah, it sucks

I've used you you're bleeding I know but don't be afraid

Be my oasis and I will try not to be your mirage

I'm not a pillar of devotion, but don't let that stand in your way

Made in a factory in Jonjoping
Fake glass baubles hang in the station

And a Swedish passport and something white
She walks past but you can't form a whistle
Even her lips look artificial
You wanna follow her but you can't swallow
Her act, it seems so superficial 
Now you've shed the old one like a worn out shoe
It was all your fault but you blame her too
You know its phony but at least it's new
And it comes from a bottle like

And in your heart there's a new addiction
Another friction that you can't resolve

An imaginary postcard that just dissolved
Endless sunsets glow in the distance
Painted by Picasso's assistants
Perfect people travel in Volvos
Into the sunsets into the distance
You're just a passenger she's not a ticket
A foreign stamp you've got to lick it 
Put it in the mail box
Put it in the fail box
You never seem to learn from the school of hard knocks

You bought it way down below the mason dixon line
Like your mother you're a southern belle

I said release me, but please don't let me know
I said release me, but please don't let me go

Ah my blood's still boiling, like a snake you come coiling
Ready to strike

When the night comes down I get a big black fear,
Like the clouds hanging up above
I don't want you to possess me, but that's how it is
I ain't nothin' but your slave of love.

Life I had, I'd give it up as if it were nothing

If I had what I haven't got, a second chance a second shot
I'd be something that I'm not, I'd be worthy of your love

I'd be there inside of every moment
I would know how every moment is a moment lost
Unless it's lived as if it's loved

Don't let it reign over us, 'cause that was yesterday's cloud

A poisonous whirlpool, swirling and black
I know we have tasted the fobidden ugly fruit
Get it out of our system rip it by the root

And well-timed time that I'll spend alone
Throw my body into insignificant positions

Complete more chances and more finishes

Fly through the world like a whirling dervish in a hurricane
Take off my clothes and run screaming in the pouring rain
Kiss people even when I'm pretty sure it's a mistake

Did I meet you in my dreams on some lonely street it seems?

Leave me spellbound, spellbound

Once I cried but now I find I have left those days behind
My mind's racing round and round, I was lost but now I've found
One look and I wear my heart upon my sleeve
One touch from you and I just can't believe

I am spellbound, spellbound
Leave me spellbound, spellbound

Each time I look in your eyes I get the same new surprise
And since the day that we met you just won't let me forget

I am spellbound, spellbound
Leave me spellbound, spellbound

Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

Leave me spellbound, spellbound
Leave me spellbound, spellbound

I have met my destiny, baby, for the life of me

One look at you and the wind is spinning 'round
One touch of you and my feet leave the ground

So, how do I feel about my life?

When will you accept your life?

For anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes

Oh, how do I feel about my shoes?
They make me awkward and plain
How dearly I would love to kick with the fray...
But I once had a dream (and it never came true)
And time is against me now...
