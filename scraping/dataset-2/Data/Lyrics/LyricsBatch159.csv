DJ's Choice,"Oh, come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the King of angels
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

God of God
Light of light
Lo, he abhors
Not the virgin's womb
Very God
Begotten not created
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens
Of heaven above
Glory to God
In the highest

O come
Let us adore him
Christ the Lord

See how the shepherds
Summoned to his cradle
Leaving their flocks
Draw nigh with lowly fear
We too will thither bend
Our joyful footsteps
O come, let us adore him
Christ the Lord

Yea, Lord, we greet thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus
To thee be glory given
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
O come
Let us adore him
Christ the Lord",O Come All Ye Faithful,2005
DJ's Choice,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem,2005
DJ-One & Dolla,"You tell me that you're leavin', 
I can't believe it's true!
Girl, there's just no livin' without you.
Don't take your love away from me.
Don't you leave my heart in misery.
'Cause if you go, then I'll be blue,
Breakin' up is hard to do.

Remember when you held me tight,
And you kissed me all through the night.
Think of all that we been through,
And breakin' up is hard to do.

They say that breakin' up is hard to do,
Now I know, I know that it's true.
Don't say that this is the end.
Instead of breakin' up I wish that 
We were makin' up again.

I beg of you don't say goodbye,
Can't we give our love just one more try?
Come on baby, let's start anew, 
Breakin' up is hard to do.",The Break Up,2004
Djabe,"Walking along the Camino Royale 
The Mississippi sighs 
Soft in the night when the wind starts to rise 
And I'm lifted high around the corner 
So I spin 
Fast as a ride at the fair 
Like a snake that flies through the air 
When I cry enough I'm fired from a gun 
And thrown through the doors 

Only the fool learns to get through 
Only the fool learns to get through 

Ahead I see candles floating in pails 
Each placed upon a chair 
Into a tent where they turn round the bend 
Through a kitchen leading to a staircase 
Now I stop 
Seems that I've been led astray 
There are no new answers today 
This road is blocked 
Only the fool learns to get through 

Only the fool learns to get through 
Only the fool learns to get through",Camino Royale,2012

Djabe,"As daybreak breaks the mist upon the earth
It came to pass that beauty settled there forever more
And as the steam clings close to things to come
It came to pass that solid rock did part for humble life

Once upon a time there was confusion
Disappointment, fear and disillusion
Now there's hope reborn with every morning
See the future clearly at its dawning
Forever drifting slowly towards a hazy emptiness
As water slips into the sea
The father's sad to see it free

As shadows creep towards their master night
It came to pass that trees defied the wind who shook their leaves
And as the peace descended all around
It came to pass that nature's creatures came to face the world

Once upon a time there was confusion
Disappointment, fear and disillusion
Now there's hope reborn with every morning
See the future clearly at its dawning
Forever drifting slowly towards a hazy emptiness
As water slips into the sea
The father's sad to see it free

Once upon a time there was confusion
Disappointment, fear and disillusion
Now there's hope reborn with every morning
See the future clearly at its dawning

Once upon a time there was confusion
Disappointment, fear and disillusion",Firth of Fifth,2017

Et tes copines, w'Allah un jour faut qu'j'en claque une
Là y'a plein d'blessures, si t'es déter' vas-y viens m'les soigner
Et faudra qu't'assures si un jour j'me fais péter par les douaniers
Toi tu resteras avec moi même si j'suis à la paille
Tu m'fais croire que nous deux ça vaut plus que la bague
Moi j'voulais pas t'écouter
J'restais qu'avec mes potos
Qu'ça vienne un jour j'm'en doutais

D'l'amour et d'la haine
Tu veux du bon taf'
Passer du bon temps
Un expert comptable, qui t'ramène à Mont Blanc
En vrai toi tu me connais pas
Faut qu'tu reste vrai dès le départ
Nous deux faut qu'on fasse des débats

Whisky dans la vessie, ça rêve des îles
T’es plein d’jalousie, fais pas l’mec qu’apprécie, tu parasites
Y a trop de soucis, il me faut un coin paisible aux Maldives
Il faut mailler pour le cuir alcantara que des dégats
Mets le casque Arai, démarre le Yamaha on met les gaz
À la recherche des 24 carats
(J'suis au millieu de la cité comme Thiago Alcântara)
T'sais qu'on rame, que des vrais arabes qui te baisent ta race
Capuché renoi tête marave, nerveux au démarrage
Dans une équipe, y a toujours un traître, toujours une rapace
Mais t’inquiètes y a toujours un frère là , qu’ça passe ou qu'ça casse

Djakout Mizik,"""Let me touch your button""

If you got your tickets to the carnival,
please report to the dance floor right now!
She says when I am Wyclef you such a dodgy geezer.
I said,
let me touch your button,
let me touch your button,
let me touch your, let me touch your, let me touch your button (x2)

(Lyrics for 'Let me touch your button' are incomplete)

""Rouge et Bleu"" (In French)

Rouge et Bleu 4x
toute kote nou pase yape di rouge et bleu
gen sa ki panike yape rele pompie
man pa gen pompie ki ka eten du feu sa
nan tanpete, eclair, l'orage
ti moun'yo nou pa bezoin fe sovage
negre ki te vole tenis pou mamwe yo se domage
yon lot negre vole'l nan pre'l
li tire'l ak gro sa'm

(wo'y) yon vendredi apres midi
nan yon tv on avion pase

manman panse se farine

ti moun yo mange'l yo mouri
rouge et bleu 4x

gende le mwen krie pou rouge et blue

Jean Jacques Dessalines Boukman

(woy) negre yo tire zam'm, chanse pouli la sante

Don't ever let me find you're gone cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory let's start a brand new story now my love

With memories

There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

Dear Lord above
Send back my love

Django Bates,"On every tree there sits a bird, singing a song of love
On every tree there sits a bird, and ev'ryone I ever heard 
Could break my heart without a word singing a song of love
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more
 
A song of love is a sad song, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo

Django Bates,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1997
Django Bates,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Django Bates,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1997

Django Django,"Waking together, you lifted your head
How would it feel if we laid back forever?
Travel the world from the bed where we lie
Floating above like the ash from a fire
Doesn't it seem like we've been here before?
Over an ocean the heavens will open
Nothing lives up to the visions we see
Everything's clear when you step through the mirror

Carried away to the fog in the distance
Breaking through the glass
Waking up at last
Are you still there?
Face up to the facts
The gasses that we share
Hot balloons of open air

Step out of rhythm and fall into place
Try not to think of the hours I wasted
Open the shutters, now how can it be?
When did this picture become so unreal?
Moving along on an endless supply
Somehow I feel like the only survivor
Try to remember the moment we spent 
Lost in the rain as we floated together

Carried away by the dream that we're sharing
Breaking through the glass
Waking up at last
Are you still there?
Face up to the facts
The gasses that we share
Hot balloons of open air

What does it matter, the world will still spin
Another day ends, and the end will begin again
Dancing in circles, and clapping out time
Telling the truth and forgetting the lines

Waking together, you lifted your head
How would it feel if we laid back forever?
Travel the world from the bed where we lie
Floating above like the ash from a fire

Django Django,"Walk out and don't look back
There's no love lost
Don't take me for a fool or
I'll keep the prize that we had split

Deceived, run short of luck, double crossed

Shot down, follow behind 'til I find you
Running ahead of me, let down
Tables have turned, and I see you
Staring right back at me

Walk, in silence you were gone
Now all is lost, you always said that I'd be the one
To cut you from the pack, I should have known
Seeing that dust where you've flown
My love has gone, it's way too late
You sleight of hand deceived me and sealed our fate
You've taken back the cards, lost one by one
And in the game we've begun, undone
Run short of luck, double crossed

Django Reinhardt,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid

I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet

Dadya, you swing it, so do I
Dadya, I swing it so do you
 
When he turns that handle down
Music goes around and 'round

Django Reinhardt,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Clouds are feathers from a lady's fan
Do you remember how we watched them drifting by
Long ago when love began
 
Clouds floating thru the night 
While the silver stars above
Lend their tender light 
Clouds drifting thru the sky
While I wonder why my love ever said goodbye
The night was young
The breeze was warm and tender
A fool was I but how was I to know
I gladly gave my heart in sweet surrender
To learn that love was meant to come and go 
Like snowhite clouds floating through the night 
Speaking of a love that was heavenly 
A love that could never be mine
 
Once we were together and now we're apart
Did you find it easy to forget?
I keep on dreaming while the years go drifting by
Calling you my ""Sweet Regret""

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,
Django Williams,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered",2000
Django Williams,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,2000
Django Williams,"Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin

And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do

Se perderá no caminho
Na pureza de um limão
Ou na solidão do espinho

Cerraram fogo no espaço
Brigando horas a fio

E a fruta que era madura
A correnteza levou
A correnteza levou
A correnteza levou...
E choveu uma semana
E eu não vi o meu amor
O barro ficou marcado
Aonde a boiada passou
Depois da chuva passada
Céu azul se apresentou
Lá à beira da estrada
Vem vindo o meu amor
Vem vindo, Vem vindo, Vem vindo

E eu adormeci sorrindo
Sonhando com o nosso amor

For the Cadillac's and gas money spent (you ain't knowin')
Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit (you ain't knowin')
Will have a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit (you ain't knowin')

Gotta couple hoes workin' on the changes for me
But I gotta keep my game tight like Kobe on game night
Like takin' from a ho don't know no better, I know that ain't right
Done seen people killed, done seen people deal
Done seen people live in poverty with no meals
It's fucked up where I live, but that's just how it is
It might be new to you, but it's been like this for years
It's blood sweat and tears when it come down to this shit
I'm tryin' to get rich 'fore I leave up out this bitch
I'm tryin' to have thangs but it's hard fo' a pimp
But I'm prayin' and I'm hopin' to God I don't slip, yeah

They come hopin' every night, they don't end up bein' dead
Wait I got a snow bunny, and a black girl too
You pay the right price and they'll both do you

You know it's hard out here for a pimp (you ain't knowin')
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent (you ain't knowin')
For the Cadillac's and gas money spent (you ain't knowin')
Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit (you ain't knowin')
Will have a whole lot of bitches talkin' shit (you ain't knowin')

In my eyes I done seen some crazy thangs in the streets
Gotta couple hoes workin' on the changes for me
But I gotta keep my game tight like Kobe on game night
Like takin' from a ho don't know no better, I know that ain't right
Done seen people killed, done seen people deal
Done seen people live in poverty with no meals
It's fucked up where I live, but that's just how it is
It might be new to you, but it's been like this for years
It's blood sweat and tears when it come down to this shit
I'm tryin' to get rich 'fore I leave up out this bitch
I'm tryin' to have thangs but it's hard fo' a pimp
But I'm prayin' and I'm hopin' to God I don't slip, yeah

Man it seems like I'm duckin' dodgin' bullets everyday
Niggas hatin' on me cause I got, hoes on the tray
But I gotta stay paid, gotta stay above water
Couldn't keep up with my hoes, that's when shit got harder
North Memphis where I'm from, I'm 7th Street bound

This that Memphis drama boy, so we came to get fucked
I thought you came with heat, nigga where's you back up?
Your clique, they some cowards, they scattered out like roaches
That bottle across your head got you leaking, loosing focus
See this is what we mean when we shut down the club
Niggas started gangsta walkin', so we tear the bitch up
We some shittin' hood niggas from the ghetto and the projects
Left the police, cause we know we the suspects
Make you wonder what's next
Bitch guard your grill 
If they play this in the club, you'll get your ass beat for real

Is your will not to do something

Make it all better instead of sitting around uptight
Looking down 'cause it ain't right
Whatcha gon do is the question

And I got no dough

Or trying to get off crack

Turn around and be the first to make a diss
Try to keep it crisp and tight and let it rip

People don't try 'cause they petrified
Of what though
I ain't even worried about the po-po
And once we ??? them
There ain't a place that can't go
And bump takin things slow

In my way-get blowed
In my space-get towed

Stack bricks real tall 
And you get brick walls 
Get a plan 
Keep it going til you figure things out
Work your plan

True thinking is a deliberative act of the mind
Held fast to its task
Good or bad
The mind will bring into you life what you conceive
Strong will is the master of the body
Directed in the ? in the dictates of desire or reason
Will is itself power to bring forth the motive
On impluse that is strongest
Be it positive or negative
As is the mind, so is the will
Contemplate confidence and belief in your will
So your mind will be clothed 
With the power to have all possessions
Self-possessions, self-restraints, self-direction
And self-complusion to have anything you desire
The law of the will is the law of all rounds
Of symmetric character of self
God gave us a choice to direct thy will
And the power to be or not to be
The choices is ours-Willpower",Willpower,2001

Es este mismo que a la cara te esta hablando
No reconoces ni si quiera ya mi voz
Why ahora me miras como si fuera un extrano

Parece ser que todo ya se te olvido
Que las promesas que salieron de tus labios
Se derritieron como el hielo abajo el sol
Why se apago ese resplandor de aqella noche de verano

Mas yo si me enamore
Por eso no te olvide
Why aunque ahora tu me nieges los besos de tus labios
Me muero por besarlos

No digas que fue un error
Jurarnos eterno amor
Si en mis brazos tu temblabas
Suplicando a puro grito no me dejes por favor

Parece ser que todo ya se te olvido
Que las promesas que salieron de tus labios
Se derritieron como el hielo abajo el sol

Suplicando a puro grito no me dejes por favor
No me dejes por favoooor
No me deejs por favor, ayy

Yo si me enamore,
Yo si me enamore de ti
Why sin ti morire

Ya no te acuerdas del hombre que fui yo
Ese que un dia te enamoro
Te dio tanto amor why tu le pagaste con traicion

Yo si me enamore
Yo si me enamore de ti

Si no recuerdas mis besos
Porque antes te morias why temblas de emocion
Cuando no estaba junto a ti, uoo

Yo si me enamore
Yo si me enamore de ti
Why sin ti morire

Yo me enamore
Yo me ilucione
Oh, pero tu por mi jamas nunca nada sentiste

Yo si me enamore
Yo si me enamore de ti
Why sin ti morire moins

I get you high if you gimme your dough
I'm only trying to get you to put your nose three feet deep in the snow

Get a sniff of this Vitamin see-O-K-E
Take a puff of this opium that'll leave your mind blown
Grown from Colombian seeds, come on!

I'm an urban entertainer of the hot nights

I'm just a brother who never
Compromised his integrity
My legacy is heavenly
Bury me in the hood
Never think I'm not cautious, hey
I recognise what a wrong look'll cost us
So inside I'm always nervous
But I never look worried
Come for me
Gun shot flurries in a hurry
Come get me
And be where I perform, stay warm
I'm prepared for the storm
And I brought the heat with me
Lord, please talk to these boys
'Fore I leave they evening spoilt
Put 'em six feet up under the soil
Looking at the roots of trees
Better yet leave they bodies all out in the open so the flies can feed
And when the 'hood get dry I supply the need
y'all faggot niggaz keep it moving honey riding with me
So what ya want?

And I never politic when I be on some cool out shit
Don't even run up on me talking 'bout some artist that you signed
'cause I don't really give a fuck and I ain't really got the time
I'm trying to put some money in my clothes
Sean clothes, Jah clothes
First, did you come with six zeros?
Fuck y'all then, I'm trying to put some dubs on the road
Then just slide up in the club and try to bubble some hoes
Player, the harder we grind, the further we go
I'm at the point I'm ready to commit a murder to blow
Whatever it takes, I see the nigga holding the case
Look dead in his face, hit the nigga holding the weight
Make his man take me to the crib and go in the safe
Jah done made the reservation so we ready to peel
For real, without no hesitation Nitty bustin' the steel
So what ya what?

Mixed with a little cheese (from Coolie High)
Mommy how you gonna move? (when it's just you and I)
Pardon me a second dude (you better get in line)
Confrontation time, get in line or spit a rhyme
I ain't looking for no beef but I will oblige
I'm kinda quiet but surprise I ain't really shy
Didn't mean to shock you with the real
But niggaz know the deal
When I'm up in punk knockers and down in Sugar Hill
Call me Mr Foreverman, can't say I never ran and never will
But when the shells get to flying and I don't got skill
I get ghost then I bounce
Come back and a nigga be ready to throw toast

Listen, momma said there'd be days like this
Where I'd have to set the record straight on a plagiarist
Who played the fifth row
Had to let the kid know even if he played the fifth
I'd still get in his ass like a wedgie
Ready or not I be lyrical machete that cut
Through bricks and steel 'cause sticks and stones might
Break ya bones
But they won't end the rhetoric
The evidence is in, I'm guilty
'Cause the verdict is my cleverness with pen
Murder music murder men
The mo' time go by the mo' intense my lyrical flow
To show the privates that they can't follow where generals go
I leave the troops and the battles and the trenches
You succeed with flukes and coincidences
You have no defenses against my sub tenses
I'm all up in the game and you sidelined on the benches
Defenseless against this
From the beginning it was senseless
You bit more than you could chew
It's knocking out your dentures
""But I but I but I but I but I but I but I I figga, that I'm a bad nigga I'm
a bad nigga
I'm a bad bad nigga""

I love it when it's my turn
And faces start to look crazy concerned
They know I'm about to burn baby burn
From the facility
The city'll need a lot of H20
When I'm finished you'll need a place to go
Face the facts
I flow from the brain to the paper to the wax
Back niggaz down like automatic gunfire
I perspire when I show a MC how to holla for the have my power locked down
like Rottweiler dogs
Don't be appalled at the crowd just because they applaud
When they lockjawed but don't follow yours
Yours was only endured for a minute or more
Until I took the floor
And came through with the definitive raw
The textbook definition of ""damn he nice!""
I'm so explosive like bullets bust from ya biscuit
Sometimes my shit is too explicit to risk it
But these idiots love the pain
And they ain't really tryin' to risk it
Nigga listen!

So check the rhyme to the rhythm
Or shiver when I give a
Very fat deliver-why
The process only Jemini, me
Other MC's is corny I set ya souls free
The baddest born motherfucker ever to pick up a mic
And when I touch the structure
Watch the structure rupture
Clutch ya, might butt ya
Not the type to get down with the baddest
The Jemini status
I'm blunt with the gun so I stomp out ya business
Plus I can dominate ya physical fitness
So witness the Jemini shit comin' from way back
Beef with me chief I throw the blade to ya nutsack for payback
Don't ya try to diss me like a gamer
I got rhymes in the clip plus one inside the chamber
Danger, so cock the glock near ya jock

Up in the facility
Instead of niggaz ice-grillin' me
When they really be, feeling me
Lyrically it's just a facade
To hide their inabilities
And their insecurities
Picture me, giving a damn
I've been in the joint
Pitting lyrics written with pistols with venomous points
I explode through the whole first step be murder on the sole of my kicks
Spittin while I'm holding my dick
In the, circle of squares
This area here
Is something you don't want to fuck around with

I got a little bit of, something for you, it's lyrical too
Get up in the, middle of you, like miracles do
Help you grow in your mental and your spiritual too
Help your hearing and your visual too
Tell 'em Jemini said it
I come to set it, break it down in phonetics
Dip it in egg whites and bread it
And serve it up hot
When I'm up in your spot
Like a tasty, pastry treat
I'm in the place to be

And copy gear quick to seen a rap cat with it
I'm about, fashion innovation

Jemini Smith they say you playin'
And you and I both know it's a shame I gotta lead
'cause others choose to follow
That's a hard pill to swallow for some
I ain't tryin' to be a role model
But some of y'all need to be spoon fed
Like babies to bottles
And maybe tomorrow you won't be so hollow

Army fatigue break up teams, the enemies
Look man, you want to see me locked up, shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin Bastard!
Cryin, know my friends is lyin'
Y'all know who killed 'em, filled 'em with the Lugers from they Rugers
Or they Desert, dyin' ain't the shit but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggaz bring the riot
Giving cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Shit, I need the company
Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like

Fuck the screw faces, when I flip

Call blacks moolies, think it's cool to smoke woolies
And fuck without rubbers (what) specialize

When Frank start bustin', Frank start somethin'
Killin ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley

Eatin' clams and mussels

Give her a package to push, 'cause I work dem hoes

Is it because I'm tan that you pull me over
My man, he gotta hustle cause he can't get a job
Slam the door in his face, because he caught a juvie case
It seems as if I got people tryin to pull me down
Red broads intimidatin insinuatin and hatin
I'm a young buck, keepin on a young tuck
Waitin for the next move, zippin up and lace shoes
And you niggaz tryin to get at me, uh-uh I never sweat B

I'd rather be sittin pretty than in a city like a bum
I roll with some killers, some real bug niggaz
And some real ill figures that ain't scared to pull the trigger
My homies all dead, in jail or doin life
While the honies give us his and we treat 'em like a wife
There's a whole lot of shootin, and executin
And the crew keeps gettin stronger cause we keep on recruitin

Why is Hennessy the only thing that warm my soul
Into the belly of the beast, I watch the hood cry

The world is so cold, yeah I can feel the breeze
Hatred is sacred, life's a dying disease
Livin to hustle, down to die for cheese
Just hustlin with muscle slugs are flyin with ease
Behind bars baby I seen the world is even colder
It seems like the weight of the world is on your shoulder

Death brings life and life brings crime
Dyin is easy, but lifes tend to stress me

Goodbye (Woo, and I would never ever say)
Bye bye (I gotta, I gotta)

Yo yo, who know the game like me, who seen it change like me
I'm the MC'n O.G. from the N.Y.C.
And I ain't never leave the streets, the ghetto made me conscious
And I've been doin' it since you rappin' cats was still in diapers
But it seems to me these cats are gettin' too big for their britches
And they're barkin' up the wrong tree, callin' my women bitches
I remember, when we used to rhyme in the park
But things have changed, now they bustin' shots after dark
Now that's a shame, these youngsters see me in the streets
Ask me O.G. how you do it make it seem like nothin' to it
Well I never lost a dream, the hustle's still inside of me
And never even departed me, this rap shit didn't father me
I gave birth to a lot of M-C's on this earth
But they're too blind to recognize the truth and it hurts
What would you do if I said goodbye and watched the game crumble
But believe me, they tease me, this rap shit needs me

I see you, Lil Mizzo
Tell you somethin', check it

Hey yo I never leave the game, how could I
When there's so much to accomplish than bein' broke and stuck in the projects
Come through in a green M-3, niggas dickridin'
Like ""Damn, how he do a song with D-M-C?""
Don't worry about it, just know I'm in the game now
He was such a cute kid, why he sellin' cocaine now
But struggling's past tense, I'm rappin' now, bought myself a house
With a swimming pool, backyard and a glass fence
There's no time for celebration, mind elevation
If you ain't searchin' for money what the hell are you chasin'?
Go against I-C-U I'll put this barrel to your back
You know who this is, Lil Mizzo and Darryl Mack
I been a man since I got in the hood, flow so much niggas get jealous
Like I can't stand when he drop his hood
How could you not respect Run-D.M.C.
For bein' the first rappers to get they hand prints in Hollywood
They deserve the respect of a legend, and I'm tryin' hard
I can be the best rapper in less than a second
I'm takin' over the industry, everybody knows us
I'm only 17 but my mind is all grown up, so whats up

[Chorus]

I would never leave the game my people love me too much
Because rap is my baby and I watched it grow up
Man I'm still here breathin', my eyes seein'
That these rapper cats deceivin', so don't believe 'em
They got the nerve to rap about cars and iced out jewels
Man you rented it from Jacob you ain't foolin' me or schoolin' D
On how to M-C, I be the pick of the litter
I've been in the game many years but I'll still spit a winner
Champ my people from the streets in Queens know I'm a hitter
Knockin' balls out the park, gettin' physically fitter
Don't duck too slow and don't jump too fast
I roll with young soldiers who put a foot in your ass
They be the new sensation, the next generation
Hollis Queens, Dirty Jersey, California situation
If I kiss the game goodbye, before I leave
I would go and fix some fake MC's, I'm signin' out D-M-C

Things ain't changed she still the same
Remember those things she used to do
Remember that song I sung to you
Remember that story I used to tell
About Mary cold buggin and +Raising Hell+
She's freaky as, as freaky gets
When it comes to chicks she's freakiest

They both are freaks then who's to blame?

This caused beef with Keith and Mick
Now who is she sleepin with?
It's a story that the tabloids got to get
All the rapper dudes, wanna hit it
All the actor dudes, wanna hit it
It's a well known fact but they won't admit it
When they knock them boots they all know who did it

She'll be the one you're always thinkin of

Might be a move you might regret
She's so fine, she's so hot
And if you want her she wants a lot
That's okay if you don't mind
One thing's for sure you'll have a good time
It's alright, it's okay
She don't want you anyway
It's alright, it's okay
You can get it but you got to pay
It's alright, it's okay

What's wrong with this world today (what's wrong with this world)

Check it out now
12 years old and I'm smokin on weed
I want a lot of stuff that I don't really need
14 years old and I'm drinkin on beer
What my parents gotta say I don't wanna hear
16 years old and I'm takin ecstasy
Girl next to me is gonna have sex with me
18 years old and I'm sniffin cocaine
Don't really care what it's doin to my brain

[singers]
Don't understand, why all the fuss
Why the grown-ups keep messin with us
I'm not gonna die just because I smoked dust
Smack me in the face just because I said a cuss
Treat 'em like kids, we should leave them alone
But they don't understand (I'm 12 and I'm grown)

[Chorus]

[Napolean]
At the age of 12 I was probably sellin weed
Seein the same things that DMC seen
Was a young cat that'd love to see you bleed
But what's goin on with this world tell me
Kids in the street eatin meals off the streets
Take me off the streets but can't stop the streets
At the age of 3 they got shot right in front of me
My moms and my daddy, shoulda never had me
16 years old my balls got swoll
Heart got cold and them glocks got load
Take it back to 15, pops was on the scene
Took me out the hood, showed me how to stack cream
Take it back to my breddern, age 11
Khadafi, the head brother, of Makaveli
Wasn't for you, the streets woulda failed me
Napolean, Outlaw, give 'em hell DMC

[Chorus]

[DMC]
Check it out
Today is the day that I bring a gun to school
The teacher dissed me and he played me for a fool
Tryin to play the role, tryin to be cool
Being {?} well I make the rules

[Napolean]
If I pull the trigger, I figure if he die
I say that I'm crazy, you know that's a lie

[DMC]
Just gotta act like I'm out of my mind
To be on the news, on the cover of Time

[Napolean]
Shoulda known I would do it, shoulda seen the signs
Been lovin guns ever since I was 9

[DMC] I played PlayStation
[Nap] And Nintendo too
[DMC] And love all the games

I know y'all niggas gon' feel this shit right here
(g.b.!)
We're goin through the same thing

[ verse 1: willie d ]
Weapons bein loaded and cocked, bodies drop
Ghetto niggas, they hang on the corner sellin rocks
Fuck the cops, they brutalize the poverty-stricken
Institutional racism prevalent in prisons
Quick decisions are made with precisions of blood-spill
Gotta make a mill, got a house on the hill
Protect my grill, and avoid gettin killed
Now if I land on the concrete with bloody pants
Lord please, give your homeboy a second chance
Baby need a new pair of shoes, and a college fund
My p.o. wanna know how I got a gun
I'm in the presence of my enemies like in the bible
Will I see heaven if I murder these fuckin rivals?
I'm havin nightmares of niggas' final cries
If I die today, will I be idolized?
I gives a fuck, if you dwell from the east to west
As long as you feel the south, nigga, you can bet
I got...

Lord, see me, to the last year, my islamic roots
Forgive me what I past did, hustlin for loot
Pass the casket, lookin at my friend in basket
Touch him with my lips, feelin like he blasted
I never seen a man cry
But my lifestyle is fear, sittin around watchin muthafuckas die
The faces of death
Who coulda predicted 2pac would be next?
Read ghetto text: if you live by the sword
Or speak about it too much, you gon' die by the sword
So think about it, do us an injustice, you know time flies
Life, I can't trust it, so I stay high
Six-time felony, no one can handle me
I'm constantly fuckin up my family
To the moms a casualty, I got love
But this a little gangsta shit, to my thugs

Called in this world to be a rider, so I'm ridin high

We in the game to run the whole thang
Return and leave from a to z

Don't fear, nigga, this is war in yo ear, nigga

We ain't gon' never stop doin this shit
I know them muthafuckas can't stand it
When them goddamn geto boys come hot
Cause we gotta represent niggas all over the muthafuckin world
We got geto boys all over the world
And that's why we always break shit down
To the muthafuckin smallest compound
Nigga, you fuck with us
You hoes'll get mugged, drugged
We ain't havin no muthafuckas down in the fuckin front row
Gettin kisses and hugs

Get em up, nigga, buck-buck, represent yo shit

Fuck with me, nigga, what's up talkin all that shit
Now we face to face, muthafucka, who you with?
Ain't nobody got your back now, you in trouble
Oh, he know how to act now, huh? we in double
Always sickin out and stomp out, nigga gettin nervous
And that stutterin in your voice, pal, that's gon' get your service
Ain't no muthafuckin game, nigga, disrespect

And till I die I gon' remain with these niggas.
St. Paul in
The M-P-L-S, I hear you callin'.
I put it down, yes.
Now, Chris Rock, where you at?
I heard you say some shit about some blacks,
Nigga, this been your ass back.
Come see the real deal.
Stay in the fields, nigga.
These niggas will kill.
This ain't no cap-gun shots, nigga.
This a glock, pah, pah.
It's death on your block,
Knock, knock.
Whut's up nigga?
These sirens start singing.
It's me and Yuk with the L-G in the makin'.
It's stinkin', freakin',
Bowlin' on the weekend.

Gimme stacks up on mo' stacks.
I'm double parked for the train.

It's in my blood. 
Smokin, sweets, drink forties to the suds,
And fuckin' wit' these thugs, nigga.
That's in my blood.
You wonder why us niggas be hustlers,
And out there slingin' drugs, nigga?
That's in my blood.
That drug money, stuff that shit up under the rug,
And make that nigga bug, nigga.
It's in my blood.
Niggas like me, turn niggas like you into hustlers.
Fucking with us, fucking wit us!

It's in my veins,
Like a chain-reaction.
How it all happened.
Paps is slangin' crack in the mid eighties,
Back in the day, when shit was crackin'.
Niggas pay thirty-eight for a package.
Tightly rappin',
For shippin' and handelin', taxes was added.
That's where the A-rap's headin'.
Even when I sleep, they in cavage,
Lavage shit.
Do automatics, with scopes, under my mattress,
With the dope and the drugmoney.
Stuffin' that shit up under the rug money.
Thug hungry.
Takin' drugs only 'cause we love money.
I'm a nigga, he's a nigga.
Would you like to be a nigga too?
Makin' big scrilla, like these niggas do.
You probably be a drugdealer too.
Scan and tuned, into the boys in blue.
Listen for clues.
In the kitchen, bakin' up Peruvian flake.
It takes twenty-eight grams,
Multiplied by thirty-six zips to make
A triple beam brake, a triple beam shake.
A hundred grams on the triple beam flake.
Two point two pounds, to be straight.
My niggas just flew in from G-A,
Ready to buy 4 kilos,
Then drive slow back to Youngstown, Ohio.
So fuck these rhymes.
Let me stick my dick in your ear,
And fuck with your mind,
Nigga.

[Chorus]

Niggas portray themselves as low key.
Broken down and fabricated,
Easily ejaculated, table with, and halfway faded.
Ain't no wars, 'cause they made it.
That type of bullshit is outdated.
But I played it like I laid it.
My partners have always said that.
It was set me up 
For life.
Money, clothes and hos, but road I chose was
Nothin' nice.
Niggas know just what it's like to be hustlers.
Governors from strugglers.
Bitches lovin' us.
Blindly chasin' that life we lust.
I blush.
Bottles, havin' thoughts and iring dreams.
Goin' down and roll fast.
Tryin' to get what my eyes have seen.
Fried of me, huh.
Nigga for a hand that got me through these eyes right to see.
But part not I was blind to the point,
Not even I could see, or that I could be,
Obviously.
I wasn't meant for me this type of trickery.
Hit me with the type of mystery.
Lay it down like history.
With the intent of me, myself, and I.
Street desire, easily.
Piece of mind, I was least to find.
Some sassiness.
Hossisiless, it gets to shit and praise to the farmer innercist.
Nobody was meant for it, it was deadly,
And I was discontent
With the shit that life once sent.
Government depend, now most of my time is spent
Escapin' what I love.
It's in my blood.

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Dmitry Baevsky,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,2010
DMP Big Band,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill like I had never known
You smiled, when you smiled at me that was how the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
I found my love at last",At Last,1996

You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag.

Shake their shoulders bold.

You're gonna brag 'bout the Bugle Call Rag.
Hold me baby; Let's syncopate to that blue melody;
Just hesitate while a break they take Shh!
While we're dancing please hold me tight; step lively don't lag.

DMP Big Band,"Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina
 
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'

Aiyo, ya niggaz must be outcha fuckin' mind,
Thinkin' dog can't pull another motherfuckin' rabbit out the hat.

Fuck is y'all niggaz...
Y'all niggaz just thinkin' I'm sittin' around doin' nothin'?
Oh my God, y'all niggaz can't be serious?

Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggaz actin up?  Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you gon' pull that.

Man, cats don't know what it's gonna be,
Fuckin' with a nigga like me, D-to-the-M-to-the-X.
Last I heard, y'all niggaz was havin sex, with the same sex.
I show no love, to homo thugs.
Empty out, reloaded, and throw more slugs.
How you gonna explain fuckin' a man?
Even if we squashed the beef, I ain't touchin' ya hand.
I don't buck with chumps, for those to been to jail.
That's the cat with the kool-aid on his lips, and pumps.
I don't fuck with niggaz that think they broads.
Only know how to be one way, that's the dog.
I know how to get down, know how to bite.
Bark very little, but I know how to fight.
I know how to chase a cat up in the tree,
Man, I give y'all niggaz the b'iness for fuckin' wit' me, is you crazy?

[Chorus]

Once a song, I come though, guns is drawn;
Blam, blam, lungs are gone, sons will mourn.
From dusk till dawn, nighttime belongs to the dog.
On the street, passed midnight, look for 'em in the morgue.
Don't play with these cats 'cause I ain't got nothin' to say to these cats.
For the mothers that really do love 'em, please pray for these cats.
'Cause I know niggaz is hardheaded, but I ain't got the patience.
Don't want me havin' no patience turn into more patience.
More trips to I-C-U, 'cause I see you
Tryna get away with shit a real nigga wouldn't do.
Where my dogs at? (Right here!) See them niggaz? (Right where?)
Get 'em boy! (Right there!) That's how we do... (Aiight then!)
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs;

Five CD's with mad rhymes.
Don't hit me with that positive shit, I know you lyin'.
You really wanna stop niggaz from dyin', stop niggaz from tryin'?
'Cause I ain't really got that time to waste,
And I thought I told you to get these fuckin' bums out my face.
Lookin' atchu in your grill, I might be nice to cut.
Once I split ya ass in two, you'll be twice as butt.
Yeah, you right, I know ya style - pussy, 'cause I'm fuckin' it.
Since we all right here, you hold my dick while he suckin' it.
Motherfucker, don't you know you'll never come near me?
Shove ya head up ya ass, have you seein' shit clearly.
Never heard that D be runnin', 'cause D be gunnin'.
I beat my dick, and bust off in ya eye, so you can see me cummin'.
Empty clips and shells are what I leave behind,
And if they get me with the joint, they hit me with a three-to-nine.

First you love life then wish you were dying
Bitch so fed up gave up trying
Kept it straight up but niggas kept lying
Ever seen something that you wanted so bad
And got it then wished it was something you never had
You ever been so lost than you thought you won't make it
If you ever been forced to do something you couldn't take it
You ever felt so strong or so loved
But when it came down it wasn't meant to be so hard
Wake yourself up like, where did I go wrong!?
Just get back up, pray on it and go on

Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there

Ever been through it then came outta there

Ever wanted to go right, then shows left
He down with a lift to way shows death
Burn in the night but everyday shows stress
Regardless of what you think I'm going in that
Have you ever wished upon a star that really wasn't there
Gaze so in your heart, but really didn't care
Stand out at the wrong turn and now life ain't fair
And all you can do is take it, like ye
Ever found out that the shit you was living with
Deeper, 'cause to me is tryin' to creep ya
Back your glock off put your ass in a sleeper

Had to be something that you didn't want to be
Had to kill a nigga that looked just like me
Wanted to believe to have a trust like me

I seen the day, I seen the night
I seen the wrong, I seen the right
I seen the start, I seen the final

DMX,"I come to you hungry and tired
You give me food and let me sleep
I come to you weak 
You give me strength and that's deep
You call me a sheep and lead me to green pastures
Only asking that I keep the focus in-between the chapters
You give me the word and only ask that I interpret
And give me the eyes that I may recognize the serpent
You know I ain't perfect,but you'd like me to try
Unlike the devil who just wants me to lie
'Til I die
Lord why is it that,I go through so much pain
All I saw was black,all I felt was rain
I come to you because its you who knows
You showed me that everything was black because my eyes were closed
You gave me the light and let me bask in your glory
So it was only right that when you ask for this story
I put it together to do our dogs some good
Our dogs being,brothers and sisters in the hood
Plenty of times you sent help my way,but I hid
And I remember once you held me close,but I slid
There was something that I just had to see
That you wanted me to see so I can be what you wanted me to be
And I think I've seen it,but I don't feel the same
Matter of fact I know I've seen it,I can feel the change
And it's strange almost got me beating down your door
But I have never known a love like this before
It's a wonderful feeling to get away from the pain
And up under the ceiling I get away from the rain
And the strain that I feel when I'm here is gone
I know real so I wipe away the tears with a song
And I almost lost faith when you took my man Monty, Paso, and Jay's brother Dan
And I fear that what I'm saying won't be heard until I'm gone
But it's all good,cause I really didn't expect to live long
So if it takes for me to suffer,for my brother to see the light
Give me pain till I die,but please Lord treat him right",Prayer,

If you had twenty four hours to live, what would you do?  
That's some deep shit right there, a lot of pressure
How would you handle it?
Mase, what would you do?

Yo, I'd turn out all the hoes that's heterosexual
Smack conceited niggas right off the pedestal
I'd even look for my dad that I never knew
And show him how I look in my Beretta, too
I'd do good shit like take kids from the ghetto
Show them what they could have if they never settle
Take every white kid from high class level
Show 'em what Christmas like growin' up in the ghetto
Teach niggas how to spend, stack the rest
Give blunts to the niggas under massive stress
Give every bum on the street cash to invest
And hope Harlem will blow up be my last request

Yo, yo if I had twenty four hours to kick the bucket, fuck it
I'd probably eat some fried chicken and drink a Nantucket
Then go get a jar from Branson
And make sure I leave my mother the money to take care of grandson
Load the three power, hop in the Eddie Bauer
And go give all six to that papi that sold me flour
Get a fresh baldy, make a few calls
Shop at the mall, shoot a lil' ball
Have all of my bitches on one telly at the same time
Spread it out on different floors
And I'm gon' play lotto, for what?
Even though I ain't gon' be here tomorrow, so what

You know when I was close to the ledge
I'd probably be in the wedge
With this bare spanish mami playin' 'tween my legs
Then I'm off to get choke and smoke one a them dreads
And get that bitch from '89 that gave us up to the feds
Thought of momma, wrote her a note, we ain't close
I hate her boyfriend so I put one in his throat
Fuck around and sniff an ounce of raw, bust the four
Fours, pull out my dick and take a piss on the floor
Jump in the whip, git them cats I wanted to git
Since the Tavern on the Green robbery in eighty-six
Went home took a shower in nice cold water
And spent my last hours wit my son and my daughter

If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?

If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?

What hey yo, if I had twenty four nigga gotta get the raw
Run all them papi's spot, put one in his head at the door
For the times that I paid for twenty an he gave me twelve
The other eight had to be baking soda by itself
So papi fuck you, you dead now, I'm off to the bank
With those bricks in a bookbag and a stolen Jag I just grabbed
Went in there grabbed the bank teller wit the pretty face
Fuck her in the safe, and have her take me to my place
We'll make a kid but that's selfish and that'll be bad
For my son to have the same shit his pops just had
And when I'm down to twenty three, I'm a be strapped wit TNT
Run up in city hall and take the judges wit me

If I had twenty four hours to live, I'd probably die on the fifth
Run in the station squeezin the inf'
I'll be waitin' to get to hell and bust down Satan
Styles' on this shit and I got spot vacant
Back to the twenty four I make it out the precinct
Shootin niggas that I hate in they face while they eatin'
I'm on the job robbin' every so-called Don
Give the money to my moms and tell her that I'm gone
I would school my little brother that niggas mean him harm
He should learn to tell the future without readin' palms
When they come in with the bullets, you prepared with the bomb
So fuck bein' violent get stocks and bonds

Twenty four left until my death
So I'm gon' waste alot of lives, but I'll cherish every breath
I know exactly where I'm goin', but I'mma send you there first
And with the shit that I'll be doin', I'mma send you there worse
I've been livin' with a curse, and now it's all about to end
But before I go, say hello to my little friend
But I gots to make it right, reconcile with my mother
Try to explain to my son, tell my girl I love her
C-4 up under the coat, snatch up my dog
Turn like three buildings on Wall Street, into a fog
Out with a bang, you will remember my name
I wanted to live forever, but this wasn't fame

If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go?
What would you do?
Who would you screw?
And who would you wanna notify?
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die?

Watch your mouth, better yet hold your tongue

Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces

And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like pickin' up a ball, playin' with Mike
Swingin' at Ken Griffey or challengin' Roy to a fight
Snappin', you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin' overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin' a tiger cub to his knees 
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't want to borrow that, you want to idolize
And you don't want to make me mad nigga, you want to socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name

Third eye watchin' you, watchin' me
Throwin' rocks from the penalty box, cop a plea
Young g we was born to die, don't cry for me
Just keep the heat closely and ride for me
'Cause we family for better or worse, you and I
From the dirt, you snatch purse, so hard it hurt
To be here, and each year, I'm pourin' out more beer

Shorty snot-nosed, he don't floss but he got dough
Thug faces, fugitives runnin' from court cases

Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And God'll throw a beam of lightning down 'cause he feel us
May the next one, strike me down if I'm not the realest

But, dawgs are friends, if one see the morgue, one'll live
To get revenge, and we ride to the end
Bravehearts blow the lye with Henn, and still rise
Took alive with live men, my man got three-six to eighteen
And only five in, the belly of the beast
Didn't want to hear the shit I tried to tell him on the streets
It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat

Love, a slug, which one am I gonna get first?
My journey's been a rough one, I'm not sure when it begins
But the way it's looking, I kind of know when it's gonna end (what, love)
Hold me down baby, it's gonna be a rough ride
Niggas give us plenty of room, 'cause I guess enough died
Let me travel, 'cause my intentions are to travel in peace
Fuck around I lay you down, you hit the gravel and cease
I could be a beast, or I could be a gentleman
But if you ain't my dog, you gonna be like 'Oh, it's him again'

I will spend mad time in one spot, plotting my next move
Trying to figure out what is it, that X do what X do
Some questions go unanswered, that's what I'm afraid of
Sometimes I can't show, but I know what I'm made of
They made love, or should I say they made lust
Bound, there didn't have to be love there, but they made us
I got quite a few sisters, I was the only boy
But being with my dog, was my only joy
Like a kid with a new toy, I forgot about the grind
Escaped the misery, didn't think about the crime
Lost all track of time, was in another world
Everybody knew Earl, but there was another Earl
Lighter side of the dark, riding the park but wouldn't want to
Stayed far, but when they jump me, became a good runner
One by one they all went under, so I had the last laugh
They all thought it all was a joke, but I had the last laugh

If I don't know where I'm coming from
Do you know, do you know
Where would I go?

I feel the ghost from within, coming back to haunt me
Stay love in my peoples, even though they don't want me
When I was bad, I was forgotten, like I was dead and rotten
Should've been getting love, but instead was plotting
Shit wasn't right, and it was all blamed on me
Didn't know that I was special 'til this rap shit came to be
Gave me a way out, showed me it was better to teach
Than bust niggas with the fo-fo, leave them dead in the streets
Over beef that was worth less, than the cost of the slugs
That I bought to kill them
And that's because I thought I ought to kill them
Little did I know, death wasn't right
Didn't always show every breath was a life
It was to be captured in suspended animation
To be felt by all, understood by every nation
What's the sense of hating, when I can show love
What's the sense of faking, when I can show blood

Now what's the moral to this story?

Come on!

I will not abuse it nor will I lead them astray

I'm really tryna win, so where do we start?

Group homes and institutions, prepared my ass for jail
They put me in a situation forcing me to be a man
When I was just learning to stand without a helping hand
Damn, was it my fault, something I did
To make a father leave his first kid at seven doin my first bid
Back on the scene at fourteen with a scheme
To get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream
And by all means I will be living high off the hog
And I never gave a fuck about much but my dog
That's my only muthafucka I had offered my last
Just another little nigga headed nowhere fast

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

That ain't the half shit get's worse as I get older
Actions become bolder, heart got colder
Chip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch
Didn't need a clique 'cause I scared a nigga that much
One deep with the pit starting shit for kicks
Catching Vicks throwing bricks gettin by being slick
Used to get high to get by used to have to puff my L
In the morning before I get fly
Ate something a couple of forties made me hate something
I did some coke now I'm ready to take something
Three years later showing signs of stress
Didn't keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed
I'm possessed by the darker side living the cruddy life
Shit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife
Wanna make records but I'm fucking it up
I'm slippin', I'm falling, I can't get up

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Wasn't long before I hit rock bottom
Niggas talking shit was like damn look how that rock got him
Open like a window
No more endo
Look at a video
Sayin' to myself that could've been yo
Ass on the TV
Believe me, it could be done
Something's got to give
Gots to change 'cause I've got a son
I gots to do the right thing for shorty
And that means no more gettin' high, drinkin' 40s
So I get back looking type slick again
Fake niggas jump back on my dick again
Nothing but love for those that know how it feel
And much respect to all my niggas that kept it real
Kept a nigga strong, kept a nigga from doing wrong
Niggas know who they is and this is yo fucking song
And to my boo who stuck with a nigga through
All the bullshit you'll get yours because it's due

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up

Too late to send my girl downstairs to say he left
Hit the basement, go through the replacement door
Come up in my neighbor's yard, with a taste for war
You know I laced the four, with the hollows
Crack the safe, grab the bottles (What you want me to do?) Beep Carlos
Two houses over by the tall black fence
I keep the hooptie parked for situations like this
There go Grease, ""Yo, get in! You drive""
""What the fuck you doing nigga?"" ""Tryin' to stay alive""
Cops on every corner, I lean back and try to cruise by
Who the fuck could'a snitched? Must have been a new guy
Damn, they back on our ass
Put your foot back on the gas, step on it fast
Trying to pull up on the side, but I'm packing to blast
Trying to take the niggas heads off, fuck cracking the glass
Hey, look out, damn, came so close
You almost hit that bitch (Like you said nigga, almost)
Shit, the cops hit her, and I know they ain't gon' leave her
Go up here, make this left, pull it over, take a breather
""Drop it on the floor""
Boom, got it through the door
Pedal to the floor, leave officers flyin'
Death is in the air, and I don't know if it's mine
But I know if it's time, it'll be what it is
And all I can think of is what about my kids
Shit, they on the corner, hit the sidewalk, quick
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 more clips
Hit the fire hydrant, get low for the shootout

Boom, boom, boom, open the door, ATF",ATF,1998
DMX,"You tell me that there's love here
But to me it's blatant
Nothin' but all the blood here
I'm dealin' with Satan
Plus with all the hate
It's hard to keep peace (Uh huh)

Thou shall not steal,
But I will to eat
I tried doin' good, but
Good's not too good for me
Misunderstood,
Why you chose the hood for me
Mean I'm aight,
I just had to work hard at it

Went to grandma for the answer,
She told me that God had it
So now here I am,
Confused and full of questions
Am I born to lose
Or is this just a lesson

And who it's goin' choose
When it gets turned around
And will it be
Layin' in my own blood
And on the ground

My child,
I watched you grow up
And I've been there (Uh huh)
Even at those times
You least suspected it I was there

And look at what I've given you
A talent to rhyme
I may not come when you call,
But I'm always on time

Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in
Lord we're just startin',
But where will it end
Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in
Lord we're just startin',
But where will it end

But when the funds are low
The guns will blow
Lookin' for that one that owe,
Make 'em run that dough

No!
Put down the guns and write a new rhyme
You'll get it all in due time
You'll do fine
Just have faith
'Cause you mine (Uh huh)

And when you shine
It's gon' be a sight to behold.
So don't fight to be old,
Or lose sight when it's cold
See that light down the road,
It's goin' guide you there
Two sets of footsteps,
I was right beside you there

But what about them times
I only saw one
Those were the times that I was under the gun,

It was then I carried you my son
Led you to safety
It just wasn't your time to face me (Uh huh)

Ah-yo a few of them times I thought you would erase me
But all you did was embrace me
Prepared me for the worst
Offered me eternal light,
And scared me with the hearse

And the curse
Turned to grace
When the hurt, turned to faith
No more runnin', (Uh huh)
Slidin' in the dirt
'Cause I'm safe

Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in
Lord we're just startin,
But where will it end
Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in

So if I'm yo' man
I'm in yo' hands
What's yo' plan?
Never had a friend
'Cause you couldn't trust your man
Learned to stand before I crawled
Things were twisted!

And if you showed me anything at all
Then I missed it
Looked the wrong way (Uh huh)
I've done some wrong things (True)
Kept a bad attitude,
But that's what wrong brings

And now you mean to tell me that
After all this time,
It was you that kept the dog from goin' out of his mind.
It was you that breathed life
Into my lungs when I was born

And it was you that let me know
What was right,
From what was wrong
And it was you that let me do
What I knew what could be done

And it was you that gave me a good wife
And a beautiful son
And it's been you speakin' to me
Inside my mind
And it's been you who has forgiven
Time after time

It was you who opened my eyes
So I could see
It was you who shined yo'
Light on me",The Convo,1998
DMX,"Who is this I see, coming through, it's like 3 on the a.m
I'ma rob this nigga, and when I'm done, I'ma slay him
For being stupid like, comin' through after 1 or 2
And havin' a gun that he couldn't get to, yeah, that one'll do
Foolish niggas learn the hard way, then I teach 'em
Be in the wrong place at the wrong time, then I reach 'em
Like Jigga said, ""Niggas test you when your gun goes warm""
So I keep 'em scattering like roaches, when the light come on
From night 'til dawn, right from wrong, hold no weight
3-57 slugs with a snub nose, trey eight
Settin' all them issues straight, squashing all beefs
To the point where the police was lockin' all streets
They got me trapped off in the building, but you know how that go
I stay fucking with the hood rats, I run up in the rat hole
Run through the hallway, see police, face to face
And being I'm telling you this story, means I caught another case

It's either you or me
And more than likely, it's gonna be you, than me
Aiight? Feel me yo

Day 2 of the saga, this fucking drama continues
Waking up like every 2 hours, looking out my window
Plus I keep the 4-4 pointed at the door just in case
When they bust in, I bust them and I'm gunning for the face
""What a waste of potential"" is what my teachers used to tell me
""You can always get a job"" and peep shit they tried to sell me
Got me no where but broke and fucked up in the game
But now I got a name, and niggas know my name
Knock of the door ""Police! We're looking for a man,
Who killed a couple of cops last night and the reward is ten grand""
I play like a bitch ""Its just me here, and I'm not dressed
And that guy sounds kind of dangerous, I hope you make an arrest""
It was a close one, now I know I gotta get outta the city
'Cause I know I'm hotter than lava, I'll holla tomorrow
Hit my dog on the horn, he like ""Fuck, you done did?!
They done ran up in my crib, nigga, patting down my kid!""

Put the harness on the dog, load up the weapons
Murder's on my mind, no half steppin'
Motherfuckers want war, you can get it,
'Cause I'm tired of runnin', remember me as the nigga that died gunnin'
Kamikaze mission, C-4 strapped to the chest
Run up in that joint, raw dog, fuck the vest
They can keep theirs, because it won't be the slugs that'll kill 'em
It'll be the raw, or the C-4 as I'm bringin' down the building
When I go, taking a bunch of the motherfuckers with me
I ain't sitting around waiting for them fagot niggas to come and get me
I bring it to 'em, service with a smile
What nigga? Didn't know a dog with rabies was in the cut, nigga?
Now that you finally findin' out what this shit means

For the love they always will be till they kill me

And to my motherfucking dogs big ups to your first share
Niggas know the deal just waiting for them plaques to get shipped

My people show love (What!) and haven't left me stranded yet
Though I have a death wish that ain't been granted yet
So until then I'm gonna be that nigga all up in your chest (Come on!)
Until the Lord decides to lay my ass down to rest
Bless my body at the funeral and hope I don't burn
Was a hard headed nigga and nope I don't learn
Saw the truth but chose to ignore it, wasn't going for it
Well a nigga had to give it to me, then I saw it
This is clear as day I know here's the day
I'mma be on my way nothing more to say
But take me Lord, make me Lord what you will
Really wanted to chill but learned how to kill

Your worst nightmare 'cause I take it right there
You got niggas coming? Where they at? Right where?
I make 'em like air, floating away
Wouldn't tell what he was thinking so I opened a way
Left him broken away, you know he hurt before he died
Makes you wonder if he lost his shirt before he died
Only two knew the answer and one of us is dead
So anyone who seeks the truth can get it straight to head
Then you and him can discuss what I did
Yeah it was wrong, dawg, but I slid

Wanna hit the malls with the same dogs I rob with
Wanna be able to laugh with the niggas that I cried with
When it's over be like these is the niggas that I died with
What do you do when you find out in the hall there's a rat?
What do you do when you find out that your dog is a cat?

When niggas hear that dog bark, they better run
When police hear that dog bark, they better come
They expect to save their lives, but they lives will be lost
There is a price to pay, how many lives will it cost? (Come on)
Since I run with the devil, I am one with the devil
And I stay doing dirt so I'm a come with the shovel
Is you on a level of a madman whose mind's twisted?
Mad niggas dreams caught the last train, mine's missed it
Listed as a manic-depressive with extreme paranoia
And dog, I got something for ya
Hear my name, feel my pain
Niggas wanna steal my fame, but first, feel my reign

Niggas is wonderin' how the fuck you hid your skirt
Right under they eyes, now it's surprise to the guys

When it was hunger that stopped the nigga from goin' under
And you wonder, why I pat you on your head, smile
Look in your eyes and thank the lord for my child
Meanwhile, somethin' I gotta show you an I hope you can take it
Gotta leave you in the desert, and I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on your ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up an see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other niggas would put a slug through you, over your heads
Cats I fucked with are real, but hey, those are your friends
Its just what you got comin' sometimes you don't know
What you askin' for, did you ask for more?
Shut the casket door, this one here, it is done
And thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run

Takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams

Easy goin', up or down what have you been provin'?
Just that you a fuckin' clown
Bitch seen through the bullshit, but never spoke on it
'Cause I know that deep down you really don't want it
I would of traded the chance of bein' the child with a father
Movin' talent and bein' able to survive when it's harder

The growlin', and prowlin'

Rap artist and I'ma start this
Shit up for real, get up and feel, my words
I make herbs split up and squeal
Ill, is all I've been hearing lately
Niggas hate me, wanna duck tape me and make me
Put their brains on the wall, when I brawl
Too late for that 911 call
Niggas stay beefing but a lot of them bluffing
But not me because I'ma nigga that can get out of them cuffs
You think a lot of them tough? That's just a front
When I hit them niggas like 'What you want?'
The battle turns into a hunt
With the dog right behind niggas chasing 'em down

But I'm tasting it now
And never give a dog blood, 'cause raw blood will have a dog bite
Biting whatever, all up in ya gut

Ten niggas on him, hope God's with him
Give me the bat, let me split him
I'll have 'em where the pillow and the casket won't fit him
Only reason I did him, he wouldn't fight back, strike back
Left him like that, laying up with the white hat
Getting right back at ya when I snatch ya
Up out the grave, nothing but bones and ashes
Hitting niggas with gashes to the head
Straight to the white meat but the street stay red
But this girl gave me head for free
'Cause they see, who I'ma be by like 2003
That nigga D took it there
He thought it was a joke
He ran through like 20 G's, thought that I was broke, stupid
That's what you get for thinking and eventually
Found that's what you get for stinking

'Cause why? And you don't know you slow like Baltimore
If you ain't trying to go, you blow
I soak up all the pain and accept it in silence
When I let go it's violence 'cause the wildest
Leaves the dog barking up the tree for the cat

Shall I go on
You don't want no real, what the deal is a mystery
How is it I can live and make history
If you don't see it, then it wasn't meant for you to see
If you wasn't born wit' it, then it wasn't meant for you to be
But you can't blame me for not wantin' to be hound
Lock down in a cell wit' a soul gettin' dwelled
This is hell, go get the devil and get me the key
But can't be worst than the curse that was given to me
It's what I live for, you take away that and I'm gone

I'm a flow regardless because I'm an artist until I'm trapped
I'ma continue to hit he hardest whether I scrap or rap
Give me death but you ain't my friend
I see it in your eyes, you contemplate my end
You waitin' for that bend in the road, where you were told
That you would go, when you were old
And if you died young, it was cold
So what the dilly, what it was worth
Think back 26 years, be like what of his birth
Was a miscarriage and I never existed
Have I given something that if taken away, you'd of missed it?
Didn't know, did I persisted?
It was the call of the wild
I really say what's in my heart, and you call it a style
Don't put it in the cage, don't mistreat it
You say you hunger for knowledge, here it is, eat it
Another song completed is another thought captured
Let me do my thing I got it locked wit' this rap shit

Either let me fly, or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'mma die anyway, I'mma live on
But I'll be gone any day

You bring your crew and 'em and I'm doing 'em
Then I'm beating 'em down with aluminum
Then I'm putting two in 'em

I'm making niggas blow trial even if they not guilty

I want a palace for my thugs, with oriental rugs
Green backs from drugs, get whacked for the love
Twenty niggas batter me, still couldn't shatter me
I'm only getting up, splitting up your anatomy
Official lock family, grants niggas handing me
I want the finer things, and I hope you understanding me
Sitting at the table, planning and plug the fan in
Let the sweat dry off and then grab your cannon

And if rap was hockey, I be Gretzky, puffin Nestle

Acting invincible like you God or something
If you God, then I'mma makes a lot 'til you rot
And if you a player, then play for everything you got

Following traces of gun powder, residue and blood

John Doe is what they gon' be putting on that tag on yo' toe

And if I don't know you, I don't fuck with you
And if you with my man, then he getting stuck with you
And gave it the money

I come to you weak, you give me strength, and that's deep 
Called me a sheep, and lead me to green pastures 
Only askin' that I keep the focus in between the chapters
You give me the word and only ask that I interpret
And give me the eyes that I may recognize the serpent 
You know I ain't perfect, but you'd like me to try 
Unlike the devil who just wants me to lie till I die 
Lord, why is it that I go through so much pain? 
All I saw was black, all I felt was rain
I come to you because it's you who knows 
Showed me that everything was black because my eyes were closed 
You gave me the light and let me bask in your glory 
So it was only right that when you ask for this story 
I put it together to do our dogs some good 
Our dogs being brothers and sisters of the hood 
Plenty of times you should help my way, but I hid 
And I remember once you held me close, but I slid 
It was somethin' that I just had to see 
That you wanted me to see so I could be what you wanted me to be 
And I think I've seen it 'cause I don't feel the same 
Matter of fact I know I've seen it, I can feel the change 
It's strange, but it's got me beatin' down your door 
But I've never known love like this before
It's a wonderful feelin' to get away from the pain 
And up under the ceiling I get away from the rain 
And the strain that I feel when I'm here is gone 
I know real, so I wipe away the tear, it's on 
And I almost lost faith when you took my man 
Monte, Paso, and Jay's brother Dan 
And I fear that what I'm sayin' won't be heard until I'm gone 
But it's all good 'cause I really didn't expect to live long 
So if it takes for me to suffer for my brother to see the light

All nightmares, the light dares to desert me
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me
Paranoid, so I strike out at whatever
The closest thing to me is gonna get it, but, never
Will I, can I think death is wrong
So I'ma keep holding, on 'til, what's left is gone
You could put that on my nigga Boom

I thank the Lord everyday that I'm blessed with the gift
I'm the best, so, unless you wanna rest with the stiff
Don't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone
When you walk pass the doghouse, leave it a bone
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife
Scratch, shake, and hold all night
So when you hear the arf arf, start running
'Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm coming
But I don't like drama, so I stay to myself
Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth
I want the money and give me the honeys with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses
I'm broke so I'ma bash his head wide open
Begging me to stop but at least he died hopin'
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish for the pack
Two glowing red eyes, everything else is black

When the sun is up, the gun is up on the shelf
And all the runners up are thanking me for their help
Hoping that they not around when it gets dark outside
Sun's going down you hear the bark outside
Locks off the cage, gauge, with the buck shots
Faggot, you've been lucky all day that's when your luck stops
One drops, and another and another
Gun pops, going through you, hit your mother
When does it all end? I found a friend in a dog
'Cause fucking with these cats will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions, no answers, stress
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed
With the curse and it gets worse as time goes by
Can't see straight cause I'm so high
Why ask why when you know?
Nigga, when its your time to go, you go

Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

Burning in hell, but don't deserve to be
Got niggas I don't even know that wanna murder me
Just because they've heard of me
And they know that the Dark is for real
The bark is for real, when you see that spark it'll kill
Be popping, robbing and chill, take it over there bark wit' it
From YO to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit' it
Come through flying, up 129
Up the school street 'cause I come through mine
Bark at my dogs, get at me nigga
Get at me nigga
What the deal is, never forget what real is
The cats that used to say X is the best know he still is
Can't help but feel this, putting goosebumps on your arms
Take you there if you want but I lose chunks with the bomb
The calm before the storm
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and it's getting warm
Feel me yo

Look thru my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

Look thru my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

I can understand why y'all niggas is scared of me
And why the big dogs never wanted to play fair with me
'Cause I leave blood wherever I go, wherever I flow
Wherever I blow niggas who know I can go, feel me yo
What is it about the Dark that gets niggas where they about to spark
About to bark, take it to the heart 'cause it's real like that
Give him chills, but do I make him feel like that
Shit is real, what you don't know is gon' get ya
With the steel, what you don't know is gon' split ya
I can blaze tracks, make niggas play rats and raise stacks
Payback's a bitch, didn't you used to say that?
Play around in dirt, you get mud
'Cause you know, I can either spread love or shed blood
And bloodshed turns the mud red and real sticky
Or I can hit you from roof, make it a quicky
For real

Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

I bear my soul, niggas wouldn't dare, my role
Give to nigga a heart of gold but with a hole
Lost all control, my shoulders hold a lot of weight
Just like first I'm sold an eight, then told it's not an eight
But then it's out of state, and it's too late for changes to be made
That's what I get for fucking with strangers in the shade
This is it, y'all niggas got to give me a plate
For the same reason that fate, chose to give me the way
Take away hate, now I'm supposed to love the one that cursed me
The one that wouldn't give me a cup of water when I was thirsty
It was always him versus me, but now I gotta teach him
Personal feelings put aside, 'cause now I gotta reach him
What I'd like to do is turn my head, like I don't know him
But it seems like I've been called on to show him
So I'ma show him
And if you never met me, then you've no right to judge me
I've got a good heart but this heart can get ugly

Look thru my eyes, see what I see
Do as I do, be what I be
Walk in my shoes, hurt your feet
Then know why I do dirt in the street

Look thru my eyes, see what I see

DMX,"Shut 'em down

Yo shut 'em down start the violence
We wilin' wilin' sling back his body found
Washed up on Coney Island
When I rolled up  this niggas heart slowed up
That killa froze up, when I pulled up jumped out with the pump-pump
Thirty-two shots and ducked out
So look out
Left that cat for dead his body smoked out
Cause when I fall y'all killas a kill me kid
I'm goin' all out
Lifes a bitch, fuck it, got the gun bust it
Game play, gotta play by the rules or your own cannot be trusted
Don't try to test, abide your chest, put five inside your vest
Have you layin' with a dead rest
Shoulda known when you was lookin' in the eyes a death
And I swore forgiveness when I did this
There was not no witness but he should understand
Cause even God got a shit list

Beat downs anonymous
I spit like a shiny silver nanabus
Niggas fond of us
We the kind that rush, those that hold back
Takin' your whole stack
Grimy street cats
Niggas bald head like Kojak
Go gat for gat
Coat that
You could smoke that
Or cut black dust
Makin' your whole fuckin' stove crack
Betta know me
1-3, one and only could be never phoney in any ceremony
I'll tear you homey
Shut 'em down
Shun sees takin' your time
Makin' your mind
Got this nigga on the low
Defecatin' with rhymes
Breakin' your spine
Got you movin' from the flurry, time to worry
I'm a bury the bullshit
Feel my full clip

Shut 'em down

Hey yo I bet you this motherfuckin' double barrel will blast his face
Be on the look out for a basket case
Niggas pumped you up to watch you get beat
Had you thinkin' shits sweet
Now you up shit's creek
Cause your shits weak
How mich is your life worth to someone important
Cause I be extortin'
Kidnap for ransom is some shit you don't want to get caught in
From back in the days of Gordon
Niggas was gettin' robbed
The guy from Rikers Height stayed on his job
With his own little mob
Was it worth goin' back to the Earth so soon
Worth makin' my shit go boom
To your own doom, from the graveyards
Till there's no room
Fuck you know about a pine box
Money goin' out with nine Glocks
On top of that same nigga when they pull with they nine shots
Feel like killin' for your crew
I ain't gon' rest
It gonna take a whole lot to put up your best
Then watch your loins spill out your vest
You best get on some act your age shit
You a little kid
That run for faces
More niggas get killed like that

Mad man Sticky F-I-N-G-A-Z
The crazy cajun blazin' bullets for days and days
Grazin' amazin' I'm the glazin' ason purple hazin'
Hard to be pahsin' Lord with all this hell I'm raisin'
God of the Underground, I'm gunnin' 'em down with a thunder pound
We gonna shut 'em down
We turn shit dumb quick gun click
Lyin' in the vine
Pursed the line on your dick
In the morgue admit it dogs
I'm the Rottweiler my Glock holler
Fuck cocaine killer I sniff gun powder
So all you real willies throw your Roleys in the sky
And all the crooks rob the place outside

Don't know what we goin' through
I'm a have to show niggas
How easily we blow niggas
When you find out there's some more niggas
That's runnin' with your niggas
Nothin' we can't handle

And he'll find his way home
Home of the brave
My home is a cage

You never really wanted it, so the mic you jumped in front of it
Outta sixteen shots I'ma hit, which one of you niggaz am I gonna get
Thought you knew what I was gonna spit, this time with this rhyme
but by the end of it, y'all niggaz is gon' be like, ""Yo X ripped it!""

Them cats can't be for real, I got this shit locked!

Cause the only thing that he'll be dropping is you

Drop it to Clue and the response from the street

If it ain't on your hip, then you're lookin' to die 
I ain't tryin' to be the nigga that's gonna look at the sky 
Ask God why I'm broke, bitch, I'm cooking the pie 
We all gon' die, sooner or later, matter of time 
My niggas sell crack, with a package of dimes 
Hundred or more, in front of the store, waitin' to bubble 
Brand new nine, and an eight in a bubble 
I put sixteen above ya neck, I love my set 
Niggas think they a thug, then thug to death (uh-huh)

You think your shit butter? Hop in front of this toast 

Aiyyo, aiyyo 
I say what I want, fuck what y'all think is cool 
And I hate cops, 'cause most y'all was dicks in school 
No pussy gettin' niggas tryin' to cuff the God 
Play Sheek out in the yard, but that shit too hard 
My dough too long, nowadays, my flow too strong 
What y'all make in a year, I kick that for a song 
Check my car, I don't care, I don't play fair 
Keep some shit in the stash box, then get me the chair 
And it don't buck shot and the blast is hard to hear 
I'm a true thug nigga, bring it straight to your crew 
Small yell when I rap, I'm basically talkin' to you 
You see the pain in my eye? Nigga, the flame in my eye? 
I'm tryin to leave my kids some real fuckin change when I die 
From rappin' or tellin' some cat to reach for the sky 
I'm that hunt down nigga, with the four pound nigga 
Bounty hunt your whole crew 'til my bullets go through, what? 

All I need is a big gun and a coupe that's crazy quick 
A nice house with five rooms, maybe six 
A town where money is coming, eighty bricks 
Break 'em down to all twenties, is a crazy flip 
Bet you never even felt the heat 
'Til I put the M1 next to your waves and melt the grease 
Streets help niggas, niggas don't help the streets 
Y'all use beats for help, we help the beats 
Who want it with me? Who want it with Sheek? Who want it with P?

Creep through the streets 
For some of y'all rappers, that's mighty hard 
Me the security? Protectin' my body? I let my shotty guard 
Put chill pills in brains, bullets like Tylenol 
Make niggas drowsy from the blood loss, got 'em noddin' off 
And take casket naps, fuck that 
You shoulda never let this bastard rap 
All I know is cold winter, hot slugs through your snorkel 
No parents, tale from my horror's no morals 
Raised in the wrong era, with no guidance 
So you dyin'? It's no problem, no lyin '
Drag's fire, so ya hamburger beef? I french-fry 'em 
Drag done ate your food 
Like I know to raise your dukes so guard your chin up 
Drag barrels, but shit, I spit-bubble your skin up 
Drag scorch niggas for dinner but season 'em well 
I don't brag I let the streets tell 
Po'-po' now you see he fell 

And you motherfuckers know what my name means when you hear it in the streets (uh) 
Y'all bitches fear it 'cause you weak 
You want to hear it? I make it speak (What?) 
You ain't ever bust a gun, but there's a lot of greasy talkin' (uh-huh) 
What the science behind that son? (I don't know) 
A lot of easy walkin'
I bust shit down (uh) got down (uh) kick down (uh) shot down (uh) 
Ain't tryin' to talk about what I got now, but I got now (What?) 
I ain't never sold a brick, I done stuck niggas up (c'mon) 
And for talkin too much shit? I done fucked niggas up (uh) 
It can get ""Dark"" for real, and I think you already know that (uh-huh) 
Well think about it with the brick in your hand before you throw that 
Now don't act, 'cause actin' might get you rollin '
If you ain't ready to handle (Uhh)

DMX,"Let us pray
Lord Jesus it is you, who wakes me up every day
And I am forever grateful for your love
This is why I pray
You let me touch so many people, and it's all for the good
I influenced so many children, I never thought that I would
And I couldn't take credit for the love they get
Because it all comes from you Lord
I'm just the one that's givin' it
And when it seems like the pressure gets to be too much
I take time out and pray, and ask that you be my crutch
Lord I am not perfect by a long shot, I confess to you daily
But I work harder everyday, and I hope that you hear me
In my heart I mean well, but if you'll help me to grow
Then what I have in my heart, will begin to show
And when I get goin', I'm not lookin' back for nothin'
'Cause I will know where I'm headed, 'cause I'm so tired of the sufferin'
I stand before you, a weakened version of, your reflection
Beggin' for direction, for my soul needs resurrection
I don't deserve what you've given me, but you never took it from me
Because I am grateful, and I use it, and I do not, worship money
If what you want from me is to bring your children to you
My regret is only having one life to do it, instead of two

You a killer or a hustler, dealer or customer
Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga
A weed head, a coke sniffer
You rich or a broke nigga
Know you all relate to this shit that I wrote niggas
Lots of my mans trapped up in a max
Penitentiary, sending me letters I answer back
That eventually, we all be Bentley'd out
Throwing campaigns, fuck it I'm running for White House
My niggas control Senate, pipe seats jeeps tinted
Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day
So I'm on point, scrap, prepare for gunplay
Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar
Ready to blast, nigga gave me daps said I feel ya
Can't believe how my life changed
From the hood, the first time in my life I can say I did the right thing

Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gonna take it(uh)

No matter what it takes my nigga, we gonna take it(uh)

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

So I keep on the vest in case a nigga wanna test (uh)
I got no time for games cause I'm all grown up
You wanna joke nigga? laugh when you get blown up (come on)
See how funny it is when your kids ain't got no father
Cause you played it sweet now you floating in the harbor (for real)
Shit is hectic so respect it for your health (what)
Didn't think it was right, you should've checked it yourself (come on)

Wake up one day, 40 years old on some bumb shit
Time flew by, you was too fly to see the light
Everyday it's getting darker then comes the night
Now what? (what) realize that you ain't got shit (uh)
Not long ago you was the man on some hot shit
So just peep the flow yo, cause you already in this

Except the dollars other reasons why I'm living yo (why?)
Time is viable
Low and behold the young, black, and powerful
Got to eat yo, everyday my daughters feet grow
You wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow
Paying doctors when I'm born, a preacher when I'm buried
That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit
Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a b'ness (business)
If you catch a bad deal, watch your life diminish
Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it
Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit
Just strap up and hold on, hope for the best
Prepare for the worse, no fears no nothing on earth
No tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first
Nor the last nigga, let's get this cash nigga

Old girl gonna stand with the dog
Hand in hand with the dog
And whatever the fuck went down she ran with the dog
First time I had a match and didn't scratch

I spit rounds at your enemy no less than six
Always keep the extra clip Dog taught me well
The extra eyes on your team I see who's next to fail
Always hold your back up, I pick it up when you slack up
And if attention gets to close I tell the world to back up
Bind too tight, rhymes who ride?
Bitch and you livin' nigga lessons through life
Fuckin' with the dog he's the master

Split you then stash you

Up against the top contenders
None of them lasted
This bitch goin' always hold you down

Ruff Ryders 
Lets go
Swizz Beatz 

This is the darkest shit, sparkest shit 
Hitting wit the hardest shit, 'cause 'fore we started shit 
Wit kids I knew my friends all turned against me 
Said fuck it, bought me a dog ever since me and my dog has been like this 
He got my back I got his, scheming on mad niggas 
That's how we do biz
It's about time to start another, robbing spree 
'Cause yo, my way is highway, robbery, chump 
When I was up north, since 16 I was sending niggas home in a coffin 
Living like a orphan, you bad nigga? 
I'll be back to see if you'll be still here 
You know my style I'll put yo fucking man, in a wheelchair 
He'll never walk again, on the strength of me 
That's how I left him G, scared to death of me 
Cannot run, hit wit the hot one 
From the shotgun, cats was close, wondered how we got done 

E-V-E 
My dogs believe in me 
Petty thugs hide yo cake, never teasing me 
I show love to, all my bitches hustling one's, tussle wit thieves 
Making moves, second to none, I locked it, uh 
Made a sudden move you got bit 
Flooded wit the double R, real street shit 
The blonde hair bandit, you got guns, hand it 
Turn my face when I bust a cannon 
'Cause I don't wear sunblock 
Ask Drag if the fire is hot 
Click pop shells, fall three feet, roll over and stop 
Believe in this gang, we beat y'all, you got money? 
Keep y'alls, for us be tearing trying to i-dentify big dogs

And you can come see me if you trying to make a grand tonight 
'Cause I can get it for you raw, gray, tan or white 
I hate rap yo, I'd rather be planning a flight 
Somewhere hot on a Wave Runner, tanning wit dikes 
Blowing the haze, while all of 'em giving me brains 
One at a time, y'all start from the front of the line 
And as for you playboy you can keep those raps
And keep your awards, my son can't eat those plaques 
Drove the Benz off the lot and just dusted her off 
Tints, rims, stashed, took the governor off 
Even the cats that be hating still be loving the dogs 
'Cause they know that the double R's coming for war 
What

If you ain't ready to die, then why should you live? 
'Cause when I start swingin' the thing you hiding the kids 
And the P is still riding on trips, surviving the strip 
Beefing on the 4th you got to fly on the 5th 
Like I wasn't hustling hope or runnin' the block
Starving or not, carving the cheek, palming the Glock 
Figure which nigga could I watch wit a watch 
I like to knock off my work then I pull off a heist 
Put it together, double it twice, rider for life 
Catch me wit a 45, hot pair of Nikes 
And three red dice, like, give me the bank or gimmie yo face 
Gimmie a shank, it's Holiday  

Y'all dem bust in them crowd cats and hit whoever 
When you should aim for them cats that took yo leather 
They right there, but you scared that they gon' bust 
'Cause they crazy, but them crazy ones bleed like us 
See I'm one shot through the heart like Cupid 
Y'all dogs might be crazy, but y'all not stupid 
Y'all I got call cops squeelers, I got autops killas, that'll bust you and slide 
And some ol 6-drop killas 
Revolver pop killas, easy ox killas
Get knocked, say we smoked detox killas
Drug program, hit the streets we cop 56 mo grams 
Y'all killas ain't messing wit scrams 
And that's 

Boy, whats the difference between fire and water? 
You whether drown or die off torture, 'cause yo skins of ya 
And watch ya burn off fat, dog I'm off the thermostat 
Could put a comb to my mouth and give yo chick a perm wit that 
Keep shells in the envelopes 'cause I'll mail out bullets 
More blood than a riot on a jailhouse footage 
Buck 40, buy the extra 20 wit the semi, when it hit you 
You gon' do a 360 pretty swiftly 
'Cause I got things that'll pop yo top 
And double R spot yo block wit 16 shots and watch y'all drop

Grrr! 

Can't stop 
Gotta eat 
Stepping on, my feet 
Spread love, think it's sweet 
Uh, uh, uh all you catz don't know 

Yeah baby, shit's about to jump off and 
Lookin' for the bus to bring in my man from up north 
Been like three years since when got knocked 
Since he got caught 
Punked up like five new blocks, holding down for it 
Kept a nigga straight with money in the books 
And them bitches is crooks who look out for other crooks 
Took him shopping, money in his pocket is straight 
Dropped him off at the wife's crib after we ate 
Our estate was the next move for me 
Had to make that nigga chill for at least two to three months 
Cause when it's on, it's on 
He didn't care 
It's like slow down baby 
The money ain't going nowhere 
Keep in touch though and show how much your ass is with it 
The dope flow is there and in a minute you can get it (come on) 
You gotta watch a nigga just coming home in a game 
Cause on the low we may just be trying to go against the grain 

I never figured this nigga would pull this shit that he pulled 
What is strange is the change that niggaz go through 
When they're locked down and really can't hack it 
A motherfucker like me handles a bid like a jacket 
Strap it on my back, niggaz ain't built like me 
And by the end, niggaz was like ""Yo, why you killed Mike, D?"" 
Wasn't me, but yeah he had it coming to him 
Used to be my dog, so I let my cousin do him 
Sent him out of state with like half a brick down to my spot in VA 
Cause the money comes quick 
Half of that got fucked up before I even got the check in on him (damn) 
But things happen so I really wasn't wreckin' on him (damn) 
Got him up out of there and sent him down a little further 
Ain't heard from him in two months, murder, murder 
And from the next flight thinking I might have to steal something 
This hungry shit will make a nigga want to kill something (come on) 

Listen, money is missing and it's hectic (what?) 
Found the safe, checked it 
Shit looks detected (what?) 
Just what I expected when I got no word from him 
Asked around but ain't nobody heard from him (uh-huh) 
But money talks and most niggaz is snakes 
So it wasn't long before his man was ready to take 
Me to where he was at, checked my gat 
Threw in a four clip, pumped myself up 
Cause I can't go for that bullshit (come on) 
Fuckin' with my last load of cash ain't the issue 
It's just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you 
Takin' back for niggaz in New York and how they told me so 
Now I got to knock his boots, he owes me dough 
Layin' up with a hoe, then he hit me with the sob story (come on) 
The famous ""Oh you didn't know I got robbed!"" story (come on) 
Told it's to me he should be grateful to 
Fuck that bitch! Look at what she made you do 
Now there's love lost and a double cross 
Pointed at that bitch, turned her braids into sauce 
So you want to be with him (uh) and talk to me like I''m silly (yeah) 
Five bottle of Mo on the floor, boxes of phillys (uh) 
Ten g's in the shoebox under the bed 
And for every g I put a fuckin' slug in his head 
And from then, the moral of the story if you missed it 
Is that the grain will always be there 
Just never go against it

Rob then I steal, not 'cause I want to, 'cause I have to
And don't make me show you with the Magnum
If you don't know by now, then you slippin'

I got my man and them stay pretty like I'm a stay shitty
Cuddy, it's all for the money, is you wit' me?
Hit the bitches, when I commit the crime
And when it's on, we transform like Optimus Prime
I'll form the head, roll out, let's make it happen
If we ain't gonna get it wit' them, we'll take a cap
Bustin' off, dustin' off 'cause them softest niggas

What you doin' robbin' niggas, jerkin' niggas, stickin' niggas?
'Cause they deserve it, with money got murdered
They know he died slow if they heard it
The nigga ain't blew up his spot a while
And the mother fucker ain't got shot in a while
Just take some light up, to fuck the night up
Blow everything in sight up
Fuck around and I'll have your ass right up
What makes you think you wasn't able to stand?
I got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of the hand
The days are longer and seems like I'm wastin' time
I've got a lot of dreams, but I'm not really chasin' mine
I soak it all up like you set the fire
Nowadays gettin' by, is nothing more than the occasional meal and gettin' high
I live to die, that's where I'm headed
Let your man hold somthin', now it's all about you can get it

Lucky that you breathin' but you dead from the waist down
The fuck is on your mind? Talkin' that shit that you be talkin'
And I bet you wish you never got hit 'cause you'd be walkin'
But shit happens, and fuck it, you done did your dirt
Niggas is wonderin' how the fuck you hid your skirt
Right under they eyes, now it's surprise to the guys
And one of their mans was a bitch in disguise
Fuckin' with cats and order more hits and slaughter more kids
Let me holler at you on Baltimore shit
Know what I mean? I'm just robbin' to eat
And there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbin' the street
When we starve, then we eat whatever's there
Come on, you know the code in the street, whatever's fair
Blood stains and chalk, means your man couldn't walk
After the talk about him not being on the 11:33 to New York
Transformin' ass niggas will get it quick
And yo for real that nigga K can suck my dick
And it's gon' take all these niggas in the rap game
To barely move me 'cause when I blow shit up
I'll have niggas fallin' like white bitches in a scary movie
Ah, you know I don't know how to act
Get too close to niggas, it's like

Or the slugs might come to you
As long as I can remeber, the streets have kept me safe
And ever since that time in December, the heat's been in my waist
I need an extra set of eyes so I keep my dogs with me
Doctor says let them die said his f***ing dog bit me
I don't know whats wrong with me
But it seems like since you heard of us
Y'all n****s turning into murderers
Couldn't f*** with a third of us
Still against me
And wanting to see me in the box
Grilling me all crazy when you see me and the L.O.X.
Leave you Red like Foxx
Ain't nothing funny about that
I see you in a coma, ain't coming up out that
You hold on for too long and they ain't pulling the plug for you
I'll run up in the joint myself and bust another slug on you
It's murda
It's murda motherf***ers

I take a squat then post up with the toast up
I bring beef to a closure
Know somethin?
From cats stackin four-somes
I'm loathesome 
I scream out f*** the world then I throw something
N****s scheming hard but f*** it, it's the god
I leave bullets lodged leave you leaning on your broad
And our punks leave you gagged up in your car
Slumping Kennedy-style with your memory out
What the f*** y'all want?
Daddio with the calico 
Let the gat blow leave you bleeding on your patio
I leave rivals on their backs looking up at the sky blue
Not only do I leave you I hide you
I before you
X and Ja-Rule
Death before dishonor now and prior to
Boss man spy on you
Conspire you
Me die before you?
You liar, you
N****s is dead off the hits I approve
F*** it, I got the feds wearin wired suits
Y'all n****s don't listen
Whether in streets or in prison
When we find them we twist them
They f***ing up missing
Y'all don't understand we want y'all all to hate it
It's murda
Murder incorporated

In crime we all related
It's murda
See if y'all can take it

I'ma murderer and murdering anything that moves
Through ya nine n****s
Straight do or die n****s
Caught up and fall victim to the worst s***
X, Jigga, and Ja as expected
Shot on the world and reflect it
N****s don't respect it
So get it the worst way
F*** with the wolves you get hunted like prey
Shot up in broad day
Now everybody want you
I'm feeling like: stupid didn't the inc. warn you the first time
It's murda
Whenever you see blood
It's murda
Lay you down for the love
That's us 
Leave the lights on
Knife through your windpipe
Cause most of your n****s ain't cut right
You thinking it's alright 
But it ain't
I'm paralyzing clowns up and down from the waist
Giving n****s facelifts and taking it
While making you bleed
And if I got a taste of the s*** I'm taking more than you need
It's nothing but love between me, you, and these slugs
Hit him up wrap his body up in a area rug
Who holding the heat?
Who leaving n****s cold in the street?
Y'all know me, ya Co-D, Ja-Rule the O.G.
N****s better watch me closely
Get a grip, it's hennessy that fuels all that murderin' s***

I'ma run 'til I bust my gun and empty the clip
Then when I come home, and gotta go, just give me the whip
I ain't got time for the lip, just open the fence

You might not make it home to eat, I barely sleep
Could you pick up a phone and call me at home

Nothing's too small, just go ball

I might leave the heat behind

That's why a nigga sleep 'til nine, out by ten
Back by ten, sleep 'til nine, do it again
If you love something, let it go
If it comes back to you, it yours
If it doesn't, fuck it, you never know

That that that niggaz ain't even seen before
That's that shit! (motherfuckers ain't never seen 
Nothing like this before, for real man)
It's goin down baby, uhh
Uhh! busta rhymes
What?! Uhh, dmx nigga
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh

I see ghosts clearly; even though, most don't hear me
They still want to get near me - fear me, so I'm leary
Kinda eerie what I'm feelin' - from the floor, to the ceilin'
Straight through the roof, want the truth?
I kinda miss robbin' and stealin'
Cause it kept a nigga hungry, only eatin' when I starved
I was ugly, so I robbed, no one loved me, shit was hard
Went to god once in a while when it got a little too hectic
He was the only one I knew that I respected (why?)
Didn't know why, didn't know what I was livin' was a lie
If I ain't shit then, why should I try
See, plenty niggaz die, over dumb shit, up in the hood
Real good heart, but up to no good
Thought I did what I could, but I guess it, wasn't enough
The devil told me it would happen but I kept callin his bluff
When it rains it pours now, my pains are yours
As yours are what's mine, define, revolvin' doors (nigga!)

[Chorus]
(why?) all my niggaz tell me (why) tell me (we die)
Cause we crazy with it, quick to blaze you with it
From in my soul to every word that I curse
With all the agony expressed in this verse;
Let me ask my niggaz (why?)
My niggaz tell me (why) tell me (we die)
Because we gods nigga (and) we go the yard nigga
Because I walk the ground under my feet
And keep it live and stay in tune with the street
Now let me ask my niggaz (why?)

They say the good die young, in the hood where I'm from
I only got one question to that - why the fuck am I here?
I look to the air, I ask god, ""love me please,""
But in reality, only people that hug me is thieves
Same niggaz that send shots through my rugby sleeves
They want to, slug me and leave, I'm thinkin' it must be me
Please shed light, the hood's dark
I did my dirt but got a good heart
Shouldn't that count for somethin?
I was told I'd amount to nothin, most of my childhood
Liked by folks it was stuntin' my growth
Separated me from the shit I was wantin' the most
Felt myself comin' close to pumpin' them o's
Lump in my throat, chest poked out, face was poker
Tryin' to, erase my ghostes, chase the smokers
Got demons on both shoulders, 
Tryin' to chauffeur my life through the streets
In other words nigga my will was weak
Please feel what I speak, 
This ain't your average ordinary jargon
Weak rap niggaz be talkin'
This shit is deep, from the mind of Busta, 'X and me
To all my fallen soldiers, rest in peace, til we meet niggaz

[Chorus]

I must be cuckoo, like I respect the new-you, never
See you too could get it through your Fubu sweater
Like a nigga when he walk in the dark, trespassin'
On a nigga land, shots echo loud in the park
I live and die for all the shit I believe
And rep for everything I stand for 
With every single breath I breathe
Like the intake from cigarette smoke, it's like you inhale
The demon in the gutter stressed struggled and broke
If the shit was all over tomorrow, I'd leave a treasure
For my kids with a legacy for my children to follow
You know it's funny how the good die first
Get the peppin' in your steppin' faggot nigga
Cause you could die worse
Hold on, you know I cut off my arm, in the name of reppin
Real niggaz in the midst of droppin' this bomb
Allah blessin' me to rep for the better, and carry on
Somethin' great and keep a nigga name livin' forever!

Now I'm looking for some washed up rapper that I can hire 
You know some old school nigga wit a bit of attitude 
Pay him $1500 to fuck a girl in an interlude 
You say I'm souped up, well, soup is good food 
So what I scratch my nuts, how the fuck is that wrong 
For so glowing, Afro picking 
S-curl hating, Jamaican rum sipping 

Kid I'll burp on your girl butt cheeks 

The honey had my nuts like two red beets 
I'm bananas, out of my fucking mind they won't let me back in

I knew he had the joint, but I didn't want to make him show me
That nigga be buggin, stickin cats up and random
Doing his dirt and disappearin like the phantom
Niggas can't stand him, but ask me if I care
'cause what I used to give a fuck about, just ain't there
And ain't nothing fair, I knew this for a long time
that's why with ever wrong crime comes anotha strong rhyme
And that's mo' time under the belt, you felt what I had
And I shouldn't have even done it, that's what made this shit sad
I'm doin' bad, but if I gots to feel it, you gots to feel it
And if a nigga can't afford it, I gots to steal it

And so I don't have nightmares I forget about it, move on
Keep gettin my groove on, 'cause that shit could fuck with'choo
Keep dwellin on it, and its gonna get stuck with you

You must of saw som'thin funny, or never saw som'thin bloody
Or you don't know I'll bring it to your door 'cause I'm cruddy
Like puddy, when I hold you niggas, I mold you niggas
I done told you niggas, that I been owed you niggas
For that shit you did that you wasn't built for
Shit I guess you didn't know you do get killed for
I done filled niggas up with the extended clip
Its like I blew this joint down with the extended rip
Or that non-stop, when the bomb drops
I'ma take it from where you at and then end up on ya moms block

Especially if its all over the place, your mind all over his face
How do brains taste, when they mixed with gun powder
Semi to fully automatic makes the gun louder

'Cause we get it right, get it right, get it right, spit it right

[DMX]
Moves is made, n****s is paid - that's just how it is
When my time is up, I'm a be out, but I'm a try to live
I'm eatin' day by day; ain't nothin' sweet about it
Act like you don't know what I'm sayin' then you read about it
Built for war like a armadillo
Smokin' yo' a**; put two through the pillow
Hear my s*** through windows
Manic depressive, and my head hurts
Soon as the dead thirst, I'll wet him first
Now wait a minute; it gets worse
I can't control what I own inside
So I take it out on the soul of that kid that died
Spit fire, cross n****s like barbecues
Mobbin' crews, strippin' n****s, robbin' crews
And put him speechless when I made him eat this
Hollow tip, and you can follow grip
You be like Kim and ain't gon' swallow s***
Don't know the half, couldn't know the math
To understand the wrath of a man split in half
But he got what he wanted; shot for three hundred
S*** is tight, and a n**** that's right gots to run it
Ain't no question; that's how I get down
N****s know gimme yo' dough and yo' ho, and, here, take these fo'
Hot things; I got things that make n****s spin
Put n****s in the wind where you never see n****s again
Bless a n**** with fifties - the thin types
And a straight blast that'll put pinstripes across your windpipe

[Chorus x 2]

[Drag-On]
Drag opposite water more than a spot order
My flows cause fire then bring holes
Takes more than a pump to out this little punk
'Less that pump is a twelve, and I get popped, still I burn to Hell
Call the police, and whatever they don't seize
And put in they mouth, and catch freeze; tell 'em throw Drag some keys
Don't care how many oyeas I gotta make believe
If you nervous, you don't deserve it poppi, please
Cats stealin' gats; y'all probably will get hit
Well, I'm the future; let's see y'all copy this, stopping this
Since a tiny kid like, ""mommy, buy me this.""
Since she always told me no, started stealin' on some grimy s***
Like look at that, now look at that slide - it in my book bag
I'm who parents point they fingers at, ""get from that hood rat.""
And put it back; f*** tough while y'all cook crack
I'm cocaine; throw me in the pot, I rise to the top
With your 5.0, go 'head, look ma, I got four more pegs
Still put them holes in yo' head, till it's mushy like dough bread
'Cause that vest only protects that chest
And if I decide to get ice, don't get to fascinated
Or it's my bullet, your brain, mashed potatoes
Double R got me comin' hard on you haters
'Cause we the streets black, and y'all belong beneath that

Rigga n****s want to see the Dog n**** bite
But this kid Drag strike a light
F*** five mics; my fire burn the wire
'Cause we the n****s that plug
Wrap 'em in the rug
Flames mini blowing on my hands like dust
Chicks want to slurp?
Ya guaranteed I'm a make 'em burp
Just push your teeth to the curve
And hum a word
Some nerve, cats think they can touch the torch
You don't know about my gun just for me to toss
F*** with the cars
I don't care what kind of drop ya pushin'
I put my fifteen through your top and dump bullets
Yeah, I see y'all cowards like to wear vests
Well, I'm a aim a little higher, like for your neck
I puff lye
I'm a lift blunts till my arm look like Popeye
Till the day is bye bye
Till then, three hundred G fly by, rented
So foggy windows look tinted
We just be lookin' at your Roley, at dem hot shows
So go 'head, boy, get drunk, pop that Mo'
Until I pull ya to the side
See the nine, kid?
And since you got that nice watch
You know what time it is
'Cause Drag's clock say 7:30
So sudden move and you gon' be left somewhere
Real dirty, dirty
Double R - a camp where it's all champs
And if y'all want to stop fire, open up a 'dant

[Chorus x 2]

Bet'cha n****s always wonder
Why Drag always spit fire?
Why y'all always pop s***
About how I burn n****s till they chocolate?
'Cause I'm the opposite of H2O; now ya know
Fix your wrinkled face
My iron press more than clothes
And girls - I love 'em when I meet 'em
Might eat 'em
But when they act up, it's like Turner Tina
Don't me get the burner
Catch me in the low key Pontiac Sun, sippin' Con-gac
Y'all know how that affects blacks
So you know I clash that
No way I'm a blow all these gats and crack stacks
I'm a lil' n**** so you know I run fast
But don't do much of it 
Do a lot of gun busting
'Cause when I let off a clip, I get a kick
Outta seeing n****s run eyes open, hoping they don't trip
Ya hear the echoes blocks away
Type of bricklayers that hear shots today
And give your blocks away
Run up on papi 
Hey, drop the yay
And if he don't stall
This world be popped tomorrow
Drag-On speaks with a stutter, but I rhyme well
So like a dead snitch, it's hard to tell
Dirty, dirty n****s, word
This is to my grimy, grimy n****s, word
This is to my RR n****s, word
Yeah, 'cause we double R n****s, ya heard?

DMX,"Holiday Styles 
Bitch, I get you shot in the head or shot in the neck 
If I ain't gettin' proper respect 
I don't care if you rap, I still spit in your grill 
I don't give a fuck, never have, never will 
If it ain't on your hip, then you're lookin' to die 
I ain't tryin' to be the nigga that's gonna look at the sky 
Ask God why I'm broke, bitch, I'm cooking the pie 
We all gon' die, sooner or later, matter of time 
My niggas sell crack, with a package of dimes 
Hundred or more, in front of the store, waitin' to bubble 
Brand new nine, and an eight in a bubble 
I put sixteen above ya neck, I love my set 
Niggas think they a thug, then thug to death (uh-huh) 
'Cause the P gon' squeeze 'til no slugs is left (what) 
You know I'm good with a hundred of 'dro, gun and an O 
You think your shit butter? Hop in front of this toast 

Aiyyo, aiyyo 
I say what I want, fuck what y'all think is cool 
And I hate cops, 'cause most y'all was dicks in school 
No pussy gettin' niggas tryin' to cuff the God 
Play Sheek out in the yard, but that shit too hard 
My dough too long, nowadays, my flow too strong 
What y'all make in a year, I kick that for a song 
Check my car, I don't care, I don't play fair 
Keep some shit in the stash box, then get me the chair 
And it don't buck shot and the blast is hard to hear 
I'm a true thug nigga, bring it straight to your crew 
Small yell when I rap, I'm basically talkin' to you 
You see the pain in my eye? Nigga, the flame in my eye? 
I'm tryin to leave my kids some real fuckin change when I die 
From rappin' or tellin' some cat to reach for the sky 
I'm that hunt down nigga, with the four pound nigga 
Bounty hunt your whole crew 'til my bullets go through, what? 

All I need is a big gun and a coupe that's crazy quick 
A nice house with five rooms, maybe six 
A town where money is coming, eighty bricks 
Break 'em down to all twenties, is a crazy flip 
Bet you never even felt the heat 
'Til I put the M1 next to your waves and melt the grease 
Streets help niggas, niggas don't help the streets 
Y'all use beats for help, we help the beats 
Who want it with me? Who want it with Sheek? Who want it with P? 
If I say so myself, it's a wonderful three 
Be in the hood with all your jewels in the glovebox 
Same niggas that'll rob you love L.O.X. (Uh) 
All types of burners, even snub Glocks (uh) 
Nice size TECs you could carry in your sweats (uh) 
Find your man dead in the trunk of the car (uh) 
It's Jada (mwwaa) responsible for breakin' your heart (uh) 

Creep through the streets 
For some of y'all rappers, that's mighty hard 
Me the security? Protectin' my body? I let my shotty guard 
Put chill pills in brains, bullets like Tylenol 
Make niggas drowsy from the blood loss, got 'em noddin' off 
And take casket naps, fuck that 
You shoulda never let this bastard rap 
All I know is cold winter, hot slugs through your snorkel 
No parents, tale from my horror's no morals 
Raised in the wrong era, with no guidance 
So you dyin'? It's no problem, no lyin '
Drag's fire, so ya hamburger beef? I french-fry 'em 
Drag done ate your food 
Like I know to raise your dukes so guard your chin up 
Drag barrels, but shit, I spit-bubble your skin up 
Drag scorch niggas for dinner but season 'em well 
I don't brag I let the streets tell 
Po'-po' now you see he fell 

And you motherfuckers know what my name means when you hear it in the streets (uh) 
Y'all bitches fear it 'cause you weak 
You want to hear it? I make it speak (What?) 
You ain't ever bust a gun, but there's a lot of greasy talkin' (uh-huh) 
What the science behind that son? (I don't know) 
A lot of easy walkin'
I bust shit down (uh) got down (uh) kick down (uh) shot down (uh) 
Ain't tryin' to talk about what I got now, but I got now (What?) 
I ain't never sold a brick, I done stuck niggas up (c'mon) 
And for talkin too much shit? I done fucked niggas up (uh) 
It can get ""Dark"" for real, and I think you already know that (uh-huh) 
Well think about it with the brick in your hand before you throw that 
Now don't act, 'cause actin' might get you rollin '
If you ain't ready to handle (Uhh) 
All that's left of your memory, is a candle (Woo!) 
It happens quick fast nigga, to bitch ass niggas 
Talkin' reckless behind your back, them kiss ass niggas (uh)

Now days cats and middleman, little man, ain't controlling shit
Talk about holding bricks, but ain't holding dick

Soon as I see 'em headed my way, I cut them off quick
Must you beat me in my head everytime I come through?
It's shit like, everybody tells me I sound just like you
But you got me, got me? And you can't live without me

Better have a cause but because you'll get burned
You got 15 years without ever coming out
And beat your fist at the world and what they talkin' about
Then get locked up every two years
For two years keep it real, hold back all tears, face your fears
Become a man before your time, rap but live out your rhymes

Tried to stop fuckin' all them other niggas and can't

And at the end, he will stand on this earth
My flesh may be destroyed, yet from this body, I will see God
Yes, I will see him for myself - and I long for that moment

Grandma, I really miss you and it ain't been the same
I drop a tear when I, hear yo' name
Mariella Holloway, why you gotta be so far away?
Used to say, ""Don't worry, it's gon' be okay""
But it ain't it's like when you left, you took the Lord witchu
Why couldn't I come when he came to get you?
Damn I really miss you I had to say it again
I remember the time when I was like ten
Crept up in the neighbor's yard, yeah, bein hard headed
You told me I would get it you said it!
And boy did I get it, but after you spanked me, you hugged me
Kissed me on my forehead, told me that you love me
And I saw, that it hurt you, more than it hurt me
I thought how bad could this hurt be? I know now
That's why it's only done out of love
What I wouldn't give for one mo' hug, from grandma

Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')
Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')

What I'm about to say a couple of family members is gon' hate me
But I'mma let you know what's been goin on lately
Now you know since you left, a lot of things witcho kids done changed
Yeah Jackie's still crazy, don't know what's up with James
Ain't seen Jerry in a while, you know he walk like you
And Renee's back in jail, you know she talk like you
Riculah's doin real good now, she workin'
Rhonda's still runnin' around, trickin', jerkin
Buckeye's buggin', he done lost his mind
And Jarvis? Back out of jail, doin fine
Kylie? He done changed, it ain't all about self
As for my father well, that's somethin' else
But that's my dog, he hold his grandmother down
My great grandmother, makin a lot of trips out of town
But that's a good thing, and if I could only hear you sing
Once more, oh Lord, the comfort it would bring

Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin)
Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin)

You left behind a mother (and) eleven kids (and) eleven grandkids
And since then, two of yo' grandkids done had kids
They had a boy named Tacoma, Xavier's brother, that's right
Xavier's made you a great grandmother
I thank you for the best times of my life
I thank you for when you first met her, accepted and lovin' my wife
I thank you for those Sunday dinners, they were vital
I thank you for my life, I thank you for the bible
I thank you for the songs that you sing in the mornin'
(Amazing Grace) while I'm yawnin'
I thank you for the two beatings you gave me
Cause I know somewhere along the line
The lesson I learned from the two beatings saved me
And when you died I cried like a baby, I begged the Lord to take me
Cause no one else could give me what you gave me
But life like everything comes to an end
I pray I go to heaven to see you again - amen

Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')
Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')

Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')
Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin')

Or pay the tolls of the roads I done kept on, crept on
Walk 'til I got tired then curled up and slept on

I burned so I earned the right to teach, what to eat

What you niggaz been gettin' fed, shouldn't be even on your fork
Let's talk, about this, and about that
Yeah, we like this or we can do it out back

Keep the bullshit for the rodeo
'Cause on the real, you cocksuckers don't know me yo
Hit you wit' something for frontin' that'll end your life

Feds lookin' for the dog, oh that nigga outta town
This is a grown-up game, thinkin' 'cause you got a blown-up name
You won't get a blown-up frame

I ain't playin' wit' you niggaz no more, them are old
I be layin' when you hit the door, you hit it cold
Be like oh no, see what I'm sayin'

Oh my God yeah niggaz done lost yo mind
Toss the nine, this nigga done cross the line
Disrespectful shit will get you hit, bitch
Fuck who you with, you niggaz get what you get

Five to the spine, ride now niggaz is dyin'
Money pulled out he was trying, yet to slow wit the iron
Nuttin' but gun firing, blap blap blap blap
Cocksucka where it at

Open up your back now I can see through your stomach
Told stupid muthafucka to stop runnin', or run in
To a buck shot, can't duck off shot
It's that click click boom you outta luck shot

Now don't fall to pieces on me, because the piece is on me
He thought the leash was on me, but dog the streets are hungry
And I'ma feed 'em every time I sing, do my thing

You never give us more than we can handle But it's gettin' hard
And I'm a strong individual But I need you, God
A lot of things that I used to I don't want to
Runnin' the streets like I used ta
I know I'm gonna speak the word for you one day
Up in the light -- Hallelujah!! -- on Sunday
I thank you Lord for the blessings that you gave me
And for my life the blessings that you have saved me
And for my wife
You have carried me enough times and that's the truth
Carried me through the rough times throughout my youth
And through it that I saw you was still wit me
I was that one lost sheep and you was comin' to get me

[Chorus:]
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like

I'm lookin' at life a lil' different now since you hugged me
And I always loved my people but now they love me
Thank you for the love, Lord, we praise ya
Jacob, ascendants, from Africa to Asia
Bleeding the blood of Christ over our life
Wrong or right just help us make it through the night
And we'll shout your name in times of need
And times of joy and when we bleed
And when we are overcome with grief
You don't have to tell me twice; I'm a take heed
And because of what you've given me, I know you'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be
You are the strength I never knew I had 
Kept the heart good when they told me it was bad, 
All praise is due to ya, that's why I had to dedicate somethin new to ya, 
Thank you Father

[Chorus]
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like
Lord, you got me like, your love got me like

Uh I never knew a love like this before
Messin' with the Thug Life, I missed it all
Open up the doors and let me in 
I'm done wit the cards so let's begin
Prayers that you give to me, I give to them
Same way you live in me I live in them
Life is a blessing now you got me smiling
From inside of my heart when inside it was dark
And it doesn't rain any more only sunshine
No pain anymore.... I really love mine
You wash away the tears with the fears
I'm happier than I've ever been in my life, in thirty years
You know that
One day I'll speak the word
You know that!
When I do, I will be hear
You know that!
You have me a permanent smile

Let us pray
Father God I am just learning how to pray, so bear with me
First I thank you for the life of everyone that's here with me
Then I thank you for the love you give me, why?
I don't know; I don't deserve it, and it hurts inside
Many a nights I cried, and called your name out loud
But didn't call you when I was doin good, I was too proud
And STILL you gave me love, I wasn't used to that
Most of the people that gave me love, they ended up takin it back
That's somethin new to me, so I'm askin you for time to adjust
Let me make it there, I will be one you can trust
What I stand for, I put my life on, I DO!
I guess what I'm askin is - show me how to stand for you
And I will RAP for you, SING for you, PREACH for you, TEACH for you
REACH for you - I will love you like you love me, unconditionally
And I will ALWAYS be prepared, for whatever the mission'll be
GIVE THE NUTRITION TO ME, and I'll properly digest it
And when I give it back, I'll show you word well invested
And whenever I go, BEFORE I GO, let me give
Thanks to you Lord, my birth, for every day that I've lived
You gave me a love most of my life I didn't know was there

â??I just called you, you said that you were on your way 
but there's just one problem... I'm all the
way to fucking Rochester, New York. Wrong. Ho.â??

Doggs gone be doggs don't fuck wit a dogg 
if you can't take care of a dogg you know whut i say
take it easy, lady, you know give me a motherfuckin break, will ya?

shorty was da bomb brown skin honey with the dough 
found out she was a lil' ho but still yo
pushed up shorty had that ass like BLAOW!!!!
had me schemin and how! How can i get that now?
was like Girlfriend, let me drop a bug in you're ear
she didn't mind 'cause i told her whut she wanted to hear
was like â??Yeah!â?? she knew she was how it was goin down
she said, â??Page me, code zero, 'cause i know you get around!â??
Didn't even have a man, but even if she did then
'cause my game is tight like i stop to cap on a nigga head
i said, woke up, like, 9, or sumthin
don't act like when i say that ass is mine, i'm frontin!
Uhhh that night she let me get that, hit that
ripped that, bounced off the walls and flipped that
But only one thing went wrong 
the rubber bust but i didn't fuss 'cause dogg!!!!
shorty was da bomb!

[chorus]
Shortyyyy.... UHHHH!! we only did it full that night 
and man the pussy was good
but shorty's fuckin up my life (fuckin up my life)
Shortyyyy.... UHHHH!! we only did it full that night
but man that pussy was good
but shorty's fuckin up my life.... c'mon, ma! gimme a break!

a few days later, i hit her up just to be real
I like, â??Whuttup, Boo, how you been, how you feel?â??
She said, â??Aiight, but my friend's kinda late
Today's the thirteenth, it shoulda been here on the eighthâ??
I'm like, â??For real? Well stress a pill 
You better 'cause i can't afford another lil' one.â??
She said, â??Neither can Iâ?? I said, â??Cool 
'cause i got mad shit to do and you still in school
so at least we got the same thing in mind.â?? 
If didn't have this kid, then everything woulda been fine
BUT i was blind! for the fact that she was settin me up for the kill
damn! why wasn't she on The Pill?!
And i still check up on her, like, once a week
sometimes i hit it, sometimes i didn't
but Shorty was a frea, and whenever i would speak
on the baby, she'd be like:
""I ain't havin this kid, is you crazy?!!""

Shortyyyy.... UHHHH!! we only did it full that night 
(listen man, only one muthafuckin night!)
And man the pussy was good (i ain't gone front it was good as a muthafucka)
But Shorty's fuckin up my life (man, this bitch is a fuckin headache!)
Shortyyyy.... UHHHH!! we only did it full that night (one muthafuckin night, 
it was nuthin but
trouble)
But Man the pussy was good (The pussy!! Man, let me tell ya....)
But Shorty's fuckin up my life (dogg, man, this bitch....!) 
C'mon Ma, gimme a break!!

By now wasn't lookin too good
'cause she wasn't doin things that she told me she would
like gettin the price checked out for whut we had to do 
and it goes up in the arguements after two
and a half, man i had to laugh at her frustrations
now she's four months ready to hit the bus station
if i was still in that shit wit her made me rob her
told her friends, â??DMX is my baby's father!â?? 
Lil' stomache was showin' so now the heat is on
well maybe we'll see the light if i start to treat her wrong
i guess she thought that if she keeped the baby, she would keep me
got the game on high level, gettin sneaky
had the kid she said it was premature
found out she was six months when she said she was four
so i left her with the pressure on the next man's arm
she'll be aiight 'cause shorty was da bomb!

Shortyyyy.... UHHHH!! we only did it full that night 
(man one muthafuckin night? Get real!)
and man the pussy was good (the pussy it ate the dick up like THAT!)
but shorty's fuckin up my life (This bitch won't quit CALLIN'!!!!)
Shorty..... UHHHH!! (she was kinda cute though) we only did it full that night

The guns, knives and bats, every time we scrap
The hustlin', the dealin', the robbin', the stealin' (uh!)

Go where I go, dog in my life

Now if you start with dirt, then you start with hurt
You start with ""Oh, you ain't got?""
Well here, take my shirt
Start with work, blood and tears over the years
Goin' through whatever we go through, we stickin' it out here
Pups turn into dogs, tadpoles into frogs
I'm just eatin' what's in front of me, ain't thinking about yours
But I'ma keep my paws on what's mine
Beg 'til I find
Strapped 'til I'm blind
A nigga that whatever I do, still gon' be able to spit this
I'm wit' this, 'cause this is mine, you scared shitless
Rap niggas can't fuck with the dog
Never, could be twenty below outside
I'm built for the weather
It could be hotter than lava, I wouldn't bother to sweat
Some of you niggas, form a following, but you startin' to forget
I paid my dues, not only did you not wear
But you would really love it
If you could meet that cat that made my shoes

Keep paying attention to what you trying to show me
Livin', but you never know, we livin'
Don't give me what you don't owe me
Don't tell me that you love me
Don't talk shit, don't kill me slowly
'Cause a dog like me, is an only
Meaning, hit another like you, truth hurts, but I can't be phony
You always looking for bad, look at you mad
But you won't be satisfied 'til it took what you had
(Aight) I'm a thoro nigga, I keep my word
And anybody that's ever met me, got love for me
So I keep a heard
And that shit y'all niggas told me got me fucked up in the head
Went from, ""Yo, that's my dog""
To, ""Yeah, that nigga dead""
What the fuck is all this?

Nevermind, I just thought it
We supposed to keep it real
I destroy what I was taught
Misery, love, company
Now you niggas talikin' 'bout jumpin' me, pumpin' me
Full of slugs, blood, stud with the love
Damn, I just gave, what a real, nigga does
Don't listen to the buzz, don't get caught up in the hype
You'll lose everything that you worked for
Trying to take a nigga's stripes

Yet lose his own soul in the process?

I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night

You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him
I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
You're alright with him

I'm callin' out to you, Lord, because I need your help
See, once again I'm havin' difficulty savin' myself
Behavin' myself, you told me what to do, and I do it
But every and now and then it gets a little harder to go through it
Losin' friends day by day
I'm in so much pain when I'm here, Lord, please take me away!
I put you here to do a job, and your work ain't done
To live is to suffer, but you're still my son
And there will be a time when you shine as bright as the stars
But there won't be a his or hers, just ours
Then you'll see what I've been tryin' to show you all these years
Do the right thing, 'cause after the tears come the cheers
I will, my Lord, with my heart and my soul
That's gonna be how I roll, from now until I mold
Lead and I'll follow, you take away the sorrow
I'ma sleep on what you said and holla back tomorrow

I want you to know, Lord, that for what you given me I'm thankful
Sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, I'm grateful
You gave us power in our words, so I think before I speak
And that way when I speak, they know I'm here to teach
Can't tell 'em nothin' wrong, 'cause I love 'em too much
I reach a lot of people, and Lord, I'm lovin' the touch
But deep inside, I've got somethin' that's workin' against
Everything I know is right, what I know makes sense
That's when you must fight harder than you've ever fought before
'Cause what you've got goin' on inside you is a war
Between good and evil, be careful of those who wanna be you
They smile but are not really happy when they see you
Be careful of the ones that always wanna get you high
'Cause when the time comes, that one'll let you die
Listen to me! I'm here, but I can only help you
If you want me to help, what do you want for yourself?

Take what's in my heart and put it in my head

I don't know if I'll do good enough (He's by your side)
And we both know the hood is rough (Right by your side)
Sometimes I don't know what to do (X, dry your eyes!)
But I know what I gotta do (It'll be alright)
You keep givin' me the word, and I'll put it to song
Talk to me, I'll talk to them, and we can't go wrong
This is the start of somethin' strong, and this is just the start of it
Praises to you, my Lord, for lettin' me be a part of it
I was that kid that, been there, did that
Became ashamed so I hid that, but ain't no longer with that
Use me as an example, if I can do it, then they can too
With the Lord behind us, there ain't nothin' that we can't do

The essence of it all, the meak shall inherit the earth
Destined to ride with the call from birth
The true worth of a man, is not measured by what he does for hiself but
What he does for someone else
And if you help another, without concern for whatever yours
What you give, you shall receive tenfold
X-Caliber The Ultimate Challenger
And I, put that on my soul
And, put that on my life
And, everything I own
And, everything I know
And, everything I show is what I was meant to do
Everything I told you is what I've been through
And everywhere I been, I was for a reason
Walk through the desert, ended up freezin'
Start there, end up where?
And now they know, whatever which way they go

Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)

Diplomats, Young Guru, Jim Jones, Santana
Freaky, came in second half
Shit man, only thing we really wanna know right now is
What? Is what's really good? That's the question

Suicide sickness, child negligence
Homicide fingerprints, wild evidence, but what?
But thou shall, respect me bloa, bloa
Clap, clap, pow, pow, bow down, nigga

Be in Columbus never seen Bow Wow, nope
We big dogs, all on the chow down
Chow and Mr. Giles lay back
Santana locked up, get 'em out asap

Aight, now boy, not tonight
I where a bomb to the court like it's a icey white
I'm real icey right, still in the hood
But the question for y'all is what's really good?

Nothing, see me on fifty five, black scooped it up
A K activated, act stupid, one did act stupid
Mac had to move it, from the hood like
What's really good?

I had to lay 'em down, clip him up, sprayed around
Split him up, he played the ground, leave, nine stayed around
Outlaw on the street, shot four from the three
Southpaw Portuguese, what's really good?

To all my ladies, ghetto to ghetto
Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos
Hello, Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know, what's really good?

All my niggaz, block for block
Rock for rock, top for top
Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood
And niggaz wanna know, what's really good?

Okay I admit, I mean they said I was trippin' had to re-edit the spin
Forty four lead when I'm spitting shots to the head of my victims
Big deserts we grippin' to dry out, you in the desert is slippin'

They go through extreme measures to get 'em
Them chains and them treasures the glistening
You got three hideouts, a bed in the system
My brethren I miss them, so please tell me y'all what's really good?

Top of the drop when it's missing
My block when it's clickin'
These rocks when they glistening
What's really good?

One forty fifth on this crunk, big forty fifth in my trunk
Big gouty wrists on you chumps, what's really good?
Mostly me and sometimes them
But mostly me, oh shit man, that's one time them

Squally, so through your set up please
Let me know if you're really good
And let me know if you really hood

All my ladies, ghetto to ghetto
Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos
Hello, Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know, what's really good?

All my niggaz, block for block
Rock for rock, top for top
Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood
And niggaz wanna know, what's really good?

I like this beat, drums and bells
Remind of bullets, bodies, guns and shells
I don't talk the verse, Polly wanna cracker
When she on the stand, you probably wanna smack her

Probably wanna clap her, end your day properly
Air the shit out like the end of State Property
No run away robber, gunner stay half of me
The end I see prophecy, what's really good?

I'm in the buggy mon', with the rugby on
Air Force Ones, looking like you Lucky Charms
Lotta dudes, yelling out fuck me, uh?
I'll blow this bitch dog, what the fuck we on

It's Santana, I'm straight out the box homey
Straight to the stoop, straight to the booth
When I stepped out the box homey
I still got the sun of the box on me
Grimy clothes, funky arms, my socks dirty

I told you I can count on my boy
I'm in trouble, needed bail money, dialed on my boy
Shit and just when I thought it was getting worst
I was bailed out scot-free, spittin' this verse, uh-huh

You don't sit in the dirt, clips'll disperse
What's really good? Me motherfucker
Don't play with this, I'm so great at this
Santana, bandanna, release the eight a spit

To all my ladies, ghetto to ghetto
Heals, sneakers, slipper stilettos
Hello, Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know, what's really good?

Once again it's the darker nigga
Hit or spark a nigga, break apart a nigga
But the dog is bigger, under stress
So unless you're wanting to bless to the chest
These slugs from his liver rest rest!
Or the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga
Dumb sex, motherfucker feeding dirt on a nigga
My hands stay dirty, cause I play dirty the mob way
You don't know? fuck it find out the hard
A nigga's job is never done
I handle my business how it come
And there's never been a one on one
Nor has there been a problem, I dissolve them
I'm like salt, lock it up
Hate to fall but never wreck his car
And it's my fault, keep nigga on point ducking down
Nigga like you need to get bust you fucking clown
I extort to support my peeps
And hold down the fort, never get caught cause I creeps nigga!

I'm at the crossroads, look but I'm not really sure which way to go
Should I play that low for what I did the other day
They on their way to float, got me striking this random
I can't stand em, fake ass niggas want to be the Phantom
Looking over my shoulder, cause it's colder than it was
And start shorty, because I'm a little older than 'cause
And the buzz from the saw, wit the chain to your brain
Will turn that big nigga to a fucking stain
That pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute
But I'm goin' die by it cause I'm like knee deep in it
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit
Cause when you look in my face you see that hard shit
Cause I done been to hell and back I ain't wit selling crack
I'd rather rob a nigga leave him wit a shell up in his back
On the real just to show proof, hit the G.W.B.
And blow the whole roof off the toll booth bitch ass nigga!

[Chorus]

When I crawl, leave a nigga sprawled out after I spoke em
I'll slit his throat, dick in the mud and let his blood choke em
Up north niggas get the pick stuck up in em
And in the streets bitches get the dick stuck up in em
My M.O. is man-slaughter kid
Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did
Slid, cause I got to slide when the dirt is done
A homicide but they want me on the Murder 1
But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight
Stay outta sight while it's light, and then come out at night
To make moves again, stomp and bruise again
I know I'm going to hell cause I choose to sin
All my motherfucking life I been the Devil's advocate
Now niggas never even knew the devil had a kid
But he does and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw
You'll know what I'll split your motherfucking brains for

Suck my dick, behind my back dog ain't shit
Well this is it, from now on if you ain't out the camp
We out to clamp, put 'em up against the champ
You bitch

[Chorus x2]
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
It's just D
And the dog is out, c'mon c'mon

[DMX]
I don't think you cats see too clearly
If it ain't that you must be deaf, cause y'all niggaz don't hear me
But I know I got you scared to death
How many other niggaz you know when you see 'em make you hold your breath?
All a nigga did was take a pause
Did a couple of movies and you thought this whole rap shit was yours?
Stop being greedy, when was the last time you gave to the needy
Believe me, I run through niggaz like hallways with the cops behind
Give it to a nigga all day cause I pops the nine
Man listen, if you don't want to see your man missin, man listen
I get dough like a nigga in a up north flick
And still roll like a nigga on some up north shit
The way dog flip out, cats'll never understand
Niggaz be like ""X I thought I was your man!""
Not!

[Chorus]

This is dedicated to, this is dedicated to
The streets, this is dedicated to

My dogs is dogs that love to brawl
Bring as many as you got cause we gon fuck 'em all
Dicksucked in the hall
The same shorty that's puttin any work on her knees
I'm duckin her call
A dog is a dog is a dog for life, dog been a dog, dog in your wife
I got kids this age
But let 'em keep talkin slick and I'm gon put somethin hot up in his ribcage

It's big dog baby
Gettin down like what
See I'm a thorough bread
I don't fuck wit much
Bloodline is
Where the pups at
They off the Grand Champ
Yea what black
Don't nothin move less
Dog say so
Cats clueless
About the way it go
Off the chain I got
At least 3 kills
Even though my last album only did 3 mil
I still give em chill
'cause they feel dog
I can't help what it is
Shit is real dog
You must have thought that
It was a joke or somethin
Now you done fucked around
And got your man choked for frontin
Now hold up playa
'cause I don't play those games
And don't ask me shit
'cause I don't say no names
See what I know I'm taking
To the fuckin grave
So keep knockin 'cause you ain't gettin a fuckin thing

Ay yo
Who we be was off the last joint
But now it's who we see
And we forget the last joint
Cats ain't never walked like X
Even before coochie rapper talked like sex
I've been around since at least 83
So ain't no sense in you motherfuckers hatin me
'cause I'm gon be here when you cats is gone
And other cats is on
Another batch is born
Don't give a fuck
Bout none of why'all
Fuck each and every one of why'all
'cause I done done it all
Been where ya at
Been where ya goin
Then brought it back
I tried to tell ya bout it
But you wouldn't listen
Now I'm gonna take you to the hood
'cause the hood will listen
I wish you woulda listened
'cause then you woulda known
That it's only right
To give a dog a bone
Bitch
[Chorus x2]
Aw Man
There are some things I can't stand
When a nigga holla want to shake my left hand
When a nigga follow 'cause he actin like my man
Nigga might as well swallow 'cause he actin like a fan
And I got balls like you do
Man I got paul to pull through you
Stan don't they know how we do
In to the streets with our hearts to the people
Gots to give a little to get somethin back
And what you usually give see you ain't nothin black
But when you don't give then it won't last
His shit will disappear like wit a nigga that smoked fast
You'll get broke fast
That's the lord's will
Hold up I think somebody's a the door
Shhh chill
You sit right there
I'm gonna answer that
'cause when I finish poppin ain't nobody answerin back

Once again it's the darker nigga
Hit or spark a nigga, break apart a nigga
But the dog is bigger, under stress
So unless you're wanting to bless to the chest
These slugs from his liver rest rest
Or the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga
Dump six motherfuckin feet of dirt on a nigga
My hands stay dirty, cause I play dirty the mob way
You don't know, fuck it find out the hard
A nigga's job is never done
I handle my business how it come
And there's never been a one on one
There hasn't been a problem, I dissolve em like salt, lock it up
Hate to fall but never wreck his car
And it's my fault, keep niggas on point ducking down
Niggas like you need to get bust you fucking clown
I extort to support my peeps
And hold down the fort, never get caught cause I creeps nigga

I'm at the crossroads, look but I'm not really sure which way to go
Should I play that low for what I did the other day
They on their way to float, got me striking this random
I can't stand em, fake-ass niggas want to be the Phantom
Looking over my shoulder, cause it's colder than it was
And start shorty, because I'm a little older than cuz
And the buzz from the saw, wit the chain to your brain
Will turn that big nigga to a fucking stain
The pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute
But I'm gon die by it cause I'm like knee-deep in it
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit
Cause when you look in my face you see that hard shit
Cause I done been to hell and back I ain't wit selling crack
I'd rather rob a nigga leave him wit a shell up in his back
On the real just to show proof, hit the G.W.B
And blow the whole roof off the toll booth bitch ass nigga

Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor

Get it, get it on the floor
Get it on the floor
Get it, get it on the floor

When I crawl, leave a nigga sprawled out after I spoke em
I'll slit his throat, dick in the mud and let his blood choke em
Up north niggas get the pick stuck up in em
And in the streets bitches get the dick stuck up in em
My M.O. is man-slaughter kid
Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did
Slid, cause I got to slide when the dirt is done
A homicide but they want me on the Murder 1
But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight
Stay outta sight while it's light, and then come out at night
To make moves again, stomp and bruise again
I know I'm going to hell cause I choose to sin
All my motherfucking life I been the Devil's advocate
Now niggas never even knew the devil had a kid
But he does and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw
You'll know what I'll split your motherfucking brains for

Father thank you for makin me righteous
And accepted through the blood of Jesus
Because of that I am blessed and highly favored by you
I am the object of your affection
Your favors surround me as a shield
And the first thing that people come in contact with is my favorite shield
Thank you that I have favor with you and man today
All day long, people go out of their way to bless and to help me
I have favor with everyone that I deal with today
Doors that were once closed are now open for me
I receive preferential treatment and I have special privileges
I am God's favorite child
No good thing will he withhold from me
Because of God's favor my enemies cannot triumph over me
I have supernatural increase in promotions
I declare restoration of everything
That the devil has stolen from me
I have honor in the midst of my adversaries
And an increase of assets
Especially in real estate and an expansion of territory
Because I am highly favored by God I experience great victories
Supernatural turn-arounds and miraculous breakthroughs
In the midst of great impossibilities
I receive recognition, prominence and honor
Petitions are granted to me even by ungodly authorities
Policies, rules, regulations and laws
Are changed and reversed on my behalf
I win battles that I don't even have to fight
Because God fights them for me
This is the day, the set time the designated moment
For me to experience the free favors of God
That profusely and lavishly abound on my behalf

Give niggaz a break, nah; I gotta chase mine

Don't wear your watch around me nigga I take time
Like niggaz that them blue tried to like
I turn men to mice, canary yellow my ice
And Ruff Ryde on anybody, to be precise

But I handle my business like I'm supposed to
When you go in the precinct, that's the only time you see my poster
But I could post up and get rid of my pieces
I own collies sellin' rocks the size of Domino pizzas

I'm untouchable, nigga

Drive by and put your brains on the side of the bar
Sheek heavy in the hood (uh-huh)
And I don't mean cause I gained weight in the hood (nah)
My aim is good, aiyyo X what they want it to be here?

Our hammer's cocked, outside of the house on the lawn chair
Yeah nigga what? The new rap LeBron's here
Get 'em dog, we the new America's nightmare
And we don't say much, we just get it on

That's why we don't get touched, y'all like a dutch
Hands all on you, I'm tryna warn you

And them pretty ass shades, can stay on your face

You motherfuckers got me back on my grizzly, I'm back on the grind
I'm back to the streets, catch a beef, come back with the nine
I'll murder ya man, come back with his shines

I tote two guns, I don't care if you box, I don't care if you blind
I spit in your eye like niggaz is eatin, I'm splittin the pies
Frank Nitty your rap, how gritty am I? The city is mine
Yeah, you get in my way I pity your moms

Yeah, my block is real, my niggaz is armed
My borough is thorough, we bang with each other
I'm switchin' my diamonds and changin' the color
with change of weather, canary in the sun, uhh

I bury ya nigga then bury the gun, X what up?
Me and you is untouchable (uh-huh)
We both had bricks they couldn't sniff cause the coke was uncrushable

I was gonna make it happen, that's the way I felt
You know Philly never scared, play the cards we dealt
Doin' it my way, you bitches strugglin' for help

I hear your rumors and your so-called beefs
But it's a different story any time we meet in the streets
I'm fully in it bitch, your shit is juvenile to me
We can squash it, go 'head let you warm up the crowd for me

I hate to even be like this, y'all bring it out
To tell the truth it excites me, I scream it out
Sick with it, ain't a bitch that can get wid'dit
Admit it, I'm that bitch you can't live wid'dit

And I'ma keep it comin long as I'm here

Turn it up and give me somethin' to burn
That boy 'Kiss is a hell of a man
Treat your life like a cell phone, so try to get a helluva plan
'Cause most dudes left the hood broke

A couple knew what they was doin, so they came back like good coke
Down South they'll tell you 'Kiss is good folk (that's right)
Up North I hit my niggaz off with good smoke
Out West they ridin with me, now I'm back hard

I'm just worried bout the rats that's in my back yard
Hated by many, confronted by none
I trust two guys, one's God, and one is my gun
Jada is the nice guy, 'Kiss is the monster

Yeah, what? New DMX

Niggaz is scared to fuck with the Dog 'cause I'm shady
You remember that kid from runnin'
Up an' down from Buildin' 80?
Highs are extreme, lows are suicidal
Got me reachin' for the Bible 'cause I think I'm genocidal

Fakers think I'm bluffin' but I'm not
Say that I be buggin' 'cause I be makin' it hot
Knowin' all I got is my, nuts an' my word
Though I'm never seen, the Dark is always heard

I speak for those who speak with glocks
From frequent blocks, where the objective
Is to put in twelve, stay alive an' leave in knots
From little rocks bein' sold, then motherfucker
If you live to see 40, then you old

An' me bein' the way I am, if the Devil close to me
That's the reason why I'm never I'm supposed to be
I chose to be on some Dark shit
Rip apart shit an' start shit, until whenever I depart, bitch

The hard shit will leave yo' ass stretched laid the fuck out
I'm on the edge, life is played out, I made out
Kinda good with the last couple of runs
Up the coast with it, couple of keys, couple of guns

The funds wasn't the issue, it was other shit
That had me flippin' on my brother's shit
Stealin' from my mother's shit
Cry by myself, I couldn't hide form myself
An' if I push my wig back, then I die by myself
'Cause it gets

Deeper an' deeper
With every move I make I'm fallin'
Deeper an' deeper
These souls from underground keep callin'

Deeper an' deeper
With every move I make I'm fallin'
Deeper an' deeper
These souls from underground keep callin'

Why is it that I do what I do?
Why is it that, only to these streets can I be true?
I ain't never been shit, my peoples been told me so
Hold me, yo, niggaz don't, know me, yo

'Cause they ain't out that mob that's out to get niggaz
Rip niggaz, split niggaz when you hit niggaz
Long as there's bodies to be caught
There's shotties to be bought
Hired that transport, fake Gotti's to extort

I cry for help but niggaz don't hear me
Niggaz don't understand me, that's why niggaz fear me
Hit the old neighborhood 'cause I'm 'bout to end it
Stressin' shit that I went through an' what I been did

Niggaz, I offended, will have to take it as a loss
'Cause in a minute, what I'm thinkin'
Is about to look like sauce, gots to pay the cost
An' this time it's gon' cost you my life
My love to my children an' my wife

Step to the last, would I, could I, should I?
Really understand with, seein with my good eye
The hood, I, came up in showed no mercy
Unforgiven of the many plagues that cursed me

The worst we went through would make a, grown man fumble
Learnin' to walk an' it hurts when you stumble
Figure out the jumble an' you live, if not you die
On my knees, hands up to the sky, why?

Deeper an' deeper
With every move I make I'm fallin'

And said that I'ma be that seed
That doesn't need much to succeed
Strapped with mad greed
And a heart that doesn't bleed
I'm ready for the world or at least I thought I was
Bagging niggas when I caught a buzz
For thinking about how short I was
Going too fast, it wouldn't last but yo I couldn't tell
Group homes and institutions, prepared my ass for jail
They put me in a situation forcing me to be a man
When I was just learning to stand without a helping hand
Damn, was it my fault, something I did
To make a father leave his first kid at seven doin my first bid
Back on the scene at fourteen with a scheme
To get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream
And by all means I will be living high off the hog
And I never gave a fuck about much but my dog
That's my only muthafucka I had offered my last
Just another little nigga headed nowhere fast

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

That ain't the half shit get's worse as I get older
Actions become bolder, heart got colder
Chip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch
Didn't need a clique 'cause I scared a nigga that much
One deep with the pit starting shit for kicks
Catching Vicks throwing bricks gettin by being slick
Used to get high to get by used to have to puff my L
In the morning before I get fly
Ate something a couple of forties made me hate something
I did some coke now I'm ready to take something
Three years later showing signs of stress
Didn't keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed
I'm possessed by the darker side living the cruddy life
Shit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife
Wanna make records but I'm fucking it up
I'm slippin', I'm falling, I can't get up

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Wasn't long before I hit rock bottom
Niggas talking shit was like damn look how that rock got him
Open like a window
No more endo
Look at a video
Sayin' to myself that could've been yo
Ass on the TV
Believe me, it could be done
Something's got to give
Gots to change 'cause I've got a son
I gots to do the right thing for shorty
And that means no more gettin' high, drinkin' 40s
So I get back looking type slick again
Fake niggas jump back on my dick again
Nothing but love for those that know how it feel
And much respect to all my niggas that kept it real
Kept a nigga strong, kept a nigga from doing wrong
Niggas know who they is and this is yo fucking song
And to my boo who stuck with a nigga through
All the bullshit you'll get yours because it's due

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ay yo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up

Let it rush through your veins, cause I'ma be the one
To step up and put a hundred thousand dollars on the game
Got a pocket full of change and they see-note stacks
Busting dominoes, spades, Cee-lo, craps
We shooting pool at the Luda-plex, I slap a hundred on the table
Just to see if any fools want to do it next
I got games galore, I got game for sure
And when I win I spit game to whores (yep)
Or double it back, I'll double the stacks
Throw a dub, a big face or double the stack (boy)
And we can 'bout anything that you want to do
But come up short and oh the things that the gun'll do
Throw in the towel cause I'm making 'em sweat
Or put your house on the line and I can cover the bet
So hurry up and come get some, if you want some
You know the phrase, scared money don't make none!

Throw some money on the books, cause I know how to call 'em

Counting green in the DROP, because whether legal or illegal
All my people bring the strength to the block
Yes sir, I thought you knew it, we loco
We'll bet on anything, just to see if anybody's goin' do it
It's people living they life coming up off change
And hustlers paying they bills coming up off games
Whether it's Madden or it's Live, tell 'em pick up the sticks
They call me Mr. Put-Down-Two-And-Pick-Up-Six
Then walk away with a clean slate, catch me out in A.C.

So all my ramblers, runners and money scramblers
Put your drinks up to all compulsive gamblers

DMX,"I come to you hungry and tired
You give food and let me sleep
I come to you weak
You give strength and that's deep
You called me a sheep
And led me to green pastures
Only asking that I keep the focus
Between the chapters
You give me the word and only acts I interpret
And give me the eyes so I can recognize the serpent
You know I ain't perfect, but you'll like me to try
And just like the devil who wants me to lie
Till I die
Lord why is it that, that I go through so much pain
All I saw was black and all I felt was rain
I come to you because it's you that knows
To show me that everything is black
Because me eyes were closed
You give me the light and let me bask in your glory

So it was only right that when you ask for this story
I put together to do all dogs some good
All dogs being all the brothers and sisters in the hood
Plenty of times you sent help my way but I hid
I remember once you held me close but I slid
There was something that I just had to see
That you wanted me to see so I can be what you wanted me to be
And I think I am seeing it but I don't feel the same
Matter of fact I know I have seen it I can feel the change
And it's strange almost got me beating down your door
But I have never known love like this before
It's a wonderful feeling to get away from the pain
And up under the ceiling I get away from the rain
And the strain that I feel when I'm here is gone
I know real so I wipe away the tears son
And I almost lost faith in you when you took my man Monty
Pass over chase a brother down
And I fear that what I saying won't be heard until I'm gone
But it's all good, Cause I didn't expect to live long
So if it takes for me to suffer for me brother to see the light
Give me pain till I die but please lord treat him right",The Prayer IV [DVD],2005

Back out to tape back out to rape
Back off the chains so please back out the way

Don't give a fuck what a nigga say no matter who he sound like

Cats and dogs hold up it is cats and dogs
Keep fucking with the dog its gonna be cats in the morgue

Stop but don't hate 'cause everybody got a lil blood to donate
Thugs'll go ape the women'll come around
Shortly after that is when the jealousy sets in then they'll shut it down

Keep a couple of niggaz with me that'll bang you down
Now lil mama put switches on and make it jump
Before me you needed Lil Jon to make it crunk
Naw for real come to Cali player take ya pump
My New York niggaz leave y'all wit razor bumps
Now pappa raised a rolling stone I feel like pops
In the absence of Makaveli I feel like Pac

Showed up at the federal court in Queens Wednesday
To accept a plea agreement
Inside the courthouse, D-M-X signed autographs with a sketch artist over the face
As well as the fans caught off guard
By this star's appearances

[Chorus]
My baby motha be buggin' soon as I walked in the door
Got me like ""I ain't fuckin' with that bitch no more""
Don't even like so I can't fuck with her
Thinkin' cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her, nah
(Repeat)

My baby's motha be buggin', she wanna blast stick bitches
One of them talk shit, and then get they ass kicked bitches
Once upon a story, y'all niggas know the story
And that everything is lovely when it's all about the glory
But soon as shit hit the fan, honies be wanna take the kid and scram
I'm having bad thoughts, don't like how dark it's getting man
From the time I wake up and get dressed
I get stressed, and hardly ever get rest
It's oh-five, so I'm on some different shit cousin
She ain't gon have me liftin' through that riffin' shit cousin
I got moves to make and mad shit to do
Her friends are looking good so I might hit the crew
It's like one and two that might get a nigga that big and happy
And I know them bitches will fuck me cause when I see 'em, they be winkin' at me
You listenin' thinkin' that's a crazy brother
But I'm gon have to be a father who ain't fuckin' with his baby motha

[Chorus: x2]

Bitches be callin' the cops, thinkin' they callin' the shots
Takin' the dude with the bag, baby it's all in the pops
And do yo thing, cause I'm doin' mine boo
A nigga just been chillin', I been just fine, and you?
I kicked it with my honey and she put me on to something
You gon think until you really see me gon, I'm frontin'
Maybe if you kept your friends of respectable distance
Out of our business, I wouldn't have to come and visit
I thought you knew, let the shit you like switchin' clothes
When them bitches through, ain't to co sure when they home
But that ain't never stopped yo ass from passin' on the Guess
Askin' for that Cougie sweater, patten up the breast
Patten up the butt, but you think niggas is stupid
Last week yo shit was like the dog, look at it now, too big
I ain't goin' blow yo shit no more, I shouldn't be even did that
Cause you my baby motha, and I'm a always hit that

Give a hell what you say (You don't)
I ain't never gon go away (You won't)
I'm a stalk you till I find you (Been there)
Turn around and be right behind you (Still there)
Be in the bushes outside yo house
Just waitin' for you to come out
Cause I'm a stupid bitch (I know)
A real fuckin' stupid bitch (I know)
Ain't nothing but a stupid bitch

[Chorus: x2]

My baby motha be buggin' soon as I walked in the door
Got me like ""I ain't fuckin' with this bitch no more""
Give me a Puerto Rican honey that cook rice and beans
And hair down to her ass, who looks nice in them jeans
So I can be like ""Damn, you looking good and I wanna fuck""
But you a chicken so when I'm finish, I got a duck
Plus, you don't wanna be around and see what honey do
And plenty comin' through, she comin' through with that twenty-two
Trust me, you don't need that in your life
Oh y'all bitches already know, I got a wife
You's a stupid bitch, a real fuckin' stupid bitch
You ain't nothing but a stupid bitch. Bitch!

Give a hell what you say (You don't)
I ain't never goin' go away (You won't)
I'm a stalk you till I find you (Been there)
Turn around and be right behind you (Still there)
Be in the bushes outside yo house
Just waitin' for you to come out
Cause I'm a stupid bitch (I know)
A real fuckin' stupid bitch (I know)
Ain't nothing but a stupid bitch

Yea, uh, from 80 school street to way across town
Cats knew how I got down 'cause word got around
I was that robbery kid with no gun and no mask
Catch a nigga out the door slippin', that's yo ass

Didn't laugh much 'cause I didn't have much
Life was like a stick, half gas, half clutch
Meaning half good and half bad
It was good if I caught a good vic, if I didn't, I was bad

Took it out on my regulars, I come through
And if niggaz was broke, I took watches and sneakers
Went to jail a few times but that didn't stop me
All it taught me was, how not to be sloppy

An older cat robbed me when I was like ten
If anybody wanted to help, they should've did it then
But they didn't and all it did was release the beast
So I'ma feast on whatever I come across in the streets

I had a ""S"" on my chest, fuck the vest
Did robberies with some cats and robbed the rest
Other times, I came through with just me and my dog
We'd clear out the whole fuckin' block 'cause we went hard

I bag some niggaz I knew and some niggaz I didn't
I ain't a fuck either way, it was no bullshittin'
I'm a cruddy nigga out to get money
And a couple of slugs is the only thing anybody took from me

Run up on a cat smooth like, put it in his left ear
Give up the money, the jewelry or get left here
Keep thinking it's a game and play, let's get popped
See how much fun you having, when your heart be stopped

Shut 'em down, open up shop, blow off a nigga top
Somebody call the cops, but it's too late
'Cause I'm a hit you in the face
And what will kill you will be somethin' that you ate

If pain is love, why hide my pain with drugs?
Choke off haze and sell attics coke for days
Same clothes, no soap to shave
And I still got a gun on my hip for your open grave

We used to get robbery vics
Until my man got killed for his whip on some robbery shit
Then I switched to the weed and started sellin' crack
But I will pull a steel and put a shell up in ya back

I feel like all my life, I was held up in a trap
Like if I go to heaven, maybe hell will want me back
But all I really want is [Incomprehensible]
And a model bitch sitting with a head up in my lap

But since no doe, don't spin
And my pant's hole got hole within, I got to fold 'em in

I wish I could open up the doors and let 'em blow at the wind

I can't see shit cause you always on my mind

But I'm a dog so I didn't sweat her
And it wasn't bout the cheddar, I don't trick
I got two things for bitches, couple of jokes and some dick
Yeah the kid talk slick but that's not what I'm about

After lookin at it, was life really fair?
Did you burn any bridges? Did you make amends?
Did you ask God for forgiveness for your sins?
What is Heaven like? If you could come back, should you?
If you could communicate for a moment there, would you?
... Just questions that we ask ourselves, every day (wanna know)

DMX,"Ask me if I cry
I'll tell you why I can, come on

I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song

I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song

How I live is simple, walk through the streets
Talk to the beats, New York, I'ma eat
I ain't never had a problem with survivin'
No problems with gettin' down, bustin' my *** or Ruff Rydin'

Cats talk slick but I talk slicker
My *** for real 'cause I'm that ***
Reason that you hurtin' is you gotta take your problems
Straight to the Lord, no one, only He can solve 'em

See what I see but look through my eyes
The Devil is a liar, the truth never lies
We all got issues, s*** that we go through
S*** that we been through, s*** that we won't do

The pain that we bring upon ourself
For no reason, is the worst
That's why I say I'm blessed with the curse
The Lord gave it all to me and in the process
I lost my soul, damn, Devil got a hold

In my mind, I'm like a little boy lost in crime
Like the healthy *** that the Devil forced into dyin'
Lord knows I'm tryin' but at the same time
You hit a *** with the weight of the world
Why you gave it to Earl?

I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on

I'ma let life be my song

I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song

To live is to suffer and I'm livin' it up
Face everyday chin up, I ain't givin' it up
If I ain't givin' a ***, then who will?
So I hope for the best, knowin' that it's all uphill

Sometimes I wonder what life's about
Sometimes I wonder why I take the wrong route
Then turn around and go out and no doubt
The fate is mine is blind
So whatever, *** it, I'ma roll out

We all go through the motions
We get different notions
We each have our own ocean
That we can either drown in or float
Like the vessels that we are
Vessels that would carry many far

You don't know what to say when you talkin'
We don't know who you gon' see when you walkin'
If you don't know how much of what you do is dirt
3 things you don't know could get you hurt

I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song

I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong
'Til the dead and gone, it's on
What y'all really want? Bring it on
I'ma let life be my song

I'm gonna go hard whether I'm right or wrong

In the name of Jesus
Let us pray
Father please walk with us through the bad times as well as the good
May we be heard and understood from the suburbs to the hood
May you judge us by our hearts and not by our mistakes
And see that we get a breakthrough however long that it takes
May you fill that void in our souls that will lay our fears to rest
Cause there is no way we can live for Jesus when we're liven in the flesh
So I pray that you allow our sprits to be born
Grow strong, move on, know right from wrong
First John, chapter two, verse 15
do not love the world or anything in the world
and we know what that means, but listen
We know the distance we need to be away from fire to keep it missin
That doesn't mean we'll listen
Lord you take care of fools and babies
You teach women to honor their men and men respect their ladies
But lately so many of us have gone a stray
Doing wrong for so long that we've forgotten the way
Please bring us back home, instill in us the word which is our backbone
We're just children that act grown
There is so much that we're entitled to yet we receive so little
Cause in this time of spiritual warfare we're comfortable in the middle
So I pray that you open our eyes
Give us the annointing to recognize the devil and his lies
If we keep our actions wise and our prays sincere
Our heads to the sky you will demonist our fears
In Jesus' mighty name we have prayed
Amen and amen",The Prayer VI,2006

My homeboyz, the only thing a nigga got left

I love my niggas to death, we ain't shit without our homeboyz
You know what time it is
I ain't shit without my homeboyz
Hey, tell 'em the story how you came up, nigga

Now I was born alone
Took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggas is so close, it's complicated

One nigga smokin' and drinkin' and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son we all happy
'Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride

To rectify the problem, motherfuckers they all die
Been tryin' to make a million, by hustlin' since my adolescence
From crack dealin' to rap villain, my new profession
Who wanna see me at eight deep, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me

Bustin' with automatic straps
My raw raps like good crack
Niggas fiendin', I got 'em comin' back
Until I die, they label me as a ridah
Forever, my niggas be together

Ain't shit without your homeboyz
Thug niggas, I love niggas
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
Without your homeboyz

The only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggas to death
We ain't shit without our homeboyz
(Without our homeboyz)

I suck it all up like a sicka fly

But shit happens and fuck it, you would of did ya dirt
Niggaz is wonderin' how the fuck you hid your skirt
Right under they eyes like a surprise to the guys
Just one of their man's was a bitch in disguise

I'm fuckin' with cats and order heads and slaughter more kids
Let me hollar at y'all that wanna borrow the raw shit
Knahmean? I'm just robbin' to eat
And there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbin' the street
When we starve then we eat whatever's there
Come on you know, the code in the street, whatever's fair
Blood stains and chalk, means your man couldn't walk
After the talk, about him knockin'
On eleven thirty three of New York

Transformin' us niggaz so get it quick
You know for real that nigga can't fuckin' suck my dick
And it's gon' take all these niggaz in the rap game
To barely move me, 'cause when I blow shit up
I have niggaz fallin' like white bitches in a scary movie
Argh! You know I don't know how to act
Get too close to niggaz, it's like ""Protected by Viper, stand back""

What type of games are being played, how's it going down?
It's on till it's gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me, or what? They gon' try to give me a nut
Just honeys want to give me the butt, what?

I'm politicking with this chicken, wondering if I'm a creep her
Little hood rat bitch from 25th named Tamika
Coming through, like I do, you know, getting my bark on
Knew she was a thug 'cause when I met her, she had a scarf on
Fifty-four, eleven, size seven in girls
Baby face, would look like she was eleven with curls
Girlfriend, (what), remember me from way back; I'm the same cat
With the wave cap, the motherfucker that TNT used to blaze at
Still here, so it's all good
Oh, you know my niggas Rich and them doing they thing on 35th Ave.
It's a small hood, and it's all wood, so let me get that number, hook it up, a'ight
Hit you on the jack later on, see wassup
Talking to shorty made me want to do something nice
Looking at that ass made me want to do something tonight
And I know right when I see right; shorty lookin' like she tight
She bite, better give a nigga the green light; we might...

[Chorus x 2]

I'm getting at shorty, like what you need, what you want?
Offer nothing 'cause I got you, but you frontin'
I see you with your baby father but it don't matter
Since you gave me the pussy, that ass is getting fatter
Let that nigga play daddy, make moves with me
I done kept it more than real, Boo, can't lose with me
Heard he smacked you 'cause you said my name while y'all was sexin'
Ran up on this cat he thought was me and started flexin'
You know I ain't even with that
So he gon' have to get that just on TV
Try to creep me? (What?) Leave that nigga sleepy
On the strength of you, and that's your kid's daddy
I ain't gon' send him on his way, put him up in that big caddy
But let him know, never mind, yo, I need you to go, take this snow up to one-five-oh, see Joe
Get that, come back with that, and we can split that, sit back, fuck, puff a L, forget that
You wit' that?

[Chorus x 2]

Hey yo, this chicken got me digging her moves 'cause she smooth
Win to lose, whoever she choose gets the dues
Respect is not expected but it's given 'cause it's real
Being neglected's the norm, expected, the deal
Lie, cheat, and steal for me
Putting something in a nigga's wig if you squeal for me, kill for me
You still with me 'cause we get down like what
Told you it's from the dog, it ain't all about a nut
I'm gon' be fair, try to be there; we gon' see then
Hit me with the question, Boo, that answer gon' be ""yeah""
See there, something can go wrong, it does
Loved it, let it go; but it came back, that's how strong it was
But she belonged to cuz, couldn't belong to me
Had two kids by this nigga, it was wrong for me
But we gon' always be, best of friends (Ha ha)
Mad love, Boo, to the end (Ha ha)

With his own little mob 
Was it worth goin' back to the Earth so soon 
Worth makin' my shit go boom 
To your own doom, from the graveyards 
Till there's no room 
Fuck you know about a pine box 
Money goin' out with nine Glocks 
On top of that same nigga when they pull with they nine shots 
Feel like killin' for your crew 
I ain't gon' rest

Then watch your loins spill out your vest 
You best get on some act your age shit

I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put your somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
You'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on front teeth, you think I'm sweet?
Want heat? One deep, leave him behind, front seat

Aiyyo, one two three four
Five six seven
Blaze the hot trizack
Shine like heaven
Seven six five four
Three two one
Come on Mr. Smith, come get some!

When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed (yeah, word up)
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin' on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'm a do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis (""LL Cool J is hard"")
Every little boy want to pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like pickin' up a ball, playin' with Mike
Swingin' at Ken Griffey or challengin' Roy to a fight
Snappin', you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin' overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin a tiger cub to his knees (uh)
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't want to borrow that, you want to idolize
And you don't want to make me mad nigga you want to socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line

Y'all make it up in the booth
Till a nigga lose his tooth over something he didn’t plan on
Wasn’t prepared for, really couldn’t stand on

Fuck it, turn the cam on, tie his feet and his hands up and watch him
I’ll be back up with that heat to get his tan on
Now that’s for fucking with me
And that’s for my dog
This because where you're going you're not gonna need that arm
The street’s is talking, Uh oh, here they come
Thirsty for that blood, Red rum, red rum
Do you know how it feels to be so mad you would kill?
Or to be so trapped when you scream your throat cuts like jagged pills?
And whenever you close your eyes everything inside you dies
And all the ‘high’s, crimes, and lies’ come alive muthafucka

I swear that I can feel 'em fucking with me
Every night I feel 'em fucking with me
Please God tell these demons stop fucking with me
Every God damn night I feel 'em fucking with me
Why? Please God",D3mons,2012

Uh, I got to remind y'all niggas
What the flow is all about
Huh, its about this
Anywhere from forty-eight and up

Straight, you feel me?
Fifty fifty

Aiyyo, I gots to hear the beat so I can eat, ahight?
If I can't live, you can't live, ain't nothin sweet
Bitch ass niggas think its all about Versace
A week later them niggas talkin about (Yo, X got me)
I thought he was my man, but he act like he ain't know me
I knew he had the joint, but I didn't want to make him show me
That nigga be buggin, stickin cats up and random
Doing his dirt and disappearin like the phantom
Niggas can't stand him, but ask me if I care
''cause what I used to give a fuck about, just ain't there
And ain't nothing fair, I knew this for a long time
that's why with ever wrong crime comes anotha strong rhyme
And that's mo' time under the belt, you felt what I had
And I shouldn't have even done it, that's what made this shit sad
I'm doin' bad, but if I gots to feel it, you gots to feel it
And if a nigga can't afford it, I gots to steal it
And that's how real it, GETS, when this shit [hits the fan]
You still tryin to get the man, first catch up with the man
Then we gon' see what'choo made of
If your shit ain't pumpin cool-Aid, what you afraid of?
The monster under the bed, fill ya with four slugs to the head
Or ya babies mother missin for a month, found dead
Worms comin' from places you stuck ya dick in
Maggots got the bitch coverered and the smells sick'nen
Plastic don't hide the smell for too long, I do wrong
And so I don't have nightmares I forget about it, move on
Keep gettin my groove on, ''cause that shit could fuck with'choo
Keep dwellin on it, and its gonna get stuck with you
Niggas try their luck with you, ''cause they smell ass
And money if you pussy, I'm gonna be able to tell fast
Some cop I'm about to smack across the face in this robbery
I'm on a robbin spree, and ain't no STOPPIN ME
On this real, that's why a nigga stay writin
''cause kid this shit is real, what you think we play fightin
You must of saw som'thin funny, or never saw som'thin bloody
Or you don't know I'll bring it to your door ''cause I'm cruddy
Like puddy, when I hold you niggas, I mold you niggas
I done told you niggas, that I been owed you niggas
For that shit you did that you wasn't built for
Shit I guess you didn't know you do get killed for
I done filled niggas up with the extended clip
Its like I blew this joint down with the extended rip
Or that non-stop, when the bomb drops
I'ma take it from where you at and then end up on ya moms block
>From here to Comstock, niggas gettin bust wild
?Cell cagers last night from lock out just died?
Ain't no where to hide, ain't no wear to run
What more can they do to a man that ain't been done
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
Especially if its all over the place, your mind all over his face
How do brains taste, when they mixed with gun powder
Semi to fully automatic makes the gun louder
I got som'thin to fix pain when I kicks game
'Cause I'ma float off more tracks than they sixth train
You 'bout to get flamed, from ash to ashes to DIRT
You gon' go with the dough that your life was worth

Moving, moving because if life stops spinning in the right direction

DMX,"[Chorus]
Keep your head to the sky
Keep your head to the sky

When I think I don’t deserve it, I think about Jesus
And the fact that he was perfect and he thinks that I’m worth it
I know I got a purpose
So when I don’t like what I see in the mirror
I learn to look passed the surface
Believe me God heard this,
'Cause these words came from my heart
I was in pain, it was dark
Then came the spark to light down the road
To let me know that he would lighten up my load
And it’s gon’ get greater, later
God only wants the best for me
But the devil’s a hater
I can see his eyes through the smiles of fake friends
If yall think hate wins just keep waitin'
At the end of the day who’s will will you think will prevail
Or will you live to tell
Miracle after miracle it comes true
The spiritual individual within you

[Chorus]
Keep your head to the sky
Keep your head to the sky

Lord if you hear me,
You know that I’m coming to you sincerely
I need you near me, please feel me
I’m sick and I need for you to heal me
I’m lost and looking for the real me
I’m tired and weary
Haven’t been able to see things clearly
And even though I know you love me dearly
I still get leery
So where does that leave me?
Lost and alone
I wanna call God but it’s like I lost my phone
Every day is a struggle cause I juggle my problems
Need to let go and let God
'Cause only he could solve them
I’m tired of lying to myself
Thinking I could do it on my own
When I get left alone
When the devil sneaks in and creeps in
Knocks on the door lightly than peeks in
And it’s usually around the weekend
Then I get reckless and jump off the deep end
Come on

[Chorus: x4]
Keep your head to the sky
Keep your head to the sky

You didn't bring me this far to let me go

I'm taking half; it's just that simple
Or I can start popping niggas like pimples
I'ma let you call it, you ballin'
'Til you get hit with them hot things, now you're staggering and fallin'
I'm holding up the wall, you got more than enough problems in the floor
You're just wasting a nigga's time; come on, man
I got shit to do, like hit your crew
Might hit your crib, so what that bitch gon' do
Not a damn thing, but dawg's with the program
Beast on that bitch like Conan, whoa man
I'ma go where no man has ever gone
Nigga, when it's on, it's on, I'll let you know when the fuck it's on
I got nothing to hide, but you got a reason to run
Come through like BRRAT, to the squeeze of the gun
And that's just squeezing one, imagine if we all let go
And turn your whole block into a death row

Bark is too strong, hot light is on
Whatever it's gon' be, that's what it is
I didn't stutter, motherfucka, put that on your kids
Built for war, built for raw
Built for more, built from it all for the dog to the floor
I've been getting down before I knew what getting down was
Shit, I just do what a real nigga does
Get anything straight up
If shit starts falling apart, wait up, let's get this rent paid up
So it's square one, and a nigga can't get a fair one at
Any time of the day, but a nigga can run
Keep shit moving, doing what the fuck we be doin'
They're coming to 'em, but I'm running through 'em
I don't need the headache, I've never been talking to death
But I'll fuck you to death; what the fuck you left?
I don't want nothing, but some fucking pussy
I ain't trying to be all cuddled up, talking getting mushy
Been there, done that, with that one back there
From when there was none of that to when there was some of that
Niggas still come back, hood for life
Shit, quiet as a cat nigga, where's my wife?
For the night, that's what it be
Or if its good for tomorrow cause tomorrow well see
Take it one day at a time, my end's in the street
Don't fear my feast, your man's in the heat
That's how the dog gets down on all fours
After a certain hour, I'm knocking on all doors
Anything goes when it's on, motherfucka
Whether you're friend or foe, you gon' lend some dough
And in case you don't know, that nigga don't owe
Whatever I come up on, let that shit go

Giving niggas facelifts and taking it
While making you bleed
And if I got a taste of the shit I'm taking more than you need
