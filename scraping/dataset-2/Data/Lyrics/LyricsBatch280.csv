Fredericks Goldman Jones,"I don't want to lose the good thing that I've got
If I do, I will surely, I will lose a lot

For your love is better than any love other I've know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood
Baby

I got superstitious about you, but I can't take change
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance
But your love is better than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock on wood

It's no secret, but that woman fills my loving cup
She sees, so ready, that I get enough
And her love is better than any other love I've known
It's like thunder
It's like lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood
Baby

Better, yes, better
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) yes, I better
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) oh, knock on wood
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) you know I would, would
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) it's no secret
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) no, oh, better
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) hangin' above me
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) I can't leave her
(yes you better knock, knock, knock on wood) oh no, baby

Knock on wood, woo!",Knock on Wood,1995
Fredericks Goldman Jones,"C'était mois de novembre
Le samedi 17 au soir
Dans ce coin de légende
Où les trains ne mènent nulle part
La chaleur était pesante et le vent chaud incitait à boire
Je suis descendu fourbu tout seul à la petite gare

Il y avait quelque chose dans l'air
Quelque chose de bizarre
Le silence pesant des enfants qui jouaient sur les trottoirs
Les vieux assis sur leurs bancs
Avec leurs drôle de regards
Qui brillaient étrangement, sans rien fixer ni sans rien voir

C'était comme si les femmes et les hommes avaient fuit tout à coup
Un rayon de lune éclairait une orée dans la forêt
Le chemin sentait la menthe, brume blanche jusqu'à mes genoux
Quand j'ai entendu plus loin leurs chants graves qui me guidaient

Il y avait quelque chose dans l'air
Quelque chose de bizarre
Le silence pesant des enfants qui jouaient sur les trottoirs
Les vieux assis sur leurs bancs
Avec leurs drôle de regards
Qui brillaient étrangement sans rien fixer ni sans rien voir

Ils étaient rassemblés autour d'un grand trou vide et tout noir
Ils se balançaient en chantant, les mains tendues vers le maître
Soudain, tout cessa brusquement et son doigt montra juste ma cachette
Venez, nous vous attendions ce soir, vous n'êtes pas en retard

Il y avait quelques chose dans l'air, quelque chose de bizarre
(Je m'en souviens comme si c'était hier)
Le silence pesant des enfants qui jouaient sur les trottoirs
(J'aurais dû m'douter de quelque chose de pas clair)
Les vieux assis sur leurs bancs avec leurs drôle de regards
Qui brillaient étrangement, sans rien fixer ni sans rien voir",Quelque Chose de Bizarre,1995
Fredericks Goldman Jones,"Et si j'étais né en 17 à Leidenstadt
Sur les ruines d'un champ de bataille
Aurais-je été meilleur ou pire que ces gens
Si j'avais été allemand?
Bercé d'humiliation, de haine et d'ignorance
Nourri de rêves de revanche
Aurais-je été de ces improbables consciences
Larmes au milieu d'un torrent
Si j'avais grandi dans les docklands de Belfast
Soldat d'une foi, d'une caste
Aurais-je eu la force envers et contre les miens
De trahir, tendre une main
Si j'étais née blanche et riche à Johannesburg
Entre le pouvoir et la peur
Aurais-je entendu ces cris portés par le vent
Rien ne sera comme avant
On saura jamais c'qu'on a vraiment dans nos ventres
Caché derrière nos apparences
L'âme d'un brave ou d'un complice ou d'un bourreau?
Ou le pire ou le plus beau?
Serions-nous de ceux qui résistent ou bien les moutons d'un troupeau
S'il fallait plus que des mots?

Et si j'étais né en 17 à Leidenstadt
Sur les ruines d'un champ de bataille
Aurais-je été meilleur ou pire que ces gens
Si j'avais été allemand?
Et qu'on nous épargne à toi et moi si possible très longtemps
D'avoir à choisir un camp",Né En 17 a Leidenstadt,2013
Frederico,"Em plena sexta feira
Fui tentar me distrair
Chegando na balada
Toda linda eu te vi

Você no camarote
E eu rodado no pedaço
Caçando um jeitinho
De invadir o seu espaço

Não tenho grana
Não tenho fama
Não tenho carro
Tô de carona

O meu cartão
Foi bloqueado
E o meu limite
Tá estourado

Sou simples
Mas eu te garanto
Eu sei fazer o meu lê lê lê
Lê lê lê
Lê lê lê

Se eu te pegar você vai ver
Você jamais vai me esquecer

Se eu te pegar você vai ver

Você jamais vai me esquecer",Lê Lê Lê,2012
Frederico Ramos,"No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with
But I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

I know for certain
The one I love
I'm through with flirtin'
It's just you I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner
In the corner
Don't go nowhere
What do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me

I don't stay out late
Don't care to go

Frederico Ramos,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2000

Frederik Kempe,"Won’t you trust me now
Won’t you tell me how
I can make you believe in life and love and liberty
Don't you dare, don't you
Trust my word, baby
We would be the first

If you're satisfied
If you think you've tried
Try again
If we do this right
If we really fight

If you want to wait
Don't forget that we promised to be there, now didn't we
Cold and lonely, I
Solved your riddle, I
Made way for you

See the break of dawn
You will be reborn
Take my hand
If you come with me
Let the old things be
We can fly

Frederik Kempe,"I know that you've been hurt before 
 but baby 
 you won't be hurt again no 
 'cause I'm a different man 
 I wish you could understand 
 baby take my hand 
 Chorus: 
 Leave the past behind 
 for this wonder 
 Don't look back again 
 Can't you see this start might be a new beginning now 
 For your broken heart 
 I promise you'll be safe with me 
 forever you'll never be alone 
 I know the pain you feel 
 I know that broken hearts can heel 
 I can make it real 
 Chorus 
 When I hold you in my arms 
 When I feel you understand me 
 Nothing else makes sense at all 
 When you're far away from home 
 When you say that you are lonely 
 This is for your broken heart 
 Chorus
",For Your Broken Heart (Per Tuo Triste Cuor),2002
Frederik Kempe,"Tell me why you want to go
And why you feel so bad
Tell me 'cause I need to know
The reason why you 're sad
I will try to guide you
And make things right
The road we share is long and steep
The ocean wide and deep

Forget all the tears and sorrow
I'll show you the world tomorrow
I've been where you are right now
But I made it through somehow
I'll tell you a different story
We're lost without hope and glory
You'll see tomorrow with me

I don't know where trouble goes
I don't know what to say
Why it harms the sweetest rose
But trouble leaves today
I will always hold you
No matter what
This narrow road was made for two
It was made for me and you
Hope you know I'll understand
I was freed by own hands
We're a different story
Hope and glory!
You and me!",Tomorrow,2002

Seras-tu aux prochaines vacances à l'hôtel Beau-Rivage?
Aimes-tu la plage?

Oh oui! j'adore me baigner
Maintenant je sais nager
Mais dis donc, comment tu connais l'hôtel Beau-Rivage
Tu y a été toi, à Sainte Maxime

Ooooooh! dis-lui toute ma peine,

Fredi,"Didn't know what time it was and the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll 'lotta soul, he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no D.J. that was hazy cosmic jive

There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

There's a starman waiting in the sky

Fredo,"Yo, I'm charging my phone
I just flipped all this white now I feel like the dark's gotta go
Just started my show
And man this chick took a glance at the pole now she's asking to go
She's feeling the kid
In some jeans with the rips
Whip 3 into 6 anytime that I'm feeling the mix
Give my young guns straps, niggas know Fred's feeding them kids
I got a message for them kids
If you hit the trap make sure you're whipping 
And you're stretching on them bricks
'Cause I was up on Harrow Road pebbling this shit 
And I'll tell you right now you'll be never getting rich
He used to have P's now he's begging for a quid
Trying to bring a young little qwenger to his crib
Speaking of young
I'm the youngest in charge 
And my young dargs won't pet to run in your yard
They came for a shoot and found slugs in my yard 
And they said I stacked criminal in front of his marge
Kept my mouth closed I was busting the charge
Was stuck in the yard, now I'm stuck in the chart
My AP looks like it's been flooded with glass
Use the gloves and the masks then I'm running a bath
I've never been that guy that clubs in the dance
I'm shotting on Friday, there's drugs in the car
Man she listens to Fred and she's loving my bars
But she said the block's hot can she come to the Shard
Her back end is huge like she's stuffing her ass
But everything's real that's my suttin' from France
I'm the man of this house so there's grams in this couch
Hella food in the kitchen like grans in this house
Little homies and opps all with grams in their mouths
Or sliding to Kilburn with bands in their pouch

Like boom boom
Bro slide in that foreign like boom boom
Niggas straight two face likes who's who
Stole a half box of coke and bought a new coupe
Man I'm a loose yute
Any gyal you see me riding with is too cute
Can't help looking at that back man, it's too huge
I just spent four racks on two Loubs
And walked to court and told the judge I don't move food

But these Nike's on my feet cost the price of my weed
If she said she's my gyal then she's lying on me
She's trying to be, so what it's likely to be
Gunshots ringing off man it's likely my team
Still I swear down I'm keeping up 
Fuckery in Gucci, they love me in Louis
By age 16 I was stuck up in juvie
Now I fly OT in fucking Jacuzzi's
You can't talk to my chick 'cause she's stuck up and boujee
Shout outs running from Mulli
21 days lost is bunning my doobie
Caught him on free flow and spun him to Tuesday
When I stepped in this game I was lit and flooded
I put that on my little cousin
Niggas talk the trap and ain't whippin' nuttin'
Bro don't rap but my niggas busting
And why these Gucci clothes make groupie hoes 
Just lose their mind and go and do the most
I didn't choose the road
But my shoes were old and big bros was getting it from moving O's
Man I can't lie, I was feeling that shit
When this plug drops a half brick, told myself have to be easy with it
'Cause when he drops 36 O's I'm leaving with it
Then it's onto the next 'cause I'm cheeky with it
That's why all of my ladies are freaky with it
Check my phone while I'm bathing, she's sneaky with it
We just smacked up some pagans and legal visits
So free up my bro 'cause he's evil with it
My cell got some B and a needle with it
Still he can't find a vein 'cause he's feeble with it

Like boom boom
Bro slide in that foreign like boom boom

While you lie to the fans
Play the cards I was dealt
Now I'm liking my hand
Told my girl that I'm liking her tan
But she's too busy tryna' see who's liking my 'Gram
I spent time in the can, 'cause I ride for my fam'
And all this ice on my hand
It got your baby mother hella likely to bang
And I will never change bro, I like who I am

Bro we're turning up
Catch us in the club and we're burning buds
That's my nigga in the foreign, see him burning dust
Put my brother in jail said he's serving drugs
But that's work to us
So I hide the pain through these designer frames
Bro died and I put him on a diamond chain
Came outta jail to a mic and stage
And it's different from the trap but I like the change

Catch me out in my block in Gucci linen
With the cutest women, we're so used to winning
Don't ask why we're used to sinnin'
It's that coupé I'm whippin', past the bando I used to live in
You got you're watch from this rapping ting
But me I got my watch from this trapping ting
Me and bro on the same bike saddling
Now I press sports on a Merc' and we're vanishing
Maddest ting, keep it humble, I didn't have a thing
Don't say much, I've been through a lot
And you're queen is a thot bro she's been through the block
My new shits mad, you ain't seen what I got
And all these boxes and kilos
Got me the same watch as the Migos
You got a Z but it's a box when I reload
And the streets know you're flexing in deets'ed clothes

Bro we're turning up
Catch us in the club and we're burning buds
That's my nigga in the foreign, see him burning dust
Put my brother in jail said he's serving drugs
But that's work to us
So I hide the pain through these designer frames
Bro died and I put him on a diamond chain
Came outta jail to a mic and stage
And it's different from the trap but I like the change

I swear I wonder how my life would be
If I didn't, go and meet the plug
15 knee deep in the streets, where my niggas?
I didn't need the love
And my dad, he ain't really shit
But I'd be lying if I say I didn't need my mum
Gyal always stressing going through some drama
Telling me she need a hug
Yo it's safe to say, I was stuck in the hood with no place to stay
You weren't nowhere around tryna save the day
Now you're all in my face cuz my papers straight
Fam I'll never show you niggas how to bake a cake
They say life is a test, I'm sure that I'm winning my lighty's the best
Gun shots were beating, we're sliding them west
Them man are singing they're trying there best

I'm right in the hood like I might write a book
My boo don't like how I grind in the hood
But she ain't going nowhere, I'm piping her good
Man my ting from North loves running her lips
And I can't bad her up 'cause my guns in the crib
Treat my ladies the same way I come with my bricks
Give them the press and turn 1 into 6
Niggas talk 'bout the trap, that ain't nuttin' you did
Yeah we do shows and clubbing and shit
But I dance with the devil and hug on my stick
So gang units still love to run in my bit
I just flooded my wrist, the Benz out front
I was begging for lunch then some pebbles to cunch
Smoking on cookies, you settle for crumbs
Man you move like a bitch so it's better you run
Having issues with niggas you settle with tongues
If I'm feeling an issue I'm getting my gun
Used to sit in my cell and write letters to mum
Now I pay her bills at the end of the month
Little homies in Uber collecting some grub
Same time I'm with Lula collecting some uck
My shoes 'causet a whole stack, you already know that
Still I'll swap it all just to have my bro back

Either traffic or stabbings, I'm late to a vid
All them man there are dissing, I'm making them sick
But I can't entertain them, they're blatantly pricks
I'm a awkward yute
My bro got a brick so I ordered two
And gyal come link me 'round twenty past
And I bet she be bussing it by quarter to
Anything that I'm wearing course it's new
Same goes for my chick so she's sort of rude
Man we slide in them foreign whips, ain't with the politics
Gave my jeweller racks for these chains, I didn't borrow it

Fredrik Jonsson,"I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak with no restrains
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away, into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me  

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man
In some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way, into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day  

Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me  

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile

There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

The lack of lust that keeps you alive
The loss of the flame that helps you survive
The state in which nothing really matter(s)
When the sound of your voice gradually gets flatter
Determination,
The time you know what's to be done
When you've set the goal and start to run
When you're willing to give more than all
And to get back up if ever you fall
Confusion,
A lack of knowledge, a weakness of mind
A vulnerable state where your directions are blind
The moment you would grab any stretched hand
The time you could loose your strongest band
Hapiness,
When you have a million reasons to live
And at least a thousand things to give
Those precious moments you wish never to stop

This is just a fraction of what's happening inside
But you ought to know your words and my feelings coincide",A Fraction of You,2006

To a random destination
Living the present
Without a single obligation
Willing to grab
Whatever the future will propose
And prepared to fight
Whatever it may oppose
Seems so simple
It can't get worse
Like a step forward
To start a new verse
I'm not the only
Passenger on this train
A dozen of us trying
To break the chain
Scared about leaving
A comfortable life
Some even dropping
Their home and wife
Seems so simple
It can't get worse
Like a step forward
To start a new verse
The train keeps moving
Rollin on
Throwing out my memories
As I move along
I'm ready now

No, I'm dreaming again, it's just the morning rain
But what about the voices from the room next door?
And the sound of your steps on wooden floor?
If silence only could be what it should
If loneliness would leave me alone
But nothing would do me more good
Than not being on my own

What about the shispers in sleepless nights?
What about the screams and endless fights?

Where you're not involved

A few friends and occupations

I swear I would pray

What has changed?

You smoke every cigarette like it was your last

Free,"[Chorus: ]
You used to be my man, we used to be in love
Since we parted ways things is gettin' rough
Just because I got a kid by you
Don't give you no reasons to act like a fool

Yo, you used to be my girl, but that was in the past
It's a shame that that shit didn't last
And just because we got a kid together
Don't give you no reasons to change like the weather

Sometimes I reminisce on how it was before we dropped a seed
I was your everything and you was all I need
Stopped payin' attention cause I gained a little weight
Pokin' all these hookers, layin' up from state to state
My stress level's risin' to the highest, you begged me
To have your baby, now you're tryin' to play me
And so I choose to move away from this drama
No longer in love, now you just my baby's father

What's up, you needs to shush up and hush up
Everything you hear you believe
You're loud plus you Rifkin more than Steve
When I come through you make me leave
If I roll up on you like a sleeve
Don't get it twisted like braids or weaves
No welly, I'm off to the bank telly
Plus actin' foul when my seed was in yo belly
You ain't the eight one on the section
The problem is we ain't together but we still keep sexin'

You tryin' to keep the upper hand just because we got a kid
Don't give you the right to try to monitor the way I live
Where I go and who I date ain't no business of yours
No need for you to player-hate, you still get the drawers

The love used to be there, I don't know where the shit went
We was young and wasn't ready for commitment
Young ways at a young age
Two teenagers with a young seed to raise

[Chorus: ]

See you been on fire since the baby, flamin' up
Started changin' up with the rah-rah callin' my peeps and hangin' up
Speakin' in a different tone now
On that young shit, even though we grown now
You on your own, but ain't raisin her alone
We can't even hold a decent conversation on the phone
Yeah, we lay down like SMPTE
You want me to hit you so you tempt me
Turnin' red like Simply

Don't take it out on my seed cause you resent me
It's unfulfilling, so in other words we empty
You talk about things you prepared to do
I was there when your fam wasn't there for you
And yo, I'm pointin' fingers, like triggers
Your sisters is a bunch of goldiggers
With they kids around a million different niggas
Fake tears you cried and wept
Baby, walk the same path and follow in they footsteps

You try to say them hurtful things and threaten me with fear
But I cried my last cry and shed my last tear
I did my best to keep you out of court for child support
But you don't do your job, it's like I'm married to the mob
Your friends be on some spy shit, I'm on some do-or-die shit
Survive it, I got to, I can't depend on you
Watchin' her on weekends, thinkin' you the shit
Callin' it a favor when you babysit
You'se a part-time daddy with some part-time love
And I ain't stoopin' to your level, I gots to rise above
Appreciate I demonstrate, my ways could be much meaner
You be a clown and fuck around, I'm servin' you subpeonas

You must understand
It's never too late to, lose who you are
And choose who you are supposed to be
Supposed to become
You've been in and out

Backwards around
Not a friend, not a mother, not a father
Just God and you should make a choice
What you ought to do
What matters most
Who you are to you
Opinions of the old and young
Shouldn't matter to you
Take advice think it over twice
Make a choice that helps you sleep at night
It's decent, but recently
Things have shown us
We have done the wrong things often
Never suicide, that's the easy route
There's always another way out

You never would'a known there was a high road
Let people get the best of you and get mad at them
Instead of bein' mad at yourself
You're only number one in your life
And you will decide if it goes right
Every time you digress
Defeat your progress
Feed you knowledge, but you must digest
The controversy yo can get personal
They don't understand till the role reversal
Seekin' fame, play their games
Gave a whole lot for a whole little gain
Push comes to shove
Do you push or shove?
When the choice is yours
Do you leave or you love?
All the tears you cried, you're dyin' inside
When will you decide to survive

Bearing the awesome weight of sin
And every bitter thought, every evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained brow

For through Your suffering I am free
And death is crushed to death and life is mine to live
Won through Your selfless love

This the power of the cross
Son of God slain for us
What a life, what a cost
We stand forgiven at the cross

This the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us
He look the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross

A young go getter mind locked on havin' wealth
Livin' wild with this thug style, I got these hoes
Tuggin' all on my Avirex clothes
A young brown Mafioso, I put my foot through the door
Infrared light smilin' title, desert eagle 4-4
Layin' Cubans on the floor, 
I send my ghetto troopers to the mother load 
To snatch a bottle of A-1 yo,
I'm hearin' rapid fire through the house
Eternal warfare with heavy weaponry
Me and my soldiers ain't scared,
You get a bullet to the head in trainin' if you don't aim for the head
So I know my young shooters left somebody dead around the corner
Plus got the yola out the trunk bendin' over
Its daytime I can't wait till it turns to night 
Cause that's the time when ghetto stars come out and shine

Quicker than outlaws I draw on haters with glocks and techs
Buckin' at undercover agents dippin' off quick in the lex
That's my trigger finger fuck 'em lets bring the heat to the street
Gave him one to the head and there he dead eternally asleep
Deep in this cold world where there's no love, what the fuck should I do?
People be killin' they family for yola not trustin' in you
But now I'm teachin' you some ackrite 
With forty-fives and flashlights
Fuckin' around with thug niggas
And drug dealers
Manajetuahs and jaguars getting chopped in the drop
Killin' haters that act hard nigga like it or not
Cause it's a hold up, your hands go up real slow
Should've told ya that I'm a soldier who kills hoes
Pullin' no mercy on these busters ain't no callin' the cops
And my nine is comin' to fuck you nigga ballin' or not

I'm off in this shit like Mr. Hanky, Janky, but when it gets stanky
Time to rape fiends, my niggas take G's, make G's, but it ain't free
Pimp niggas laced me when I was a baby, how to slang D
And stained me, a suck ya up nigga lip locked but I can't speak
Now it's crazy, niggas be lazy, imbecilic, milli vanillic, 
Can't speak on it but I feel it, I'm the villain stealin' scrillion
Convo be thrillin' your brain waves get to healin'
Just to reach out and touch you 
train of thought make a killin', Soldiers willin', 
So I do it for thug niggas and drug dealers through the snow and rain
Focused on fetti fuck how it came, steady remain
Paper over hoes, and stay on my toes 
And air these niggas out like sandals, 
Blow 'em out like candles
Handle my business and listen to my theezo

As I walked into the room
And as I stood to see Him face to face 
I was gloriously made new
There was a great and awesome presence
And a light as bright as any day

I heard the Spirit say

All rise, All rise
To stand before the throne 
In the presence of the Holy One
All rise, All rise
As we worship the Messiah
All Rise

Then I looked at those all around me
With their hands uplifted high
Then the Spirit laid His hands on me
And I uplifted mine
And He was singing alleluias
And praises to His name

I heard the Spirit say

All rise, All rise

Freedom Band,"The summer breeze, made ripples on the pond
Rattled through the rings and the willow trees beyond
Daddy in his good hat, mama in her Sunday dress
Watched in pride, as I stood there in the water up to my chest
And the preacher spoke about the cleansing blood
I sank my toes into that East Tennessee mud

And it was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But I felt like a new baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

Amazing grace, oh how sweet the sound
There was glory in the air, there was dinner on the ground
And my sins went for many, were washed away and gone
Along with a buffalo nickel I forgot to leave at home
But that seemed like such a small, small price to pay
For the blessed peace of mind that came to me that day

And it was down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth
I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
But I felt like a new baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord

This road is long and dusty, sometimes the soul must be cleansed
And I long to feel that water, rushing over me again

Down with the old man, up with the new
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
Guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

My girl's best friend had payed me a visit.
Sly as can be, tight dress and all
She knew that I was faithful.  I really didn't have the gall.
I tried to chill.  She made the move.
Now I know my girlfriend wouldn't approve.
I didn't realize my girl was settin' me up
Yo, my girl didn't trust me.  No!
Yeah, but she lost control I wouldn't take the bait.
I said chill baby baby chill baby baby wait
My girl bust in, Caught us creating a boom
She said ""Girlfriend""?

Here's how it started
Just an example of how another brother can trample
Ruin your life, sleep with your wife
Watch your behind
There was a friend of mine named Jay
Would come over late at night and say hey
I watched the fight.  I thought is was alright.
'Cause me and Jay were really really tight
So damned close we had the same blood type.
Months went by and my wife got big
We were havin' a child and I got another gig
So I let Jay move into the crib and chill
He had his own room and helped pay the bills
The time had come (for the baby down to the scene)
It looked like Jay and I couldn't believe
Before my eyes in the delivery room.

Seventeen and I was havin' a ball
Eleventh grade and ""Joe"" I knew it all
I fell in love for the very first time
With this girl she really blew my mind
Inner sense and whole lotta class
Style that could give you whiplash
We said hello and my heart beat stopped
She was the world and I was on top
Time went by, She filled my universe
We made love, She said I was the first
My boy kept tellin' me. Yo, I don't know
I think your girl's been playing tic tac toe
I'll ask my girl I know she only loves me
Wasn't I the one who took your viginity?
The look on her face read sorrow and gloom
She said ""Yeah, Why do you guys always ask that?""

Hey ladies
Have you ever had a man
Go away for business, come back with a tan
Comes home late at night from work
You cooked him dinner now you feel like a jerk
Sayin' he didn't have time to eat
And he's not even hungry, he wants to RETREAT
To the bedroom he said his head hurts
You're only makin' love in radical spurts
Mysterious calls and the phone goes click
You say to yourself  ""I'm gonna hit him with a brick""
Ain't no way he could be cheatin' on me
I wonder who bought him those BVD's
Dressed to a T to hang with the fellas
Over the guys and I'm getting jealous
Comin' home late smellin' like perfume (fume)

That I won't go back again

I might stand it myself
Better let me sit next to the door baby okay

I know that you'll never say

Sometimes you've got ten years on me
I don't have a whole lot for you

Would you look at him
Raised by wolves
Now he's in the Senate, President!

Let me show you courage, friend
Barking like a clown
When the moon, the clouds, the sea, the animals, even the rocks

Looking at Nature Boy
Standing in the setting sun
Looking at Nature Boy
Standing like a mannequin

That day I kind of grew
Gills and fins
I said, ""The race that's through
Is the one I'm in""

You looked at Nature Boy
Passed out in my arms
I thought everybody knew

The sign said ""Nature Boy
Five miles ahead'
Tall and strong
Alert to changing needs
Growing, changing
Growing fur, wings, a horn, sharp and dangerous gills,
And a third eye

Does not sleep as we know it
Long tongue, never fully concealed hooves
A scaly tail and back
And a pouch of mystery, which moves

This is the story of Nature Boy

[Repeat: x3]
And the man with the double chin",Nature Boy,1990

The road ends in a fence
She flies off overhead
He starts his lonely trip out west

Western sky
The miles go by
She'll always get there first
And I'll always arrive

Meet you there
You take care
I love that look you get
Before you say goodbye

His conscience waits for dark
Like an AM radio song
Fades in reflected off the clouds

After his father crashed
He moved his family back
And vowed to never leave the ground

Western sky
Between the signs
I'm spelling out your name
In neon passing by

Meet you there
Saturday
Now you be careful love
The road can hypnotize

An exit in the rain
She answered before it rang
But he can only say her name

Western sky
He laughs then sighs
I'm only halfway home
And stopping for the night

Glad you're there
You know my fear
I need those words you say
Before you say goodbye",Western Sky,1997
Freedy Johnston,"Did I wake you up again
Talking in my sleep
Unfamiliar afternoon

We were out for a little while
Voices from the street
Sunlight in a rented room

I don't know how
You get me lost
Forgotten where I'm running from

I have found
You get me lost
And I don't care where we're going

I'll follow you to your cloud
Or meet you underground
Take me with you either way

What if we'd never met
You lead me to forget
What I was about to say

I'm turned around
You get me lost
Directions wrong, way unknown

I have found
You get me lost
And I don't care where we're going",You Get Me Lost,1997
Freedy Johnston,"Here comes the first good snow
Only to decorate a vacant yard
Moving out of here tonight
All that's left to do is sweep the floor

Old address book in my hand
How'd I lose my place again
The only thing not packed away
Moving on a holiday

Just another place left clean
Won't be dreaming here anymore
Empty shelves and lonely keys
Sounds so hollow when I shut the door

Driving slowly, quiet streets
Signals even red and green
Me and what's not thrown away
Moving on a holiday

I can almost hear my heart
But the motor's making
Such a peaceful sound
Up across the great divide
And you can't tell
When you start going down",Moving on a Holiday,1999
Freedy Johnston,"You left your watch
It's already stopped
Your favorite shoes
Where you dropped them

And the rain won't stay
And the sun won't move
And I hold my hands
While I wait for you

Won't be long
A note by the phone
Two weeks now
And you're still gone

And your garden's dying
And the flowers won't bloom
And I sit by the window
While I wait for you

When I wake up I forget
Put my arm across the bed
Where it left, the wait begins again
I imagine, I recall
To the family and the walls
And I still believe no one knows

How a night needs day
Like a lie needs true
And the rain won't stay
And the sun won't move
And I hold my hands
While I wait for you",While I Wait for You,1999
Freedy Johnston,"Bus stop, wet day
She's there, I say
Please share my umbrella 

Bus stops, bus goes
She stays, love grows
Under my umbrella 

All that summer we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella we employed it
By August she was mine 

Every morning I would see her
Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought 

Other people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same 

That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinking of our sweet romance
Beginning in a dew 

Came the sun
The ice was melting
No more sheltering now
Nice to think that that umbrella
Led me to avow

Freedy Johnston,"Hey baby, don't worry
Hey baby, don't worry

Open my eyes
Another day
I see your face and your eyes

In my dream
In my cold and quiet dream
You could not go outside
In my dream
They would ask where I had been
They would know that I lied

And so I go
Into my day
Though clouds cross the sky

In my dream
In my gray and hollow dream
I went out, you would hide
In my dream
You were never to be seen
Then they appeared outside

Hey baby, don't worry

Clothes are kinda funny
Hair is kinda wild and free

And nobody knows like me

She talks kinda lazy
People say she's crazy
And her life's a mystery
Oh, but love grows where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me

There's something about her hand holding mine
It's a feeling so fine
That I just gotta say
She's really got a magical spell
And it's working so well
That I can't get away

I'm a lucky fella

At a dirty old expensive motorway
I dream of colours when all around is grey
I dream of colours and sunlight

There's a way i'd rather be
Than the person who pretends that he is me
I dream of colours to be what i would be
I dream of colours, it inspires me

Suddenly, a shaft of light breaks through
Illuminates the room
When all around was darkened
And tender hues of light and shade
It paints a picture of an
Altogether brighter day

Why were depend on a handshake when you reachin' a palm
Why beef with my mom why can't sleep when I cum
Why my black I love every fight I laugh when they mug me every right

I got to fuck every night 
Run deep in my ways six feet deep in our graves
Why periods last three to five days
Why we ain't retreated to slaves

Why we don't learn til we leave for the cage
And we say the beasts is in rage
Why I can't tell you the whole story just a piece of the page
Why's no such thing as true lies

Why can't I have two rather than few highs
Why's homos got to do guys in the world
Why ain't there more girls that wanna do girls
Why's multiple-sclorosis why got multiple intosis

You know my .45 my .357 but why my shotgun why plot dun
Why man in statue depend on his rocks son
Why my hood fight flurges I see crook type murders
And niggas get cooked like burgers

Why your girl want my clique why your girl on my dick
Why she rub it against her mouth like it's chap stick
Why this rap shit 
Why CEO's wanna rap why rappers wanna be CEO's

Why the rederick why I can't get my proper ettiquette

Going up, holding up, and your's is (Going down)

The morns the better, I'm shorter, I'm better whenever it's (Going down)
Got a new chick, badder than ever
Ass fatter than ever, got it together and love (Going down)
No bud, no kiss, no hug
No rub, no bath, no tub, just love (Going down)
Yeah, that's my kind of baby
That's my kind of lady it's (Going down)
And the purse, you might find a eighty
Underneath her lip gloss, shorty keeps some lip gloss she's (Going down)
And that's why I love her, that's also why I don't trust her
Think she got her a sucker, nope (Going down)
Got another thing coming, not a baby but a

Gotta survive, maneuver through towns
Gotta drive, smooth through the town, or it's (Going down)
Cops on my ass, gotta shoot through the town
Shooting the pound, I ruined it now it's (Going down)
Only question is, will I get caught
Will I get cuffed, will I see court, will people see me (Going down)
No they won't, man I'ma survivor
Plus I gotta lady cop that's a rider, so nothing's (Going down)

Was not enough to keep him on the horizon

With bending pitch in fractals woven
All your friends will call to us
They're floating overhead

Give us a tone
Fill us with sound codes

Glow into a meade inside the lions head
Delicate species were meant
The pirouette into the background with the dead

When all the bridges wave and flex
With bending pitch in fractals woven
All your friends will call to us
It's floating overhead
And when the sonic waves are shot
From cannons on a flatbed truck
The atmosphere will shake and shout
It's cracking over head

Fill us with sound codes

Let her nova alone breathing outwards to burn

And if I am to become a lump of coal

I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall,
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

('How do you think he does it?)
I don't know!
(What makes him so good?')

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind kid,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

He's a pinball wizard,
His score's a trillion more.
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord.

He's scoring more!
More more more more!

First to go on this track
Transcending continents
Who better
To hold it down for Malaysia?
Ain't no argument
I'm eloquent
With my words
And linguistics that I abuse
MC's wanna bite
But still got on
Some loose baby tooth
My rhymes so hot
We got fire blankets
In the vocal booth
Producers with extinguishers
To put out the blaze
When I'm on the loose
I'm rolling with the best
Meeting of the minds
Not a contest
Evoking MC's around the globe
With finesse and skills God blessed
From KL
But a hungry MC
Like I was from Budapest
Too Phat to go on diet
Toe to toe with Joe is ludicrous
Don't fool with this
You know we fly
Like a stewardess
Impressing pure hip-hop purists
In every single metropolis
Don't step to this listen
Rubbish we don't utter
Got to stop the hating
Unite us and start working together
So keep it butter
We'll kick it hotter

They'll flee

Verse 6 (Malique- Too Phat, Malaysia)
I come from a land
Where everybody eats rice
And all the people speak nice
And tourists get a Rolex
At a cheap price
Pretty kites at beach sites
That make you breathe right
In some cities
Students still collide
To keep they peeps rights
We hostin' different ghettos
Different sounds each night
No drive by's in caddies
Clocking marks
Up on the east side
No kids with 40's
Shootin' dices under street lights
And buck guns
Here thugs swingin' samurais
In street fights
But buck a where I resides
As long as the beat's nice
I keep my rhymes precise
And when it recites
It makes you
Wanna peep twice
Impressin' each type
In each tribe
From jail to kids in Yale
To tribal Indians
Blowin' peace pipes
And buck the cheap hype
Your metaphors are re-writes
Your style is like tryin'
Your granny panties on
Could never be tight
The type that chicks like
Dudes wanna be like
And while you jerkin' offa free sites
I'm doin' three dykes, uuh
Yeah, I'm a Malay kid
And no
You not mistaken
The type a A&R will tell Dre
""You gotta take him!""
Some haters plottin'
To cut my hands off
So they could shake 'em
Malaysia representin'
Peace assalamualaikum


Chorus (2x)
From sea to sea
Country to country
6 MC's bring the delicacies
It's a meeting of the minds
To ease the turmoil
360 degrees
Around the earth's soil

Telephone poles bakin' hot rolls

Leap out the room grab the old broom
Eat a watermelon and walk on the moon
Cherry coke canteloupe little old maid
A big black berry inside the cool-aid
A bass guitar a old fruit jar 
A green canteen and a chocolate bar
Cannonball baby doll football fan
I flipped a mad dog and a Japanese man
A double bunk bed a 40 to the head
Now get up and watch me rap to cornbread hey

Hey I hear ya
Yo aceyalone I hear ya

Well have ya ever kilt a great white shark? well I have
I was on a boat I built and sailed around the world don't laugh
Yeah I was a crook an' met captain hook an' got tookin' a captive
Wrote a book in 31,000 chapters yeah yeah that's it
I seen the ghost of Augie creek
I went to fantasy island Gilligan's island and pirates peak
And then to nappa valley rappers alley and stayed a week
I met the queen of all my dreams and we danced cheek to cheek 
And then we freaked
Had a fight with King Kong Godzilla and rodan
Johnny socko's giant robot and wrestled with Conan
I jumped on a rocket with Davy Crockett headed for no man's land
And landed and seen a time bandit in the sand
I traveled with Gulliver and I'm a hell of a patrol
Looking for the Acapulco pot of gold
He blazed I raised little bastard got me floated 
Hit the road and had to hitch w/the son of a bitch who turned into a toad
You ever slept on blueberry hill well I will
We'll have to connive and cook and clean for a meal and that's real
Planted three jolly green bean weed seeds in a field
A tree grew all the way up to the sky and I smoked it

Well I seen zig zag as he was zooming in a Z
Looking zorked and zany like a Zulu zombie
He thought he was a zenith with a zebra ont he scene
He was a buzzing in the zone like he was zapped
Bullshit

Well jingle bell jingle bell sugar on toast 
The fellowship shop is from the west coast
Hey hash and eggs crocodile legs 
I'll bring the chronic you bring the kegs
Buckwheat and stymie's down with Rodney Allen rippey
While Tommy and Annica were beating up Pippy
Karate chops snap crackle pops
You do the hip thing and I'll do the hop
Cough up a lougie shake break and boogie
Cause I got a home girl that's giving out nougies
Mr George Bush was on my floor 
Cracked out butt naked watchin' the cosby show
Hey little rascals Eddie Haskell 
Black eyed peas with a lot of tabasco
Chico stix big fat chicks 
Old reruns of the Jefferson hits
Eenie meenie miny mo larry and shemp
Slide me some skin on the black side pimp
Training bras holey drawers 
Vonte and D double E is breakin' all the laws

Yo I'll scratch the break you rap the cornbread hey

A big old black wacky tacky black man

And I'm alive and survive in a one room home
Never take a hand-me-down never dig a bone
I give and I live and I handle my own
Used to a peewee now I'm full grown
Not a shufflin' jigaboo I'm hard like stone
I drink out the jug I eat out the pot
I learn and I earn and I love what I got
My mama ain't a housewife daddy ain't a cop
I was taught to be a fair man shoot your shot
Snake in the grass livin' in the past

Sittin' on a park bench
Lookin' in the skies when
He can see the mouth-stench

Of the range of the people
Walkin' and talkin' nonsense

In the park
I see a man sittin' there
With a newspaper under his head and hair
I think

He would be down for me
To tell him that he'd been waiting 'round here
For all, of his life and

It took time for the soul to come
When it came, I saw the same old scene
Over and over again, my friend
People's talkin' and squackin' in the park
And sittin' on a bench
Thinkin' 'bout things

I think of all the people of the park
Sleepin' in the street
Livin' from their hearts
Sleepin' in the street
Livin's kinda hard
Sleepin' in the street
People fall apart

There's a park bench
That's painted black and white
And when you sleep there
It don't get wet when you wake up
Because the trees are withered
And so you dry in the sunlight

You sit there and you prepare to make a move
And so you go through each and every can
Lookin' inside tryin' to see somethin' that you didn't
See last night
Wantin' to get somethin' to eat
And you go down the street
You see some friends of yours
And then they all speak
Sayin' ""what's happenin' man?
You sleepin' in the park again
Yeah nothin' but a survival thang
You know what I'm sayin'
Insha'Allah
Then again my friend

All they want to do 
is play you like you are a fool
But I know better
You're safe from school
Through this stay cool
Mark you are mis-skewed
And now I know better, I maintain black

We'll overcome
In the sun

On the bench in the park
Where you lay when it's dark
And it's wet
'Cause it's raining on you

You have newspapers and you'd like to go home
But you can't 
'Cause you just got put out on your own

You're thinkin' 'bout your kids
You're thinkin' 'bout your girl
You're thinkin' of all the things you did

You see the children play
You hear the people barely look at you
Laughing while they run away

Sleeping in the street
Living from the heart
Sleeping in the street
People fall apart

In the park, where are
They's every people
Walkin' round lookin' at themselves far
As if they were somethin'
But they ain't nothin'
They frontin'
Not a people nowhere standing
Aw these people are something

Earth perched on
The edge of all time
And yet they search
For drums, imperial dreams
Similarly so barred
Can't buy my soul
Won't sell my soul to the Devil
On the other level, never with another rebel
Under trouble

Two knocks on the door, but they did everything twice
Received the device, two pairs of latex gloves
A scalpel, a rich knife
Looked at each other and said let's get it on
Strapped the body down, checked the temperature
To see if it was warm
Stick man sculpture on front side
Skin splits in two, reveal insides
Now it was a homicide
As it drove away, I heard bullets ricochet
And a hell of a skid marks left from the six tray

Just, give me a call

Smoke coming out of the window

Point blank-point blank range
Better lay the fuck down and run
Blow from a twelve gage, a point blank range
There was a sign that said, six tray
Blow from a twelve gage, a point blank range
Better lay the fuck down and run, this is a six tray
Blow from a twelve gage, a point blank range

Freestyle Fellowship,"Once we have the knowledge of self as a people then we could be free
and no devil could ever enter the boundaries
I stand in the center around all these sounds I see
Blessin' Allah that I found the key
That's how we be
 
We are by no means ashamed of our cultural background
Not a tad bit 'fraid of change
Look around, it's the same ol' same ol' thang
(Hey, what's goin' on man? How you doin', man?)
Ahh, you know, I can't call it
Try to maintain, overlooking these boundaries

I gotta be righteous, I gotta be me
I gotta be conscious, I gotta be free
I gotta be able, I gotta attack
I gotta be stable, I gotta be black
 
Who is that surrounding me?
Enemy enemy you crossed the wrong boundary, poof!
Wicked witness wizardry
Disappear from here and end up in a tree
Crossed the wrong boundary
 
The sharp shooting wizard but not a Grand Dragon
A chop off the block but my pants ain't saggin'
Got a strong ass grip but my name ain't Money Grip
Liked Gladys better when she sang with The Pips
And when it comes to strength I'm surely of the stronger
And when it comes to death I pray my children live longer
Payback's a bitch, that's why I never borrow
If the push come to shove I'd do a stick-up tomorrow
With the group thing over and my flat top gone
I'm livin' kinda lovely, only Allah above me
Provin' that old time axiom - birds of a feather flock together
Know where I'm coming from?

The win, the loss, the draw
The summit, the peak, the wall, the downfall
The energizing uprising black nigga 
The wise, the eyes, the dirt
The overall ball, the earth
And most importantly the birth of a new generation of blackness
And we're forced to set our boundaries
 
I gotta be righteous, I gotta be me
I gotta be conscious, I gotta be free
I gotta be able to counterattack
I gotta be stable I gotta be black
 
I gotta be open, gotta be me and
I gotta keep hopin' we're gonna be free

Freestyle Kingz,"[Chorus] 
Oh no, there go them Texas boys banging in a fo' do' 
Top fell out the drop, crawling on 84's 
Think of taking my slab, baby I don't think so 
My heat under my seat, and I don't love you hoes 
Living it like a G, but still I gotta lay low 
Five percent or ten, but still my screens goin' glow 
These haters be in my mix, and these boppers be on my dick 
Every time I come round the corner 

I'm from the land of opportunity, in God we trust 
But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust 
I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park 
It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks 
Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note 
But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat 
See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus 
It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust 
Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping 
I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping 
Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick 
But take a trip to South Lee, and end up in a ditch 
They got my purple people eater once, the next day 
I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts 
I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch 
Paul Wall and Trae, hit em with that one-two punch 

[Chorus] 

When I flip in my slab 
I'm fin to beat they back off, like I was legs 
Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished 
I'm bout to diminish these haters, when my trunk start waving 
Blue over gray, side of my drop with six T.V.'s I'm displaying 
They hate that I'm shining, with the fifth wheel falling flying down the block 
But if one of these haters, wanna jack me 
Slugs goin' be flying, out the glock 
I click for no reason, this season my slab is staining they brain 
And I be known for getting reckless in Texas, gripping on grain 
Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South 
Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth 
They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em 
Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking 
But not today, cause Trae goin' be flipping on top of his game 
We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me man 
When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the slab is bound to get tossed 
And if you trying to be competition, then you bound to be getting lost 

[Chorus] 
 
Make way for the team, when the fo' do' be coming round the corner 
These haters are goners, cause I'ma drop the top when I wanna 
I know these jackers, better think before they reach out and touch 
Cause in back of the car is the Excursion, full of thugs that'll punch 
I know they wanted to get me, but they don't know what I'm bringing 
I pop the trunk and swing the block, while jamming Slow Loud And Bangin' 
Trae and Paul Wall on a mission, and ain't no stopping it man 
With my hand on my heat in my seat, and the other on grain 

Mo' money mo' problems man, the legend is true 
You better stay up on your toes, when you ride 22's 
I'm rolling strapped, everywhere I go I'm watching my back 
Cause on my block, them jackers don't give a damn if I rap 
People see me being friendly, and they think that I'm soft 
But the truth is, my best friend is a sawed off 
These haters in my mix, got me losing composure 
But if they take one step closer, it ain't gon be kosher naw

'Eager to MC' is my calling card
So here's the return of the one on the mike
Definition of Sound is in the house tonight
Due to the fact that the entire nation
Hates an MC sounding like a compilation
We come forth, back off sabatical
Keep the old flow, nothin' too radical
Passing the vibes with the greatest of ease

Scorpio is my zodiac sign

Many have tried and are eager to please
I've gotta get paid 'cause I have my needs
What I really want does grow on trees
What I really have flows like a dream
Roll in the pub will create a breeze
Pulling out the stops, no need to tease
Your MC's come in their 2's and 3's
Try to dismiss, sucker MC please
You never come close to vibes like these

Taking my spot is a never could be
Making rhymes faster than Linford Christie

Shut the door after me please

Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki
(Shut up)
Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki

Three words to the whack, step yourself back
Just gettin' down, and you then you're givin' no slack
Like a Burger King with a sack of Big Macs
We're throwin' down with the radical sacks
On time, in your mind you see
You gotta boogie to your best ability
You gotta funk it up until it knocks you down
And when you're funkin' up, be sure to pass it around
Come on, let's go to work
We got what'll make your body jerk
Make you throw your hands up in the air
Shake your booty and scream, oh, yeah
'Cause we are the Jam On Crew
And jammin' on it is how we do the do
We'll funk you up until you boogie down
So come people check out the sound
Check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound
Check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound

(Jam on it)

There's going to sound
They're going to get down

(Jam on it)

Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Chilly be
And I'm a surefire, full blooded bonafide house rockin' Jam-On Production MC
If you want the best, put me to the test, and I'm sure you'll soon agree
That I got no force 'cause I'm down by law when it comes to rockin' viciously, you see
'Cause when I was a little baby boy my mama gave me a brand new toy
Two turntables with a mic, and I learned to rock like Dolymite
Time went by, on this God creation, I knew someday I would rock the nation
So I made up my mind just what to do and I joined with the Jam On Production Crew
So go crazy, go crazy, don't let your body be lazy
I said don't stop the body rock till your eyesight starts to get hazy
'Till the sure-shot beat chills you to the bone 'cause Chilly B is on the microphone
'Till your mind is floatin like you're in a dream and you feel so good that you gotta scream
(Jam on it) jam on it, jam on an n on an on on an on
'Cause the beat don't stop 'till everybody's gone an that doesn't happen 'till the break of dawn
Clean out your ears and you open your eye, if you want to hear the music just come alive
If you don't know how get ready to learn
'Cause Cozmo's takin' his turn to burn

Take the see and O and the Z
Then they add M-O and the freaky D
Add a funky beat, and then what do you see
It's Cozmo D, yeah, baby, that's me
I've got the beat that's, oh, so sweet
Without me rockin' it's incomplete
So rock this, y'all, rock that, y'all
Rock on and don't you dare stop
You rock this, rock that, and that's a fact
'Cause the Jam On Crew will rock your body right back
Rock a steam locomo ride off the track
And give the whole wide world a funk attack
A to the beat y'all, get down
Let me rock it to the rhythm of the funk sound
From hill to hill, from sea to sea
A when Jam On's rockin' everybody screams
(Jam on it) jam on it, jam on and on, on and on it
And if you're feelin' like you want to dance all night
They go on ahead and flaunt it
'Cause jammin' on is what we do best
It's what separates us from the rest
And if you go deep, I'll cruise down for real
Let me tell what happened to the man of steel

(Said Superman had come to town to see who he could rock)
(He blew away every crew he faced until he reached the block)
(His speakers were three stories high with woofers made of steel)
(And when we boys sit outside, he said I boom for real)
He said, I'm faster than a speedin' bullet when I'm on the set
I don't need no fans to cool my amps, I just use my super breath
I could fly three times around the world without missin' a beat
I socialize with X-ray eyes, and ladies think it's sweet
(And then he turned his power on and the ground began to move)
(And all the buildings for miles around were swayin' to the groove)
(And just when he had fooled the crowd and swore he wouldn't fight)
We rocked this bet with a 12 inch cut called Disco Kryptonite
Well, Superman looked up at me, he said, you rock so naturally
I said now that you've learned to deal, let me tell you why I'm so for real
I'm Cozmo D from outer space, I came to rock the human race
I do it right 'cause I can't do it wrong
That's why the whole world is singin' this song

(Jam on it) jam on it
I said jam-j-j-jam on it
As days turn to night and night turns to day
Whatever time it is I want to hear you say
(Jam on it) jam on it
I said jam on-on-on, jam on it
Jam all around and upside down
And keep jammin' to the Jam On Production sound

(Jam on it) jam on it
I said jam-j-j-jam on it
I said Jam On is the funky beat that takes control
With a sure shot boogie that'll rock your soul
(Jam on it) jam on it
I said jam-j-j-jam on it
Get outta your seat and jam to the beat
And don't you dare stop till early mornin'

Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it
Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it

(Yeah, that's how you do it Cozmo)
(You were right, kid, that's the way you do it)
(Yeah, like did you see when he went in the corner)
(And he started doin' this)
(Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki)
(Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki)

(Ah, man, this is too funky for me)
(I'm goin' home)
(Hey, Mergatroid, let's go)
(Hey, you fellas seen my sister Mergatroid)
(She was standin' over here just a minute ago)
(Yeah, I think I saw her over there with Randy)
(He's rockin' the mic, you know)
(Diggy dang diggy dang da dang dang da diggy diggy diggy dang dang)

And tell him catch up like mayonnaise, um
I'm the sickest nigga doin' it
Bet that baby
These other niggas dough I'm wet crack baby, yes
Get back get back boy this a set back
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a death trap
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on

And when it comes to that paper I stack books
You heard what I said
I can put you on your feet 
Or put some money on your head
Life ain't cheap
You're better off dead
If you can't pay the fee
Shout out my nigga fee
See every mother fucker at the door don't get a key
You outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see

Yah the one with the braids. Yeah, well I see you on Wednesdays all the time, 

You come in every Wednesday I think you come in on your lunch break
And you always order the special with the hot chocolate.
And why manager be tripping and stuff talking about we gotta use water, 
But I always use some milk and sugar for you cause, huh, I think you kinda sweet. (laughs) 

Anyways, you always got on some fly blue suit,
And your cufflinks are shining all bright.
So what you do? Oh word, yeah thatâ??s interesting.
Look man, I mean, I donâ??t wanna waste your time, but I know girls donâ??t usually do this

But I was wondering if maybe we could get together outside the restaurant one day,
'Cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes. (snickers)
I mean, we could just go across the street to the park right here,
Wait hold up, my ph, my cell phone breaking up, hold up.

Can you hear me now? Oh.Yeah, so what day did you say? Oh yeah , Thursdayâ??s perfect. (laughs)

And it feels like Oo-oo-oo-ooo, but you donâ??t know my name.

Baby, baby I swear, itâ??s like Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooo,

Freeway,"Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
Say, ""Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
But I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
Cause most niggaz don't know a brick from a bike
They keep buyin hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
FYI, I never been robbed in my life""
Or, you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
Let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
Then, before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or, gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Still there Brooklyn?

Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'ma roll with that one

Make out a check for eight hundred dollars
Jigga Man, holla 

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy
Whassup Sig?  This Chris out the Young Guns dog
Whattup?
I'm ready to smash these niggaz in the rap game
The niggaz takin too long with that advance money and shit
Yeah
Talkin 'bout chill, chill don't pay the bills
Yeah I feel that
I know you well connected dog
Let me holla at somebody real
Aight look, I got the perfect person for you, hold on
Bleek, line two

Listen shorty, you wanna roll just give me the word
I ain't got time for a sentence all that shit is absurd
You find a strip first, if you don't cook find a bitch first
If you don't hustle find a nigga who pitch first
You new in town, no red and blue in town, there's gangs
Don't get fresh, let 'em know you small change
The strong move quiet, the weak start riots
We know you got a brick but sell 'em twenties til they tired
With no credit, you know you sick with that gotta eat fetish
And other niggaz who gettin it, dead it
Make 'em an offer that they can't refuse
He resists, box him in, til he can't be moved
Here's the rules: chop it, bag it, stash it, stack it
Get in, get out, that's a O.G.'s classic
900-Hustler, you pass it around
Wanna speak to me direct, hit extension trey-pound, I'm out

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your dog
What seem to be the problem young boy?
Yo whattup, this Murder Def Kill Homicide Nigga
I got two freaks
Yo watch your fuckin mouth man
Fuck you mean watch my mouth nigga?
Been on hold for about two hours nigga
I don't give a fuck how long you been on the line
Shut the fuck up!  Matter of fact, hold on
I know this nigga ain't just put, put me on hold man
This bullshit-ass elevator music
Free, pick up line five

First things first, watch what you say out your mouth
When you talkin on the phone to hus-tlers
Never play the house, think drought, keep heat in the couch
When you sittin in the presence of cus-tomers
Never hold out, pull out, throw heat and be out
If a nigga ever think that he touchin-ya
Lay low, get cake, whip all over the state
Stash dough, whip yay with, right amount of bake (hoe!)
Nigga too close went right around his place (yo!)
You stoppin dough when we clutchin the gats?
I know you heard ""Friend or Foe,"" this ain't different from that
Make sure you got your four-four and he can slip if he like
Young, Jon Benet daughter missin tonight and yo
Until you up stay away from them dykes and whores
Three smuts, two straights and a dyke
Can pause one-three rumbles two streaks and a pipe for sure
And if it's tight, then he might come back for more
Nine and four, everyday back and forth
Winter to summer, 1-900-Hustler
Pass the number til you're stackin balls
Tell you how to weigh shit wet and package more
I take cash or write the check out to F-R
Two E's, that'll be two G's
And forget my money I'm comin for all your ki's, nigga

I see why'all niggas lookin'
But I ain't stoppin', I'm gone, in something fast
Through the city with no top
That reach 220 on the dash, I'm so hot
In everybody's hood with other niggas' hoes
I'm throwin' paper at them bitches
Screamin' So So
Now every spot I hit
I'm hearing different shit
About homies that want me that weren't with me when I started this
It's fucked up but I
But I can't let these niggas blurry my vision
On where I'm going and how I'm living, ya know?
I got a daughter now, young age three
If her daddy don't shine, then my shorty won't eat
Feel me?
Do I floss? YES!
Sometimes I hit the block so damn hard I start hatin' my self
It's bad, I feel your pain dawg
But the only thing I'm about to change is the game motherfucker!

If you're sick of seeing artists

I run to the brink

You can see what's under my sink
And I do shit just to do it

Yo I come from a crack in the ground, a hole in the wall
And dog when the crack ain't around, the smokers'll brawl
Streets like a bullet in cancer, it'll swallow you up
Or eat you from the inside and hollow you up

And everyday like a test, you know life got rules
And its sorta like checkers and chess
I went to school and took the lessons punk
Know a pawn get kinged, a bishop get juiced

A rook get jumped
Faggot niggas took the easy route
They either coked out, smoked out, doped out
Niggas took the needle route

And I ain't tryin to take either route
I'm tryin to stop get weeded out
Really, tryin to weed it out
No the flipside we choosin your way

Like gettin fat from losin the weight
Or losing that from, usin the weight
I feel like I'm speeding and I'm 'bout to crash
No where to go and I'm gettin there fast

 Ooouu hooouu, I got nowhere to
 Ooouu hooouu, got nowhere

 There's only two places to go, we either dead or in jail
 What the...
(girl singing)
 Ooouu hooouu, I got nowhere

[Beanie Sigel]
Eh yo I'm caught up in the system where the blind lead the blind
And this artist only speaks on the signs of the time
And I pop pills in purple rain to state my pain
They say I'm just like my father, bold and too cold

But you know that's how a thug ride
I send a kite through a dove in a jail where the thugs cry
I feel your pain when you restrained and your love die
And make your heart hard, the blood in your vein fry

Feel like I'm trapped and I'm blindfolded
But my eyes wide open to see it
Feel like the O'Jay's, climbin those stairways hopin
Heaven's gates wide open for me

Look towards a lie, Sige in direction
Still I spin in every direction, seekin directions
Tryin to balance out the good with the imperfections
Yeah I know I still move with nowhere to go

[Chorus]

[Freeway]
It seems like we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom to see faces of the people that I shot
When I get high late night, flow through the bottom
My aunt's house, one of the places that I stopped

See she just died, she got cancer from smokin and drinkin
The same shit that I'm drinkin and smokin
I can't lie, wish life would just open its handcuffs
And let me go, I feel like I'm doin a bit

I can't slide, so what I'm a rapper?
I can't escape the wrath of the law if I crash up my whip
Or get, blast in the jaw
Prick, masterded his fifth

I might go triple platinum, become a household name
After a long day of out of town work make my way to the plane
Plane fast in the tenth
Hear mayday, mayday, control's outta work
How the hell can life end like this? Nowhere to go

We all started innocent
Eating Reese's Pieces
I was young, then wearing 5 star Aleses
Bullet in ya gut a have a bag catch ya feces

20 months, vision quest, sleeping in a tepee
Since my dad died, attitude worsened
That's why I stole cars before I could write cursive
Thousand miles from being rich, stuck on my grind

Try to sale nickel bags like Louie Baton
I'm young, I'm good, best shape of my life
One shot from big shit a blow you out of ya Nikes
Only a dick head wouldn't want to be rich

And do his car like school and drop out in the 6
You could look at my wrist, It wasn't shit on it
But I was determined to get a little gliss on em
The 40 ounce bottles done turned to Cris on em
And every bitch that was fronting, I'ma piss on em

Like any average one
You know the dirty kids on the block having fun
Hand to hand is how the grams is slung

But you remember those latter days
Them tubleware, soul food platter days

That was ya mom little hustle on a Saturdays
Back then, when it really didn't matter days
You would take that beating
'Cause you wasn't trying to be

The only one who missed the house party on the weekend
Knowing that them project chicks was in there freaking
Grinding off ""As We Lay""
Walk with me why'all

Back in the Day, you and ya man slap tapping away
Pitching chains, playing craps everyday
Getting high on the block
Green bottles of private stock

2 dollar 40's
Sparks tell ya story

[Chorus]

[Sparks]
I come up fragile and timid
Pressed to the limit
12 years old, no household
From the start I was finished

Disowned by the biologicals
And adopted by rolling stones on corners, sipping Thunderbird
Banging needles and pushing stolen Regals
And with no hoe and no money, layered my hunger pains daily with rice and gravy

Stuck between a rock and a hard spot as a juvenile
Just made me want to holla ""Lord help me""
But I had will power
Stole a burner from Uncle Lester

And that .22 long blossomed to wild flower
Now when I enter rooms the conversation stop
And them cock suckers whisper
These faggots ain't got no cahunas

So if they so much as touch me
I cock back and put like bananas on them mokey motherfuckers
Show no love for these cock suckers
Weeping

Who can't deal with life situations cause that's money to me

Moves like Carl Lewis when it's coming out the clip

Focused, trying to purchase all the burners I can get
I know plenty niggas fell, trying to chauffer through this shit

From them nosey neighbors and the boys in blue mom,
But I remember them times, no food in the crib
Nobody taking timeout schoolin' the kids

In school with the kids they got they Timb's on
Buttered up, it wasn't right
I'm up in there my slim's on button up, it's alright
But they ain't never clown me, they see pain up in me
I had a little Sugar Shane up in me

[Beanie Sigel]
Why that cat gotta be pushin' them Bently's
Back to back like that , cause' god meant me 
You little dirty punks ain't ready for the boy
Load four thiry chunks and eatin' seventy more

What makes you say that is it cause I'm laid back
Spinnin' through them wheels of fortune like Sajak
Pump your brakes scrap, I only spit it for ya'll
Niggas like my nigga Mark eatin' space packs

Ya'll niggas want R.I.P but I'm CEO
I remember I use to see CC
Cop, cook, and collect 
My nigga Kyle use to cook it the best

But for you crooked cops I got a 40 cal that'll cook up
Ya' chest, paralyzed my man, slimmed his legs and
Paralyzed his chance, I know Allah got plans 
But still I reminisce at night this can't be us this
Can't be right

[Chorus: x 2]

[Omilio]
It's funny me chasing change
Made my whole life change, got me a range
Slammed in the bing, freedom snatched away
Hug my momma from a K,

But mom is hurting no more

It's lots of shine in the ghetto
Too many haters in the hood (too hard, niggas be hatin)
Gotta watch what you doin 
The ghetto only cop black shine in the hood (Freeway, Young Gunz)
This for my niggas who thug like shaked lights in the ghetto (Oschino)

Yo we gotta, hollow the gat, bottle the smack
When the cops pull up we gotta swallow the crack
All my niggas did time like Geronimo Prep
See the Benz like damn, what model is that
Oschino, the nigga who was locked in a cage
Niggas clockin my style like flavor flave
Fuck gettin the Source Award, or gettin Five Mics
I'm happy just gettin my daughter a pink bike
A roof over her head and some Barbie skates
It's plenty of nights man, I hardly ate
I'm from where the summers dangerous, the winters is cold
And bitches pop Van X's like birth control
I got bitches on death row, stuck with a cell number
So close to Jesus they got his cell number
The ghetto is trife, this is my life
How many rappers you know been down for murder twice?

Yo what up wit ch'all niggas
What it look like?
Throw it in the pot, see if the shit cook right
We can get it down, see if it bubble white or brown
Take it to the town and break my youngin's down
It's doin good, business is lookin fine
Get 'em for 20, but maybe 29
Youngin out on his grind, youngin poppin 'em nine's
I'm a juvenile delinquent, youngin was doin time
Cause Judge Reynold's left it up to my mom (what else?)
And I was thinkin like, damn ain't that crazy?
But mom duke's can't live without her baaaby
I'm back home, thrity eight strong, out on my own
Thinkin, get it wit chrome
Fuck makin them songs, but my mind right now
And this rap shit be my grind right now (now...now...)

You ever heard a nigga's lawyer scared to talk for him?
Creep in the dark on him, the led bark on him
I'm on his head til the Fed's spread chalk for him
That's how we do it dawg, these the last days
Yeah I had my bad days, I been through it ch'all
But I grew back (grew back)
Got my groove back (groove back)
That's how we do in trainin, cockin them two's back
Same dudes namin', givin up news
Gettin up on the stand, endin up on the news
It's fucked up what that pressure'll do
And you don't want to fuck up when they questionin you

Get snatched from the hood
Feds grab 'em, and some get put in the dirt
Some live in grime, good with the work
Stick up kids get hit with the nine
But the funeral parlor good with embalming fluid
Good with the hearst
Some niggas don't even grind
But still make a stack every other night, good with the dice
So it don't even matter, get hungry in the hood
Miss Low is sharp with the platters, good with the rice
And her daughter's just like her
Shootouts, they stash my guns, and I got away good with the knives
The end of the nights, stash my ones

And dog when the crack ain't around, the smokers'll brawl
Streets like a bullet in cancer, it'll swallow you up
or eat you from the inside and hollow you up
And everyday like a test, you know life got rules
and its sorta like checkers and chess
I went to school and took the lessons punk
Know a pawn get kinged, a bishop get juiced
A rook get jumped
Faggot niggas took the easy route
They either coked out, smoked out, doped out
Niggas took the needle route
And I ain't tryin to take either route
I'm tryin to stop get weeded out
Really, tryin to weed it out
No the flipside we choosin your way
Like gettin fat from losin the weight
or losing that from, usin the weight
I feel like I'm speeding and I'm 'bout to crash
No where to go and I'm gettin there fast

Ooouu hooouu, I got nowhere to
Ooouu hooouu, got nowhere

We in the streets player get your man
There's only two places to go, we either dead or in jail
What the
Ooouu hooouu, I got nowhere

Eh yo I'm caught up in the system where the blind lead the blind
and this artist only speaks on the signs of the time
And I pop pills in purple rain to state my pain
They say I'm just like my father, bold and too cold
But you know that's how a thug ride
I send a kite through a dove in a jail where the thugs cry
I feel your pain when you restrained and your love die
and make your heart hard, the blood in your vein fry
Feel like I'm trapped and I'm blindfolded
But my eyes wide open to see it
Feel like the O'Jay's, climbin those stairways hopin
Heaven's gates wide open for me
Look towards a lie, Sige in direction
Still I spin in every direction, seekin directions
Tryin to balance out the good with the imperfections
Yeah I know I still move with nowhere to go

[Chorus]

It seems like we grind from the bottom
just to make it to the bottom to see faces of the people that I shot
When I get high late night, flow through the bottom
My aunt's house, one of the places that I stopped
See she just died, she got cancer from smokin and drinkin
The same shit that I'm drinkin' and smokin
I can't lie, wish life would just open its handcuffs
and let me go, I feel like I'm doin a bit
I can't slide, so what I'm a rapper?
I can't escape the wrath of the law if I crash up my whip
or get, blast in the jaw
Prick, mastered his fifth
I might go triple platinum, become a household name
After a long day of out of town work make my way to the plane
Plane fast in the tenth
Hear mayday, mayday, control's outta work
How the hell can life end like this? Nowhere to go

[Verse 3 - Sonny Black]
If that block used to get paper
Then throw that work on it
broadly your flow ain't shit
You need to work on it
Fat asses hit em hard from the back
It hurt don't it?
And that nigga got what in the stash?
Went right on it
Playa that money talk
Gats'll make 'em sumersault, like gymnastics
When the mac spit, you'll lay in caskets
why'all only hot for a minute
We makin classics, got mad clips
and we get through metal detectors, gats is plastic
I'm a thug, raised around drugs and niggas who ain't never have shit
Wherever the clubs at, my homies gon' crash it
1:45 roll in with somethin early
that go in smashin 'em
We don't keep hammers for nothin
We gon' be blastin 'em
You know that slogan
""True playa from the Himilyah""
Hit her for years and I never had to spend or pay her
Names is ringin, niggas is singin
Waist line on the wrist playa, it can change the season

It's B Sig in the place with State P
And we got what it takes to rock the mic right yeah!
Still watch what you say to B. Sig
'Cause I still will knock your ass the fuck out

I bring the hood when I'm traveling
Scrap backwoods unraveling
Scrap smoke good when we traveling
Forget the Mac's 'cause the K's fit good in the Caravan
I clap up your hood like the hammer man
Bring your gat, better bust it if you get that close
You're scared to clap better strap your folks (strap, your, folks)
Who want beef with State P,
Enemies try to speak to me
Negative they don't get that close

It's Free, listen
Blow trees with Mac Mittens
(No we didn't) Yes we did!

Bring the broads down with ribbons

Hit him with the AK nigga (free no you didn't)
Yes I did
Overpayed shit? Wait a minute, when this fakin
Snatch the cake up out his crib

If you can't get Nelly you'a settle for who boy?
Two toy carrier, two stashes
One truck that seats six asses
Twenty-Twos to confuse the masses
Remove glasses, blow smoke up in my ashes
I used to drive my mama stuff
Now the school boy puttin' twenties on the Bomb Pop truck
I make rappers go back to the block
They be like ""maybe I was better off selling rocks""
I'm Murphey Lee in the place to be punk
And I got enough skunk to fill the whole blunt
I take trips with chumps up in my trunk
And I take 'em real far to a safe place to dump

It's Mister countdown
I'm with ya dirty go head and lay down
Finance a pay-down, heard what I said now?
See how I procede with caution

Nut check, gut check, 'cause I say what I wanna
Around six in the six with the throwback
Sixers, number six Julius Irv'
Cris and the herb, make it hard to swirve
Throw your hands up, if you didn't bang your rim on the curb
You gettin't hit while you was makin a turn
I strike a nerve and old MC's wantin' a comeback
I got repsect but it's lost and that's a fact
Like K, nooone here even said your name
R, You really feeling guilty bout something man
S, Sad to see you really just want just
One more hit please please!
You the first old man who should get a rapper's pension
No we ain't system call this mic invention
I'm snitching? Matter fact stay the fuck out the kitchen
Nelly kickin' with too many dimensions
Mid west, and we aim about mid chest
Duked on my side, too many in my tribe
Coupe outside who the fuck want a ride?

The alias you've been living under the mack goes thrriiing
Peddi, Peddi, I heard that they watch your mother

Got a hit on your brother, like motherfucker don't - blliinng
Crack, smack a tooth out your choppers
Any wrong move, I blast the tool up on you fuckers
Wait, that's just enough for you to follow

Stop playing thinking you touch him, trouble you deep in it
Clock spitting, it's just the principle, my principality

Follow me home, better have a full tank, money for shoes
What you fools think, full bank money from shows
It's the Roc bitch, I'm on your block bitch
I'm in the cock-pit, you think it's a rose

So what if it's brown from Mac, gotta take it back, back
And gotta bobble the gat, push your shit back, back

Got the greatest listening, haters 4-5'n them

Do not bother the rumble, niggaz ready too, bang you in a second

Or the last bullet from my Mac blaang, mayne
My whole click goin' reign, the half a clip will melt ya
For shelter, don't get caught up in the drizzle
Hit you in the spittle, and then bring it back again

Crack a 40 when the sun go down
It's a cold winter, y'all niggaz better bundle up
An' I bet it be a hotter summer, grab a onion

Yes, the ROC gets down, you hot now, listen up
Don't you know cops' whole purpose is to lock us down?
An' throw away the key, but without this drug shit
Your kids ain't got no way to eat

We still try to keep Mom smilin'
'cause when the teeth stop showin'
An' the stomach start growlin', then the heat start flowin'
If you from the hood, I know you feel me, keep goin'

If a sneak start leanin' an' the heat stop workin'
Then my heat start workin', I'ma rob me a person
Catch a nigga sleepin' while he out in the open
An' I'ma get him, keep flowin'

We gotta raise our kids while we livin'
Make a million off a record, bail my niggaz outta prison
Fuck a Bentley or a Lexus, just my boys in the squadder
Nigga talk reckless, then I hit 'em with the Smif an'

But I'm never snitchin', I'm a rider
If my kids hungry, snatch the dishes out ya kitchen
I'll be wylin' til they pick me outta line up

We keep the nines tucked, chopped dimes up, rap about it
Wyle out, fuck niggaz up, laugh about it
I'm not tryin' to visit the morgue
But Freeway move out 'til I sit with the Lord

'Til I get my shit together, clean up my sins
Freeway got it in like 10 in the mornin'
An' I can get it to ya like 10 while you yawnin', man

Still deliver the order, man
An' I ain't talkin' 'bout chicken an' gravy, man
I'm talkin' 'bout bricks 'o ye yo, halves an' quarters
4 an' a halves of hash, you do the math

Swing past us, scoop up your daughter
She wanna roll wit' a thug that rap, you do the math
He won't blast 'til my stacks in order

Man, lemme get 'em Free
Hove never slackin', man, zippin' in the black Range
Faster than the red ghost, gettin' ghost wit' Pac, man
One time, know a got a knack to get that change
Leader of the black gang, ROC, man

Bang like T-Mac, ski mask, air it out
Gotta kill witnesses 'cause Free's beard's stickin' out
Y'all don't want no witness shit, we squeeze hammers, man
Bullets breeze by you, like Louisiana, man

But I gotta feed Tianna, man
So I move keys, you can call me the Piano Man
Rain, sleet, hail, snow, man
Slang dough, E, hydro, man

Know B. Sige in the third lane
Gramps still prayin', workin' on my nerves, man
Like, ""Son you gotta get your soul clean
Before they blow them horns like Coltrane""

But still I cry tears of a hustler
Wipe tears from my mother, pull out beers for her brothers
That's above us, make beds for the babies
Tuck kids under covers, buy cribs for their mothers

Shit, I'll probably be wylin' with their fathers
Tell Ms. Robert, tell Enijah that I'm ridin' for her father
That's like my brother, like same mother, different father
Any problems? Dog, know I got 'em

An' still we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom, sold crack in the alleyways
Still gave back Marcy 'A Dollar Day'
Real gangstas make hood holidays

They ain't thank us but we still paid homage, man
Soul Food Sunday, lookin' like Big Momma's, man
Tell the gang I never break my promise, man, man

Even though what we do is wrong
Even though what we do is wrong

And when I bang out in the hood, I just fuck up my bread
Instead of lead,I save it when I see you face to face
Right now, I'm fucking wit hoes, they don't gimme face shit!

Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Leave me alone (never leave me alone)
Never leave me alone

[Nate Dogg]
They tell me that temptation, oh, is very hard to resist
You tell me that you want me, i tried to hide my feelings, d-o-gs
Ain't supposed to feel like this
You can call it what you want to, but I don't even know what it is
You've got me singing in the morning, you bring me breakfast in my bed
And when it hurts you rub my head
Ill ask you one time only, baby, wont you be there when its hectic
When I don't have a hit record (never leave me alone)

[Chorus]

[Nate Dogg]
Ive traveled so many places, I've seen so many faces
There were times I didn't think Id make it through (alone)
I went through so many phases, that got me so many cases
Three strikes you're gonna then what you gonna do
I guess Ill call my lady, and tell her to kiss my baby
They tell me that crime is all I know how to do
Tell him his daddy's sorry, let him know all about me
There's one more thing Id really like for you to do

[Chorus]

[Snoop Dogg]
Somebody was naughty when they snitched on me
A'm mobbing through the county mainline
Back in 9500 just trying to handle mine
Spitting game at the homies about the good ol days
As we try to pass time waiting for the chain to chino
I see no reason to cry but I miss my baby boo
And my nigga spanky too
Its true that the dirt I did from an o.g. to a snotty nose kid
Got me caught up in the rapture like maze days gone by
And real gs gon cry
But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky
And hope my baby boo ain't fucking niggas on the outside
But whats the chance it ain't cracking
If I was out and she was in Id probably be macking
I cant lie
So I say I would now my girl in a world of player hood
A player should show a nigga love and look our
But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out
So keep away better yet stay away
And hope I get out one day, OK
But if I don't I guess this is home
My girl is tripping she got a block on the phone

And I clap your men; I'm from a block where niggas might blast your pops
No chance ambulance can't save your kin; smoke reefer burn reefer
Chill in my spot instead of making selat drink liters of gin
I'm drunk again I'm high again I just might fly a kite
To my niggas up state knocked off in the pen
They booked in a jail; I'm booking a flight

Nigga, the name is strong, it can mean ten things in one
This dedicated to my niggas that grind from ten to ten
In other words all day duck the cops 'cause they want to be free
Man, them gates is strong and when that nigga locked down and he can't get out
And he lose a couple pounds and his skin get pale
And he's sittin in his cell til his patience gone, you know
Freeway be feelin your pain, I got twelve homies doin the same
And if they had bail, homey, they'd be out
But they don't so they sittin for a minute
That's the price of the game when you in it
Your freedom get strippin away
These niggas came through my hood with the nines
My man Black hit they wheel with the K, spun it around
Same day cops book em guess who send kites to em, nigga?

Shootin out with Free you gon' need a four leaf

I seen bullets come up out the lamas and go into melons
And leave niggas killas leakin like Aunt Jemima
Fuck what ya man think that nigga gone but he ain't Free
Gimme the kees, y'all niggas is bitchin
Package it up, I'm out with the breeze
In and out of lanes until I get where I'm goin

Not payin attention, lunchin, gripped by the deez
Gotta be on point movin ya work by them benches
That's how I got my change, fam
Ain't a damn thang free in this world but your boy got a mean plan
To get my team out the ghetto with my boys in stilettos til we rich man

I can get ya chick on E
See through her dress, get the address
Give her the F, pass her to E
They say the best things in life are free, but I can't tell
I gotta pay for all the food that I take in
And gotta pay for all the chronic that I inhale
That's why I stick with my team, nigga, stick with my men
y'all dudes freelance, play for any team
Don't stand for nothin then you fall for anything
Turn on your voice soon as you get any cheers
But it's cool, beat downs with bats and spiked chains are free
Gettin played and haters screamin my name ain't me
Gettin paid and changin the game is me
That's why I keep a gatt in the tuck
That rip through ya bean, y'all niggas mad 'cause y'all ain't Free
Look, I focus and aim, listen to bull
One verse can fuck up the game
Kick in a door, icier chain
Clean up ya kids, hook up ya bulls but gotta work hard 'cause it ain't free
Used to get work hard couldn't cook soft

You can't make it to the show
And niggaz make it to the jail
Shed a tear

[Chorus: Freeway]
When you hear the song
Will you cry (it's fucked up man)
Cause you know you wrong(how you go out then you locked up)
Will you cryyyy (how you run around a lie)
When you hear the song (can you dig)
Will you cry
Cause you know your wrong (but I got one more person to address)
Will you cry (I ain't forget about you ol' girl, I remember)

[Verse 3: Freeway]
Oh look
Who could it be, Ms. Lee
You know this nigga ain't kiddin'
Think harder, Freeway L. Pridgen
Shit you used to tell me make me want to work harder
At gettin' crack spots sent me to prison
Said I'm never gonna be a thang
So I listened and skipped school
Had them thing distributed
Fuck class, on the block all day
My science was choppin', baggin', dividin', addin', the math
How my teacher gonna tell me I'm dumb
Had me feelin' like a sore thumb
Clown of the class (uh)
I got graded most hated with guns
But now I made it to the life
Couldn't make it to the class
If this nigga chew your ear
That's an oh for you to hear
Kiss my ass!

[Chorus: Freeway]
When you hear the song
Will you cry
Cause you know your wrong (you know you wrong)
Will you cryyyy
When you hear the song (feel me)
Will you cry
Cause you know you wrong (State Prop Chang Gang)
Will you cryyyy

This is dedicated to all, all the motherfucker out there
You, you, and you mothefucker who did something wrong

Freeway,"Ooh
It's that real street shit
[Incomprehensible] they're ready for this one, nigga
Ooh shit ohh

I came up with my man, same hood, same age
Withheld names to protect the guilty and
Your boy, Free was filthy, same clothes, different day
Be the first to admit it, while niggaz claim to be willies, hey

We cleaned up the first Donny I drove
We cooled up the first tommy I seen, follow the flow
Smoke a timmy, with this semi, made his chimney move
Nerves made his body shake, everybody froze

So young with a pump and a mac
But still manage to make it the magic, the bad kids
On the block, with a bundle of crack, package of pills
All heads will try to teach us to rhyme

He said, ?Muhammed walk with a sword?, I roll with a gat
This the same shit, different day, from times
Now my man Book ain't writing me back
So I figured, try to reach 'em with rhymes, no listen to Mac

We thuggin' for life gonna take it
And then enough ain't no mistakin'
But it's for life, it's my life
Not for the taking

To all my boys in the hood, the East Coast throw boy back
From the land of them throw boys black
I keep my toast in the hood, gon' squeeze
Hope you throw yours back come to the streets
To bring my homeboys back

Blew my mind out this piece, but I'm always back
I got sheet in my air, like mac, fall away back
Shit, I'm trynna come way up
And make the path so freak, I tear the runaway up

My life a bitch with a period on
But still I keep it real, dog, I'm hittin' it raw
And I don't know how to carry this bitch
Sometime I wanna marry this bitch

Sometimes I feel like quitting this whore
But I can't 'cause it feel like, giving it all
I've been on so fucking much, feel like my living was all
But in my lifetime, I'm a deliver regrets
Still with the evils, know that one day I'ma sit with the boss

We thuggin' for life gonna take it
And then enough ain't no mistakin'
But it's for life, it's my life
Not for the taking

It's not even close, we throw toast, sleep with ya gats
It's the worst of both hoods, holla at 'em Mac
Follow up exact with the Mac, and the V
Get back, if you happen to see, the Mac or Free, at where you be

I be where you at, I come where you live
The cat untuckle the gat, maneuver the thing
The Mac untuckin' a pump, removin' they wig, with ease
Hear the feds trynna ruin the boss Sieg'

'Fore they kill me like Cornbread, you be like Dial Lo
Before I'm stuck like Luima, I be up when you need it
And I'ma ride for you, lace up my sneakers, puffin' my reefer
Tuckin' my heater, duckin' your rounder

Tell 'em tricks they gonna die when I see 'em
Let 'em know my friend colt 45 trynna meet with they mind
But we keep drama, think, rhyme is the reason
And Freeway the reason that you tied up in pajamas

We thuggin' for life gonna take it
And then enough ain't no mistakin'
But it's for life, it's my life
Not for the taking

Four door for the stick up boys if they want war
Fiends comin' all night all I heard was four more

When it was jumpin' me and Rell hit dances
You could pick me out the crowd rockin' the cap
But things change
'Cause my man Rell fightin' a body
On state row where it's so cold
Rockin' his blues
I roll with the ROC
Still trynna rock at a show
Shit ain't like 98' niggaz pockets is low
Which way do I go?
Indictments blew over
Man whipped a few shoulders
Shovel nick boulders gettin' it slow
Me, I'm in the studio switchin' the flow
Changin' the styles

'Cause they just shittin' them up
And changin' the size

See the change in his eyes

Just grab four and a half get it outta my trunk

And the only rock I worry bout is right on my face
We bout to go shake, rattle his block (shots) with no plans
Shots fired, cops came

Tryna to survive in the hood everyday
Takes, everything you work with
Everything you got quick
From the cops wyle off the product

Show em what helped a lot but I can't get it
I hugged the block, light an L
Let my man hit it and ran with it
Sell it nixed to the pops

Hate to tell ya if he don't get it from me
Then he gon get it somewhere else
Sometimes I would if I was somewhere else
Me and my man on the corner with two crates

Picture us rollin, somewhere else
Pretendin to be pushin the V's
Then two fiends walked up to me
Brought me back to reality

He want three and he want five
But my packed stash (why) 'cause the cops act like I'm Lil' Cease

No rules, no trees just a lot in the push
My [unknown] in the house, read my mouth
Fuck the D's got a pocket to push
Send fleas in the opposite way

Quarter to one guess I stop at the ?
Gimme a grub, count up the profit I made
Rule number one
Sell your first stack and cop you a gun

We hear gun shots, we hardly amazed
My man Willie Mays and Santana live on the run
What does it mean? not goin' back
Not gettin' caged, strong with a gat

Prepare for the raid
Listen Mothers, bodies still underaged
You better talk to your sons
Send em on a straight line from the lines

And move straight to the pen
Sleep with a blade, husky niggaz touchin they chin
Get bailed, get out and then they at it again
All for the love of the pay

[Chorus - Freeway + (Female Singing)]
(You don't know)
How it is in the hood so Freeway bring the hood to your front porch
My niggaz duck court pour weed in the woods
Set up shop and move rocks on the front step
(You don't know)
How it is in the ghetto the tech blow hear shots echo
We can't let go, stuck on the block
Stuck in the hood, street niggaz up to no good

[Verse 3 - O. Sparks]
Every since I don't stop waist side
Sparks had the ambition to ride
O. Town play games but I need this chain
Got me deep in the game

To the point, yea coulnd't get no rest, no sleep
All I did was hug the block
And shake the police while they shakin the bag
At age 18, like half a brick, crack got half the street

Most of my always call me ""Snoop""
'Cause I couldn't cook this shit then
So I brought all my worst stylin fiends
Runnin' back to the kid like ""Sparks man, you sold me some bullshit""

But I kept on pumpin' cause the block kept on jumpin
I'm not stoppin', I was told the sky's the limit
Plus I'm tryna to push the roads
And park the [unknown]

And let you know what exactly takes places in the ghetto
When techs blow
When the cops circle, I know the bells like ?
Run fast with that .38 special

I hear these haters talking seem like they're getting louder
These sweet cupcakes softer than some clam chowder
I'm from the city to proudly serve crack rocks?
For twenty dollars get you higher than an astronaut
I keep a Glock in my state prop jeans
Floating on cloud nine goin' off codiene
I chuck a deuce to a hater
I'm on a mission for paper
I got Lil' Hawk with me serving dope fiends like a waiter
I'm on the south B with my boy do you
Big bank take little bank baby tell me what it do
These boys talking loud but they ain't saying a thang
But Paul Wall and Freeway will make 'em sang

[Chorus]

It's the Swishahouse state prop chain gang
.45 cal big Glock bang bang
I keep the Tupperware tucked in my underwear
Rain down thunder on these suckers make the clutter clear
Let's get one thing clear I run with grizzly bears
Bite you in your back and make you straighten out your chest hair
I'm 100 baby no time for playing games
I got a garden full of carats hanging in my chain
I keep a player bought my paper fuck a hater
Cause the real turn fake switching over like a cross fader
I'm squashing chatter climbing up the ladder
Cause my goal is to make my pockets fatter baby Paul Wall

Listen close I got duct tape and rope
I'll leave you missin' like the fuckin' O'Bannons
One hand on my money, on hand on my buddy
That's the A-K forty seven made his neighborhood love me
Bullets like birds you can hear them bitches hummin'
Don't let that bird shit, he got a weak stomach
Niggas know I'm sick I don't spit I vomit
Got it?
One egg short of the omelet
Simon says, shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg
And tell him catch up like mayonnaise, um
I'm the sickest nigga doin' it
Bet that baby
These other niggas dough I'm wet crack baby, yes
Get back get back boy this a set back
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a death trap
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush
And when it comes to that paper I stack books
You heard what I said
I can put you on your feet 
Or put some money on your head
Life ain't cheap
You're better off dead
If you can't pay the fee
Shout out my nigga fee
See every mother fucker at the door don't get a key
You outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see
Its about money its bigger than me
I told my homies don't kill him bring the nigga to me, yea
Don't miss, you fuckin' with the hit man
Kidnap a nigga make him feel like a kid again

If a nigga try to stick me I'm a blam him

Got the green and got the tan got the whole enchilada

Tie up your brother
Make the prick call up your mother 
She might know where to find you
I am, on top of my job
The heavyweight champ of the flow
Its flow like the ocean, open water you drownin'
I will, four pond 'em 
And sink them heat 'em and leave 'em stinkin'
Sharks surround them and eat them nice then know that I will
Roll over ya squad like I'm a one punch card

I will, take control of your soldiers
You wont listen till I toss them in the wok like chicken

This rap shit like diggin' in the register, dealin' with big embezzlers
Get it right, I'm better and better than my competitors
Ahead, another level up, me, I'm worth eleven plugs
I can stop rappin', ain't I already said enough?
The whole motherfuckin' game owe me, time to settle up
If I move forward a little slower, you'll be catching up
Man that's the shit you need to listen for
'Cause where I'm from niggas dumb, they'll give you what you're itching for
It's a issue with you, best to handle your business, bro
'Cause ain't no politicking when killas comin' to get you, bro
Hey, although, they don't know the whole fire
In the dark, shoot sparks like rim with no tire
I don't deal with the lames, I'd much rather blow by ya

And I'm really off the wire, look at me, I'm on fire
Here's some useful information if you don't know sire
Snort that cake (cake), and I'm not fake (fake)

Oh shit, yo, yo, run!

Aiyo, I jumped from the 8th floor step, hit the ground
The pound fell, cops is coming
Runnin' through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin'
Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summon
So I stopped at the 2nd floor, ran across, cracks is fallin'
My pockets is lean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy
The walkie talkies them D-E-T's had, black, they was rated P.G.
Run, I will not give up, no, quick flag the car down
Take me to, Ghost here they come now!
Er! Pull off quick, back up, hit the bitch, dog
Turned down Hill, light the Marley spliff
Run! I will not get bagged on the rock
Run! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops
Run! They am' shit, plan shit, destroy evidence
Fuck a case, I'm not comin' home when I'm fifty six
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me and shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop
Curse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word
That I told the chief on Rich Port I don't wanna merge

I skated through the back of the building, hit the steps up
Ran up in Kay crib, lay daddy rest
I had to break free, police on me and they F-B's
Yelling ""I think his name Lex, that's his aunt, freeze""
That's when I hit the window, indo' coming out the back room
Boom, Pretty and his man, Black Caesar
Damn, they saw me and they bustin' at me
Cab just missed me, plus them goochie frames, foul, that's six fifty
Stop back at suite, them leaf defense slid through my man garden
Yelled out 'pardon', kept it moving, peace
Build be gone, ain't no honor amongst thieves
Please, plus they heard I'm getting Parmesan cheese
And I won't stop moving til the metal dig me
Say word, yo, make 'em work for it, young rookie, y'all need me
That's when it is, what it is, if it's that or the cup
But in the ill gangstas book what they niggas do is

[Chorus]
Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone
Run! If you gettin' chased with no shoes on
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns!
They givin' out life like by the tons
Run! If you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip
So, run! Hop fences, jump over benches!
When you see me comin' get the fuck out the entrance!
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns!

Ah-hah! I might gotta take my shirt off (yeah, kid)
I like that one (uh-huh, go in, go in!)

Yo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car
I got five hundred, hundred packs in my backyard
Clear twelve-twelve's, that look like stuff shells
I'm cuttin' niggas throats on the sails, while they puff L's
Don't leave nothin' unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything (to save everything)
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she gettin' knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that
Uh, down-shiftin' on 'em like I got gears on me
(Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me
(Run!) Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me
(Run!) My Timb's start feelin' like they Nike Air's on me
(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the throughway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm try'nna hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm asthmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
'Magine if I would of let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do

Free hold east coast whole, boxing the Philly down
Down to Dela', when y'all rarely toting the milli round
I bring the milli to ya house, I was just down south
Carolina had the milli down there
Pearl Beach had the heater in reach, and four freaks
In Hooters, I made 'em lose it when they heard freedom of speech
Told them freaks that I gotta run, I'm on the run
But they tried to make me stay, they showed me two hooters a piece
I stayed for a second but you know I gotta skate
It's like a race, cops chase me, I'm chasing the moon
Before I left the premise, saw two more bitches
They told me they was witches, told me hop on they broom
I did, and then we went zoom
Don't you know them witches got me outtie wit the quickness
I'm buggin', I'm trippin' in reality I'm skitzin'
The cops got me trapped in the Audi wit the Smith and

[Chorus]

D-Boy, yeah, Birdman Jr. in ya building, people
I'm a let you know how it go on my side of the mountain, whoadie

It's sure about does that you heard me
And I dropped in effect since 9/11
I'm on the avenue with nines, elevens, I'm a two times felon
That's why I keep the top up, on my 9-11
Pele, in New Orleans, ain't got no Rico law
So I keep that heat in the car, but they don't know
I had that 'dro in the seat of the car
But it's hot right now, so you can see me tomorrow
Ay, Ghostface, the youngins on the block duckin' blue and red lights
While your boy bypassing fare light
But if them cock suckers ever get me dead right
Three hots and the cops swallow weed and a knife, right?
I speed at night, take it easy in the day
Go hard wit the dough, take it easy wit the yae
Yup, Lil' Weezy, I get my loot up
But at the pull up, come, I say my crew run run, boy

And, our money was funny, we ain't know no Prada
No dough, no jewels, so the hoes didn't bother
I was going to school, wearing clothes from my Father
Had to post up with the stickers, that a stigmata?
If you don't hustle where I live, then you don't get nada
Was a disgrace to my mom, pulled my first case
Grinding in the crack house, on my 26th hour
No fresh pair of clothes, took no shower
I was posted like the Baker trying to flip the flour
Couple older Muslims tried to give us xxx
Then the people raided us, the shit went sour

Fuck the people trying to put a co-defendant on me
Can't catch another case, my kids depending on me
Know the difference, some friends are real, some friends are phoney
Fall in love, but don't ever marry a Tenderoni
'Cause when niggas can't get at you, they'll get at her

And my raps are spitting facts, all I know is the truth
I been gearing, I've been back
I've been rich and I've been crack
Got this whole shit popping, then I was damn near forgotten
Left the Roc, but miraculously managed to blossom
They thought that I would lose my faculties, without the faculty
Evil men, sent their defense in to tackle me
Their evil xxx evil eye, match their evil grin

They do it for their dead homies, let em' be with them
Try to rip my youngin's up, before they see the Pen

Et même s'il est plein de défauts

Par du carton, sont rembourrées

L'premier qu'a voulu ma vertu
Pour me posséder n'a pas eu
A fair' de siège
Il n'a eu qu'à m'ouvrir les bras
Et mon amour est tombé là
Comm' dans un piège
Si j'avais l'esprit perverti
Mon coeur au contraire était lui
Pur comm' la neige
Nous éveillant sous les bécots
Nous allions à tous les échos
Chanter l'amour,
Comm' deux moineaux !

Il me plaqua a-t-il eu tort ?
Je me suis consolée d'un sort
Qui est le nôtre
Avec un p'tit gars déssalé
Mais qui pour ne pas travailler
M'vendit à d'autres
On s'accoutume à ne plus voir
La poussière grise du trottoir
Où l'on se vautre
Chaqu' soir su' l'pavé parigot
On cherch' son pain dans le ruisseau
Le coeur joyeux,
Comm' des moineaux !

L'hiver viendra et mon seul bien
Ce pauvre corps qui je l'sens bien
Déjà se lasse
Tomb'ra sur le pavé brutal
J' pens'rai sur un lit d'hôpital
Un soir d'angoisse
Pas plus mauvaise que beaucoup
J'aurais préféré malgré tout
Au lieu d'un poisse
Un homm' qui m'eut aimé d'amour
Pour avec lui finir mes jours
Dans un nid chaud,
Comme un moineau !",Comme un Moineau,1995

Y en a qui vous parl’nt de l’Amérique,
Ils ont des visions de cinéma ;
Ils vous dis’nt "" Quel pays magnifique ""
Notre Paris n’est rien auprès d’ça.
Ces boniments-là rend’nt moins timide,
Bref, l’on y part, un jour de cafard…
Ca f’ra un d’plus qui, le ventre vide,
L’soir à New York cherch’ra un dollar
Au milieu des gueus’s, des proscrits,
Des émigrants aux cœurs meurtris ;
Il pens’ra , regrettant Paris :

R.
Où est-il mon Moulin d’la Plac’ Blanche ?
Mon tabac et mon bistro du coin ?
Tous les jours étaient pour moi Dimanche !
Où sont-ils les amis, les copains ?
Où sont-ils tous mes vieux bals musette ?
Leur javas au son d’l’accordéon ?
Où sont-ils tous mes r’pas sans galette ?
Avec un cornet d’frites à dix ronds
Où sont ils donc ?

D 'antres croyant gagner davantage.
Font des rêves d'or encore plus beaux
Pourquoi risquer un si long voyage
Puisque Paris est plein de gogos ?
On monte une affaire colossale,
Avec l'argent du bon populo,
Mais un jour, crac ...c'est le gros scandale :
Monsieur couch’ra ce soir au dépôt !
Et demain on le conduira
Pour dix années à Nouméa.

On aurait dit de la lutte

Et quand il revenait
Il ronflait 24heures

Ça c’était une merveille
Il me parlait d’amour
Quand je rapportais ma paye

Ohé! Les copains!

Y’a quelque chose qui cloche
C’est quand j’ai eu 20 ans 
Qu’il m’a donné cette broche

1. Quand j'l'ai connu, j'ai bien compris
Qu'c'était un' femm' (un homm') trop à la page
Mais qu'voulez-vous l'coeur était pris.
Mon coeur tout neuf était en cage
Il (Elle) a fait d'moi c'qu'il (c'qu'elle) a voulu
Sa chose à lui (elle) pour son caprice
Et je n'avais plus qu'un seul but
L'aimer, l'aimer malgré ses vices
Puis inconsciemment
Sans savoir comment...

REFRAIN

Je me suis senti partir A LA DÉRIVE
Quand il (je) me (la) prenait
Plus rien n'existait
Le désir toujours plus fort me rendait ivre
Sous ses baisers je me sentais partir tout doux
Je ne sais où.
A LA DÉRIVE

2. Aveuglément, je pardonnais.
Ses mots méchants et ses injures
Pour le (la) garder, j'aurais tout fait.
Pour empêcher cette rupture
Il (Elle) est parti, sait-on c'que c'est.
Que de perdre l'homm' (celle) que l'on aime
Combien de larm's et de regrets
Il faut pourtant vivre quand même
Insensiblement (Misérablement)
Sans savoir comment...

REFRAIN

Je voudrais pouvoir partir
A LA DÉRIVE
Noyer mon amour
Dans le fil des jours

Dans un ciel clair, lavé de tout, j'irai là-bas

Fréhel,"J'avais un amant depuis quelques mois
Je l'aimais de toute mon âme
Mais il m'a quitté sans savoir pourquoi
Il a brisé mon cœur de femme
Et depuis je vais partout où l'on boit
Dans toutes les maisons où l'on soupe
Je sors tous les soirs, espérant le voir
Et le champagne emplit ma coupe

Quand je suis grise, j'dis des bêtises
J'amuse les gigolos
Comme les copines, je me morphine
Ça me rend tout rigolo
Je prends de la coco
Ça trouble mon cerveau
L'esprit s'envole
Et mon chagrin
S'enfuit au loin
Je deviens folle

Hier au soir comme tous les soirs précédents
Je sablais encore le champagne
Lorsque j'aperçus mon ancien amant
Avec sa nouvelle compagne
L'orchestre jouait un brillant tango
Dans ses bras il tenait sa belle
Et moi sur la table, j'ai pris un couteau
Et ma vengeance fut cruelle

Oui j'étais grise, j'ai fait une bêtise
J'ai tué mon gigolo
D'vant les copines, comme une coquine
Dans l'cœur j'lui ai mis mon couteau
Donnez-moi de la coco
Pour troubler mon cerveau
