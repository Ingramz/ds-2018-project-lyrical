Bill Champlin,"For a while, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew, and our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For a while we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night somethin' right 
Would invite us to begin the dance
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Somethin' happened along the way 
And yesterday was all we had

Oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me one
And not let me stay around?
Oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?
 
For a while to love each other
With all we would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had 
Til sadness was all we shared
We were scared this affair 
Would lead our love into
Somethin' happened along the way
Yesterday  was all we had
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be was all we had

Oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

Oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found
Oh, oh, after the love has gone

Bill Champlin,"I walked into an elevator and you walked into a wall
You said you wanted to be with me
I never dreamed I had it all
But something changed hat day inside me
And I believe it changed inside you too

Yeah, Angelina, can you feel it?
Watching angels as they're dancing up above
Angelina, what's come between us
Could it be the magic and the mystery of love?

They all said we'd never make it
Two crazy panthers on the prowl
They said we would only fake it for a while
But we just looked at them and growled
You were massed and tied an' cut and weary

But I said, that's okay, you can be a girl
Yeah, Angelina, can you feel it?
Watching angels as they're dancing up above
Angelina, what's come between us
Could it be the magic and the mystery of love?

This ain't no chance we're taking
It's a real love that we're making
Blindfolds off and now we see
Yeah, we see, Angelina, oh Angelina

Yeah, Angelina, can you feel it?
Watching angels as they're dancing up above
Angelina, what's come between us
Could it be the magic and the mystery of love?

Angelina, what's come between us
Could it bee the magic and the mystery of love?
Could it bee the magic and the mystery of love?

Bill Champlin,"In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land
In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams
In the middle of the night",River of Dreams,2012
Bill Charlap,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You,1994
Bill Charlap,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Yes I ask you very confidentially, ain't she sweet?
Ain't she nice? Look her over once or twice.

Just cast an eye in her direction, oh me oh my, ain't that perfection?
Oh I repeat, well, don't you think that's kinda neat?

Bill Charlap,"Ooh

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.
I don't mind the gray skies
'cause they're just clouds passing by.

Heaven is a goodness time. 
A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

God of love, please look down and see my people through.

Bill Charlap,"Can't we two go walkin' together out beyond the valley of trees?
Out where there's a hillside of heather curtseyin' gently in the breeze
That's what I'd like to do; see the heather but with you.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.
There may be other days as rich and rare,
There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go
For this I know;
That when the mist is in gloamin'
And all the clouds are holdin' still,
If you're not there I won't go roamin' through the heather on the hill, 
The heather on the hill.
The mist of May is in the gloamin',and all the clouds are holdin' still
So take my hand and let's go roamin'through the heather on the hill.
The mornin' dew is blinkin' yonder,there's lazy music in the rill,
And all I want to do is wander through the heather on the hill.
There may be other days as rich and rare,
There may be other springs as full and fare,
But the won't be the same, they'll come and go

And all the clouds are holdin' still,
If you're not there I won't go roamin' through the heather on the hill,

Bill Charlap,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,1997
Bill Charlap,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end,
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're sio close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

When dawn comes to waken me,
You're never there at all!
I know you've forsaken me
Till the shadows fall,
But then once again I can dream, I've the right
To be close to you all through the night.",All Through the Night,1998
Bill Charlap,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

Say Emily, Emily, Emily
And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

(and we fade to a marvelous view)
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily
Too
",Emily,1999
Bill Charlap,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Bill Charlap,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night,2000
Bill Charlap,"It was written in the stars
What was written in the stars shall be
It was written in the skies
That the heart and not the eyes shall see
 
And so whether it bring joy
Whether it bring woe
It shall be done
Now suddenly I know
You are the one
 
Here as in a daydream
By my side you stand
Here with my tomorrows
In your hands
 
It was written high above
That I have to have your love
Or I'll never be free
And cloudy though the day be
Crazy though I may be
What the stars foretold shall be
 
Here as in a daydream
By my side you stand
Here with my tomorrows
In your hands
 
It was written high above
That I have to have your love
Or I'll never be free
And cloudy though the day be
Crazy though I may be
What the stars foretold shall be
 
And so shall it be",It Was Written in the Stars,2000
Bill Charlap,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When,2000
Bill Charlap,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,2001
Bill Charlap,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

Bill Charlap,"I fall in love too easily, I fall in love too fast
I fall in love too terribly hard, for love to ever last

Bill Charlap,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Bill Charlap,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2001
Bill Charlap,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2001
Bill Charlap,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true

If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,2002
Bill Charlap,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Bill Charlap,"The things I used to like, I dont like any more,
I want a lot of other things Ive never had before,
Its just like my mamma says, I sit around and mourn
Pretending that I am so wonderful and knowing Im adored

Im as restless as a willow in a windstorm,
Im as jumpy as a puppet on a string,
Id say that I had spring fever,
But I know it isnt spring.

Im as starry eyed and gravely discontented,
Like a nightingale without a song to sing.
Oh, why should I have spring fever,
When it isnt even spring? 

I keep wishing I were somewhere else,
Walking down a strange new street,
Hearing words I have never never heard,
From a man Ive yet to meet.

Im as busy as a spider spinning daydreams,
Im as giddy as a baby on a swing,
I havent seen a crocus or a rosebud,
Or a robin or a bluebird on the wing,
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way,
That it might as well be spring,
It might as well be, might as well be,
It might as well be spring.

Bill Charlap,"The more I read the papers, the less I comprehend.
The world and all it's capers and how it all will end.
Nothing seems to be lasting, but that isn't our affair.
We've got something permanent,
I mean in the way we care.

It's very clear our love is here to stay.
Not for a year, but ever and a day.
The radio and the telephone.
And the movies that we know.
May just be passing fancies and in time may go.
But, oh my dear, our love is here to stay.
Together were going a long, long way.
In time the rockies may crumble,
Gibraltar may tumble, they're only made of clay.

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,

Her only answer is one little smile,

End it all and let her go to some better man;

For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Time

Oh, now wait, no wait

Cut

When I got my arm around you and we're going for a walk
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, talk, talk, talk
When we're sitting close together in a cozy taxi cab
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, gab, gab, gab
Aristotle, mathematics, economics, antique chairs
The classics, the comics, darling, who cares?
There's a brand new moon this evening and the weather should be fine
If you  ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
I'll politely close your lips with mine

How's your golf Bing?

My golf? Ho-ho I'm really moving that ball out there, striking it a ton.
I had a sixty-nine Sunday, should have been a sixty-five.
Terrific wind blowing, couldn't drop a single putt, it was murder

Oh, I lost my head with this question

And of course the equipment, you just can't get any golf balls anymore
The actors are hoarding them all...and the caddies, huh they want an 
Annuity for eighteen holes. You've got to take an option on one to be sure
He'll show up.

Cut
Sorry
When the parlour lights are lowered and the family isn't in

When there's music softly playing and I'm sitting on your lap
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, yap, yap, yap
Forward passes, second baggers, or a jockey who is hot.
Or boxing, or hockey, darling, so what?

I'll attempt some other evening.
Well you can call for me at nine

Calling?
But if you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
What do you mean the same old line?
Same line

You asked me about my hat,
You've been standing there for an hour 
And a half talking your big fat head off

I thought
About golf

I just
You didn't even let me finish my story
I told you what I would do
Oh darling, let me finish
Steady, steady

Oh
It's so nice to close your lips with mine.","Yah-Ta-Ta, Yah-Ta-Ta (Talk, Talk, Talk) [Alternate Take]",1994
Bill Crosby,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Yesterday, perhaps

I've got some real estate here in my bag
So we bought a pack of cigarettes, and Mrs. Wagner pies
And we walked off to look for America

Cathy, I said, as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburg
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
And I've come to look for America

Laughin' on the bus, playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gaberdine suit was a spy
I said be careful, his bowtie is really a camera

Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat
We smoked the last one an hour ago
So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field

Cathy, I'm lost, I said, though I knew she was sleeping
I'm empty and I'm aching and I don't know why
Countin' the cars on the New Jersey turnpike
They've all come to look for America, all come to look for America

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.

Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me,

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2005

Bill Doggett,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,1995
Bill Doggett,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice, warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace rising to a snowy height.
Each star it's own aurora borealis, suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me--or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember, and the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in december, icy white and crystalline.
But oh my darling always i'll remember when your lips were close to mine,
And we saw the midnight sun.",Midnight Sun,1999
Bill Doggett,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1999

Looks like every drop of rain is gone, gone, gone

I can hear that doggone plain

And hold her in my arms

I turn a back over flip and I'll forget these feet of mine

Over rivers deep and wide

Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Just me for you and you for me, alone!

No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear. 
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake 
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me, 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.
All of your schemes I'm admiring, they're worth desiring but can't you see,
I'd like to wait there for some future date dear;

To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left

Bill Evans,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [*],1958

I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

It is seldom that a dream comes true,
To me it's clear
That he'll appear.

Some day he'll come along, the man I love
And he'll be big and strong,  the man I love
And when he comes my way,
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand
And in a little while, he'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word.

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday,
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day.

He'll build a little home just meant for two
From which I'll never roam, who would? would you?

To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,

And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1966

Somewhere in her own little head

It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works it's way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it burn

To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied, ""Oh why ask me?""

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

The touch of your lips upon my brow,
Your lips that are cool and sweet,
Such tenderness lies in their soft caress,
My heart forgets to beat.

The love in your eyes a-shine,
And now, at last, that moment divine,
The touch of your lips on mine.

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for rainbow coloured weather

North and South and East and West of your life

Is it just for the moment we live
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie

Or are we meant to be kind
And if only fools are kind, Alfie
Then I guess it's wise to be cruel
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie
What will you lend on an old golden rule
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie
I know there's something much more
Something even non-believers can believe in
I believe in love, Alfie

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Songs that are spun of gold

They will miss her I fear

The two lonely people once loved and were caring
But now it's all over and dead
They don't know what happened
They can't think what happened
They had something fine on their own
But the two lonely people have turned into statues
Yes turned into statues of stone
The world was their moon once
The yellow ones
It held all their hopes and their dreams
But time came and broke them
Reality woke them
The world's not so pretty as it seems
For all that once mattered
Is old now and battered
But must it be shattered in two
The two lonely people
Would give all their life
Yes give all their life
If they knew, the two lonely people sat silently staring
Their eyes looking coldly ahead
The two lonely people sat silently staring
Their eyes looking coldly ahead",The Two Lonely People,1971

And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.

I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well

And her prince and her silly old bear

When she goes they will cry
As she whispers ""Good-bye.""
They will miss her I fear
But then so will I",Waltz for Debby [Take 2],1961

In the night, though we're apart,
There's a ghost of you within my haunted heart
Ghost of you, my lost romance,
Lips that laugh, eyes that dance

Dreams repeat a sweet but lonely song to me

Dreams are dust, it's you who must belong to me
And thrill my haunted heart,
Be still my haunted heart

Should cause you such misery and pain

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song

Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

I knew he was just my style

Though I live at fifty-one-thirty-five Kensington Avenue
And he lives at fifty-one-thirty-three
How can I ignore the boy next door
I love him more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me
Doesn't even tease me

It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1963
Bill Evans Trio,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath

I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.

The night is like a lovely tune
Beware, my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care, my foolish heart

That's hard to see on an evening such as this
For they both give the very same sensation
When you are lost in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware, my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
