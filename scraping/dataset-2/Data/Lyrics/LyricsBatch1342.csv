Bowling for Soup,"Ask me a question
And I'll fill you full of lies
I know now the truth is bigger than my disguise
The message that I sent was shot down long ago
All I wanted was a simple yes but baby you said no

You can't see my point of view
You're too caught up in protecting you
I'll put on a smile and wait just like I often do
Then I'll make myself a promise too

I need correspondence
So please give me an answer do
Could you repeat that one more time 
So I believe in you
I've got a unique talent 
For seeing things that other people can't
I know your heart is shot full of holes 
From mistakes made in the past

You cant see my point of view
You're too caught up in protecting you
I put on a smile and wait just like I often do
You say we're friends so I'll just guard this heart
If I don't you might tear me apart

Tear me apart
I know you don't believe it
I could never do that to you
How I wish that you could see it all 
From the eyes I look through

But you can't see my point of view
You're too caught up in protecting you
I put on a smile and wait just like I often do
You say were friends so I'll just guard this heart
If I don't you might tear me apart

Bowling for Soup,"Baby, for years you’ve been saying “Why don’t you write me a song?”
And I’m like “I don’t know, I’m not inspired to write you a song
But last night, I decided I’m gonna freakin’ do this”

We’ve been together for so long
And you always asked me why I never wrote a song
All about you, about our love,
And about how you’re the only one I’m thinking of

I’ve been writing all night
And I
I got it just right!
Here we go!

You talk too much
You never shut up
Everything I do for you is never enough
You snore, you drool,
You talk in your sleep
Won't get a night's rest until you're six feet deep
I promised you forever
But we both know,
We're never gonna get along
You want it, you got it
Here's is your freakin’ song

And all my homies have always said,
What you doing with that girl? She’s fucked up in the head
My mom don’t like you, my dad don’t too
And my brother says you look like guy from Hüsker Dü

I’m just keeping it real, this is
Just how I feel
Here we go

You talk too much
You never shut up
Everything I do for you is never enough
You snore, you drool,
You talk in your sleep
Won't get a night's rest until you're six feet deep
I promised you forever
But we both know,
We're never gonna get along
You want it, you got it
Here's is your freakin’ song

I can talk and you get pissed
Used to dream I don't exist
I say yes, and you say no
Like any bitch, you gotta' GO
With all the shit that we’ve been through,
This is the best that I can do
Can I still get lucky tonight?
Please?

Those are manners and everything,
I uh, I hope you like this song,
I spent a lot of time on it,
But I've spent oh there's Erik
I'm just playing
I didn’t really spend a lot of time on it
This is the chorus

You talk too much
You never shut up
Everything I do for you is never enough
You snore, you drool,
You talk in your sleep
Won't get a night's rest until you're six feet deep
I promised you forever
But we both know,
We're never gonna get along
You want it, you got it
Here's is your freakin’ song

You want it you got it
Here's is your freaking song

You want it you got it
Here's is your freaking song

Here's is your freaking song

OK I don't know why this is still going
I anticipated this being 3 minutes long
It's still going here, I don't even know what's happening
Anyway that's this song I wrote for you
And Uh
OK Evidently it's over now I don't know
I have no idea on the timing of it and uh
Boy this is sort of an awkward moment here
I uh
I'm going to be honest, I have to pee",Here's Your Freakin Song,2011
Bowling for Soup,"I met her at the Sonic
She was listening Detonic
With her I-Pod and her roller skates

She said her name was Summer
When I asked her for her number
She said ""Never mind I get off at eight"".

She had eyes like Heaven, face like an angel
But she had the body from Hell

Cause in a half an hour
We were naked in the shower
Taking dirty pictures on my cell

Then she whispered in my ear

I've never done
I've never done
I've never done anything like this
I've never done anything like this

Yeah, right!

She drove me in her Saturn
To the Sweetwater Tavern
Just a block of the Denton Square

She did a shot of Jager
And she made out with the waiter
While I was just sitting there

Before too long her
Clothes came off
Like something out of girl's gone wild

Had to come up with the bail,
Just to get her out of jail
And she threw up at the passenger's side

Then she whispered in my ear

I've never done
I've never done
I've never done anything like this
I've never done anything like this

Yeah, right!

She says that trouble never finds her
No fucked up history behind her
She says she's never stolen anything
Except the car we're driving

Oh shit!

Then she whispered in my ear

I've never done
I've never done
I've never done anything like this

Bowling for Soup,"Make me something out of nothing, you're good at that.
I could be tripping but I think it's time we got back
To being apart if you want to.

We can call it a day if you want to.
We can run away if you want to.

Why don't we just get naked?
 
We go together like peanut butter and jam,
And most days there's no doubt I'm your biggest fan.
I buy you flowers and gum 'cause I want to.
 
You hold my hand on roller coasters 'cause you get scared
And when you throw up 'cause it makes you sick, I hold your hair.

You can be mine if you want to.

Naked in the front yard,
Naked on our Christmas card,
In the pool, in the hall,
In the fountain at the mall,
Naked selling lemonade,
Marching in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

These white pills aren't kind

And slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights
I've given a lot of thought to the nights we use to have
The days have come and gone
Our lives went by so fast

I faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
Where I laid and told you, but you sweared you loved me more

Do you care if I don't know what to say
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me
Will I shake this off pretend its all okay
That there's someone out there who feels just like me
There is

Those notes you wrote me
I've kept them all
I've given a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall
With every single letter in every single word
There will be a hidden message about a boy that
Loves a girl

That we'd make it through

I saw this man
Dispose of hunger
And soap opera too
I saw this field
That grew perfection
Full of things you do

I saw this box
Get rid of heartache
And cure cancer too

I sat there hoping
This is what we'll do

If we can
We will leave our letter and this song, for you
And we'll write, once a day
And float it through the sea, to you
We'll regret, all those things we thought of but didn't ever do

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle

Goodbye so long there's lots of places that I've never seen
I'll always be a drifter but I'll be driftin' back
To where I left you cryin' in the smoke along the track

I like to keep on goin' it helps me when I'm blue
I get the urge to travel that's all I want to do
I know I just can't settle down because I like to roam
And when I hear that whistle blow I've gotta move along
Goodbye so long there's something down the track keeps calling me
Goodbye so long I guess that's just the way I'll always be
So when I get that feeling don't try to hold me back
I'll only leave you cryin' in the smoke along the track

I know my baby loves me I love my baby too
But she don't understand me when I'm feeling blue
And when I hear that whistle blow I hurry home and pack
And leave my baby cryin' in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long I hate to leave you but I've gotta go
Goodbye so long it's coming now just heard that whistle blow
It'll be here in a minute you'll wave and I'll look back
I'm gonna leave you cryin' in the smoke along the track

I'm a pimp so it ain't nothing for me to think of a lie
But I'd rather keep it real
And tell her just how I feel
Looky here if you see with with anotha chick
Then it's just what it is
You ain't my main dame
I just beat you out the frame
Baby I'm hurricane
You gotta stay in yo lane
Stick to the script of a pimp
And follow my gutta rules
And I u feel like u wanna leave
Then do what you do
Baby u think I'm goin' cry
Just because I lost you
Every-time I loose one
I bounce back with 2
How you think I got you
Somebody got laid off
I'm a pimp I pimp a chicken
Until she get plaid out

Say lil mama let me get up in it
Betta make you wanna give it to me
Like you never gave it up before
And I bet I make you moan
With my boys when I pull up in a Rolls Royce
I know where to hit ro
And I pull up fresh in the back
And the mode real low low
She can't see my eyes
Everybody holla cause-ya boy so blind
And all I gotta do is get her in my ride
Give me a million dollars and I can make it go live
Let it be any chick in the world and I can make her mine
Put her in the whip
Now I'm feeling on her thighs
Take a shot of patron
And I'm finna go live
And then she told me that she want me to cut her
But she ain't want me to use no rubber (no rubber)
I'm feeling like u tryna get me caught up
No disrespect lil mama but that's just how I was brought up
If I can't use protection when I cut
Then it ain't no cut
I can't picture me going in you raw
That just ain't what's up
Lil mama I'm a pimp
And I will never get caught in my lie
Cross my heart and hope to die

Mountains will hide,

Flowers bloom slower

And if nobody takes a picture
We take pictures of ourselves

Look at us
Look how we shine
Look how we celebrate our time
The greenest grass
Right at our feet
Look how we skip from peak to peak

So we’re drifting downstream
Exposed but unseen
All covered in exclamation marks
Give me something tender
Something I remember
A touch or a beat, a wave of heat
That hits the heart

It’s hard to bear the sound of silence
So we get bored quite easily
Have you heard this song? I found it
Like it, like it, like me please
And we’ll fast-forward to the chorus
Join the choir, spread the words
I’ll take my finger off the trigger
Just take yours off the trigger first

Look at us
Look how we shine
Look how it eats up all our time

So we’re drifting downstream
Exposed but unseen
All covered in exclamation marks
Give me something tender
Something I remember
A touch, a beat, a wave of heat
That hits the heart
A touch, a beat, a wave of heat
That hits the heart
That hits the heart
Come hit my heart

On and on and on

So we’re drifting downstream
Exposed but unseen
All covered in exclamation marks
Give me something tender
Something I remember
Something I remember
A touch, a beat, a wave of heat
That hits the heart
A thought that sticks and flips the switch
And shakes me up
A little thing that I let in
A word that sparks
And hits my heart
Come hit my heart",Hit My Heart,2015
BOY,"We walked these streets like kings, our faces in the wind
And everywhere we were, we made the city sing
We sang ""forever young,"" we had our fingers crossed
And when the city sleeps, it dreams of us

Yeah, it still does

Oh, love, it changes shapes, it glows in many shades
We won't be gone as long as our echoes resonate
We need no photographs, the past's not only past
I find us everywhere and that's how the magic lasts

'Cause everywhere we've been, we have been leaving traces
They won't ever disappear
We were here, we were here, we were really here
And the rains get rough, but time can't wash us off
We won't ever disappear
We were here, it was really love
Everywhere we've been, we have been leaving traces
They won't ever disappear
We were here, we were here, we were really here
And the rains get rough, but time can't wash us off
We won't ever disappear
We were here, it was really love

It's only little things, footmarks and fingerprints, a treasure hunt through town
It's full of evidence, our monuments are all around
Everything's on the move, the paint is wet, all colors are new
But if you look carefully, you'll see us shining through

'Cause everywhere we've been, we have been leaving traces
They won't ever disappear
We were here, we were here, we were really here
And the rains get rough, but time can't wash us off
We won't ever disappear
We were here, it was really love
Everywhere we've been, we have been leaving traces
Everywhere we've been, we have been leaving traces
And the rains get rough, but time can't wash us off

We were here, we were here, we were really here
We were here, we were here, we were really here
We were here, we were here, we were really here
We were here, we were here, we were really here

(We were here, we were here, we were really here) we're in the air, we're in the water
From the rooftops down to the pier
I'll never walk these streets alone (we were here, we were here, we were really here)
We're in the air, we're in the water
Engraved into waves, invisible ink on the walls
We were here, we were here, we were really here",We Were Here,2015

I'll sweep and clean and dress my dream, kick that broke down washing machine

Next time I'll be kinder
And I'll be tougher too
I won't worry half as much, and neither will you

On and strut my stuff

It plays upon my sanity

No, I don't need your lecture cause your lecture won't show
That you told me so I told you so
But I would have managed, I would have been fine
I'd do it myself and I'd do it just my way,
I'm a big man for thinking just so.

But somebody told me that your mother was born
Wa-wa-wandering woman with a spirit so sworn of the riverside
And it never surprised me but it meant that my love was immobilized
Well, it meant that my love was immobilized
Cause when it comes, it comes when it does.

But you came in the middle and you fell in my hands
Oh a, wonderful woman and an average man.
See that makes me the lucky man
I won't be deserving, but I won't be denied
See, I fell in this position, I will still teach my kids pride
Because failure's a part of it all
And if failure don't hurt then failure don't work at all

But somebody told me that your nephew was born
Oh, a beautiful baby, so smart and so sure of his little self
And in a wonderful way he was making me feel so small
Was making me feel so small, was making me feel so small.
And I don't think I've felt this before.

I broke my turn down button so man can't press that again
Brand new tracksuit looking all jet black again
Said I quit smoking
But I'm in the Ace Hotel with the jetpack again
I remember when Wiley told me to jump on mic
And I got stage fright
Never thought I could jump on right
Thought I would jump on light
Now I'm like an air hostess how I jump on the flight
Sky scanner, I rocket on sight
Never stay in the same place for too long
You wanna find me? Start looking online

Every day man turn up to the max
Don't know how to relax
Went to the hills tryna kick back
Still I wanna tweet and chat
Woke up this morning, said I quit smoking
Now I just bought me a pack
'Cause every day man turn up to the max
Don't know how to relax

I go so hard
Mum told me I should take it easy
Sorry, mum, I am a grime star
And you know my ting stay off the heezy
Please believe me, respect the turn up
Boy Better Know any time we turn up
It's mad, empty bottles of Hennessy
Still I'm on point, slap two at my enemy
This year, I tried to turn down couple time
Fam, who am I kidding?
Told my girl I'mma stop smoking
With a zoot in my hand, just ready to bill it
When I'm riding the riddim, no time for the -isms
I'm high in the sky like a pigeon
See them man there? Them man are some them man theres
They can see but they got no vision

When we turn up, them man can't turn up
Too much Henney in my cup
Bottle down to the halfway level, not above
Look, now manaman's ready for the club
Them man can't ride the wave I surf
I drink out the bottle, I'm tryna get burse
Drink out the bottle like a baby to bras
15 shots, I'm tryna get murked
Man's on a wave, Dagenham Dave
Man violate, get a punch in your face
Boy Better Know my niggas, we set pace
Man turn up every night and day
Sometimes gotta mix the work with the play
My niggas don't mix the weed and yay
My niggas smoke on the loudest packs
Them man smoke farmer yardie hay

Every day man turn up to the max

Anger and tears, so many things to feel

Whirling swirling never blue
How could you go and die, what a lonely thing to do

Silence equals death, this is what they say
But the anger and the tears do not take the pain away
How far must it go, how near must it be
Before it touches you, before it touches me

Did they laugh and tell you they're not really sure?

Acting like that is the best thing that's going
Seems like he was always dancing around you
And I remember him spinning all over
I've been here but not for much longer
Go out and get me a hand full of powder
Red eyes and red lips that come up and kiss you
Sun coming up on a big broken picture

Here comes the little ghost
Here comes the freaky boy
Here comes the little ghost

Angel with nothing but make-up and fab things
Diamonds and fur coats and money and gold rings
Pictures of people who love ya and kick things
One for the blue boy and two for the dead kings
Here is an angel with wings on his shoulders
Very expressive cigarette holder
Here is an angel with a bow and arrow
Saying God doesn't know how to put on his halo

Here comes the rolls royce

Let me come wash away your fears
We go play in the tides of tears
This seems like the year that I will rip off all my skin
And then I'll be exposed to those stars up in the sky
And they will blow no wind
I would have to shed my light

All I do is hope for the blind man
Hope for the crippled man
Hope for the dry old smile
All I do is hope

I watch the leaf, boundless and free
Drifting so carelessly ready for bed
Trees they scream, boundless and free
They scream so gently
That this love will never die

Look at all the people. 

You found the sad side, 
I found the good side,

We have a good time,

And darkened my sun
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to

I look to you
I look to you

After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong

I look to you
I look to you

Yeah

And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song

I look to you

After losing my breath
There's no more fighting left
Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door

And every road that I've taken
Led to my regret
And I don't know if I'm gonna make it
Nothing to do but lift my head

I look to you
I look to you

Yeah

And when all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong

I look to you
I look to you

Oh yeah

And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song

I look to you

Coming down on me

All the rain is falling

Set me free

Take me far away from the battle
I need you
Shine on me

I look to you
I look to you

After all my strength has gone
In you I can be strong

I look to you

And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself

I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again

There's no one could be so sad

Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love.

And you'll be met there by others like you

Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams

Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure

Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near

Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind

And even the palms seem to be swaying

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.

Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love.

I know forever isn't long enough to forget the faces and places that played out your tragedy.
Our memory defeats us all.

And there's nothing there worth keeping or believing.
So, on the eve of the attack, we'll finger-trace the targets on their backs and open fire.
Just hold on until they're gone.

Boys Night Out,"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
This halfway house is home to a madman.
His ghosts, and his perfect song.
This year has been bruised and broken in so many ways that days have long since been abolished.

But If all of this could bring my love back to me...
I'd do away with the drugs and the drink...and the body count could cease.
I've sensed her here, but I know that we're destined to stay seperated.
...and this is all my fault.
For what it's worth.
It's worsening, and my song demands an ending...closure.
Karma can't control the beast.
I've born to swallow us whole.
Yes, my heart may beat again - but we all need medicine.
So forgive me, love, I'm choosing a fitting end to the abusing.
Last night, I leapt through the ceiling.
There was just something appealing about leaving my body behind and coming through as you circled overhead.
I said all the things that had been missing from the funeral that I had been forbidden from taking any part in.
You forgave me for everything while the victims of the song sounded their applause.
""The doctor has to go."" was the last thing that you said as I found my body back in bed
...but then, i guess it's always been his job to fix this.",Disintegrating,2005
Boys Night Out,"On some nights you'll find me falling.
I am formless, I am shapeless.
And on some nights i am better left alone.
You take it all in from some severed state of stasis.
You scream ""wake up!"" inside your own body
But you're buried, or suffocating, or worse.
Tonight it's worse. Tonight the screaming hurts.

Tonight I'm wrapped up in her.
We find each other under blankets as warm as summer. 
We are inseparable.
Our bodies know what they're for and we give in,
We explore each other, desperate for something inseparable.

This coma kiss is infinite, and I may take your tongue if you stay.
We are this dream - fluid and intricate. We made it that way.
Every nightmare needs influence, and your body turning blue as you lay directly next to me colours this on in blueish hues and darker grays.

Everyday when I awake, I'm shaking or worse. 
Tonight it's worse. Tonight the screaming hurts...

Tonight I'm wrapped up in her.
We find each other under blankets as warm as summer. 
We are inseparable.
Our bodies know what they're for and we give in,
We explore each other, desperate for something inseparable.

Last night as I was wrapped up in her
I drowned her body under blankets as warm as summer.
We were inseparable.
So this is what has become of everything that I loved.
The betrayal and the blood became inseparable 
From the most beautiful nightmare I've ever had.
Completely inseparable.

I see her hair spread across the floor 
Entangled in the telephone cord.
Our favourite songs been repeating all night.
Someone call an ambulance because somethings not right.",Dreaming,2005

Boys Night Out,"[Doctor:]
Test, check. Well, he's been released again today, and I'm going back where I started.
Looking over old notes, listening to tapes, wondering how bad I potentially messed up this time.
The wounds seem to be healing, and he seems to be getting along
without his appendages, and I know he seems fine,
But seems can be a very dangerous word, especially in this business, it can be fatal.

Initial Diagnosis: Catatonic. And I know he's back there somewhere,
but there's just no response whatsoever, to any kind of stimulus.
We'll start him with medication tomorrow, for sure.

This mans tragedy has made him a prisoner in his own body.
And it's not just tragedy, it's dementia, despair;
it's this hole I can see in each of his eyes,
where all the events that happen in this real world kind of just fall through.
It's loneliness in it's most crippling form, the kind that no amount of love,
or human contact, could ever mend.

The patient was plagued by violent nightmares, terrible, deeply troubling dreams,
which one night overflowed in to reality, and he murdered his wife, in his sleep.
These people were in love, deeply in love.
And it's that love filling those holes that I can now see behind his eyes.
And it's my job to try and fill those holes with something else.
But what? Hope? I can try to fill those holes with drugs, soothing words, but that's all.
I hope his wounds will heal in time, but right now, things aren't looking good.

The lines around my wrists, the infection seems to be getting better.

Boys Night Out,"He kept his craft confined to the night
Subdued by sleep, we hate to wake up.
He cataloged and counted his kills, divided the dead,
And suddenly stopped.

Prompted by the heat of July,
The sweat on his skin beaded and fell.
He never prayed a day in his life...
Cause man what's the point when you've been promised to hell.

There's something to be said for the crowd,
Which gathered and grew and erupted into song.
He smiled, as he toyed with the noose, and took up their words.
Oh, it won't be long.

Oh, it won't be long [x4]

The tune collapsed, and the mob ceased their song...
Confused and in awe of the monster trained to sing.
The hangman tightened up and leaned in,
And offered the man a chance to speak before he'd swing.
He cried out:
""Man and monsters both make mistakes.
But for every man who cries and begs for time enough to breathe.
You'll find a million monsters like me.
Who'll lick your world and laugh when we leave.""
Then the trap door released.

Boys Town Choir,"O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee to-night.

For Christ is born of Mary,
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven.
No ear may hear his coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in.

Where children pure and happy
Pray to the blessed Child,
Where misery cries out to thee,
Son of the mother mild;
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
And Christmas comes once more.

O holy Child of Bethlehem!
Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin and enter in,
Be born in us to-day.
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell;
O come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel!",O Little Town of Bethlehem,1962

Loving and kissing and holding you tight

Letting you know everything is all right

And I can't lose this
Love that I have in my heart and baby
I know that you will never leave
This is my heart

Our love keeps us together
Whenever we're apart
Our bond holds us close
We live in each other's hearts
And so I'll always feel whole
Somewhere I know I'll find someone
With some love to give
To one whose heart is fragile
But I'm willing to take a chance
This is my heart

On a cold December night just like this
For they knew what was going to happen
Mary would give birth to the prince of peace
Our Lord

From the manjor what they saw in the distance
Was a misty silloutte of three kings
Bringing all the most prescious jewels to our savior
Knowing he would soon be called the king of kings
Our Lord

On Christmas day
They saw a star in the east and followed it
On Christmas day
That marked the birth place of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ

All free from sin
Here to give us a chance at everlasting life again
So the world
So cold you better let him in
To your heart, yeah

The pure sight of the blessed child was full of beauty
As they looked upon the one who would save our world
To their knees they dropped and started to worship
Giving thanks to God above for the prince of peace
Our Lord

No one knew back then that on that evening
That the miracle of miracles came true
That a God above would come down from heaven
In the form of a child
That would set us free

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby

Now they can see the tears in our eyes
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
Well, maybe that's a pain we can't hide
'Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart

Why do we hurt each other, why do we push love away

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby

And some just don't know how to change

We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby

Don't do it, baby, don't do it, baby

So many things to talk to you about
'Cause you're the strength that I hold onto

And I hope I'm the strength that you hold onto
So we can strive together and be perfect
Til' death do us part

The nights gone the morning here
And soon it's time to talk about
Where we stand and where we plan
To be in life long years I need to know

I keep crying tears of joy
I guess that's what you're put here for
To change these tears of pain
To tears of happiness

Through the trying times
Trying to get the best of me
I'm still finding time to show I care
With my crying eyes
I see contentment because of you

Trials and tribulations build up walls
In front of faces made of stone
Yet we stand strong enough
To break the walls down to journey on

But I know if we just bond our hearts
There will be nothing that will stand in our way
And we'll be together forever and a day

Through the trying times
Trying to get the best of me
I'm still finding time to show I care
With my crying eyes

Don't wait for the water

We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it baby

Now they can see the tears in our eyes
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
Well maybe that's a pain we can't hide
'Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart
Why do we hurt each other
Why do we push love away

Don't do it baby

For as long as I can remember
You're all a real man could need
And could ever ask for
This is more than a crush
Yeah

It was Harlem at the ruckus
I saw you with your man, a smiling, huh
A coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment and that was that

So I skated off as you strolled off
Looking at your legs, god damn, they look so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man, that's my mission
If his love is real he's got to handle competition
You only knew him five months, (that's right)
Besides he drinks too much, and smokes too many blunts

And I'll be working out everyday thinkin' about you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catching flashbacks of our eye contact
Wish I could lay you on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold you in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I ain't had a crush in years

[Chorus]
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush, lover
Hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush

I see you at the bus stop waiting every day
Your man must think it's safe for you to travel that way
And I don't want to violate your relationship
So I'll lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip

Still he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tongue'n you down with uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searching you body with my tongue girl all night

I wonder one day could it be, (how I wonder)
Simple dreams could turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the aisle of destiny

Would your man get his hustle on, got your type scared
Break your off a little chump change to do your hair
It seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you follow our lead, hey lover

[Chorus]

Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standing at the pay phone about to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Telling you come by and then you walked in

I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about traveling the distant lands
Escaping all the madness out here in the world
Becoming my wife no longer my girl

Then you let your dress fall down to the floor (oh yeah)
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparalleled
Into an ocean of love we both fell

Swimming in the timeless currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss
Undying passion unites our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control

But, it's a fantasy, you won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swears he love you
So, I'm gonna keep all these feelings aside, (that's right)
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

Ain't nothing like a fantasy kid

Walked a mile inside my shoes

There you go trippin' on the things I say

Friends say I should leave but love forces me to stay 
I try, try to give you all of my time

Every single day I pray that we can make things right

At the market 
She was staring at me 
I knew even then we would share 

Something special 
And it was like chemistry 
I fell in love from the moment I saw her 
So I took her straight home with me 

And that's where I'd dream 
She would step right out of the picture 
And spend a whole evening with me 
And oh how she hated to go 

Back to her picture

You gave me strength to go on

There were so many times
Looking back when I was so afraid
And then you'd come to me and say to me
I can face anything

And no one else can do
What you have done for me
You'll always be, you will always be

I've been watching you from afrar
For as long as I can remember
You're all a real man could need
And could ever ask for baby
This is more than a crush
Yeah

It was Harlem at the Rukus
I saw you with your man, a smiling, huh
A coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment and that was that

So I skated off as you strolled off
Looking at your legs, god damn, they look so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man, that's my mission
If his love is real he's got to handle competition
You only knew him for five months, that's right
Besides he drinks too much, and smokes too many blunts

And I'll be working out everyday thinkin' about you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catching flashbacks of our eye contact
Wish I could lay you on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold you in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I ain't had a crush in years

[Chorus]
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush, lover
Hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover
This is more than a crush

I see you at the bus stop waiting every day
Your man must think it's safe for you to travel that way
And I don't want to violate your relationship
So I'll lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip

Still he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tongue'n you down with uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searching you body with my tongue girl all night

I wonder one day could it be, I wonder
Simple dreams could turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the aisle of destiny

Would your man get his hustle on, got your type scared
Break your off a little chump change to do your hair
It seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you follow our lead

[Chorus]

Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standing at the pay phone about to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Telling you come by and then you walked in

I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about traveling the distant lands
Escaping all the madness out here in the world
Becoming my wife no longer my girl

Then you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparalleled
Into an ocean of love we both fell

Swimming in the timeless currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss
Undying passion unites our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control

But, it's a fantasy, you won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swears he loves you
So, I'm gonna keep all these feelings aside, that's right
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

And life will never be the same, while ya moan and groan

Holding your body like a plastic molding

When you went away from me
My dying heart made it hard to breathe
Would sit in my room
Because I didn't want to have to go out
And see you walking by
One look and I'd break right down and cry
Now you say that you made a big mistake
Never meant to take your love away
But you can save your tired apologies
'Cause it may seem hard to believe, but

You were my earth
My number one priority
I gave my love to only you
Anything you'd ask of me, I would do
But somewhere down the road
You felt a change in the weather and told me 
That you had to journey on
A kiss in the wind and your love was gone
Now you say you never meant to play your games
Girl, don't you know it's far too late
Because you let our love just fall apart

And pain you put me through
So unfair to me, girl

The rose

How I love to smell
She kisses me so well (She kisses)
Unlike anyone I've ever known (You're the best)
Knew there was no other who
Listen it's time up
But I see right now I was deadly wrong (I was wrong)

Scent is oh so strong
Feel like an animal
'Cause I can smell it through the phone
Soft like silky petals
All over my skin
Still yearning for the honey
That I've been missing (I've been missing)

The love I've been waiting for all my life
Has rendered my soul helpless
Whether in bloom or a taste I consume
My rose and a honeycomb (My rose and a honeycomb)
The love I've been waiting for all my life
Has entered my heart with grief
Can't think of a reason
Taste and smell when in season
My rose and a honeycomb

The honeycomb

Sweet and tantalizing
It just stays on the rising
Every time her eyes address my name

So hard to keep composure
'Cause she's taking over

Fills my every fantasy

(Tastes just like heaven) 
Tastes just like heaven
Can't feel my knees
Like my precious rose
She attracts too many bees

Sometimes I wish I never knew her

I meant some people knew her
But I need the sticky love that she gives to me

The love I've been waiting for all my life
Has rendered my soul helpless
Whether in bloom or a taste I consume
My rose and a honeycomb (my rose and a honeycomb)
The love I've been waiting for all my life (all my life)
Has entered my heart with grief (entered my heart)
Can't think of a reason
Taste and smell when in season
My rose and a honeycomb (honeycomb)

Oh how I wish I could choose
Be ashamed to fight for love and then lose
So I'll taste as I smell
I can't choose the whole world
My rose or my honeycomb

But if one day I am found
And be forced to let one wear the crown
If we are to do this
Neither one would be missed

My rose and my honeycomb

Been lost somewhere where no
Light could shine on my heart
I have known a pain so deep
But I know my faith will free me

Get there and I'll get through this
Get there I'll find my way again
So don't tell me that it's over
'Cause each step just gets me closer

I will get there, I will get there
I will get there, I will get there somehow
Cross that river, cross that river
Nothings stoppin' me now, I will get through the night
And make it through to the other side
Get there, get there, get there, get there

I've been in these chains for so long
I'll break free and I'll be there where I belong
Hold my head up high, I'll stand tall
And I swear this time I won't fall

Get there I will do this
Get there no matter what it takes
'Cause I know no limitations
And I'll reach my destination, I will get there

Cross that river, cross that river
Nothings stoppin' me now, I will get through the night
And make it through to the other side

But somewhere the sun is shining
And I'll feel it shine on me

Lived all my days trying to embrace 
Life with my heart by all the beauty 
I feel and create it spins and moves 
Flows at my pace telling its story 
From the tear running down my face

Visions of a sunset just appear when 
I close my eyes 
Takes my closer to heaven when the 
Flute starts to fly 
And the violin cries 

Confusion leaves while peace 
Orchestrates runs through my 
Veins and in other seekers it 
Penetrates my reason why 
The big city air smells so 
Sweet takes me through journeys 
In time from my youth to as 
Far as I can see

It's all I need and no one 
Can take your place by my side

I want you to know that love is alive

I can hear you thunder
I can feel the pain in your eyes
I can smell the flowers

I know your heart is broken

You are gon' survive and I'm tellin' you

No, woman don't cry

You gave him your money

Light up the sky for all of the world to see
Of all the holidays that exist

And there's no Christmas for me

How can you go without paying mind to my sorrow

And the thought of you not being here
Makes me shed a tear
And yet matters remain unclear
About why you're gone

And God knows, Lord knows where I need to start re-building

It's all love when they see you they should try it, that's how I do with you

Public display of affection
Whether before or after we're sexin
No flippin on you in public, no wild flexin
You're my angel and I'll be your protection

The more time that I spend with you
The closer I get to you

It don't matter where we are
In the park, restaurant, or the car
I want to show the world
That you are everything to me

The attention that you show me now
Is enough just to hold me down

Cause how you feel about me is the same
I hope the way it is now will never change
I like how me and you is arranged

That's the only thing that can stop you...is your ego
Hey...it's crazy man, but we got you...so listen

My ego had me doing things that I thought I'd never do
Like being with another shorty when I was with you
Unnecessary shopping sprees for things I didn't need
Maybe it was a little necessary
But looking back it was greed
Big chains, big cars, big chips
More things, more girls, long trips
Maybe if I would've thought of it
I would have had a chance to enjoy it

My ego was my enemy
I thought it was a friend to me

Nobody couldn't tell me nothin cause I was feeling myself

See it ain't about the jewels
Or how much dough you got
Not even bout the car you drive

As long as you stay fresh and you're not acting pressed
Most of all don't say nothing dumb and you'll have her like

That changes the one I used to sing
The songs so beautiful it can't be wrong

If I can get you to think just like me
We'd be happy
My hearts on the brink, it's not what you think...it could be
If I could get you to think just like me
It would be cool
And then the love would be everything it should be

I feel this girl shouldn't be on my mind
But she does all the right things
At the wrong damn times
I should just try it, but NO
I think about crossing that line
I mean, I've been accused so many times for that crime
I might as well have
But if I did it I would admit it
Cause it's the path my heart will lead me too
I'm so afraid of what would become of my world
It's the reason why I stand here so confused
And I'm about to lose it

Darlin listen...this is not a dirty thing...it's pure
If we were on the same page...You'd be sure

The cloud is closing down, been invited to a party at my homies house
Got my crew and rolled out
Called my girl on my celly before I hopped into my V
No answer, oh well...baby must be sleepin
Said she had a long day and didn't feel like clubbin
Can't wait till I get home so she can give me some lovin
So we bounced...headed out...rolled up to my homies spot
Thought I saw somebody familiar in the parking lot
Walked up to the door gave pounds and hugs
Right back homies showin me love
Distracted for a moment till I went inside
Now I'm looking right in her eyes

[Chorus]

I was at the crib when I heard my cell phone
Knew it was my girl cause I recognoized the ring tone
Says she's still at work and she'd be late comin home
But I was too preoccupied cause the game was on
Hung up the phone and it rang again
It was my boy Hakeem who valets at Crustaceans
Sent an email with picture attached
With my girl and some dude that read...
This is where your girl be at

[Chorus]
I can understand how you feel but don't overreact
Until you know the deal...step back and peep the situation
Don't be hasty baby for lack of being patient

So pimipin be easy stop catchin feelings
Two sides to every story
Find out what the real is

She came to me like a thief in the night
And whispered in my ear
She had my undivided attention
And told me everything I wanted to hear

She said that she wanted to give me a gift
And that she'd give it to the rest of the world
No matter how many people hear it
She would always be my girl

She makes me want to say...la la la la la la la la la

Sometimes she's smooth, sometimes she's rough
And I love to see her rock
Sometimes she's a little alternative
Bu nowadays she's more hip hop

No matter how you interpret her
She's always at the top of the chart
And if you look around and she can't be found
You can always find her deep in your heart...music

Chorus:
I can't help myself...I love her, she's my everything
I won't ever be without her...she's the reason why I sing
I can't help myself I love her, what she does to me
Makes me feel so good about her...music is my everything
Very rarely does she disappoint
She always says something good to me
Whoever wrote the words that come out of her mouth
They know just how to get to me
Well she's my muse and I get sick to my stomach
When somebody disrespects
They don't value her opinion
They just use her for her sex
She's beautiful, sensual and I love the way her body works
Sometimes she makes me happy
And sometimes her message hurts

No matter what she says to me
I'll always be around
Some will say she lost her way
But here is where she's found...music

When she was young and comin up
Nobody really knew where she would go
But now she's really opened up
And now the whole world can feel here...don't you feel her

All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

When they said you weren't worth a dime
I thought they were wrong
But they were right all along
I can't believe it, look what you're doing
You're trying to ruin everything that we made so strong

With all the craziness you put me through
I shoulda been done with you

But I refuse to be the reason why you're gone

Tell me why, why did you stay so long?
If you, you knew that you felt this way
And if I knew I wouldn't have wasted my time on you
Now you're free to do what you want to do

Well okay if love is not a reason to stay

Then it really doesn't matter anyway (no it don't)
Why should I give it my all (why should I give you my everything)
You should know everything ain't always been everything, no

Sexual, natural, the feeling that you give me
We've been there before, now is now

I just wanna lay back and watch you rock me

Slowly, slowly, slowly
Love your body on me, on me
Like you own me
I feel you rock me slowly, slowly, slowly
Love your body on me, on me
Like you own me

God no, where to go it's just you and me and the radio
And your warm skin, cold wine
And holding you as you moving in a slow grind
Having you in my bed fulfills every fantasy in my head
As we make this memory
Nothing better than for me to watch you rock me

Slowly, slowly, slowly
Love your body on me, on me
Like you own me

I feel you rock me slowly, slowly, slowly
Love your body on me, on me (on me)

Baby slow it down gently rock it back
To the end then rewind it back oh
Right now you're a part of me, I know you're a part of me
Inside is where I have to be
We can do it like it's supposed to be done
And together we will become one
Feel my love, my love is just for you

Not just when the skies are clear but when the tears form in my eyes
Sometimes is rough but strange enough you stay through all the pain
I know you're somewhere out there, can you by my umbrella in the rain?

[Chorus]
Will you be there
When the storm clouds roll in 
Will you be there
When the nights get colder
Will you be there
To be the one I am holding
I need you, where are you
Will you be there
When the winds are blowing
Will you be there
You feel the changes coming
Will you be there
Just tell me so 
What I want to know is can you step away

Life can be so suffocating and makes it hard to breath
Love is over rated for the ones who don’t believe
But I know somewhere out there what I want will surely find me
Like the eye of a hurricane will you be the piece that I need
When I find you I ain’t going nowhere
When the weather is ragin' hope you'll be there
When you are in my life I won’t be ashamed
So be my umbrella in my life?

[Chorus]

When the sunrise kisses the sky
And the clouds clear girl I know you're gonna be here with me
Through adversity if this feeling stays the same 
Only then I know that you can stand our rain

That's why we rollin' deep with a barreta taker (look)
A dime piece with me all you better do is (look)
Get your head open wide like a pocket book (look)
You know you shook you ain't gotta hide your face bitch (look)
Yeah its mister click clacker yeah I jack the jackers
Cover more than greyhound every hustlin' backwards
Stay in the pocket gettin' sticked but I'm breakin' them tackles
Disrespect shift you brain left to right like a tackle
I've been gettin' it for years and real niggas know that
Back when Dominique, Brooklyn jersey rockin' the throw back
Take it from me, I'm a hunt your ass down like a lojack
Catch your ass while you sleep, blow your ass like a dro' sack

[Chorus: x2]

Step up in the club with just a swing in my chain
It's deez boyz snow man is the name
Posted up poppin' cris like you do them beers
Got bread stacks I ain't seen in a couple of years
When I ball I see a gangsta they don't look they stare
Symbols in my ears 6 figures a pair
And I'm straight from the hood that's where I come from
Still spend a hundred grand a year on white air ones

Watch them dumb fucks cuddle up when the tool clicks

You can flabber jack, chow jack, talk back
Cuss me, tongue wrestle 'til ya tongue tied but don't touch me

I'm such a gangsta I don't tout glocks
Pop the trunk pump ya ass like some Reeboks
And I'm strapped I ain't slipping
Red jersey on Jeezy still cropping

At any time I'm willing to pop the clip in
Cock back one up in ya hip and let's see if you limp then

I move fast forward I ain't got no button to rewind 
I react of instinct I ain't stressin no time 
I came a long way from peddlin rocks

Showed me the recipe & other grams I copped 
Home ain't a home withoutta arm & hammer box

Lotta niggas they be claimin the spot 
But we the only ones that still represent it like mascots 
So ask not why my attitude is shitty 
Step aside why a real nigga move the city, huh 
From my block to your block niggas know me 
They know that ole reppin ass niggas a O.G. 
We use to rock flip-flops, tube socks with gold teeth 
& A flip flop crease with gold shoes on all they feet

Stay away from who fake and frontin'

Try and play me, I'm ma take your face to thumpin'

And only play games in the A or Compton
Hop by the box, Chevy murder, any man standin'
It's Boyz N Da Hood, E tell 'em where it's standin'

I got beat for the street to tha beach I'll be rolling
Neva see me strolling, 40s I'll be holding
Girls in the daisies, drive Eazy crazy
Rolled up my windows as I turned on my AC

Rolling down Crenshaw, see tha hoes jocking
Sunday nights popping, see tha foes hopping
My stereo's bumpin' that ATL funk
You can call it what ya want, either way the shit bumps

I'm in the 6-4, 5th bitch strapped, no roof, roof
The Snowman pimp, bitch shoes on the coupe
Stepped in 100 deep, deep, blew a few bucks
G'd up a pair of black strings in the chucks

My wrist so rocky and my neck so bright
My stones change colors like a disco light
Whole team strapped up, let a nigga trip
Desert Eagle in the club, better, nigga flip

From the south to the west, I stay in a vest
Fully loaded, Smif N Wess to protect my nest
Let you trip, disrespect, you get checked
More direct, you end up with a hole in your neck

I must confess there's got to be somethin in the water
Cause every year I age, I gets harder and harder
Got a team of cutthroats, niggaz with hood hoes
Tryin' to cope slum dough, whenever the guns blow

I'm just tryna hit a lick an leave you slobbin an bleedin
Hope you niggas don't thank that we teasin
Its a drought on the street so that's a good enough reason
So tha next time you niggas wanna lean back
Don't be surprised to find a gat where ya spleen at
An I don't need a solo stack this a team sack
If you don't wanna get cracked where the cream at?
Yea lil daddy please believe I need that
Tha whole stack an throw ya boy the dro sack
I need you ballas face-down on the rug
I want you all butt-naked turn the(?) into a strip club

[Chorus]
[Big Gee]

what if I ran in yo shit nigga beat you wit tha butt of the chrome
I beat ya wit the butt of the phone
I put ya arm behind ya back keep pushin til I'm crushin ya bone
Or get some acid,iodine hardto pour on ya bone
Don't slip hack saw off tha fangertips
Cut ya foots at the angles makin sure you disappear
Dental records can't tell who you is

We lay the club down fuck we rob fo real
Got some standho niggas like the mob fo real
Got erasers in decatur a goon sqaud by mosey park

Boyz N da Hood,"Ay, I got a 45 magnum kitted
And you will rarely see me grab my dick without grabbing it with it
If you want, I can tag ya with it
And you can tell ya fam 'cause I'll let ya whole family feel it

y'all punks, blood pump, fags and sissies
Hoppin' in and out of bed with niggaz
And turn around and say ya pimpin'
Man ya trippin', ask ya women
But she ain't heard, ya listenin' to the man and griffin

I don't talk, I'm bout action really
And I don't need a glass of Remy to cock back and blast the semi
Man it's in me, I'm tellin' ya, thuggin' in my bone
Get me wrong, I'ma put one off in ya dome nigga

No talkin', no fussin', no flossin', we shootin' to kill
Ya momma, ya daddy, ya aunts and ya uncle and children
Boyz N Da Hood in the cutty, keep the pump in the buildin'
Ya want it, it's nothin', whatever, we got it to give

No talkin', no fussin', no flossin', we shootin' to kill
Ya momma, ya daddy, ya aunts and ya uncle and children
Boyz N Da Hood in the cutty, keep the pump in the buildin'
Ya want it, it's nothin', whatever, we got it to give

I'm stuck in the gutta my nigga, life don't mean shit to me
I'm broke and my daughter cryin', and I'm lyin' to the jury
I see no hope in my future, abandoned by them folk killing me
Boy I swear, since my granny died, I don't know what got into me

I've been thinking of suicide, no Nyquil to go to sleep
No dough just to wake me up and be forcing myself to eat
Most my niggaz don't live right, my life throwed from the get go
Folk better try to get their mind right, plus my nine bout to let go

We in the middle of the limelight, I'm bout to ride to the liquor store
We on the pills or that good weed, talk and I'll wind that trigga boom
I might ride through the hot spot, police chillin' in they plain clothes
I might pull up in the hot bar, no talks back that in them lame hoes

No talkin', no fussin', no flossin', we shootin' to kill
Ya momma, ya daddy, ya aunts and ya uncle and children
Boyz N Da Hood in the cutty, keep the pump in the buildin'

Boyz N Da Hood in the cutty, keep the pump in the buildin'
Ya want it, it's nothin', whatever, we got it to give

Yo, posted up in cul-de-sacs, with plastic gats and fifty packs
Niggaz they pull drastic acts, twenty stacks will get ya whacked
I touch ya with that steel, cut ya off like daffodils
Hit ya with the button, leave ya drowsy like some Benadryl

Casting gears been in the field, Ola bear share many tears
Saw her baby boy get killed, sho baby boy hella trill
Keep it G for all to see, but all don't keep it G like me
All don't see shit how I see, couldn't be in the spots I be

Everybody know Big Dukey known to act a fucking donkey
Keep a chump dumped off in the trunk, that's why it's smelling funky
MTV, don't try to 'Punk' me, leave that cracker head lumpy
Fuckin' hoes and bustin' fo's so long, they call me Humpty Dumpty

No talkin', no fussin', no flossin', we shootin' to kill
Ya momma, ya daddy, ya aunts and ya uncle and children
Boyz N Da Hood in the cutty, keep the pump in the buildin'

Boyz N Da Hood in the cutty, keep the pump in the buildin'
Ya want it, it's nothin', whatever, we got it to give

Ay, close ya eyes, let me take ya there
Got a prison sentence tucked off in my underwear
62 grams nigga, servin' straight deuces
Young nigga riding Magnum, squattin' dub deuces

Mind on my money, money on my mind
Snitch call me up, exit's on the line
For the love of these exotic cars
We'll risk it all, even time behind bars

My reality is yo nightmare
And this is my life, it's no nightmare
I ain't slept in two weeks, shit I'm paranoid
They snatched my patna up, the alphabet board

No talkin', no fussin', no flossin', we shootin' to kill

And my coat in my hand

Unto another man's land

Realised I was wrong

And nobody else
I am feeling shame

I knew right from wrong
And how my heart
Would beat so strong
And I'm feeling a yearning
But I guess I'm just learning

De esta noche que viene fria why sola
Un aire de exstasis en la ventana
Para vestirme de fiesta why ceremonia

Cada vez que estoy contigo
Yo descubro el infinito
Tiembla el suelo, la noche se ilumina
Why el silencio se vuelve melodia

why es casi una experiencia religiosa
Sentir que resucito si me tocas
Subir al firmamento prendido de tu cuerpo
Es una experiencia religiosa
Casi una experiencia religiosa
Contigo a cada instante a cada cosa
Besar la boca tuya merece una aleluya
Es una experiencia religiosa

Vuelve pronto mi amor
Te necesito ya
Porque esta noche tan onda me da miedo
Necesito la musica de tu alegria
Para callar los demonios que llevo dentro

Cada vez que estoy contigo
Ya no hay sombra, ni peligro
Las horas pasan mejor entre tus brazos
Me siento nuevo ya nada le hago caso

And I can't believe I'm home again
And I can't believe how nothing's changed
I'm finding my way

Old park bench where I carved my name
But now it doesn't stand alone
'Cause now the trees have over grown

Many a road that I've traveled
That's led me astray
Here's where my heart's gonna stay

This is where I belong
This is where I come from
No need to shed my tears
Or face my fears anymore

So I won't walk alone
Taking things on my own
All of the lands I've roamed
Memories of my home
They keep beating strong
'Cause this is where I belong

There you stood in the open door
Just like so many years before
When I told you that I needed more
In my life

I was wrong to ever walk away
Abandon all the love that we made
But now I've learned from all my mistakes

Just like a star in the sky
Guiding me on
Your love is pulling me home

This is where I belong
This is where I come from
No need to shed my tears
Or face my fears anymore

So I won't walk alone

Boyzone,"I pretend that I'm glad you went away
These four walls closing more every day
Now I'm dying inside
Nobody knows it but me

Like a clown, I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
That I'm crying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Why didn't I say
The things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just
Tumbling down
I can see it so clearly
But you don't know we're around

Nights are lonely, days so sad
And I just keep thinking about the love that we had
Now I'm missing you
Nobody knows it but me

I carry a smile when I'm broken in two
And I'm nobody without someone like you
I'm trembling inside
And nobody knows it but me

I lie awake, it's a quarter past three
I'm screaming at night if I thought you would hear me
My heart is calling you
And nobody knows it but me

How broken I get
You could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A billion words couldn't say
Just how I feel
A million years from now you?ll know it
I'll be loving you still

When we have way more than we should
Our grass is greener than green

We bend, we break

We climb, we fall
We take it all
We bruise, we bleed, we fight

In-between the wrong and the right

If we open up our arms and forgive
Count up all our reasons to live

We win, we lose, we try
We climb, we fall

Boz Scaggs,"I was born on a side road far from here
While the town was burning out my dark window
I was crowned with a cage of cold barbed wire
And my bottle I keep with me even till now

Curse my pain, curse the sunrise every dawn
Those sidewalks ran me ragged, those cracks my only guide
Long for midnight, long for darkness sweet release
Beg the alleys for your endless time to cease

Screaming blackbird on my shoulders
Mark my nearness to his youth
Left my senses reeling as he cried, ""I understand you""
(Sweet release, sweet release)

Try the handle, try the doorway, try the path
Try to enter, to enter and to find some solace there, there
In this clearing, you'll find nothing but a song
Give it breath, give it sunshine and with you it will belong, belong

It will whisper, it will stir a gentle breeze, its hands are your hands
They will take you where you please, if you please
Will you choose to be gentle? It's just your life whatever you feel
Are we blind for a reason or is it just to make it real, real?
(Sweet release, sweet release)

Show me do, give me seashells for my ears
Tell your neighbors and forgive them for their fears
(Sweet release, sweet release, sweet release)

Never came back at all, oh

As keeper of my heart
It saw me search and saw you
It showed me from the start

Time and again I've held you near me
I wonder if you've ever known
How I hold you near me
Is not exactly shown

It's come to be my fate

Like the winter holds its cold
Like a question holds its answer
