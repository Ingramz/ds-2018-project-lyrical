Buddy Spicher,"Darling, you toyed with toy heart
I think you played the game right from the start
This toy heart was broken 
When parting words were spoken
Darling, you toyed with a toy heart

You played with my poor heart like a toy
That toy broke and then we had to part
It never can be mended 
I hope this romance's ended
Darling, you toyed with a toy heart

Now darling my time will come some day
Time alone will heal my broken heart
The clouds will roll away, 
The sun will shine someday
Darling, you toyed with a toy hear

Now darling you know you've done me wrong
Your love for me has passed and gone
I'll find somebody new, 
I hope that they'll be true
Darling you toyed with a toy heart
",Toy Heart,1991
Buddy Spicher,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Buddy Stewart,"Did you ever get that feeling in the moonlight
That wonderful feeling that you want to be kissed
You're strolling through the park, the stars so bright above
You'd love to love somebody, but there's nobody there to love

That wonderful longing you can never resist

Buddy Stewart,"Every day, along about evening
When the sunlight's beginning to pale
I ride through the slumbering shadows

Along the Navajo Trail
When it's night and crickets are callin'
And coyotes are makin' a wail
I dream by a smoldering fire
Along the Navajo Trail

I love to lie and listen to the music
When the wind is strummin' a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin'
It always finds me wishin' on a star
Well what a ya know, it's mornin' already
There's the dawnin', so silver and pale
It's time to climb into my saddle
And ride the Navajo Trail

I met a gal named June;

Buddy Tate,"I've flown around the world in a plane 
I've settled revolutions in Spain 
And the North Pole I have charted 
Still I can't get started with you 

On the golf course, I'm under par 
Metro Goldwyn have asked me to star 
I've got a house, a showplace 
Still I can't get no place with you 

'Cause you're so supreme 
Lyrics I write of you, I dream 
Dream day and night of you 
And I scheme just for the sight of you 
Baby, what good does it do? 

I've been consulted by Franklin D 
Greta Garbo has had me to tea 
Still I'm broken-hearted",I Can't Get Started,
Buddy Tate,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love,
Buddy Tate,"East of the sun and west of the moon
We'll build a dream house of love dear
Close to the sun in the day
Near to the moon at night
We'll live in a lovely way dear
Sharing our love in the pale moonlight

Just you and I, 
Forever and a day
Love will not die, 
We'll keep it that way
Up among the stars 
We'll find a harmony of life to a lovely tune

Buddy Tate,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Buddy Tate,"I'll have to see my broker, 
Find out what he can do, 
'Cause I'm in the market for you.

There won't be any joker, 
With margin I'm all through, 
'Cause I want you outright, it's true.

I want a thousand shares of your caresses, too.

Buddy Tate,"Wouldn't it be a change for you and me to stay at home once ina while?
We'd babaret until the break of day
I'll bet we've danced many a mile
I'll like to see a movie once more
They don't keep people staying up until four

Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight' 
It's getting' lat and dear your pillow's waitin'

Sleepy time gal, when all your dancin' is through
Sleepy time gal I'll find a cottage for you
You'll learn to cook and to sew
What's more you'll love it I know
When you're a stay-at-home , play-at-home
Eight o'clock sleepy time gal.

Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a kitchenette only for you?
Wouldn't it be a pleasant sight to see a table set only for two?
I'd get a big victrola and then
We'll start in dancing ev'ry new dance again
Then it will be a pleasant novelty to tumble in just about ten.

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight'

Buddy Tate,"Peg o'my heart
I love you, don't let us part
I love you, I always knew it would be you

Buddy Tate,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Buddy Tate,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

Buddy Tate,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Imagination will feed my hungry heart

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

Doesn't belong to me

Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another

Buddy Tate,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1990
Buddy Tate,"You came to me from out of nowhere
You took my heart and found it free
Wonderful dreams, wonderful schemes from nowhere
Made every hour sweet as a flower for me

If you should go back to your nowhere
Leaving me with a memory
I'll always wait for your return out of nowhere
Hoping you'll bring your love to me",(You Came Along from) Out of Nowhere,1992
Buddy Tate,"The more I'm with you pretty baby
The more I feel my love increase
I'm building all my dreams around you
My happiness will never cease
But nothing's any good without you
Cause baby you're my centerpiece

I buy a house and garden somewhere
Along a country road a piece
A little cottage on the outskirts
Where we can really find release
But nothing's any good without you
Cause baby you're my centerpiece
Hey baby come and go
[Repeat first and second verse]",Centerpiece,1992
Buddy Tate,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,1992
Buddy Tate,"Pride, sad, splendid liar,  
Sworn enemy of love
Kept my lips from saying
Things I was thinking of.
But now my pride you've humbled,
I've cast it to the winds,
Broken, beaten, sick at heart
My confession begins.
 
We've played the game of stay away
But it cost more that I can pay.
Without you I can't make my way,
I surrender, dear.

I may seem proud, I may act gay,
It's just a pose, I'm not that way,
'Cause deep down in my heart I say
I surrender, dear.

Little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game,
Lending a spice to the wooing,
But I don't care who's to blame.
When stars appear and shadows fall,
Why then you'll hear My poor heart call,
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear.

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1996
Buddy Tate,"Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same
Will it make it easier on you
Now you got someone to blame

One love
One life
When it's one need

It's one love
We get to share it
It leaves you baby

Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?

Into the light

Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus

Love a higher law

And day by day my love seems to grow
There isn't any end to my devotion
It's deeper dear by far than any ocean

Buddy Tate,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice, warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace rising to a snowy height.
Each star it's own aurora borealis, suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me--or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember, and the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in december, icy white and crystalline.
But oh my darling always i'll remember when your lips were close to mine,
And we saw the midnight sun.",Midnight Sun,2002
Buddy Tate,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,2002
Buddy Tate,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.

And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave

And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain

Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over

Buddy's Buddies,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath

la vergüenza de habersido
y el dolor de ya no ser...
Bajo el ala del sombrero,
cuántas veces embozada
una lágrima asomada
yo no pude contener...
Si crucé por los caminos
como un paria que el Destino
se empeño en deshacer...
Si fui flojo, si fui ciego,
sólo quiero que comprendan
el valor que representa
el coraje de querer.

Era para mí la vida entera,
como un sol de primavera,
mi esperanza y mí pasión.
Sabía
que en el mundo no cabía
toda la humilde alegría
de mi pobre corazón.
Ahora, 
cuesta abajo en mi rodada,
las ilusiones pasadas
yo no las puedo arrancar.
Sueño
con el pasado que añoro,
el tiempo viejo que lloro
y que nunca volverá.

Por seguir tras de su huella
yo bebí incansablemente
en mi copa de dolor,
pero nade comprendía
que si todo yo lo daba
en cada vuelta dejaba
pedazos de corazón.
Ahora, triste en la pendiente,
solitario y ya vencido,
yo me quiero confesar.

el amor que me ofrecía,
por aquellos ojos brujos

Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función
Corriéndole un telón
Al corazón

Un poco de recuerdo y sinsabor
Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrame el ventanal, que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris
Tras el alcohol

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?
Y háblame simplemente
De aquel amor ausente
Tras un retazo del olvido
Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino

Que tiembla, bandoneón

Alive

Same city, yeah, we can't break up
Nice mask on, wear the same one
The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled
Was convincing women that they looked
Better in their makeup
I wear war paint, fight to the casket
Too tired to apologize on this mattress
Emotional detachment, what's the matter?
She's learning that she never should have
Dated a rapper
I don't blame her, my mind is gone
I'm at dinner, checking phone calls
Texts & blogs
I don't hear a word, I know nothing at all
Just concerned about the world
Memorizing these songs

Goes on and on
Don't wanna break you
But I'm leading you on
On, on, on, on
And now it's gone

And on on, and on, and on we go

You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
This time we know we know
It's over, over

Didn't believe in love until we fell out
Gave the keys back, now I'm on the homie's couch
Always going out, sleeping ‘round with strangers
Danger! But you can't live without her
Now you're paranoid, checking on her cellphone
Making sure she ain't like you alone
Haven't made love with the lights still on
It's like you're hiding something from me

Let's fake another toast to the good life
Predict the future, clean slate, blue sky
Fantasy, I see me husband, you wife
Lyin', staring into those two eyes
And I can't take it, back to where we came from
My pavement, past the emotional earthquake foundation
Yeah, let's keep swimming in the snake pit
Get bit, get out then jump back into the suffocation
Make up and fuck to save us like we got this
Come on, this is just us baby
And this is just a fight, this is just love, maybe
Is it just you or am I fucking crazy?
I swear to god, I wish that I could Photoshop the scars off
Cold world and get all my heart throbbed
And I said it all and never get lock jaw
Mouth is a saw, a shock at any second could pop off
How does the truth taste?
My job comes with complimentary toothpaste
Lately, I've been living up out of my suitcase
Building trust in that I'm leaving on Tuesday
Bought a one night stand, just a bootleg
A duplication of something authentic
Heart augmented, and it's so hard to end it
I said peace before but this time I meant it

Can't get her out of my head
This place is a mess
Holding onto cobwebs
That has us both on the fence
She walks that thin line
In and out of my bed
Each time I love her less

Can't get her out of my head

I would die with my boots on
Like all good cowboys do
And you could find the treasure on your shore
Star spangled winter night
Drags me up and out of bed
I'm all riled up

Aren't supposed to hide their eyes
Unless they have no alibis
And then they must die in disguise",The Plank,1989
Buffalo Tom,"Racine took a trip to Long Island
She got so tired of Times Square
Sometimes she'd look at herself in the mirror
Sometimes she wouldn't even dare
Racine always dreamed of Long Island
Things always seemed so clean there
She took a train out of Penn Station
Blond wig covered her day hair
But as she saw her reflection in the black-windowed train
Sweat poured out and washed her makeup off, like wet paint in the rain
Racine, Racine, Racine, Racine
Racine sat in a bar on Long Island
Not knowing anybody there
Some boys like to have a good time
Beat her in a parking lot and left her there
But as Racine stood up in front of the great wall
The K-Mart lights bled like her heart abandoned as that mall

On any other day
The date's irrelevant but she was drunk
In the heat of the June night
The faces in the windows - shouts rang out
Into dawn's early light
The flailing arms and scrambling eggs I fled
On my two shambling legs
I gotta go I said - they both looked dead

Songs that thinned out near the end
Oh, her voice trailed off in the end
Though your miles are more than mine
The things I've taken in a bind
It's for certain it's for sure
I've no use for them no more
Making room within one's self
For another's songs to help
And it all comes back to me
As I walk hungover down the street
Oh, and it all comes back to me
And it all comes back to me
And it all comes back to me

I look different in her skies
But it's morning so I say
It's a big red letter day

Her words sing softly just like silk
There are some things I've got to say
She won't understand anyway

Way up in the trees
Afloat on the seas
I can't afford your voice
But I have no choice

Your hurt drizzles forth twice nightly
And I once held on to you so tightly
You were made of wood
And cried 'cause no one understood
But I had splinters in my fingers
Tears well in my eyes
No surprise
Washed swiftly from the sands
Into my hands
Into my hands

I climb up the shaky ladder
Your bird flies with you
With claws of orange hue

You've got the same toothy grin
And a penchant for dramatic ends
See the harbor lights
His five brothers down there
From the salty bay back home again

He went from one ball and chain
His whole life down the drain
With a widow in his wake
When he got back home
He took the first job he found
How much can one man take?

And he measured his breath
As he pocketed his pride
And he quietly watched life go by
From the register side

Well, he drove down to the shore
But he can't see her no more
He bought a bottle of red wine
He wasn't guilty then 
And he's not guilty now
Of killing anything but time

And he measured his breath
As he pocketed his pride
And he quietly watched life go by

Yeah you can waste your whole life 
From the register side

Buffalo Tom,"Gone, advice from a side road
And a dying breath and yellow oak
Big tall weeds and leaves of gold
Now; a wasted clock hollow
And I'm not the drowning man you think
Though I flail my arms, I refuse to sink

All I ever wanted was to see
Scottish windows opening for me
It's all I ever needed in the end

I saw you in a store window
Dress the orange window glow
I'm walking down a winding close
Gray evening fell over me
And I saw your face, though fleetingly
As the bus pulled away from me

All I ever wanted was to see
This glimmer in your eyes as they closed on me
It's all I ever needed in the end

You need different boots in this country
I see you through the screen door
Abandoned below in the birch's bough
You left me on the church floor

All I ever wanted was to see
Scottish windows closing as I leave
It's all I ever needed in the end

And a spiral staircase down

Their appeal just don't last

All a wreck at the airport

You've made your bed, you better lie in it
You choose your leaders and place your trust
As their lies wash you down and their promises rust
You'll see kidney machines replaced by rockets and guns

I'm sitting and sighing and rocking the cradle,

I thought myself lucky to be blessed with a wife. 
But for my misfortune, sure I was mistaken 
She's proved both a curse and a plague on my life. 

She goes out every night to a ball or a party 
And leaves me here rockin' he cradle alone. 
The innocent laddie he calls me his daddy 
But little he knows that he's none of my own.

Take my advice and let the women alone.

They'll leave you with a baby that's none of your own.

You've asked for my comment I simply will render

My country 'tis of thy people you're dying.

Now that the longhouses breed superstition
You force us to send our toddlers away
To your schools where they're taught to despise their traditions.
Forbid them their languages, then further say
That American history really began
When Columbus set sail out of Europe, then stress
That the nation of leeches that conquered this land
Are the biggest and bravest and boldest and best.
And yet where in your history books is the tale
Of the genocide basic to this country's birth,
Of the preachers who lied, how the Bill of Rights failed,
How a nation of patriots returned to their earth?
And where will it tell of the Liberty Bell
As it rang with a thud 
O'er Kinzua mud
And of brave Uncle Sam in Alaska this year?

My country 'tis of thy people you're dying

Hear how the bargain was made for the West:
With her shivering children in zero degrees,
Blankets for your land, so the treaties attest,
Oh well, blankets for land is a bargain indeed,
And the blankets were those Uncle Sam had collected
From smallpox-diseased dying soldiers that day.
And the tribes were wiped out and the history books censored,
A hundred years of your statesmen have felt it's better this way.
And yet a few of the conquered have somehow survived,
Their blood runs the redder though genes have paled.
From the Grand Canyon's caverns to craven sad hills
The wounded, the losers, the robbed sing their tale.
From Los Angeles County to upstate New York
The white nation fattens while others grow lean;
Oh the tricked and evicted they know what I mean.

My country 'tis of thy people you're dying.

The past it just crumbled, the future just threatens;
Our life blood shut up in your chemical tanks.
And now here you come, bill of sale in your hands
And surprise in your eyes that we're lacking in thanks
For the blessings of civilization you've brought us,
The lessons you've taught us, the ruin you've wrought us 
Oh see what our trust in America's brought us.

My country 'tis of thy people you're dying.

Now that the pride of the sires receives charity,
Now that we're harmless and safe behind laws,
Now that my life's to be known as yourheritage,
Now that even the graves have been robbed,
Now that our own chosen way is a novelty 
Hands on our hearts we salute you your victory,
Choke on your blue white and scarlet hypocrisy
Pitying the blindness that you've never seen
That the eagles of war whose wings lent you glory
They were never no more than carrion crows,
Pushed the wrens from their nest, stole their eggs, changed their story;
The mockingbird sings it, it's all that he knows.
""Ah what can I do?"" say a powerless few
With a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye
Can't you see that their poverty's profiting you.

My country 'tis of thy people you're dying.

Came to me on a rainy afternoon

And there'd been summer love
Love I trusted far too well, got away and winter's spell 
Had broke my heart and left me all alone
And looking for a home to rest my weary heart
For just a while

Then I found it in the smile of a boy
A little boy with midnight in his hair
And promise in his eyes of days and nights still yet to be
Days and nights he'd cling to me
For I am winter's lady and he is winter's child

Though there be summers yet
And the smell of pine comes crying to my heart
Still my joy and my security will lie beside the boy of less impurity

And diamonds in his eyes
Diamonds made of trust and love for me
And gleaming at me all the afternoon",Winter Boy,1966

Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star
Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like, when you're older, must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look behind
From where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels thru the town
And they tell him,
Take your time, it won't be long now
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look behind
From where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through

Magic never hid

Though his funeral lengthened
Though his mourners thickened
Magic never fled
Though his shrouds were hoisted

Though his words were twisted
The naked Magic thrived
Though his death was published
Round and round the world

Many struck men bled

Magic always led.
Many stones were rolled

Many wild men lied
Many fat men listened
Though they offered stones
Magic still was fed
Though they locked their coffers
God was always served.

Though altars built in parliaments
They could not order men

And Magic went with them,
For Magic loves the hungry.

It moves from arm to arm
It would not stay with them

It rests in an empty palm
It spawns in an empty mind
But Magic is no instrument
Magic is the end.

Many men drove Magic
But Magic stayed behind
Many strong men lied
They only passed through Magic
And out the other side
Many weak men lied
They came to God in secret
And though they left him nourished
They would not say who healed
Though mountains danced before them
They said that God was dead
Though his shrouds were hoisted
The naked God did live

This I mean to whisper to my mind
This I mean to laugh with in my mind
This I mean my mind to serve 'til

And flesh itself is Magic

And time itself the magic length of God.","God Is Alive, Magic Is Afoot",1970

Sailed off in a wooden shoe,
Sailed on a river of crystal light,
Into a sea of dew.
""Where are you going, and what do you wish?""
The old moon asked the three.
""We have come to fish for the herring fish
That live in this beautiful sea;
Nets of silver and gold have we!""
Said Wynken, Blynken, And Nod.

The old moon laughed and sang a song,
As they rocked in the wooden shoe,
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew.
The little stars were the herring fish
That lived in that beautiful sea--
""Now cast your nets wherever you wish,
Never afeard are we"";
So cried the stars to the fishermen three:
Wynken, Blynken, And Nod.

All night long their nets they threw
To the stars in the twinkling foam,
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe,
Bringing the fishermen home;
'T was all so pretty a sail it seemed
As if it could not be,
And some folks thought 't was a dream they 'd dreamed
Of sailing that beautiful sea,
But I shall name you the fishermen three:
Wynken, Blynken, And Nod.

Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,
And Nod is a little head,
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee one's trundle-bed.
So shut your eyes while mother sings
Of wonderful sights that be,
And you shall see the beautiful things
As you rock in the misty sea,
Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three:
Wynken, Blynken, And Nod.","Wynken, Blynken and Nod",1976

And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.

And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.

Bugle,"I find out there’s no one, no one on playground
So if you fall rise again, don’t stay down
Don’t you think I’m joking
Knock on the door we open
If you’re sick, you shall surely find your way around it

Good things not promised it’s a fight
As long as you alive then your future can be bright
Any ‘cause nobody knows what the future hold
So what you do is be pass it and things inna your sight
Don’t forget the past but focus on the future
High on a dream line, Martin Luther
The youth them a make it if them fight hard enough
The young fissing my brothers then my live life love
Oh yes I’ve been through it
So I come telling to do, just do it
Because I knew it
Life’s not easy, non-tall
But you can be the one that don’t fall
The summer, I’m for one, one for all

I find out there’s no one, no one on playground
So if you fall rise again, don’t stay down
Don’t you think I’m joking
Knock on the door we open
If you’re sick, you shall surely find your way around it

How long before we see that love’s the only way
And through the struggles that we juggle it will be okay
Are we immune to what is true? The message on the air
Was short to confusing, take the life out of my bed
We lose some power and it’s hard to find the way
But it’s so simple to supply it
Our bodies but starve our soul
Try to escape but there’s nowhere to go
In the land of make believe, focused on the wrong thing
Ain’t half of what you see like here’s the enemy

I find out there’s no one, no one on playground
So if you fall rise again, don’t stay down
Don’t you think I’m joking
Knock on the door we open
If you’re sick, you shall surely find your way around

Some is ordering to mothering
Old fashion to the modern
If this was a guest it took no other
Gots me, I got tired of chew life up my limy island
So who no like it then can ask that be suicidal
Getting through to me and I threw it to yourself
Respect me if you not view to yourself
You don’t wanna do to me, you don’t want to lose yourself
Nothing is so stable, all lucid and data
Your life start on to amaze me, like fine but don’t be lazy

If you fall, no you can stay down
People are moving, find your way around
If you fall, no you can stay down
People are moving, find your way around

I find out there’s no one, no one on playground
So if you fall rise again, don’t stay down
Don’t you think I’m joking
Knock on the door we open
If you’re sick, you shall surely find your way around it",Playground,2013

Peace to Wile E. Coyote and Foghorn Leghorn

On tree, the Toon Squad got the best game
And after it's over, we'll need a plan
What type of Mickey Mouse organization goes to Disney Land

Bugs Bunny & Friends,"I just came back from a trip along the Milky Way
I stopped off at the North Pole to spend the holiday
I called on old dear Santa Claus to see what I could see
He took me to his workshop and told his plans to me

Now Santa is a busy man, he has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas Day
You better write your letter now and mail it right away
Because he's getting ready his reindeer's and his sleigh

You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list and checkin' it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice

Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

Little tin horns, little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Curly head dolls that cuddle and coo
Elephants, boats and kiddie cars too

Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

The kids in girl and boy land
Will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toy land
All around the Christmas tree

So you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

And no were not the same,

You'll never sing a song (that we love),

Licking off headtops like Jet Li
I went through more green than a christmas tree
I am not talking about Philadelphia when I say that I have boxes of cheese
And if you thought that I have one box then take 36 multiplied by 3
I'm grime 2015
Forget the pagans, walk with me

I'm not down with the pagans, it's on site with a pagan
I go to town on a pagan, I lose my mind on a pagan
Pagans, pagans, pagans, pagans, pagans
Everywhere I look, everywhere I look

I keep it moving, no I don't stop no more
I got bare money and I don't shot no more
And I'm coming from a world that's got no law
So if we've got problems, lock your door
How are you and I friends if we don't talk?
How are you a viking if you've got no sword?
Somebody tell the pagans they're not on top no more
Take off the fence, run through the garden, kick off the door
I've been in the building a minute and I've left red stains all over the laminate floor
Sub zero from Mortal Kombat 4, will get left with a frozen corpse
Al Pacino couldn't do this if he was Scarface and if the flake was raw
Like a red nose Pitbull with a locked jaw
Got 1 million views, I can get 4
I got famous on YouTube, now I'm on tour
I got too many new shoes that I've not wore
I remember thinking life's not fair
Thinking that I wouldn't go nowhere
Then I came from the bottom of the deep blue sea, crawled over the beach and sat on a deck chair
I used to wear the same clothes all week, now I've got too many clothes to wear
The King is old, and right now I'm like Will Smith in the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air
There's a lot of hype in the grime scene right now, it's political like Tony Blair
I don't care, ask yourself, how can a weazal fight with a grizzly bear

I'm not down with the pagans, it's on site with a pagan
I go to town on a pagan, I lose my mind on a pagan
Pagans, pagans, pagans, pagans, pagans
Everywhere I look, everywhere I look

Forget the pagans, so the real mandem can shine
Forget about the pop, forget about hip-hop, 2015 is Grime
Forget the pagans, cause being a pagan's a crime
I told them once, let me tell them again, 2015 is Grime
Forget the pagans, so the real mandem can shine
Forget about the pop, forget about hip-hop, 2015 is Grime

Bugzy Malone,"Yo, listen

I went from 0-100 real quick, all by talking some real shit
I got a taste of happiness, til I realized that people just wanna steal this
And when they say that money buys comfort, just know that it's a real myth
I went from 18 to like 36, to like 72, still ready to flip
I got a million views
And it felt like a million people wanted this seat
He wants to know me, she wants a piece
He wants to know if she's got the D
Cause I am the guy that he wants to be
But I was grinding while he was asleep
I'm sleep deprived, I nodded off and woken up in the driver's seat
Looked in the rear view mirror, nothin' but darkness cause I'm in too deep
No turning back, I'm overexposed
10,00 views and I was cold
20,000 views used to be loads
I was known all over my postcode
980,000 views later and I'm noticed by the MOBOs

I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow
Back then nobody wanted to know
I said back then nobody wanted to know
I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow
Now people are ringing off my phone
Now people are ringing off my phone

Imagine me standing on that stage
Who would I thank, what would I say?
I'd probably start with a moment of silence, the struggle has faded way
I've not come to do what's been done, understand I will change the game
And when I'm playlisted and when I'm used to fame
I'll do a Cassius Clay and I'll change my name
Because my last name isn't my dad's name
Cause my dad never wanted to know
But when he heard I was gonna be famous, he won't stop ringing off my phone
Tell him there's nobody home
Cause I'm way too busy putting Manchester on the map
And I'm Bugzy Malone
That's no secret, everybody on Twitter knows that
When will I get a blue tick?
I'm like David Blaine with a new trick
Cause when I say 0161, Manny on the map, everybody in the room goes sick
I am the evolution of Grime, in fact I am way before my time
Nobody wanted to know me back then, so I just rung people off my line

I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow
Back then nobody wanted to know
I said back then nobody wanted to know
I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow
Now people are ringing off my phone

I don't know these people, these people don't know me
I come from the bottom and the bottom's kinda lonely
I said I don't know these girls, and these girls, they don't know me
But now they want my number all of a sudden to phone me
I said I don't know these brothers, these brother don't know me
But now they wanna swear down on their lives that we were cozy
I said all I gots my people and all my people know me

Bugzy Malone,"I'm not gonna lie, I'm pissed off
My iPhone 5 just got switched off
Cause I don't wanna know him and I don't wanna know you or anybody thats popped up
My phone was ringing and I sat thinking 'What can he give me that I have not already got?'
Then I went to London with a backpack and came back with a suitcase full of brand new stuff
The door to the game just got kicked off
And I ran through with a gang like Rick Ross
Shouting 0161 Manny on the map, I told every mandem he's dog
I was born in the 90's inspired by gangsters
Fascinated by criminal things
I wear Nikes and Trespass pants cause nobody knows what tonight might bring
Anybody comes at me they will get spun around on a Mike Tyson thing
I come here to defeat the boss
What do you think that I'd let M.Bison win?
Them manna dead I'm the next of kings
Their inheritance, money I'm spending

I just got a million views in 25 days
Do I walk around with a vest now?
Or do I just walk around like it's normal?

It's a shutdown when I pick up the mic and I just can't put the microphone down

I try to stay calm but I keep losing it
And when I blow there's no defusing it
I just got an iPhone 6 and an iPhone Watch
But there's no point in using it
Because I get notifications non-stop
And I get and inbox every two minutes
She told me that I'm big-headed, and that I'll regret it
But that's just confusing it
It's not that I think that I'm sick
It's that I'm moving too quick, I don't even know this chick
Sue me? Now that's the talk of a snitch
I'll smash any emcee into bits
It's like people want to see me switch
I'll make a man scream loud and high-pitched

I just got a self-portrait, that's sick
I just got a pair of trainers with my name on
All in the same day, that's a hat-trick

I jumped up from the bottom like a gymnastic
I got a million views six times on YouTube
It's about time that I got a blue tick

I'm not talking about Kimbo Slice
When I say with gloves on, I will split a man's wig

And a Gucci hat from two double oh six

And choose from different whips
That means we're on different ships
You're on the Titanic and that tipped
I'm on a submarine and that means
That I go deeper than the Antarctic

Bugzy Malone,"Phone vibrated twice, I looked but I still didn't read it
'Cause I knew that it was gonna stress me out and right now I don't need it
She told me she was leaving, I gave her too many reasons
She told me that I don't care, but I told her I'm no good with my feelings
When I first met her, I'm not gonna lie
I was struggling sleeping
Then she got a nigga dreaming, and then helped me achieving
Alright fuck it let's read it
She said the roads won't love you like I will and I'm starting to believe it
In fact I'm starting to feel it
Back then I was driving with no license, I was struggling with violence
The man said 12 pounds for 2 tickets, and there was an awkward silence
She had to pay me into the cinema, and at that point I was frightened
Do I tell her that I fell off, or do I lie?
Either way she was smiling
I told that I'm gonna be somebody, must have been hard to believe
When I'm sat there bagging up weed, breaking down 28 G's
And that was in Bury New Road, bedroom stinking cheese, but she was on a ride or die ting
We're like Beauty and the Beast

I'm not home much no more, she sits and cries about the times we were low
And when her family ask about me she says we're cool
Tell her not to cry no more 'cause I'm coming home, I'm coming home

I'm not home much no more, she sits and cries about the times we were low
And when her family ask about me she says we're cool
Tell her not to cry no more 'cause I'm coming home, I'm coming home

She told me that I'm the man, and I gotta spread my wings
And now that you're smashing music, you could have plenty of tings
And your getting better with the spotlight, then she looked down and grinned
I could see the tears and I pray to God that he forgive my sins
I remember the night, when the police knocked on, and she was shaking on the bed
And I was tryna' hide the weed, shaking my head
And then I threw it in the bag, and I ran across the park
She met me on the other side, and we was rolling in the dark
And that's that criminal love, she's wearing leggings and Nike's
I'm wearing Bally and gloves, no one's fucking with us
And now I'm fucking her up, I told her no sidechick could ever break down what we've build up
Then I see her eyes fill up
Tell her I'm coming home, I'm sick of this black patrone
I'm sick of these dizzy girls, I'm sick of us acting cold
Tell her when I get back, I'm gonna do this properly
No more setbacks, nobody can stop me

I'm not home much no more, she sits and cries about the times we were low
And when her family ask about me she says we're cool
Tell her not to cry no more 'cause I'm coming home, I'm coming home

See, right now, I'm facing time
And I don't know how long
It could be four years, ten years
Could be life
Watch this

Last time I had a schedule
It said Maths and Geography
Last time I felt embarrassed
I was stood in the dock and my mum couldn't look at me
Last time I seen my dad
He was asking me if I'm gonna do this properly
Now they call me an MC
Master of ceremonies
But time is the master
'Cause time will turn all this to a memory
And I don't think I'm built for the industry
All the fake smiles and laughter
Make me want to turn into a mystery
'Cause I know what people are after
Critics and journalists trying to get to me
I preferred being a grafter
You know, living under the radar
With nothing but drugs and money to look after
But now I've gotta see television as a factor
I've got responsibilities
Everybody wants something
But they come wearing a mask
'Cause they're never gonna ask ya
Even a friend can turn to an actor
They act like they're happy you made it
But feel like they deserve your wages
And at that point it's the end of the chapter
I'm losing friends and gaining enemies
In fact more to the point
I'm losing patience with negative energies
I had to change my number
'Cause conversations were lacking in relevance
I wanna be top of the food chain this year
I don't want a war with the elephants
I don't wanna go back to claiming benefits

I used to love money, but I don't no more
I got money that I don't count no more
I don't listen out for the drama no more
We don't have to be down no more
But I'm facing time
I'm famous now
So I'm facing time
They wanna know what I mean by facing time
If I could turn back the hands of time
I'd go back to when I had freedom
But now I'm facing time

First time I've felt secure in all twenty five years
First time I've felt like I don't need people to deal with fears
First time I told my dad I loved him
I was being sincere
But family's a word
And words just don't mean nothing out here
I brought exposure to my city
And I don't care
About those who feel like it should be them
And it's not fair
Bring me one other person that could've climbed these stairs
I know they don't want me to succeed
But I've been saying my prayers
They wanna know what I mean by facing time
They wanna know runs through the mind of a famous guy
They think fame means plenty of money
And a glamorous life
But fame is a jail
And not everyone here will survive
I'm new to the wing
New to the guards
I'm new to the vibe
For the things I've done
I'm facing life
Where else could I go?
I don't blend outside
Looks like I'll just have to do my time

I used to love money, but I don't no more

I was on the road trying to get paid last year
I paid 72 for one box of haze
When I look back that's way too dear
I went straight into production wearing a full body suit like Breaking Bad
Trimming for 2 whole weeks and I ate nothing but frozen pizza, it was mad
Driving around with a box on the floor, just under the glove compartment
A box on a seat, box in a bin bag wrapped up left in a likkle back garden
I was in a crop gaff so long when I hit road man told me I look like Tarzan
I got a full face Bally with eye holes
When I wear that I just feel like a Spartan
Budubow, doors just come off
Budubow, dogs get wrote off
Budubow, you can't stare down the barrel of the John Gotti if it's already sawn-off
Budubap, most victims scream
Budubap, head-shots are clean
But most mans don't look where they're shootin'
That's why there's bare evidence at the scene
I hear the whispers, I hear the shouts
I see the angle, I hear the doubt
But I'm the first Mancunian emcee to take the piss, what they talkin' about?
I see the pictures, I seen the comments
See a couple diss tracks floatin' about
And I swear down on my life I was gonna say somethin'
But I was too busy in my house
Yo, way too busy on my couch
On the phone talking about my accounts
I nearly spat out my mango Rubicon when I heard a hundred thousand pounds
Did he forget that I'm Bugzy Malone?
Did he forget I came up off the roads?
I'm saying with a full face balaclava pulled down
I'll turn straight into a look
Yo, straight back into that mode
The lick off ya head top mode
Them man represent the back garden
Me, I'm way too big for a postcode
What can I tell 'em they don't already know
They already knew about Bury New Road
They already know about the 0161
And how I put Manchester on the globe
Wait, let's talk about the Walking Dead
Why? 'Cause I watch that when I'm in bed
Why? 'Cause it reminds me of when I was comin' up
And I would lick man over the head
Yo, I licked man down with a brick so bad once
Everybody said he was dead
And I ran all the way back to Jacob's mum's 'cause I didn't wanna go back to pen
You remember the party on Alderglen
When, man come let shots off the gat, bap bap bap bap bap
Everybody ran
Brick dust in the air like a spray tan
I had man jumpin' about like Rayman
I wear my hat low like Raiden
And I get so much radio play these days, man think I'm a Freemason
Ypo, this one's not for the kids
Not for the MOBOs, not for the BRITs
Not for the TV, not for the radio
More time, this one's just for the whip
Now I got the Batmobile with gadgets on it
2.5 Quattro, S-tronic
Now I need a bed like Wallace and Gromit
So I can slide out of the window onto the bonnet
Into the driver's seat
It's the Night Rider, they can't ride with me
My man's driving a clapped out Astra
Tell my man not to try it with me
My man got left stood with a face full of blood
Tell man not to try it with me

Bugzy Malone,"It comes a point in life when you gotta learn to keep it moving
And what I mean about that is, you can't look at a problem
You gotta look through a problem
You see the minute you stop, you're dying
And the minute you understand that
Well, then you can start to live

Nobody's doing this for me
Not even behind closed doors
Nobody's stopping this army
Because that's gonna start wars
I hear they wanna know my story
But they don't wanna know yours
That's 'cause I made music to make me feel good
Not to go on tours
But I hear that my tours just been booked
And I'm gonna make dough
I've never had money in the bank
Now I'm looking at a screen just watching it grow
Along with my confidence
'Cause these days I walk with a toxic glow
I remember the days
When I couldn't come out my house 'cause I felt so low
But wait, I was sitting on the 142
Or was it the 143?
Looking at my Sony Ericsson walkman phone
Nobody rang me
Then I look at my Nokia
'Cause you know they say I make money on the streets
But when you're in a bad place you don't wanna show face
And you don't wanna make P
So I just make music
Ask Ali Kareem I was a studio freak
I fell asleep on the sofa
And I drifted into the deepest sleep
I dreamed that I was in solitary confinement
And I was back in Stoke Heath
That's where I met failure
And it's also where I nearly left my dreams

But I kept it moving
I kept on trying but I just kept losing
More time I'll be in my Beamer cruising
Sometimes I drop the top
Just to remind myself that I'm on top
Just to remind myself that I gotta keep it moving
(Swear down, swear down)
I kept on trying but I just kept losing
(Swear down, swear down)
More time I'll be in my Beamer cruising
(Swear down, swear down)
Sometimes I drop the top
(Swear down)
Just to remind myself that I'm on top
(Swear down)
Just to remind myself that I gotta keep it moving
(Swear down)

Swear down
It's like man wanna see me slow down
Its like they wanna see my break down
Like an old Vauxhall with a rattling sound
But there's no way that I'm gonna turn round
More to the point do they think I'm a clown?
Do they think that I made all of this money on the road
To keep walking round my hometown?
As if I don't wanna see the rest of the world
As if I wanna see my brother get killed
As if I didn't keep couple of toasters around me
Just in case some asked to get grilled
I think they forget that I come from a place so bad
That people rarely escape
And the way that I broke the mould
I swear I'm like Superman with no cape
You're looking at a walking legend
And that's mad 'cause they just don't know it yet
I saw my mum breakdown through owing debt
'Til the point that my head was going west
But when I seen my uncle drop the top on that Beamer
I was so impressed
That I hit the road with no regrets
And I, had to do loads of CS
'Cause I was a persistent young offender
I hit the road on my own agenda
Nobody could tell me what to do
'Cause if I got grounded, I'd jump out the window
Heard that my dad could ride a Ninja
So I started riding
I was brought up on loads of lies
I thought my little sister's dad was mine

But I kept it moving
I kept on trying but I just kept losing
More time I'll be in my Beamer cruising
Sometimes I drop the top
Just to remind myself that I'm on top
Just to remind myself that I gotta keep it moving
(Swear down, swear down)
I kept on trying but I just kept losing
(Swear down, swear down)
More time I'll be in my Beamer cruising

Until his shins were numb
He just kept powerin' through
He wants to look after his mum
Somethin' his dad couldn't do
He used to train out in the park
In the blistering cold
Until the roads went dark and the streetlights gave you that orange glow
He would keep kickin' but he would get kicked back 'til he had a broken nose
It could've been boxing, could've been wrestling, it could've been taekwondo didn't matter he was there 6 days a week
Same gym bag, same trainers on his feet
Worked on the door so he could eat
Trained hard 'cause he didn't wanna taste defeat
But sometimes you have to lose and learn before you become the man to beat
And the night that his mum stood next to the cage to support him it was just clear to see
She kept payin' and payin' and payin' for sessions and all of 'em paid off
'Cause now when he kicks, he doesn't feel pain and he could take somebodies face off
He won in the second round but by then his mum would just ruin the make-up

To fail and know it's too late
There was three of 'em all of 'em cousins and they would play on the estate
They didn't get along with the other kids
So they would get into fights
But the oldest cousin felt like he had to make sure they were nice
So he started, fightin', fightin', always fightin' just to protect
He put himself in a position where nobody liked him
He got arrested for the last time
Say good night to the bad guy
Only sixteen lookin' at eighteen months and at least he'll do nine
And this meant the younger cousins were left on the street to fend for themselves
And now the protection's gone for the oldest out of the two it was hell
And now he's just, fightin', fightin' always fightin'
But he's not originally from this country so he's on his final warning
He got deported back to his hometown where the older cousin was holed now
Feelin' guilty his younger got sent home so he's ringin' his mobile phone now
He didn't answer, and when he went on his facebook, it just said R.I.P
The reason I know this story is because the oldest cousin in this was me

I hear that you trust your girlfriend
I know man that have loved your girlfriend
I know man that have touched your girlfriend
I don't know if she told you everything
Ask her if she told you everything
I don't know if she's shown you everything
Carry on and I'll tell them everything

(Swifta production)
Yeah
Man know the season
Yo, watch this

So man wanna reach the heights that I've reached
They wanna drive the cars that I've driven
The clothes I get given, there's way too many
And my new walk-in wardrobe can't fit 'em
They wanna do the things that I've done
They wanna do it the way that I did it
I'm the originator, never been a mimic
And a Honda Accord could never be a Civic
I used to play Tony Hawk's
But them days are done, I'm not ramping with him
And man are still tryna make diss tracks
But there'll never be another ""Relegation Riddim""
I get straight to the point
So the agenda's not hidden
You can go and tell the king that I'm coming
This isn't the Game of Thrones, if it was
Then the '01 to the '61's got a dragon
Forget about Winnie the Pooh or Aladdin
It's not a Disney story I'm chatting
None of these MCs can fuck with me
Cuh they do more talking than they do rapping
I don't know why you talk about trapping
Them man are soft like butter, I'm stabbing
You can straight bar for bar all you want
But man know bar for bar that I'm savage
Man know bar for bar, I do damage
I'll leave an MC's headtop cabbage
Leave enemies in the past just like jungle and garage
Now she wants to get married
'Cause she's seen me in gloves and a Bally
Heard I'm an MC and I get paid good wages
To make the crowd go manic
I used to make change in the snow
I would have fifty pots in one grow
Now I get paid in shorts and a T-shirt
'Cause I've got shows all over the globe
I hope this one's not a fix or a hoax
Got nominated for best video
Nobody's done what I've done this year
This time listen to the people's vote
Anyway, no big ting
I've got a new tracksuit, no big ting
See JD soon, no big ting
Some all-black split man's wig ting
Some matte black hitman sick ting
The kind of tracksuit man use to make a man go missing
This is supply and demand part two
Cuh the old T-shirt sold on a quick ting
Yo, the green light means go
But the red light means don't phone my phone
Speaking of red lights, I was in Amsterdam
So high you would have thought I smoked
One space cake had my legs like jelly
I'm usually light on my feet like Pele
I couldn't stop giggling
I was walking round the district higher than Kevin and Perry
It's mad, never thought I would see a penny
Then I just spent way too much on a three-part music video
Just so I could make the club scene entrance look like Belly
Them man are slow like Tom and I'm Jerry
Them man are Ron Weasley and I'm Harry
How are they gassed 'cause of Brotherhood?
They're only there 'cause I was way too busy
I don't know what happened with Adam Deacon
But you can't get me in a sequel for pennies
Not when Section 8 has got set directors
Looking like they're not ready
I've been in the top ten twice
And certain MCs can't even get a top twenty
People lie, numbers don't
I can't but right now, I've got too many
Look, none of these niggas scare me
They act like they cannot hear me
Do you believe your girlfriend's with you
'Cause you're a peng ting? You don't really
You and I both know that he's weird, G
Now I know why these niggas fear me
If I was you, I wouldn't let your girlfriend
Come anywhere near me
It's mad, cuh dem man know I'm coming up fast
Kick that door off, take that cash
It was groggy season
And man kept sending for the invisible man
Brand new tracksuit, all in black
Man don't wanna see me going on rags
Everybody knows that I, I

Turn into the devil when I get mad (mad)
Turn into the devil when I get mad (mad)
Turn into the devil when I get mad (mad)
Turn into the devil when I get mad (mad)
Turn into the devil when I get mad

There's levels to this shit, I know man
She's not a ten, she's a low five
She's a minor, I'm a gold mine
I sent her back to the roadside
I can't embarrass anybody
That's embarrassing themselves
Two thousand likes on Instagram
Doesn't mean that your name is ringing bells
You're a has-been and everybody can tell
If you're a snake, you and I won't gel
Copying me was never gonna help
You're just an imposter
He got an A in his GCSEs
And he's still not clever like me
Went to uni and then got a degree
But he's still not clever like me
See, back in 2013
I went to the Jobcentre to jobseek
Now I can stay in bed until two o'clock
And make ten grand on a bad week
I am the lone soldier of this scene
And nobody's fucking with me
I am the wolf and them man are sheep
And nobody's fucking with me
They want me out the game as we speak
But nobody's fucking with me
And if you don't know and you wanna know why
It's 'cause I've got Manchester behind me, watch this
Look, man tried fucking with the King of the North
And got stopped at the door
That's 'cause I had archers shooting down from the fort
They ran off the mission screaming ""abort"", ahh

Must be the reasons why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reasons why I'm free in my tracksuit
Must be the reasons why I'm king of my castle
Must be the reasons why I'm making examples of you

And they've had nothing but invisible beef
They can bring Zeus because I'm like Ares
I'm a warlord but I've never been Greek
Now it's looking like war

Looking like you coming up against me
Looking like Bugzy Malone's top 3
And set man are getting too old to compete
Set man are getting too old for this grime ting now
Man are way too old for these beats
When the album dropped everybody stop listening
To his album after one week
Now you're looking confused, looking at me
You sing now but you didn't sing last week
Oh you want to make a track for the galdem
Because the galdem love beauty and the beast
This one's a robbery with no baly and gloves
Man know I got a bare faced cheek
I'm not from London but when I go London
Man know I got a army behind me

When I'm Gordon Ramsay and they're just the chef
Gogglebox, everybody looking at me

How can a guy come from out of town
Come to town and fuck up the whole grime scene?
How much money does he make per show?
And how much did he make from the EP?
Wait and all that from his own label
He must have way more money than me (damn right!)
How did he get that car? (Life!)
How did he come so far? (Life!)
How did he go from selling drugs signing on
To becoming a star? (Oh Life!)
I'm like the Leonardo DiCaprio forget about trophies
I just want to know have you ever counted
£500,000 out in £20 notes? No?

On a boat or ship and get anchored

I'll make a dark-skinned MC crumble
Just like a double chocolate chip cookie
I'm King Kong
I'll make a light-skinned MC sound like a new born puppy
They can team up they can round the whole scene up
It's not going to make a difference on G-Dot
Dem man are pissed off because they've got shows

Wow, few years ago, we were on the radio that weren't legal
Now you're scary yo, yo take control of your ego
This real so your fake to the mandem now
When I came with my sound, I made the mandem proud
You used to be comfortable just tryna be the best in your area
I was never satisfied, I'm tryna be the best from this era
You said you've been depressed, you was re-addressing your career
So I took a UberX when I could've came in my Carrera

Didn't wanna share no limelight, now you wanna steal my thunder
Tripled my net worth, 'cause I'm rich in karma
Even let you come to my studio, get you bits mixed and mastered
Always showed love as an artist
Celebrate it when you charted
Then you started going on darky, wonder why the hype never lasted
You can tell lies for a whole lifetime but the truth is a bastard
We was with you on the phone till late, those times when you was at your darkest
Now apart from your African friend's house, you ain't seeing no red carpets
Had a whole world in your finger tips and now your so way past it

I didn't wanna cry but I know the streets aren't safe
I know the police don't play, they've gotta be on my case
There's only so many crimes that can take place before they observe it
I was on a reministic ting but I didn't wanna miss this time
I was studying, so I watched Giggs's, then I watched K Koke, then I watched Nines
But when I say this, couldn't agree with this shit
I'm one of the realest out here, man make music, man don't bitch

I said I'm coming for the game this year that's me
I just switch it up on these MC's
Just so they know that I'm in a different league
I got the Mercedes, now I need speed
Paid in cash, I don't need a receipt
I think they forget that I'm the elite
The most successful independent MC since 2015
But back then I bought the BM was clean
Thought I was cold in a Series 3
Three years later and I bought the Huracán Spyder
With the suede racing seats
I told them watch how they walk with me
We went from G-elite to C63
I went from giving it away
To being on Spotify with fifty million streams
I was on Wireless main stage
And when I look back
All I could hear were screams
This year we got Parklife and it's gonna bang
Made the King of the North reign supreme
I was making the new B Malone gas
It’s gonna be in JD, no collabs
Labels tryna bring their contracts
But I'm a multimillionaire, hold that

Naught to sixty in 2.8 this year
So we don't need road tax
I feel sorry for the police at nighttime
'Cause they never see me when I drive past
I wanted the Porsche GT matte black
But then I got the Lamborghini with the red badge
I imported the tires from Germany and I got a banging girl
Fuck a lap-dance
Me and the night-rider we had a deep chat
I said when it rains can I get the roof back
And on corners can you be a drifter
And if we see the enemy can we make the exhaust go 'puh puh'

Baggin' up ten bags
When I had mix-tapes in the man-bag
I went from the top ten to the top five
I'm selling out from London to Belfast
Have a look at the new B Malone logo
See how it's pointing north of the compass
Watch when the 'B. Inspired' album comes out
It's gonna fuck with the forecast
'Cause it was Groggy Season
But now it's body season
It went from cold to freezing
Groggy Season has just turned body season
It's gone from cold to freezing

But man can't lose I'm not Ronda Rousey
I spit yoga flames I'm like Dhalsim
Why would I sign to a label when
I've been looking at 1 million pound houses?
Feels like I've been climbing a mountain
Tryna drink from a frozen fountain

Switch off the beat
Let me make an announcement
My album is the coldest
I got tired of counting
So I got me a bad boy accountant
What's Bruce Wayne without the Alfred?
Fuck drowning, I'm in a submarine and
I'm in there prowling
Just under the ocean like a great white shark
Looking up at all of the boats
Them man can't see me I'm a ghost
Remember your label keeps you afloat

I'm an independent
That means there is no co-defending
I write every line, every statement
I don't know why you're pretending
Plus I don't care who I offend
Be careful who you call a friend
I heard he is gonna be a boxer now
But first he should have learned to pay the rent
I've got new cartridges for the pen
I'm not religious, but I'm born again
Everybody started to sound the same
I got bored of them
But, fuck that, did I pay in cash?
Did I pay in cash?
Who said Grime don't pay these days
I paid it in cash
Yeah, so what you're saying is trash
No lease or finance crap
Nah, I'm coming for the game this year
You better watch your back
Watch this

I came from the bottom
Into the stratosphere
And the labels still ill-gotten
Everybody turned on me when they thought I was losing
They must have thought I've forgotten
Watch when I sign my first artist
On my mum's life they are gonna be poppin'
It's body season right now
And that means bodies are gonna start droppin'

I'm coming for the game this year and what

I've seen broken people give up hope and then chase the dragon
Abused people with children, normally pass the baton
Like it's a relay race, I wanna see him now so I can see his face
I need him to know that I can re-inflate
I was a leader then so let me reinstate
And I'm about to buy a house with an electric gate
And I got the Huracan sat in black with a private plate
I was brought up in a house with no carpets
Birthdays with no parties, car games on the Atari
Motown and Bob Marley
Sad times and heartache
I would run away and I'd would tell myself I would get rich one day

I'm bringin' in so many new tracksuits
That you woulda thought I was importing drugs
If I get a one million pound house
I don't wanna hear nobody's big mouth
'Cause that'll make me one of the most succesful grime MCs
And I'm not from the south
Nah not at all, I'm the King of the North
I infiltrated me and my troops
Holding a sword that had never been used
And it looked like I dipped it in cranberry juice
It looked like I covered my face in tomato ketchup
By the time that I was through
And that's 'cause everybody other than women and kids got
Aghh, say no more

Pu-pu-put it this way, we don't have olders no more, that's old news
Put it this way, I seen way more boxes than I seen new shoes
Put it this way, when it goes off, there's no one you can run to
Put it this way, you're gonna hear pah-pah-pah-pah when I come through

Watch when the album drops
None of these MCs are ready for the boss
If I take a loss, he takes a loss
At the end of the day, my whip's drop top
At the end of the day forget Tokyo Drift
'Cause I'm letting off like Lewis Hamilton does
I can make it go sideways kicking up dust
Me I'm on some Gran Turismo stuff
I was drifting round a corner
Me I just put 'em in danger
You should have seen when I pulled up on him like
""Everybody get down, nobody gets hurt""
It says one-six-five on the dash
Even the sat-nav thinks that we're gonna crash
You shoulda seen the footwork
I was like, pah-pah-pah-pah, I'm not gonna let 'em past
They know I'm on job, I like to stand my ground
Man know that I've never been shook
If I get overtook
Then I down-gear and light up the road like a street light does
Oh my God, this one's better than the final scene in Scarface 
When he got shot
Just as I was gonna give him his props
Them days I was still a foot soldier but I wanted to be a captain like Spock
This ones a straight up banger, like when man put snooker balls into a sock

One seat in the whip like F1
And a matte black helmet, teflon
A 3D display in the visor, one of a kind
You're never gonna get one
Spikes in the wheels to stop man powersliding
And the acceleration's paralysing
Does naught to 60 in 2 point 8
Nobody can compete with lightning
The North Pole can get blinding
And we keep on twisting and winding
I looked into the rear view, couldn't find him
I looked into the rear view, couldn't find him
Wait, here we go
'Cause I know set man are trying to steal my flow
Got sick of man replicating videos
So I shot on a frozen lake with a drone
You've never put anybody in the boot
You'd get smacked up if you tried to
You think I can't see you're a soft yout'
Set man look purple like a beetroot
This is the 01 to the 61
Overtaking man like it's formula one
So many buttons on the steering wheel
That it looks like a pad from a PS1, Dualshock!

Like Greek gods
Thunder will come down
If they try fucking with the home town
I'll make a man spin round
(Dual shock)
I'm like Jack Frost
'Cause when I turn icy
Believe there's nobody like me
I'll send man to the almighty

I always say that to her
But Rome wasn't built in a day
And neither was this empire
And I know she's hurt
Cos some of the things that I done to her
And it's not her fault
Sometimes I would look right through her
When she's asking where I've been
She gets zero explanation from me
Travelled all over the world with music
She's still the prettiest thing I've seen
But it's not just that that sets her apart
It's not whats in her mind, it's whats in her heart
It's not on Instagram in knickers and bras
This is ride or die till death do us part
They must just think that Beauty & The Beast is some kinda made up story
Like she didn't see duffle bags and duffle bags filled up full of weed & money
Weapons that could have got man punished, taking calls from the custody office
Told her that I was looking at 4 years, she climbed into bed and told me don't worry
I was depressed for 24 months but she would come round soon as she left college
And I'd be at my Mums house, wearing slippers, like something outta Wallace & Gromit
I was running low on money them times it was like I totally lost my wallet
And my confidence, if it wasn't for her then I would have had nobody

And I don't expect you to accept it
You could have any other guy
Plenty of times you could have left me
Especially when it was hectic
You was travelling to mine on the metro
I was immature in mindset
Insecure from the get go
How did he let you go? Where did I find you?
Furthermore I remember we was dancing slow
Youd never catch man cuddling in the dance
But I didn't wanna let you go
I was gloved up in the club
Going on tough
Mans not afraid of anything
But when approaching you I was feeling shook
What if she doesn't like me back?
I was scared of rejection, but I manned up and approached her
All these years later and we're closer
Only thing different is my exposure
I've been famous for ages
But she still gets gassed when she sees me on posters
I'm not home much now so I'm never there when she needs me
I'm hopeless
When she met me I was down but I told her
I was gonna turn it around
And I swore I would make a million pound
But I forgot to keep my feet on the ground
I remember, not being able to train
'cos I was so deep into depression
Now I'm on top
I let myself get carried away with female attention

I'm emotionally broken
Or maybe I'm selfish
Either way you're helping

When he get's hungry then it's robbery season
Beaten up as a child
So he likes to hurt people, he don't need a reason
He thought them man were Gods
But he watched them man turn mortal and weakened
The hood's an addiction
But most things in the hood these days are deceiving
No snapchats or tweeting, he's living under the radar
And that means he's avoiding policemen
He got left with a scar and that's a reminder of when he got beaten
But it's not an L when it comes from an older
Them man are Gods no longer, they're human and humans stop breathing
Flip the mattress, pull the Adidas shoe box out it's that time
He don't play games anymore but it's looking like Mortal Kombat time
He had Scarface playing on DVD in the background
So when he left his room he heard Al Pacino say, ""You better say good night to the bad guy""

He's heard stories about hits
And he's got what it takes to make a man go missing
He knows where my man chills
And he takes back roads, he's turning and twisting
The plan's quite simple
Go to the pub, identify man and blast him
As he gets closer, he starts losing his composure
He remembers looking up to the man
That he's about to go on and dispose of
It's ten o' clock
And he knows them man link at the pub just to talk business
He pulls down his mask and that's just in case there's a witness
Just to be safe, then he arrived and seen everybody standing outside
Squinted his eyes, located the guy and then let four shots off with the quickness

He could see a lifeless body

No remorse at all, he's not sorry
He just licked man down and he cannot wait for the word to get 'round
This means he'll be the talk of the town and now they'll know he's never been a clown
Then he got a call straight from hell, but it wasn't Lucifer, it was his sister, Shell
Histerically crying, with police sirens in the background as well
She said mum's been shot at the pub, we were standing at the door and she just fell
He had 1 more bullet, he looked up into the sky and blasted him self

What you gonna do now man? Sat talking about straps
But I cannot tell the youngers not to rob olders, I'm not their dad
17 years old looking like something out the city of God
No mouth, holding the balaclava so there's minimal talking and dialogue
What can a squadron do, nobody gets caught in the fog
Watch the super-bike, watch the quad
'Cause man will have that, 12 o'clock

The olders are gangsters so the youngers are still robbers and thieves
Man are still visiting man there's still man in H.M.P.

Every one of us kings
We could live on the street
And make it a castle
Fuck what they call us
They can keep throwing out orders
In fact bring cameras and recorders
We've been fighting for survival
And you're gonna learn what war does
Why did they call it an army?
That's 'cause it's filled with soldiers
There's a war going on outside and it's life
You can keep the revolvers

If you wanna know something 'bout me
The blood in my veins is full of northern grit
I got that northern soul, man I got bags of it
We're far from ordinary people
And if you wanna know something 'bout us
The hearts in our chest are full of northern love
And even when we're broke, we'll always have enough
We're far from ordinary people

We're far from ordinary
Okay, what did they expect?
They expect us to fail this test
They think 'cause we're broke and we're not blessed
Like we're gonna watch our parents stress
No chance
And more time our parents are broken up anyway, there's no romance
And the car's been sold
And that's 'cause there's no keeping up with their finance
What do they want us to do?
Skip down the road to the job centre and just hold hands?
It's not easy out here, depression's a killer
Especially when you've got no plans
So much pain on a daily basis
Would you not grab the painkiller with both hands?
It's a shame the painkiller's weed and liquor
Strong enough to wipe out the whole gang
If I'm being brutally honest
I don't condone it, but I understand the stealing and the violence
Yeah man run when they hear the sirens
""No comment""
Leave the room in silence
That's the same boy who's mum got treated bad in the job centre on Friday
Dad don't care so he lacks the guidance
It's a shame that the streets are evil
But that's just where we grown up
And not everything was legal
But that's where we learnt to be tough
Most people grind to a halt
Like a car with no petrol or no diesel
But we keep it moving round here
'Cause we're far from ordinary people

If you wanna know something 'bout me
The blood in my veins is full of northern grit
I got that northern soul, man I got bags of it
We're far from ordinary people
And if you wanna know something 'bout us
The hearts in our chest are full of northern love
And even when we're broke, we'll always have enough
We're far from ordinary people
We're far from ordinary

I see the raindrops falling again
We look up to greet the heavens
Who cares if we had harsh beginnings
We know congruence

You were knocking on the door
They're looking at you through the peeper
You say you don't love them, they say they don't love you either
You say you don't care, you're lying through your teeth-a
You're cut deep down and the wound is getting deeper
You're getting kinda hungry looking like a Wiz Khalifa
The roads are getting cold and now you're gonna catch a fever
Penny for your thoughts, that's because the door's staying closed
And your memories are getting no cheaper
Family first, but you're not a believer
It's been a nightmare for this daydreamer
They've done you dirty and it's getting no cleaner

You pick your bags up and your running for the stairway
Adrenaline running from your head into your toes
'Cause you know that people they escape rarely
What's sin when you're sinning only to survive?
You're getting by but you're just getting by barely
You're stumblin', telling them that they don't know the struggle
They don't understand that struggle can be scary
Bottom of the stairs, you run out the fire exit
Backstreet boy, you don't wanna get arrested
Running through the city's got this young boy breathless

Separation's mad, 'cause we don't even talk no more 
You don't even cross my mind
Really that's sad 'cause I was on the bedroom floor waiting for the PS3 pad
I remember the smell, you was trying to make man blaze
Them times I was way too young
Nobody could tell, but deep down I was just following you like you was the one
You remember the creps? 110s we used to call them, yours were the baddest on road
Them days were the best, free as a bird pedalling from postcode to postcode
Reaching speeds on a Mongoose Pro, playing grime beats on a stolen phone
I remember the Samsung D500 with the little speaker on, it was cold
20 man deep, bare different emcee names, everybody had bars
Do you remember the Toyota Corolla, bare different stolen cars
Even the dog's nickname was Bullet, because it was leaving holes in necks
And you got hench and had man feeling weak Samson with no dreads
We don't talk no more but that's fine
Please tell your mum I said hi
Them days are gone and they're never gonna come back
We're older now and that's life
No disrespect, back then you was on top and it felt like you was the guy
Separation's mad and time flies 'cause now you're institutionalised

I remember we were ride or die
Just one minute we were wavy
Now separation's got me living like

I don't even ring your line, I was with you in the trap
I couldn't believe my eyes when I seen your hustle and grind
Back then you was wham, what are you about 6'2""
You made man feel so small
Back then the Nokia never stopped ringing it was like phone call after phone call
18 ounces in the holdall, to me it was full of dust
I would watch you cook until it turned into a golf ball
Then you'd break it up into little rocks and we'd hit the road until dawn
Still don't know how we never got caught
I thought we wore the balli to stay warm
But when I look back you was just on form
When we'd go Milkshake, that was the flex
Over the road for chicken and chips
And you had some of the waviest old school Nike jackets I'd ever seen in the bits
You kept elastic bands on your wrist
And you told me to keep stacks in thousands
I remember the night that we kept counting and we must have stopped at about 26
And the time that we dug up the ting, you wanted me to let it bang and it jammed
When I look back, the ting was rusty and it probably could have blown off man's hand
We don't talk much now and it's strange
I hope your mum's okay

I just wanna explain 'cause I know that nobody's told him
It's alright saying you're my father but you know family's not chosen
And we never got past our problems
Like the Playstation is not loaded
And how can I call this home
Its more like a BNB with no rooms in
Telling man close but I'm not not over the smoke
I could walk into a room and choke
Takes me back when there was no hope
We would sit with the curtains closed
So the bailiffs wouldn't think anyone's home
Some times the electric would go
Its like it was brighter out on the roads
I just wanna explain because that hes never been told
To be someones dad isn't the type of job you can finish early and go home
I was gonna write this down and send it to you in the post
But I needed the music I want you to feel this one in your soul
See when your raised by someone you gotta take on their problems
Just because you call somebody your son does not mean you can rob them
And I don't even wanna go there but who the fuck beats up children
Anyway that's not helping
What's done is done we kept moving
In a totally different direction
You brought her up to be daddy's girl
But now daddy blames the recession
And that's why hes out shoplifting
And that's my little sister
I can't stand the fact that we are drifting
We're completely different
Even though we share the same upbringing
Back when the vibe was good and
Whitney Houston was singing, ""Your love is my love""
I couldn't picture anything changing

There's so much more to life, I don't rate it
Could've been family and that's what so frustrating

I can make it pop like pringles

And you might have to make some enquiries

With them golden curls dripping in finesse

Balenciagas and Fendis

Like it was horrendous
Did he forget? Make him remember
I was tackling man like a defender
I was gloved up in a blender
Mixin' the fizzy with the Bangla
Sendin' it out with an agenda
I was 18 years old and I had five workers all shottin' off then

Over the fence and straight through the ginnel

I'm not the leader of North Korea

I'm like a silverback gorilla climbing to the top of the tree
And pulling off squirrels
I was gonna stamp on my man's chest like Bruce Lee but I got morals
Not talking about boiling hot water
When I say that I will put on the kettle
The presidential is on a different level
There is about fifteen just in the bezel
When man do a move and start showing off
I just think to myself, what did he want? Medals?
One box between about 4 man
I'm just standing in the club tryna pop bottles
We got 2 quid a piece
That's if they sell it in zeds
Couldn't even buy a moped

Your lovely eyes, they close like petals
Your sweet surprise could win you medals
You strut your stuff and fan your peacock feathers

Whatever it'll take to get them to listen
Piss on your designer boots and designer leathers

This is not all that it's cracked up to be
And I can't say I blame you
For throwing the towel in or buying more fame
by cashing your chips in
But with all of your talent, and so much to gain
To toss it away like that would be such a shame

Juvenile delinquent, misunderstood

Will you ever know happiness, little rock star
Or is your death wish stronger than you are
Will you go up in flames like the torches

Meetings with presidents
Of companies pretending
To protect their investments

While they suck the gristle
Off the bones of your art
Unfaithful and fickle
Seductive and smart

They'll say you're a rarity
And sleep in your bed
And strangle your purity
And leave you for dead

They'll call you little honey
And write you a check
Seduce you with money
And fuck your respect

For offering a small glimpse
Through your secret door
Of your intellect and brilliance

Tan sólo algún niño perdido jugando
Como te extraño

Son tus caricias, las que cambiaron mi vida
Pero es tu ausencia la que domina mi pensamiento
Y por las noches baila mi mente con tu recuerdo
De madrugada, soñándote volverás mañana

Me ha dicho la luna que una vez te vieron
Ibas de la mano de otro caballero
Condenada luna seguro mentía
Tú sólo eres mía

Y si el viento pasa y el agua no llega
Y el árbol se muere y el río se seca
Seguiré esperando, sola en el desierto

Sé que no hay nada imposible, si no seres incapaces 
De quitarse los disfraces que obligan a la mentira
Uno ofrece soluciones y el otro piensa en la huída

Built to Spill,"You waited for Saturday
And waited for my birthday
And most of us probably
Expect even less than that
And I'm glad you're not like us
And by us I mean everyone in the world who isn't you

All this time 
I thought was mine
Your proximity made 
When boredom comes
It won't be long
Before I sing to you
There's nothing you can do 
There's nothing you can say
To make my problems go away
Or to make me do the same

From the outside
My ideas
Pour me outside
Bottled feeling
For a mountain
Marbled ceiling
Commence the healing",Saturday,2006
Built to Spill,"Hindsight's given me
Too much memory
There's too much never seen
It's always there
To tell me where

Taking my own advice
Worked out for me nice
Now I've come to find
That tricks are played
With human brains

They don't wanna think about the other side
Is that grass just greener 'cause it's fake

'Cause that's all we've been told
Since we were five years old
Is that all we'll ever know

Hindsight brings me down
Keeps me on the ground
Though I'm never proud
I wouldn't dare if you weren't there

Think we're getting up
Feel like giving up
Feels like not enough
For you to come and waste the love

They don't wanna talk about the other side
When the grass is greener then they said

This doesn't bring to mind
What I'd expect to find
They must be combed with lies

What about Canada

What about Canada
It's paradise with pines and ice
Morning comes in freight ships while your sleeping
Batting two ideas with no surprise

Wait 'till the wine has rights
And never walk bulls at night
Kiss all those girls goodbye",Hindsight,2009
Built to Spill,"Dusk 'till dawn, but it feels so dark 'till then
Drowns you out, so you can't be too surreal
Common bonds, and fill me up with me
Everybody in this world is just like me
So what
Grow on

Life ain't nothin' but a dream
Realistic as it seems

Sounds like fear
Thinking there might be a cure
Waste your life, but you don't know what it's worth
Comb your mind for the treasures of the soul
Too close to find anything outside yourself
So what
Grow on

Life ain't nothin' but a dream
Realistic as it seems

Miles 'till dawn, but it feels so dark 'till then
Drowns you out, but you can't be too certain

For our answers
This cancer's
Common as sand

What happens
Here stays here
'Cause no one
Anywhere else gives a damn

All said and done
Who's gonna bother remembering
All dead and gone
Like anyone assuming
They know what makes us tick
I was just as wrong as I could be
Only knowing that
Explained a lot

The more you have to live for
The more you love your life
The harder it will be for you to die
And we all want
(Living and)
Dying easy

Seems like eternity
But it's just one lifetime
How can a love that
Unforbidden be so strong
There's something wrong with me
I try to forget

I try to forget
But my memory
Won't fail me now

It's wonderful and scary
Knowing what's alive
A tree, a rock, a turtle, or a thought
That's what makes me wanna
Never die

At least we have tomorrow
If we have tomorrow
Tomorrow's just a day beyond today

Separating friends from foes
Taking dangerous blows
Learning from life as you grow
Yo, do you believe me?

It is not a far-fetched dream

A she a love mi lover she a mi wan' to do ma 
Cuh de love mi have fi her mi you have to park a cock
Woman just change up your lifestyle, rearrange your act

Loneliness in my eyes
Day and night my heart cries
Don't want this feeling go on, forever
Happiness is not home
Hurt won't leave me alone
So I'm searching for someone better

Whoa baby, gotta find someone better
Gotta be now or never
Got to have some peace inside
Gotta find someone better
Gotta be now or never
Got to have some peace inside

I am searchin' walkin' up and down like mi mad
Lookin' for a love mi 'cause I need one bad
I am desperate an' lonely an' hopelessly sad 
Need a better loving than the one that I 
To raise mi hands to di father and say thank you
Hills and valley nuff roads we haffi trek
No I buck up inna love dat will never make mi said
Jump up inna di air got mi feelin' extra glad

Gotta find someone better
Gotta be now or never
Got to have some peace inside
Gotta find someone better
Gotta be now or never
Got to have some peace inside

I'm like we Winnie Winkle runnin' thru di town
Up di stairs and down di stairs inna mi night gown
Callin' out di window, peepin' thru di lock
Can't find mi girl and it's past ten o'clock
And ah di gyal dem a talk you know me wonder to di mat
Anywhere anywhere she go she have to come back
How I watch out for you is change you pon act
An' mi love when mi half a rise it and drop oh

On the border like you not going

Why you walking and chuck it so

Word go round say the man them from up so say
Then a go corn you
Don't bother form no fool
And go back down there
Can't say I never warned you
You must jam one away
And ever lay lay
That way them can't harm you
You must move well alert
And expect any foul play
Those men know where you work
Where you sleep
Where you play
Dis the wrong set a man you got to run away
Force ripe bad boy

Now your friends are after you
Your life is on the line
Start playing the role name John hard to find

Laing, Ford and Amin every body want you
Five bad man hunting you

Public nuisance
It's either kill the law
Or they murder you

Straight from my heart

[Chorus]
If you do wrong they complain
Even if you call the father's name its the same
What they'want us to do
Don't they know it is nothing new
Why won't they do what they want
And let me do my thing they should be thankful
There's lights of hope still shining

[Buju Banton:]
Let Jah rise and the heathen scatter
Have to give thanks and praises no matter
Even if the flames is getting hotter & hotter
Every one should know I don't believe in rumor
Children arise from your sleep & slumber
Don't come to bow, come to conquer
Strictly love why you envy your brother
Don't let them re-arrange you in a different manner

[Garnett Silk:]
Why should I change to gain acceptance
Can't tell a next man how to wear his pants
Lift up the name of Jah in abundance
Every single thing we do, we are liable
To get a sentence
But we won't be like a flea just like how the more we see
The less you hear we speak
My brother don't you be like a stubborn sheep
Blessed are he when man shall revile you
And persecute you, say all manner of evil
Against you falsely, for Jah sake
Rejoice I say and be exceedingly glad
For great is your reward
For so persecute they the prophets before you and me

Buju Banton,"Chorus
It is real, as real as it seem
Don't you live on illusion
And don't you ever try to live a dream
I sing...

Buju say how could you rise up every living day
Telling yourself everything is OK
When you look at life you'll see it slipping away
Lord knows who feels it every moment every day

Those why cry for the poor get neglected, rejected, put to death
How much more will we take?
Did you father work off his shirt, blood, sweat and tears
Don't tell me that you forgot
Being oppressed by the oppressors, all different types of stress
For the sorrows of the poor, they don't even care less
Refuse to deal with world atrocities, civil unrest
Instead they're building penitentiaries as big as a bird's nest
Saying we are to be blamed for whatever what mess

Chorus

Some say, how are you going? They want to know if we are mine
Not until we reposess what's rightfully mine
Sitting down for so long we do belive it is time
Everyone is entitled to food at mealtime
'Til then, we'll struggle for rights, no more racial fights
Degradation to the highest heights
All obstacles as a people we have to cross
With health and strength we all can get across
Happenings of yesterday are just a thing of the past

Chorus

Don't you cry little one, wipe your tears, sing my song
Though we're in a strange land with evil ones
Help the weak if you're strong, iron sharpens iron
When you're down take a look at where the help is coming from
What about the masterminds with the foolproof plans
What about the geniuses who achieve grade one

They think it must be some glue
They tell their girlfriends they have left them

I can't tell you how much I want you, right now
I'm coming to get you, serious talk now
You could barricade the door or your father could
Be guarding you with a 404 rifle

Woman every groove and every angle fit
It must be aerobic class

Look how the girls wrecking the corner

Hold up your head glancing on both side
Waiting anticipating praying for you to slide

Deliver Jonah from the whale
Never leave him to die
Help us all Abbaba Joni

I've been travelling all morning
With such a heavy load
Now it's noon and I cannot afford
To put down this burden alongside the road

Upon my face I've the got to put on a smile
Make up my mind just to walk more miles
Because I know that

For that oh-so-true love
To comfort this heart of mine
No pretense stop wasting my time
A virtuous woman is really hard to find
I'm telling you lady
I'm only human, not looking for impossibility
Just a genuine woman with sincerity
Someone who is always near to hold me
Show me you care, up front and boldly
Don't shun my feelings, all the positive meanings

I would spend my nights at home
But if it means contention
I'd rather be alone
Tell the service man cut the phones
Lock all communication
If there's no light within my day
I'd rather stay in isolation
For that special someone a lifetime I'll wait
I know that I'll be okay
Cross my heart, every day I live I pray
And I know she'll come my way
Night and day for this woman I pray

Wine up, jump up, when you hear sweet reggae
Dis yah weh we Lord a mercy... I sing

To ratid, I see girls a get wild
Selector a spin muzik versatile
Dem wan tun dung we sound and bruk we vibes down
A who dem a try turn in a clown
Dancehall full up and mi caan get a chance
How mi ago find mi sistren ina di dance
Muzik a play, people jump and prance
Bawl out, selector boy

Buju Banton,"Intro: 
You see all dem people whey you see over deh so 
Don't pay dem nuh mind 
Dem is just one set a people who have nothing to do 
With the development and upliftment of I and I as a race 
But watch this 
Well it's Anthony be	, Buju Banton and Garnett Silk 
Mama Africa, Mama Africa 

Chorus: 
Hello Mama Africa 
How are you? 
I'm feeling find 
And I hope you're fine too 
Hello Mama Africa 
How are you? 
I hope when you hear these words 
Your grays turn blue, grays turn blue 

Verse 1: 
I will break these chains 
Of their subhuman bondage 
Scatter all the remains 
With negative thoughts in diverse places 
Posses the state of mind to declare anytime 
Say Mama Africa a yours and mine 
Own a continent no island never deh pon mi mind 
This was well-orchestrated plan from long time 
Soon I shall be home and everything will be fine 
When you see the lion running wild know that is a sign 
Of an ancient order royal and divine 
With all the natural resource to satisfy mankind 

Chorus 

Verse 2: 
Who say so? 
Marcus Mosiah 
Listen Mr. be	 
Marcus tell I 
Black starliner gonna carry us home 
I know it's true 
What will you do you don't want to be left alone 
I've been waiting watching from the distant shore 
At every passing vessel my teardrops flow 
Could it be in my direction it goes 
Beaulah land beckons trod home trod home 

Chorus 

Verse 3: 
The sweetest things are there to be found 
The golden sunshine 
The wind blows around 
The fresh vegetation which comes from the earth 
Oh Mama Africa you make me know what life is worth

Buju Banton,"Never jump up in-a mi face 'cause I gun
Never judge a book by di cover, dat's wrong
Dis is Fat Joe alongside di Banton
Hey, what about Pun?
Rudeboy, salute with your gun
Terror Squad leader, come down

When I was young I blazed the corner with a vengeance
Crack king descendant, 14 years old facin' a sentence
Me and Tone Soul still co-defendants
Know your legends, Fat Joe, Soul blowin' up sessions

Split dough with detectives to get my flow in protection
Through the ice on my gold you see your own reflection
Can't tell me shit about murder and movin' weight
I got niggas that's off the scale that'll bust through you and your mate

It's proven today, Armageddon's comin' sooner than late
We rappers that really blast, I know Cuban relates
50 niggas of terror, rockin' 560 leathers
Some of us are dyin' to gain but the name lives forever

Marked on my flesh to make my thoughts manifest
When I spark, no man's heart could withstand through the test
So apply the pressure like I used to do but Crack never left
I traded in my double breasted for a Mac and a vest, what the fuck?

Never jump up in-a mi face, I gun
Never judge a book by di cover, dat's wrong
Dis is Fat Joe alongside di Banton
Hey, what about Pun?
Rudeboy, salute with your gun

Tonight is a whole lot of fun, tell them, icin' this
From the heart of Kingston to the ice of Alaska
Buffalo Soldier, hardcore rasta, I am di original, fuck di impostor
Determined to make it with or without ya

No borders, no boundaries
I've got to take care of my enemies
Don't you oppress, elevate stress
Disrespect [Incomprehensible] wreckless

Artillery strapped over my chest
Bullet a-penetrate from right out to left
Skip and dive, duck like The Matrix
From the day I've been born I have been a target

Get, get, whenever, whoever disrespect Buju Banton
Never, Lord, [Incomprehensible] clever
Wanted, make di front page of di [Incomprehensible]
Terror Squad crew, you're takin' over, over, over, over, hear dis

Never jump up in-a mi face 'cause I gun
Never judge a book by di cover, dat's wrong
Dis is Fat Joe alongside di Banton
Hey, what about Pun?
Rudeboy, salute with your gun

Little baby jacker, raised my little sister while you baby-sat
Why she livin' fat, she ain't got a baby back, ya heard?
'Cause where we at, it's either live or die
I seen a nigga sky high from blye 'cause he thought the shit was fly

I let you ride if you bustin', I let you die if you bluffin'
'Cause to die is the whole price of nothin'

You fuckin' with all brothers and Bronx bombers
Who want dramas, word to my dead and gone mama
Let me find the next muthafucka
Disrespect Fat Joe, the Don Carta
And I'ma have to jig a nigga like Shawn Carter

What's wrong, partner?
Punisher peel your banana, see you manana
Leave your mama covered with a white [incomprehensible]
That's right, I'ma be there with my guns

Blowin' the spot, I ain't got no hair on my tongues
'Cause where I'm from, we don't only talk the talk
We walk the walk, be-X, baby, New York, New York

Never jump up in-a mi face, I gun
Never judge a book by di cover, dat's wrong
This a Fat Joe and Buju Banton
Tell them, what about Pun?
Rudeboy, salute with your gun

Never jump up in-a mi face, I gun
Never judge a book by di cover, dat's wrong
This a Fat Joe and Buju Banton

Buju Banton,"Wanna be loved
Not for who you think I am
Nor what you want me to be could you love me for me?
Real love, with no strings attached
I wanna give you me heart
Don't want to take it back
This is my chat – cho
 
Been searching for a long long time
For that oh so true love
To comfort this heart of mine
No pretense stop wasting my time
A virtous woman is really hard to find
I'm telling you lady
 
I'm only human, not looking for impossibility
Just a genuine woman with sincerity
Someone who is always near to hold me
Show me you care, up front and boldly
Don't shun my feelings, all the positive meanings
Love me morning, noon and seasons
 
Chorus
 
Well every hoe have it's stick in a bush
What happen to me... she must be somewhere out there
Now where could she be?
Caught up passionately in a love rhapsody
I'm like waiting on some honey
But there ain't no queen bee
 
Everybody's laughing
Some say I'm silly
No infatuation, no love fantasy
 
Woman you lead my life on a string
I can't take the on and off thing
I'm oh so lonely inside so I sing
 
Chorus
 
I would spend my nights at home
But if it means contention
I'd rather be alone
Tell the service man cut the phones
Lock all communication
If there's not light within my day
I'd rather stay in isolation
For that special someone a lifetime
I'll wait I know that I'll be okay
Cross my heart, every day I live I pray
And I know she'll come my way
Night and day for this woman I pray

So damn good baby 

Verse 1:

Di way you full a carisma mi see it ina you eyes
Good enough for me not fi rest a mankind
Feel good about yourself all di time
Clouds part ina di sky fi mek di sun shine
Call out mi same and be there anytime
With you by my side, my life feel divine
What another man lost, let Buju be find
Show mi di mountain I man will climb
Just tell me you'd be mine until di rest of time
And he will never be apart no woman 

Chorus: 

Baby you're good enough, good enough
You in my life it's so much better

Buju Banton, Luciano come fi teach
Listen and you will learn

The price you pay
And still at the end of the day
For them it's just a lue la lay

We have done all the good that we know should
Spread a little love in the neighborhood
Buju done that, I and I done that
Spread a little love in the whole wide world
And telling my people better take control
We have done that, I and I done that

Well, so tell I, why do they act so strange who
Through mi natty them would a love mi rearrange who
Come ya to speak the truth, the natty never hold it back
I never hide the truth, Jah know mi never hide the fact

No couldn't love mi talk, no couldn't love mi chat
A who a try stop Buju fi reach pon top
Buju Banton, Luciano, two youth them can't stop
Touch it, touch it, touch it star

Amidst temptation, I and I will be strong
I earn my meditation in this holy Armageddon
With love and righteousness, we manifest upon creation
Together we're standing tall

We'll be alright
With Jah by my side

Most people think others cannot make it without dem
No man is an island but I still cannot trust dem
Oh, we have learned more than what they've taught us
So in this day and age, we'll let knowledge take its place

Over the mountains and over rocky terrains
We try to prove to mankind that Jah Jah lives and reigns
He in the heart of man so we must manifest
Together we're standing tall

Put your shoulder to the wheel, go days without meal
Walk up and down, run down mi boot heel
Nuff think I am jokin', nuff thinkin' it's fun
Catch I when I fall

We have been everywhere in the world we could
We spread a little love, we haffe know we should
We have done that, Buju Banton done that
We have traveled the world and we spread Jah word
Tellin' mankind to rise and move forward
We have done that, yes, Jah know we have done that

Why do they think Rasta cannot make it without dem
No man is an island but I refuse to trust, good gosh
Oh, we have learned more than what they've taught us
So in this day and age have got to let us, let us

Cannot move in rage, that's a wrong stage
That dem wan fi si mi do fi fling me inna cage
Take it easy, deh pon a descent page
Yeah, I'm not face

We will survive, yeah, Buju Banton
We will survive, oh, Luciano [Incomprehensible]

And food mi ago hav it nuff plenty

 Nigga hand it over or all your seeds gon' die
 And it don't take much for me to kidnap a DJ
 Or clap at ya truck while you ridin through the freeway
 Shit is mad ea-say to wet you up
 Betta, watch yo' bitch and who's dick she sucked
 She gon', set you up, I been to the crib
 I don't know why you surprised bitches love the kid
 I'm more realer than the way you act
 A born killer quick to wave the mack
 And all you niggaz gotta face the fact
 I pop shit 'cause you can't stop me
 More rich 'cause they can't rob me
 I plant clips at ya fam's lobby
 Joe the Don and you been warned
 But niggaz never want to listen till they kin's gone
 Now you want to get it on 'cause ya dollars stack
 Now how you plan to holla back with a hollow back?
 Joey Crack and I be the truth
 Don't believe that's the streets till proof
 Ask the deez how my Eagle blew

Niggas hated on me but I wouldn’t stop

None of y’all niggas fuckin’ with me dog

None of y’all niggas' boots fit me dog

Cost more than my house did
Fuck land, I’m fly today
First class if I fly
Credit card ain’t mine
Don’t know how I’m getitn’ back
But in luxury I arrive
iPhone in my baby name
Long way from that chirp
Strip pole in my bedroom
But I’mma kill my daughter if she twerk
I’mma kill my daughter if she twerk
Miley Cyrus is that bullshit
But a rednecker can’t judge
That for Billy Ray to have to deal with
Record deal, fuck college
Missed out but no pyrex

What you know 'bout checkin' yo' paper for a down-a** bottom hoe
Or snatchin' yo' new fur model mink with the hood off the hanger

Shoes my Maurie, piss by the month, he cut shock s***
Anything from my hoes when I ask, I get it
In the Cadillac I kick it, since y'all I wanted to be like macks and Bishop

Flossin' my club, peepin' persons yellin' out ""Chuuuch!""
Finna attract to trick politicians I'm a maintain pimpin'
You can't change pimpin', from the Stone Age to the ""Space Age"" pimpin'

From Southern mackin' in Memphis to the playa mo' when you shoot to Chi
In the black diamond with fuchsia dye pullin' out hoes like Superfly
All I gotta do is spit fo' lines
Now she got me chameleon gators with colors that flip fo' times
Now get yo'.

High heels and furs, Lexus his and hers
Hpnotic, ex' and sex mixed with the words
Pull up, and let the window down, here she come
The American way, I was taught how to.

Are met in thee tonight

While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love

Oh morning stars together

And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on Earth

So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven

Where meek souls will receive Him still
