H. Aviles,"Sin ti
No podré vivir jamás
Y pensar que nunca mas
Estarás junto a mi
Sin ti
Que me puede ya importar
Si lo que me hace llorar
Esta lejos de aquí
Sin ti
No hay clemencia en mi dolor
La esperanza de mi amor
Te la lleves por fin
Sin ti
Es inútil vivir
Como inútil será
El quererte olvidar
Interlude
Sin ti
No podré vivir jamás
Y pensar que nunca mas
Estarás junto a mi
Sin ti
Que me puede ya importar
Si lo que me hace llorar
Esta lejos de aquí
Sin ti
No hay clemencia en mi dolor
La esperanza de mi amor
Te la lleves por fin
Sin ti
Es inútil vivir
Como inútil será
El quererte olvidar",Sin Ti,1995
H. Boggie,"The love has gone
The love has gone, baby

I didn't get it when he hung up the phone
He said that he's all alone
And that's when I heard her moan, I get it
It's not a secret 'cause he's working till late
But then he doesn't come home
And now he's switched off the phone, I get it

Tell me something baby, tell me this ain't true
Tell me something baby, tell me this ain't true
I won't be crying for you no more, baby

The love has gone, that took me higher
Now you've gone and left me, boy you've wasted my time
It's breaking my heart, you know this ain't fair
I deserve better, but you don't even care

I'm taking back my, my heart from his hands
He's got another lover so I'm taking a stand
I've sat and watched our, our love drift away
I looked into his eyes and he had nothing to say

Tell me something baby, tell me this ain't true
Tell me something baby, tell me this ain't true
I won't be crying for you no more, baby

The love has gone, that took me higher
Now you've gone and left me, boy you've wasted my time

Where is the love, that took me higher
Now you've gone and left me, boy you've wasted my time

You had me baby and now we're through
You've been messin' with my heart and yes you know it's true
I won't sit here waiting, while you're out of town
Just look into my eyes and there must be something to say

I won't be crying for you no more, baby

The love has gone, that took me higher
Now you've gone and left me, boy you've wasted my time
It's breaking my heart, you know this ain't fair
I deserve better, but you don't even care

[Verse 1]
This for the streets, and you know I ain't goin nowhere
Get your guns out who want it with Memphis yeah

Why I keep my hat tilt, and my doorag too
I'm a thug, my heart pump gangsta shit

My wrists don't freeze, glocks'll squeeze
Whole click got a watch, dropping keys
And I want the block back
You niggas had your run, we'll stop that, you better watch this cat
I done came up, and fuck bringin your name up
It's beef I'ma see you, and bang til you hang up
Your life on line, but here's the truth
You ain't hype to die, but you hype to shoot
You let the Henny talk for you, you really a bitch
Why the D's know your name 'cause you really a snitch

[Chorus: x2]]
Got my mind right, money right, ready for war
(Memph Bleek Is) (Murder) yeah told you before
I got the streets locked, Bleek hot as before
You know the game and the name now I'm ready for war

[Verse 2]
(Memph Bleek Is) back for the streets
Knowing that (Coming of Age) controlling the creep
Put in work on these streets, busting my heat
Dodging the Ds, you know it's a margin between me
And only a few fit in, your lifestyle's written
So who you supposed to be, play your position
I used to write to the wall, about the Porsche
Now I write for the house and the rob report
I used to think, Bleek and the baddest bitch
Now the, baddest bitch is a average bitch
All I need her is for head and to stash my lead
Push my V, take this key to hempstead
And you run through backwoods, I twist backwoods
And greenery, sha shoo with heavy machinery
You know exactly who these streets belong to
B.I.G. done warned you, and I'ma run up on you, nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Hey yo I think I'm the best, from coast to coast
I'm above rap cats, they know what I gross
What they make from they album, I do at my show
Your advance is what, I spent that when I was broke
I ship gold, you better watch me now
Many middle in this game, at the top I'm found
I wanted these cats, repping my hood, then go back
Be on the same old bench, with the same old rap
I'm from Marcy, you see them cars we buy
Seats up, smoke blunts, with my concubine
Twin, P-89 for you two fake fagots
Tucked under the lining of the Roc-A-Wear fabric
Fuck why y'all, you know the squad be 'bout
Anything that involve dollar signs and accounts

You have to pick niggas off of the ground
When I pick niggas off with tha pound
Go get your click nigga
This nigga running with clowns
I'm a rich nigga
I get you clipped at cost right now
Niggas forget niggas as soon as your coffee off in the ground
Family man, look at your kids orphans now
Used to just smack rappers
I'm extorting them now
Taking all that's important to them now down to your bitch
Nigga you sick fronting like you tougher than what you are
Till the gun is coming through the drivers side of your car
Using my name in vein like I won't damage the boy
You think niggas was shooting you out of canons before (I'm that nigga)
Niggas is pompous, first they in Evil Kanevil jumpers
Than they turning over Rovers like they want it with Hovah
It's not about rich and po', nigga, it's about Richard Poe
Understand I'm here to get this dough
It ain't about Brooklyn or Harlem
No more them it's about fame or stardom
It's about me being on blocks you borrowed from
I'm setting myself apart from rappers who use other peoples names
So other motherfuckers can watch 'em
It's as sample as this y'all niggas get off my dick
I'll let you eat after I get off my bricks
The world's most dangerous clique; R.O.C. mind right bitch

Ready for war

Nigga betta study your forms

If there's wars with my dogs, it's war with H
Act pumped and get left with a sawed off face
Respect carter, respect the R.O.C or respect the shots
Or respect the shots 21 thrown out the heckle or cock
The Co'd's no respect for the cops
Even if the park right next
To the spot we setting up shop
I got my mind and my cash right, a bad wife
Gripping a bag tight while y'all living a mad life
I chase down niggas, shake down niggas
Head back to the honeycomb to break down figures
I love 38's but the trey pounds bigger
Throw in the bank, trucks the size of tanks now nigga
I don't rap for pleasure I rap for chedder
Guns clap for treasure straight like that forever
H, Bleek & Jay on a track together
It's a wrap for y'all dog
We ready for war

[Chorus: x2]

I keep the gun tucked nigga
Which one of you tough
Which one of think you can go around with the pump
My clique for real
I ain't gotta talk no more
One in the leg, bet he won't walk no more
Ladies love me, why?
'cause I give em back shots
Niggas want to throw slugs but I bust back shots
It ain't even about trying to diss these niggas
It's about these niggas ain't built for these niggas
The R.O. yeah we simply street
You niggas cotton candy you simply sweet
I let the fifth spit without the red dot
I point and pop, pop, pop and drop
I got my mind right, money right ready for war
For that doe Bleek bustin' that for
This how real we get deep in the streets kid
The R.O.C. exclusive remix motherfucker

I got my mind right, money right
And it's not right here
Who want a war?
Nigga I'm right here
Get mind right, your money light
Don't make me come out there
Snatch your whore and get it done right there
Little niggas ain't ready for war
Better get ready for bed
Buck shot land at your head
Buck shots right at your head
Sit you niggas in a permanent chair
Give you niggas permanent stares
Shut down the party with the cut down shotti
Make doctor, cut down your body
Keep a hammer fuck a strong arm robbery
I blast I push the gas on the road part Johnny
I'm fast stay on the road so the law can't find me
In some quiet town tying it down
That's right Mac still supplying it now
By the pounds, stop trying it now

H. Williams Jr.,"It's been a blue, blue day, I feel like running away
I feel like running away from it all
My love has been untrue, she's found somebody new
It's been a blue, blue day for me.

I feel like crying, dying, what can I do
I feel like praying, saying I'm glad we're through
It's been a blue, blue day, I feel like running away
I feel like running away from the blues.

How can I make believe that I don't sit and grieve
It's been a blue, blue day for me
I can't pretend and say that I don't love her anyway
It's been a blue, blue day for me.

I feel like crying, dying, what can I do
I feel like praying, saying I'm glad we're through

Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness

Hello emptiness

Your love dear why'd you do me this way
Well I never felt more like crying all night

Without you you got me singing the blues
The moon and stars no longer shine the dream is gone I thought was mine

H. Williams Jr.,"Now they say don't go on Wolverton Mountain if you're looking for a wife
Cause Clifton Clovers has got a pretty young daughter
And he's mighty handy with a gun and a knife

The bears and the birds tell Clifton Clovers if a stranger should wander there
All of my dreams are on Wolverton Mountain I want his daughter for my wife
I'll take my chances and I'll climb his mountain
Though Clifton Clovers he may take my life

It's just ain't right to hide his daughter from the one that loves her so

Nigga, Nigga, Nigga that's me! (That Mike D!)
On the trill you dummies!
Froze up the whole block on dots and a hummy
Young mommies want a hog that ain't cuffing the puttee

They want a jigga with figures sittin' swole with them goodies
So follow me now to the land of the brick lick hitters
Go getters and wig splitters and a little game that gives shivers
Playboy how you figure you can step to a hog

Let off a hundred rounds drums punishing you and yo dogs
My platoon issue wounds that don't heal up
Nigga when the Mack-9 reel up you better throw your shield up
We dope runners and cake runners 

All out big head hunters three glots and sixin it off the chain young stunners
Better slow down lil daddy before you fuck around and get pegged
Run you off like a scared dog with your tail between your legs 
want to be a baller when this G-shit go down
This my time when I clown that yo click out in one rhyme

[H.A.W.K]
I'm a outlaw (outlaw)
I'll bring it to you raw
Southpaw (southpaw) bone knuckles to the jaw
Above the law and all military forces

A hustler run the block like obstacle courses
I stand taller than Sasquatch
Rolex my wrist watch
And when the gloat cock it's strictly head shots

If a nigga got beef I knock out teeth
Steal you like a thief make the asswhippin' brief
Bring your family grief if the situation is getting sticky
My trigger fingers itchy cause my business is risky

You better not miss me (don't miss me)
Or you ass is history (Bye-bye!)
Yella tape the lot on an unsolved mystery
I can't deny pull more stunts than fog eye

Snitch and you'll die like bacon you will fry
My alibi ""I wasen't even on the scene""
But bullet shells left a trail from the M-16

[Chris Ward]
I'm one of the ones (that's me)
That's an usual suspect
A thug that hang on an infested drug set
And stack chips, stay strap and pack clips

With hollow tips that will make you niggas do backflips
And If we go toe to toe I'll break your jaw
In three or four places like I break the law
Ghetto dope man yellow stone smokes man

Got killers and dealers on my team from here to Oakland
That's movin' more powder than Johnson and Johnson
I'm a death wish to niggas just like Charles Bronson
I'm uncut and lethal like LSD

Cocaine mixed with acid and PCP
Rap game assassin 
If I raise I blast and bury niggas six feet deep in the grass
So if anybody ask
Tell Chris Ward is dangerous 

For the fact my profile is mob style and gangsterous

If the Drama start I never meant to hurt you
But if everybody keep on fuckin with me
On everything I love I'm not gon'let 'em be

Drama keep calling me-Drama keep calling my phone
I told them to let me be-it is what, it is so let's get it on

I told them to let me be-it is what, it is so let's get it on

[Verse 2-Trae]
They say they know about Trae who the fuck lied to them
'Cause everyday that I breathe I'll be forced to live
And forcing no slugs to protect myself, I'm a asshole I ain't got nothin to give
I've got nothin to lose, get these blues

Some of these niggaz don't want to pay dues
I hope they buckle up they belt
'Cause it's finna get rough 1 of these niggaz finna get bruised
Why you start it if you ain't want the beef

You got plex you really don't want no teeth
These Silvaback girls come on dogg
You better get ya weight up before you fuck with me
'Cause I'll maab on a nigga-swung on a nigga

Hit ya block up to harm me a nigga
Put 'em in a figure 4 and get raw with a nigga
Put 'em in a box so they don't find that nigga
Everybody want to hate me like I changed

Said the hot block since I got fame
But I know one thing they better get they bitch ass
The fuck from round me cause I got aim
So I'm back again-I got a pack of men

I pull up in a black 'Lac with a back again
'Cause these cats don't know how to act again
Trae they attitude off track again
So what you niggaz hatin on if it's the crime you gon' be waiting long

'Cause day after day it's gonna be takin on, I put it on leak and the 4's I'm skatin on
I promise you don't really want to take it there and I advise you for this
Ain't too many finna be too many finna be after this
Cause these bitch niggaz done got me pissed

I wanna send a special shout out to these hypocrites
These muthafuckin' fairy informant ass niggaz mayne
You know what I'm sayin', these muhfuckin' Donnie Brascos
These fuckin' dick riders, ol' pussy eatin' bullshit ass niggaz

Run they muhfuckin' mouth, get they muhfuckin' wig
Split, talkin' all that muhfuckin' pussy hoe ass shit nigga
We ain't playin' with none of you hoez
Y'all know who I'm talkin' about fuck you bitches
Project Pat light the fuckin' track up for these hoes mayne

Hen-hen-O-Sin make a playa sin, mix it in with that white and gin
Here we go again, Project Pat gotta keep a strap, haters know I rap
Wanna shoot me in my gold teeth, blow me off the map
I attack like a shark would represent this hood
North Memphis, nigga Hollywood
Make it understand in my blood ain't no trakeness
Or no fakeness and no hoe couldn't break this, you can hate this

Dis bitch that bitch, nigga here's the deal
Crunchy ain't runnin' 'round here fakin' deals
Crunchy runnin' 'round here tryna get a meal
Why you fakin' a deal, it don't cost nothin' to be real

All ya gotta do is keep that shit real
Don't be runnin' 'round here hollerin' you got deals
Don't be runnin' 'round here hollerin' that you'll kill
It don't cost nothin' to be real but it costs when ya kill

I'm 'bout to crash into you suckaz like the World Trade
I'm riding Green Escalade, full of green grenades
You hoez always hollerin' that we be some bitches and shit
But everytime I turn around you got our name on your shit

I used to be with them mayne, I'm still with them
You wish you was with them
How the fuck you hate them when you always claimin them?
I think it's funny 'cause ya'll faggots be still calling my studio
Trying to get back, stay who you with 'cause I don't need ya hoe

I call up my niggaz we buckin' and tossin' with no mercy hoe
We packin' mass case and decoratin' ya with bullet holes
La Chat I be ready you bustaz ain't got no reeds and shit
That leaves me no choice to grab my glock and go fucka wit

You speak killa talk but ain't no killa in yo blood boi
The infrared be beamin', I got this scope-a behind your door
You niggaz can't take it you hate the fact that we runnin' it
You ain't gotta love it but you gon learn to respect it bitch

Got some syrup in my cup, got some smoke in my mouth
Got some white in my nose, got your bitch on the couch
Got her head in my lap, trick I gotta keep it south
Got a problem with Three 6, gotta blow your brains out

Got that south sowed up, got them guns loaded up
Fuckin' with the Scarecrow, that'll get ya blowed up
It's a hold up, everybody fold up
Niggaz talk like they tough but they ain't got no nutts, bitch

I'm shootin' a dike in her breasto, coward in his chesto
And this police nigga, what we call em' Donnie Brasco
If you bitches want war, you can bring it, let's go
When I put this tone in yo face presto

Leave you in da street wit a bloody Willie Esco
Drankin' on some scotch and we choppin' down that coco

You ain't gotta lie to kick it actin' like you down dawg
Always lookin' lite trying to wear a murder frown dawg

Don't you get smacked and be gettin' off the pavement dawg
Don't you make me act a fool when somebody hatin' me dawg
Hypnotize Camp Posse got my fuckin' back dawg
Frayser Boy will leave you stankin', pop you with that gat dawg

I'm watchin' out for you polices, niggaz who'll tell it
This union will rip your head in pieces, I know ya feel it
These lyrics just like Mona Lisas 'cause you can sell it
The posse click tight like feces, I know ya smell it

Now here's a story 'bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin' quiet tears in the back seat
So when she asked me: ""What would you do if it was you?""
Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed niggas grabbin' me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain
Lord, come and take me
Four niggas violated
They chased, and they raped me
Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin' with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No! You got to find a way to survive
'Cause they win when your soul dies

Everyday, his mind on gettin mo' (gettin' mo')
And never your feelings, he's chasin' millions fo' sho'

Lost and turned out, what you let that nigga do to you? (Damn)
I knew her since elementary, she blew a kiss to me
Wrote me a note in crayon, wantin' to get with me
We was kids, now she got three kids
They see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is
Seen him last night, homey roll a E-class
Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her Pampers and food, just to stop through
But those ain't my seeds, nothin' really I could do (nah)

From this unending path of mine
Serpentine and black
It stands before my eyes
To hell and back
It will lead me once more

Of dying light
And cross all the rivers

Why time would've passed us by

The less I know myself
And every vow I break on my way towards your heart
Countless times I've prayed
For forgiveness
But Gods just laughed at my face
And this path remains
Leading me into solitude arms

I see through the darkness
My way back home
The journey seems endless
But I'll carry on
The shadows will rise
And they will fall
And our night drowns in dawn

Amidst all the tears there's a smile
That all angels will greet with an envious song
One look into strangers eyes
And I know where I belong

I walk through the gardens

Sacrificing all we have
For a frozen heart and a soul on fire
We are like the living dead
Craving for deliverance
With a frozen heart and a soul on fire

Again we're falling for disgrace
And hate will shelter us from the rain

And gently raped by the light of day

Afraid that everything remains unchanged in this fragile dream
Ashamed of the shattered remains of promises made

Drained by the anger and grief
Fazed by the envy and greed
The secret cries for a release
The lucidity hidden deep in sweet pandemonium",Sweet Pandemonium,2003

H.I.M.,"Is it so hard to believe our hearts 
Are made to be broken by love 
That in constant dying lies 
The beauty of it all 
My darling won't you feel 
The sweet heaven in 
Our endless cry 

Oh at least you could trust 
For this one last time 

So amazed how bright are the flames 
We are burning in 
Ever smiled at the tragedies 
We hold inside

H.I.M.,"There is no turning back
From this unending path of mine
Serpentine and black
It stands before my eyes
To hell and back
It will lead me once more
It's all I have as I stumble in and out of grace

I walk through the gardens
Of dying light
And cross all the rivers
Deep and dark as the night
Searching for a reason
Why time would've passed us by

With every step I take
The less I know myself
And every vow I break
On my way towards your heart
Countless times I've prayed
For forgiveness
But gods just laugh at my face
And this path remains
Leading me into solitude's arms

I see through the darkness
My way back home
The journey seems endless
But I'll carry on
The shadows will rise
And they will fall
And our night drowns in dawn

Amidst all the tears there's a smile
All angels greet with an envious song
One look into stranger's eyes
And I know where I belong

I walk through the gardens
Of dying light
And cross all the rivers
Deep and dark as the night
Searching for a reason
Why time would've passed us by

I see through the darkness
My way back home
The journey seems endless
But I'll carry on
The shadows will rise
And they will fall
And our night drowns in dawn

H.I.M.,"Memories sharp as daggers
Pierce into the flesh of today
The suicide of love took away all that matters
And buried the remains in an unmarked grave in your heart

With the venomous kiss you gave me, I'm killing loneliness
With the warmth of your arms, you saved me
Oh, I'm killing loneliness with you
The killing loneliness that turned my heart into a tomb
I'm killing loneliness

Nailed to the cross together
As solitude begs us to stay
Disappear with a lie forever
And denounce the power of death over our souls 
And secret brings us in to start a war

With the venomous kiss you gave me, I'm killing loneliness
With the warmth of your arms, you saved me
Oh, I'm killing loneliness with you
The killing loneliness that turned my heart into a tomb
I'm killing loneliness

H.I.M.,"It's poetry carved in flesh
This beautiful hell of ours
To the deadliest sin we confess
(Tears of joy fill our eyes)
We are safe where disfigured saints
Cry out their prophecies of doom

My heart's a graveyard, baby
And to evil we make love
On our passion's killing floor
In my arms, you won't sleep safely
And of lust we are reborn
On our passion's killing floor

At the first kiss
the seeds of hatred are sown
Back into darkness we flee
(To tear our hearts out)
We are saved where all faiths fail
Alive inside of our tomb

My heart's a graveyard, baby
And to evil we make love
On our passion's killing floor
In my arms, you won't sleep safely
And of lust we are reborn
On our passion's killing floor

My heart's a graveyard, baby
And to evil we make love
On our passion's killing floor
In my arms, you won't sleep safely
And of lust we are reborn

H.I.M.,"Softly the light shines in through
The gates of grace on me and you
Deceiving our restless hearts
A flickering flame so serene
Devours the night so we could see
The fear we hold on to so strong

But I know where I belong
Away from your gods
That heal our wounds
And light this endless dark

Lonely the light shines on you
Through the gates of fire entombed
Feeding on your love
Weak is the blaze that kept me away
From cruelty and tenderness embraced
Saving my soul no more

And I know where I belong
Away from your gods
That heal all wounds
And light this endless dark

H.I.M.,"You had demons to kill within you screaming
With a gun loaded with guilt you opened their eyes

Too close to my heart

And so are you

Confusion that separates us two

All is lost in this war
And all we can do is to wail and weep to the saddest song

To be near but not to turn into you my darling

H.P. Baxxter,"Jumping is an ability that most humans and many animals share to some degree.
It is the process of getting ones body off the ground for a short time using only ones own power
Usually by propelling oneself upwards by contraction and then forceful extension of the legs
In some cases the height of a jump may be increased by using a trampoline
Or by pushing down with the arms whilst playing leapfrog
One can jump up to reach something high
Or jump over a fence or ditch
Or jump down and one can jump whilst dancing
And as a sport
But jump also is the synonym for an exciting style of dancing just to freak out for sometime
Now listen to the sounds of Michael, Rick and the Chicks Terminator.
Please Jump

Let me see you get together,

Fading on the grass.

And clear the isle

Mic check

I be doing things on my own, and ain't no need for a mentor
Girls want to see me front and center, diamonds gleam when I enter
Hit the spot and them boys looking, that boys is so lovely
And that boy be popping champagne, that boy be sipping on bubbly
Running thangs, ain't no every day I'm on my campaign
Some boys be sipping Cristal, Moet pop serving champagne
Sip a fo' guzzler, straight up 'cause I got your muzzle
People too hard to figure out, so shit call me a puzzler
Freestyling nigga, boy I be showing charisma
Yeah I be shooting for Georgia Tech, like my name was Eddie Elisma
Doing this thing these boys can't mess with me, these boys can't test me
What's left to see, is that boy are-E double D
I'm a star sipping bar in the car, sitting sideways on the highway
Two hundred the fly way, what that boy say
That boy's out of control, that boy balling, that boy top drop low crawling
That boy's nineteen, that boy's not stalling
That boy mash for his green, that boy stacking cash for his dream
That boy last to get the green, that boy too fast on the scene
That boy be moving, that boy in the groove, that boy gon' bust a move
That boy gon' get the girls man, he gon' make 'em all soothe
In a bubble bath in the jacuzzi, might pull a yellow bone floozie
That boy don't understand, 'cause that shit really don't amuse me
I'ma grab the microphone till the mic is gone, I can hit the spot
Like it or not I'm a big shot, fuck it drop

I be at the stud' in the cool, with the draw walking in the nude
Telling her that I can come through, and I can get her into a interlude
At the same time I can have the tool, that's the microphone the utensil
While I come through the Southside, everybody say man that boy's instrumental
Better yet he's a republican or a democrat, every time he look at
Talking bout man what he have to have, a motherfucking Cadillac
On fo's, and I'm still swanging to the elbows and they sticking out
What you talking bout, what about them boys on Rap-A-Lot
Love to talk about the hoes that I fuck, and I smash and I pass
At the same time every time I receive, they be saying he's tip-toeing fast
Like a motherfucking ninja, or I mean the karate kid
At the same time I can drop the top, and I can go on and drop the lid
I mean I can let it fall, always come through and we still can ball
At the same time I gotta write my name on the wall, 'cause I gotta get a plack
I'm a mack in a Lac ready to attack, I duck on Shaq
Might as well make this boy put his granny, have a cardiac arrest
Using finesse I pop up in the STS, or a Benz
Me and my friends rolling on 20's, I mean three's
At the same time we some G's, sipping on Hi-see
Tropicana, here's the key to the banana, what about the scandalous
And Fraiser that he say, that he made the people
'Cause they be talking bout what we doing, and how we be screwing
I'ma pass the mic to Flip, so he can get to doing what he doing
Grab the mic and be screwing

Man hold up

Put the mic up, I'ma let y'all know I'm the Freestyle King
Got more ice than Dairy Queen, I pull up very clean on the scene
In a brand new machine, it might be a Jag
I wear my pants with a sag, had a BMX with mask
I never brag I never boast, I might eat on roast
And people say when we got a white cup in my hand, we might toast
I got Hump I got Redd to the side, we'll chunk it up
Uh ain't no drank in the cup, 'cause I done already drunk it up
I'm leaning I mean like a tower, got mo' drank than Doogie Hawser
Stay in Cloverland, I might pull up in the Prowler I'ma call
Get a room for a hour and take a shower, hit the West down to press
Pass a girl I can tell I must confess, I must manifest
I learned about the constitution, I learned about all this stuff
I learned about that you can get diamond baguettes, princess cuts or crushed
I got a piece I got a crease, nigga I look nice in it

The Terminator or The Predator, nigga I wrote a book I'm the editor
Them boys be saying, Flip always be ahead of his competitors
'Cause these boys can't flow, these boys be saying I'ma come down
And I'ma break these boys off, and get down like James Brown
Or Chucky Brown or Troy Brown, I could make me another movie
In the jacuzzi and blast like a uzi, nigga I get free in the movies

When you was growing up

[H.A.W.K]
I use to sit and watch the Flinstones, Gucci rolls and herringbones
Bezel sets and baguettes, while talking on my cell phone
From Bo-Bo's to Air Macs, low cars to horse backs
Hoopties to Cadillacs, water guns to chrome gats
Levis to Guess jeans, black and white to big screens
Six by nine to 18's, Bumsalack to sipping lean
Regals with white walls, 20 inch with screens fall
Michael Jackson off the wall, to MJG and 8Ball
Screw house to wrecking flows, to BET on videos
Zig-zags and yellow bags, to Glad sacks and optimos
Fist fight to gun play, sawed-offs to a.k.'s
Spitting flows at talent shows, as the H-A-W-K
Riding on the Metros, pushing a six double O
Smoking cess to endo, fill it up with petro
Fixing on my lego, let go of my ego
Get in with my little bro, getting up when the rooster blow

[Lil Flip]
I remember Kangaroos and afro curls, always running after girls
Trying to sneak in Natural World, BB gun shooting at the squirrels
Candy red on tricycles, training wheels on bicycles
Sugar Daddy's, Pixie Stix, peppermints and side pickles
Loaded toes and Scooby Doo, some of the things we use to do
Roller skate now roller blades, Ivy Leagues to holding fades
Blow-Pop rings and diamond things, herringbones to bezeltines
Cadillacs to limousines, ironing jeans to being clean
GI Joes to Tonka toys, eating Willy Wonka boy
Riding in my uncle's car, wanting to become a star
Having dreams to be like Mike, hooping in my all black Nikes
Flying kites and shooting dice, sneaking in the movies twice
Staying up and watching Cops, walking outside in Michael socks
Being afraid of chicken pox, check my bowl on Magnavox
Running up and down my block, sweating cause the sun is hot
I use to ride the city bus, now I'm pulling Hummers out

[AP]
I remember brothers getting dumped off, in ditches and bayous
Boys gave head jobs, and all I saw was hairdo's
Pimps drove Lacs and dob hats, with chrome gats
Hustlers stack paper, with the players and macs
Police burns in the hood, because somebody just got jacked
Every girl I slam they call, I told em call me back
Haters got backhanded, because they were always talking smack
Instigators chit chat, and were known for spreading rumors
Ballers went from stabs, to buying more of consumers
I use to eat on tuna, now it's shrimp and caviar
I use to be a virgin, now I have menage tois
I use to drink on soda, now I'm sipping mixed with bar
I use to stay in the ghetto, now I'm a ghetto superstar
I recall when I couldn't rap, now my rap game's up to par
From then to now it's funny, Jabos to Armani
AP became a business man, that's all about his money

Back in the days I was young, I'm not a kid anymore
But sometimes, I wish that I could be a kid again
I use to wear a swatch watch, now I only wear Movado
Went from bare foot on a bus, to holding keys to Monte Carlos
Now it's a big body Expedition, showing my naked ass provado
Went from hood to all good, shh playing a game like huh brah
Backyard nickel and dime that, now boys be moving birds
Use to carry my knife special, now it's gats and smoking sherm
Use to mix at house parties, freestyling to Whodini
Now I'm signing rappers to paid in full, eating shrimp and fetichini
Boy I use to ride big wheels, while wearing them Chuck Taylors
Now it's Jordans, Air Macs, even pink-green gators
Use to be sneaking in Lover's Land, or at the drive-in movies
Now it's Tinsel Town or Motel 6, where this hoe can do me
Use to watch freestyle the man, or Rap City on BET
Now I star in sitcoms, movies and got my own video show on t.v., what

Should of seen it I was right there, when a problem jumped off
Rounds got dumped off, leaving niggas bumped off
Always trying to get the hook up, leaving your girl shook up
Women breaking my pager, phone line you can't look up
We had ice on us, merchandise on us
Busting at other hoods, when they had a price on us
Listening to flow tapes, people saying rewind it
Pulling out my piece, and bystanders get blinded
From winter to summer time, there wasn't no leaving our block
When the laws made it hot, we was freezing our block
Man we got enough money, to make my neck look pretty
Cause we done made enough money, to make my check look pretty
Rapping at talent shows, saying phrase too frequent though
Niggas talk about Fasachi, we roll that in Regal though
Seein niggas Redd capping on, the comedy bout my chaperone
My dress code is casual, but all of a sudden I'm valuable

H.S.E.,"Come on, uh
I'm bout to cause a disaster, like a earthquake
Eighteen's, got little kids dropping milk shakes
I smoke and sip eights, poured in one soda
Treat my girls like dogs, nigga teach em to roll over
Give em the cold shoulder, if they don't listen
But they quickly convinced, when they see them rims twisting
Better pay attention, to that nigga Lil' Reezy
It takes six dimes in bikinis, just to please me
Better believe me, its real in the field
My chain like yellow lights, it make people ill
In the Porsche switching gears, like a Nascar racer
And the rocks on my bracelet, got it looking like a glacier
I'm a clutch player, like Robert Hory
These cats ain't balling, they telling stories
But ain't gotta worry, bout H.S.E.
If I ain't hating on you, then why you hating on me

We from the deep down South in the city
In the light, and I be seeing these girls be looking pretty
That's why, I got to stay on my grind
So we can be a hundred percent, all the time
Y'all don't know where we from (where we from)
Y'all don't know where we been (where we been)

Its like one for the money, and two is for them hoes
Three is for the drank, Four pass me the smoke
You won't see me riding, in any ole Benz
Unless its jet black, on twenty inch rims
I got more Air Force, than the government
Every color pair, I'm so fly trust me I'm loving it
I never leave the hoe, with just a single rubber
And I crawl like Ringling Brothers, hoes love us
Under the in-fluence, catch me swerving
Playing in a number six, like Julius Irving
My watch and my chain, got me coughing and sneezing
Still a young heathen, as long as I'm breathing
I pay for a show, turn it out then I'm leaving
The way the man told us, its flossing season
This year we got it made, we shining y'all
Even though we got a due, we still grinding y'all

Who am I, name is Lil' Flip
And I roll with, two clips
Just in case, something happen
While y'all niggas yapping, I'ma be capping
Rolling with my strap and, pistol packing
Glock 9's, Tech 9's, even a Mack 10
I'm not acting, I pack clips so
Play your roll, and stick to the script
Before I flip, and empty the clip
I'm Gladys Night, cause I'm a pimp
We eating shrimp, and catching planes
You know I'm great, at catching dames

Will you give some brain, do you got kids

But I, I see the handle to the hilt
You know I'm always pulling
But they, they won't stop
They won't stop pushing

I remember
Feeling guilty
Was it something I did
Or was it what I said?

It's not you, it's not me
The situations telling us to be
Not you, not me
It's what the world has left us to be

Me haces esperar
No entregas nada a cambio
Me ruegas y mis pies descalzos
Otra vez se quedan por tu encanto
Camino me llevas me elevas sin parar
Yo corro y tropiezo con mi ingenuidad

En tu forma de involucrarme

Ay como odio amarte
Más que negarlo quisiera olvidarlo
Pero hay algo entre los dos
Deja de sentir algo a tu corazón
Toma todo más en serio
O yo te digo adiós
Te odio te amo te amo te odio
Ay como odio amarte
Te odio te amo te amo te odio
Ay como odio amarte

Sonríe si me das otra oportunidad
A este amor viajero
Aunque parece ser
Que está en tu realidad arrodillarte al miedo
Te creo te sigo me elevo a soñar
Me lleva hasta el suelo tu inseguridad
Despierto perdida enredada

En tu forma de involucrarme
Ay como odio amarte

Esta mujer 

Esta mujer, necesita sentir que la amas aún 
Que este hombre aquí estará junto ami 
Cuando apague la luz, oh

Pero hoy no me siento tan fuerte 
Pero hoy no me sé defender 
En los días yo curo tu alma

Para encontrar vació mi corazon
Para darme cuenta que contigo no era yo

Y no, no fue

No quiero detenerme

No digas que me quieres
No significa nada amor

Porque en tus ojos me encontraba y tantas veces me perdí
Porque en el fondo exacto de la oscuridad no supe mas de ti

Que ya no me desarma
Regresan las palabras con las que me hipnotizabas
Y le di sentido a mi vivir
Y hoy no dicen nada
Noh, por eso no te quiero nada
Yo ya no te quiero nada

Quizá por juego nos vemos y punto
Dar una vuelta tu mano con mi mano 
Para contarnos que este es un mundo extraño

Era una vez o puede que dos veces
Era un ocaso que desaparece
Era una noche con una sola estrella 
Pero era grande, luminosa y bella

Nadar y hacer el muerto por la orilla

Tan perfecto que no te olvido
Piensa en mí, ayúdame a odiarte

Ha*Ash,"Te conocí un día de abril, un día común
El día que menos lo esperaba
Yo no pensaba en el amor, ni lo creía
Y mucho menos lo buscaba

Y de pronto apareciste tú
Destrozando paredes e ideas te volviste mi luz

Yo no sabía que con un beso
Se podría parar el tiempo y lo aprendí de ti
Ni que con solo una mirada
Dominaras cada espacio que hay dentro de mí
Tampoco sabía que podía amarte tanto
Hasta entregarme y ser presa de tus labios
Descubrí que sí
Porque lo aprendí de ti

De pronto algo pasoó y la pasión faltaba
Nuestras noches se alargaban,
Jamás pensé sentirme sola y fría y tonta
Aun estando acompañada

Después todo se volvió monotonía
Luego tantas mentiras que ya ni tú te las creías

Yo no sabía que sin tus besos
Pasaría tan lento el tiempo y lo aprendí de ti
Y que aguantarme, no llamarte
Tomaría toda la fuerza que hay dentro de mí
Tampoco sabía que podría extrañarte tanto
Ni desbaratare y que se secaran mis labios
Descubrí que sí
Porque lo aprendí de ti

Y ahora que por fin te he logrado olvidar
Hoy me vienes a buscar
Pero es muy tarde ya
Me he enamorado de alguien más

Yo no sabía que con sus besos
Iba a reemplazar los tuyos, lo aprendí de ti
Ni que existieran otras manos que al tocarme
Superaran lo que antes sentí
Tampoco sabía que podía amarlo tanto
Después de tu engaño que me hizo tanto daño
Descubrir que sí
Y todo lo aprendí de ti",Lo Aprendi De Ti,2014
Ha*Ash,"Perdóname por ver colores en un cielo gris
Por convencerme que a tu lado iba a ser feliz
Perdóname por entregarme a ti

Te imaginé sincero cuando no era así
Y si tenías ojos eran para mí
Discúlpame pero que tonta fui

Te idealicé a mi lado en mis noches y días
Y me aferré a la idea que tu eras el amor de mi vida

Hoy te pido perdón, perdón, perdón
Por haberte confiando sin dudar mi corazón
Entregar mi alma a tus brazos
Por confiar mi cuerpo en tus manos
Perdón, perdón, perdón
Por crearme esta falsa historia de amor
Y te pido perdón
Por haber esperado demasiado
De un perdedor

Pensando ""Dios, qué complicado es esto del amor"" 
Se preguntó así misma cuál habrá sido el detalle 
Que seguro Cupido malinterpretó

Sonó de pronto una canción romántica en la radio 
Quizá fue Michael Bolton quien metió el dedo en la llaga 

Y como le faltaba el sueño fui a buscarlo 

Los dos estaban caminando en el mismo sentido 
Y no hablo de la dirección errante de sus pasos 
Él la miro, ella contestó con un suspiro 
Y el universo conspiró para abrazarlos 

Dos extraños bailando bajo la luna 
Se convierten en amantes al compás 
De esa extraña melodía
Que algunos llaman destino 
Y otros prefieren llamar casualidad 

Uh

Y él le preguntó al oído ""Mi amor, ¿dónde estabas? 
Durante todo el tiempo que yo tanto te busqué"" 
Ella le contesto ""Lo siento, es que estuve ocupada
Aunque para serte sincera, ahora no entiendo en qué"" 

La noche se hizo día, pero no se fue la luna 
Se quedo a verlos apoyada en el hombro del sol 
Alúmbrales con fuerza, brilla todo el día 
Y cuando llegue la noche yo sellaré su pasión

Se convierten en amantes al compás

I cannot live without you ]

Love was never easy,
But leaving you was hard,
And time didn't heal my wounds at all
I wonder, if you know what I'm going through
All the lonely times that we're apart

CHORUS:
I miss you, oh I miss you
I'm gonna need you more and more each day
I miss you, more than words can say
More than words can ever say

Saying sorry was a question of my pride
Pride can push aside a loving heart,
In the end emotion has ruled my mind
And I'm asking for a second start

(chorus)

[ Maybe I've said words that really didn't
mean, but I know, every day
When a man does wrong
I know I miss you ]

To the point where total apathy consumed its hard working citizens and government

I. Red Death
It was a time when life was short
Long devastated was the land
Never had there ever been
A more fatal plague against all man
Pungent pain, sudden faintness
Your energy begins to fade
As you stand there somewhat daunted
You know 'Red Death' is on it's way
Blood, blood, blood and more blood
Profuse bleeding at the pores
You watch your blood slowly sizzle
As your flesh dissolves some more
Screams of anguish, blood still flowing
Pollutes the ground a rotten red
Your time has come, you must meet your maker
As you slip into the valley of the shadow of death
II. The Prince's Master Plan
All men feared this great disaster
But the valiant Prince had the only answer
For his majesty and his chosen ones
The inception of new life would free them of contagion
Magnificent it was this structure of seclusion
Surrounded by these walls so massive yet elusive
The gates were welded shut impervious to those forsaken
Never letting go of the souls that were taken
There was beauty, there was wine
Ambrosia and sweet nectar
Flowing from within
All appliances of pleasure
Inside the Master-Plan
Providing noble lunacy
Outside the palace gates
'Red Death' just sits and waits for you
Narration:
It was toward the close of the fifth or
Sixth month of his seclusion, and while the
Pestilence raged most furiously abroad, that
The Prince Prospreo entertained his thousand
Friends at a masked ball of the most unusual
Magnificence... Edgar Allen Poe (1809-1849)
III. The Masquerade including the Twelfth Hour and Return of the Red Death
Bizzare it was seven chambers
Held this jubilee except for one
It stood alone, the western wing
Where no one shared it's offerings
Blood tinted panes, brazier or fire
Projects it's rays
A clock stands tall, ominous
It warns of death so soon to be
So loud, so deep the guests pay heed
The dissonant ring of ebony
The crowd goes pale as darkness
Shrouds the maskers in their revelry
Then as the echos ceased
A light laughter spread through the assembly
And all is well
Until the next chiming of old ebony
The ebony clock struck the twelfth hour
And everyting ceased as the revellers cowered
The pendulum swings all still, all silent
Save the voice of old ebony
As the last chime died and sunk into silence
Soon it was felt a presence so strange
Tall and gaunt who is this masked figure
Shrouded in habiliments of the grave?
His blood splattered mask bore a striking resemblance
The countenance of a rigid corpse
He stalked to and fro in a slow, solemn movement
Enraging the Duke, invasion of his sanctuary
'Seize him, unmask him, ' commanded the prince
'Who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery?
You'll hang at sunrise! '
Not a person came forth it seemed like all was lost
As the intruder make his way unimpeded
An anon he went on trugged through each chamber
Where the music once swelled and the dreams lived on and on
The prince in pursuit dagger drawn aloft
As the figure retreats to the seventh chamber
He suddenly turns, a piercing sharp cry
Now the Prince lay dead in the hall of the velvet...
Then summoning the wild courage of despair,
A throng of revellers at once threw themselves
Into the black apartment, and seizing the mummer,
Whose tall dark figure stood erect and motionless
Within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped
In unutterable horror at finding the grave
Cerements and corpse-like mask, which they
Handled with so violent a rudeness, untenated
By any tangible form.
And now was acknowlegded the presence
Of the Red Death. He had come as a thief
In the night and one by one droppd the revellers
In the blood-bedewed halls of their revel,
And died each in the despairing posture of his fall.
As the life of the ebony clock went out
With that the last of the gay.
And the flames of the tripods expired. And Darkness
And Decay and the Red Death held illimitable dominion over all...
Edgar Allen Poe (1809-1849)
",Masque of the Red Death,2005
Hades,"How 'bout we get a little honest with ourselves
Let's start to think!
We're only flaunting our lack of respect
When we argue over opinions
You!
You talk like it's a fact
I wish you could just listen to yourself and your...
Opinions!
From the way that you talk
(Opinionate!)
You'd think your word was law
A preference cannot be wrong nor right
But it's wrong to try and dispute tastes
There's so many reasons we all use to form opinions
You see we've got the right to each hold a point of view
Why fight each other, it's all in vain respect's the key
But we argue blind, each thinking he is right
We are all at fault, you know it's true
Our simple free will is completely ignored
Damned to ignorance, what will we do now?!
We've all got enough problems, why add to the strain?
A no-win situation is what we have on our hands
Over and over and over and over
We prove the fact that we can't think
Living one mulish day at a time
Convinced that our shit doesn't stink! Yeah!
This song is food for thought, we're all starving
To change your standpoint is not so alarming
The usual result of change is growth
What's your opinion we'd like to know!
Opinionate! Opinionate! Opinionate!
Opinionate! Opinionate! Opinionate! Now!
",Opinionate!,2005
Hades,"Process of assimilation
You're the one who used to say
""My goals will never change,
However long they take to reach!""
""I'm no feather in the wind
I'll triumph with a grin""
You spoke with such conviction
Process of assimilation
How quickly you changed your tune
When time gave you room
To grow toward your desires
You claimed ""change"" helped you mature
Believe me I was sure
That you were trying to convince yourself
Your problem, I thought, was a weak frame of mind
But noticing your smile, I saw the problem was mine!
We're all searching for contentment with blinders on
We've got to learn to be objective
Before life itself is gone!
",Process of Assimilation,2005
Hades,"Defeat our purpose
But just which fate is worse?
How long can we go on?
We cannot sell ourselves
We'll take it on our terms
No easy path to resist success
You sell out, cash flows in
Your sickly glitter grin
You've only got one chance
To take it all the way
Relax, don't go so fast
Why get so carried away?
Resist, now don't tell me what to do
Success, I'll never ever leave it up to you
We may not change the world
Who said we wanted to?
Don't curse in ignorance
Fearful of something new
Oh, open up your mind
Success is self-defined
Do what your heart commands
Despite what they demand
Resist Success
Resist Success
Don't stay within their lines
Don't scramble for the dollar signs
They'll find you if you're deserving
If your course is unswerving
Outweigh the possibility
Of market stability
You are the path to resist success
",Resist Success,2005
Hades,"See his memory fade
Wife and daughter raped and killed one night
Life's rewards erased
Only one thing to look forward to
He wants his sweet revenge
Stalking lifeless streets
Target waiting for him underneath the light
Hands that shake with rage
Clutching ornamented bronze and steel
Nerves that twitch with fear
Like a soldier waiting for attack
His sweet revenge approaches
Springing into flight
Victims' scream are nothing that his heart can feel
His essence is freed
As the blade cuts from behind
Slicing the temple where the tender flesh
Joins one's only mind
Fighting with a desperate last breath
His life endures punishment a second time
His vision is blurred

As the life drops from his eyes
Shining the weapon as his entrails fall
Splattering upon the floor
Ripping up the pieces of nerves that keep his limbs from dying
Twitching as if still alive

Letting the body ease from his arms
Slowly slumping to the floor
Smearing all the blood along his fingertips
And watching where the deadman and his body lie
Stands atop his kill
Gloating on his recent victory
Like a lion's pride
Guarding over it triumphantly
The streets are filled with laughter
Sweet revenge is what he's after
Now he walks alone, into darkness that will only ease the pain",Sweet Revenge,2005

Hagers,"Deep down in Lousiana close to New Orleans
Back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B.Goode
Who'd never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sit beside the tree by the railroad track
The engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Listen to the rhythm that the drivers made
The people comin' by they would stop and say
Oh my but that little country boy could play
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode
[ guitar ]
His mama told him someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people come from miles around
To hear you play your music till the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights a sayin' Johnny be Goode tonight
Go go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode

Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me

Say ""Night-ie night"" and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading, but I linger on, dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear

Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me",Dream a Little Dream of Me,2000
Haia,"I close my eyes, only for a moment, and the moment's gone
All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity
Dust in the wind
All they are is dust in the wind

Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea
All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Oh, ho, ho

Now, don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away
And all your money won't another minute buy
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Dust in the wind
Everything is dust in the wind
Everything is dust in the wind
The wind",Dust in the Wind,2000

Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song

I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style
And so I came to see him to listen for a while
And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that he would finish but he just kept right on

Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly with his song 

He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair
And then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there
And he just kept on singing, singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly with his song

Haia,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty,2000
Haia,"Quiet nights 'n quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie away 
from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering

Eu vim pra te provar
Que não sou só mais um

Rá! Modelo mais bela das passarelas
Tava na dela com pressa
Ela disse ""calma""

Vou te beijar, te abraçar, quero comigo

De seu abrigo

O conceito ainda é o mesmo de antes
Me escute no alto falante, nada elegante
Vai!
Damassa na pant, ela me trouxe o enredo
Sua marra não tem segredo
Calma por calma amor
É o que me tira o sossego menina
Medo do medo é o seguinte óh, óh
Peço perdão pelo jeito indecente

Não compare swag e swing
Não tem como ver a luta de dentro do ringue

Meu verso dá glória e o começo foi punk
Notória missão dos rivais adiante

Da cena que a gente criou pra curtir
E eu gostos desses Mc Prison Break
Que entraram na cena só pra sair

Caminhando diferente, caminhando com a minha gente

Olhar na indecisão, futuro desejado
Passaporte na mão, coração 'tá gelado
Um dia de gestão da imprecisão, a imensidão
Versão de ainda não ter começado
O trato de te trazer pra perto a cada verba
A cada vento
Cada linha desse verso
No orçamento
O desconverso, ensinamento da vitrine de Rolex
Mais de um preço pro mesmo tempo, e
Nada contra Capitu, sabe que eu tenho capital
E eu sou banco, ela brisa
Dissimula e visa
Marcou o batom na camisa
E eu só sou o que sou, nem sou
Só sou o que sou, nem vou
Foto do Tripolin e revés no trampolim
E antes das 10 jantar no Italy
Fica ali veneno, me inspiro igual a Rita Lee
Negra Linn 'tá demais, mesmo pique Negra Li
Isso que eu li tudo sobre tudo, sobre o mundo
Sobre como ser menos machista e vagabundo

E ó você sabe que é sem pausa
Então vem de quatro, vem de lado
Vem de fato, cama treme, cai os quadros
Cai a luz do melhor quarto, é fato
Vem de hidro, de roupão vermelho
Na parede agora, mão no espelho
Vem por cima, vem, meu bem, trabalha
Vem agora, senta sem cansar
Ah meu Deus, assim eu vou casar
O que mais da vida eu vou querer
Vem de quatro, vem por cima, vem
Trabalhar de novo, de novo, de novo

Snitched on by some neighbor
Smelling the weed
Blown cover on the under

How you really know

Can't even be a roots man
And crop yo green

And prop 215

Who's gonna do me?

Or my look a like
It's looking like
It ain't looking too good
So I looked where I stood
Then I looked up
What a wonderful world
To have at my disposal
And those who know
If you abuse it
Then you lose it
But who's is it to begin with?
We started god-like
Now what's it gonna end with?

Haiku D'etat,"Aceyalone:
It's not a problem that I can't fix
'cause I can do it with my bag of tricks
they're playing for keeps and for kicks
but they're building with popsicle sticks instead of bricks
the time ticks, the atmosphere gets thick
I breathe in, it makes me sick to my stomach
if you got any kind of fix I want it
sometimes I think the attic's haunted
but it's not, it's just me
so I keep strutting and keep pushing my buttons
but I'm not about to be pushed over the edge
I made this pledge
not by you, my brother or by Sister Sledge
now I know that I'm not your boss
and I'm not trying to floss or come across lost
I wipe the frost until the glass is clear
and I exhaust the possibilities of showing fear
'cause the bigger the scare, the heavier the tear
and the wetter the drop and then you flood the crops
and we just don't want to be flooded
we cut it when we can't cut it we strutted we stay budded up
we keep it up and cut it up until we gotta shut up

Chorus (x2):
Haiku De Tat, make my music for the people who want to get down

Abstract Rude:
It ain't a lunch time I like to miss
I ain't a punch line type lyricist
and if you had beef you'd fight with your fists
my people suffer from lack of knowledge and righteousness
streets so wild we developed a frown
and a keen sense for knowing when it's going down
play it cool
say some shit that surprise me, my face don't change
serious 'bout them chips like a poker game
I come frequently like these Oakland trains
I freestyled it in a show and never wrote it the same
Aaron Pointer came to reign and say something
Eddie Hayes stays a little ways from me
the west side combination is legendary
home studios, cause by any means necessary
completed projects is my productivity
gimme food smoke and electricity
and if the power is ever cut off
I got a generator up in the loft
to stay energized, my music finds a way
to survive through the times and with the kinds today
L.A., what a wild place to be
styles by Ab, Mike Troy, and A.C.E.

Chorus

Mikah 9:
Indeed, indeed, Haiku De Tat what we could do witcha'
men at peace for y'all to call entities 
quicker on the draw the sickest thing that you ever saw
so for all our trees grow and grows in my backyard
remember me, sometimes I like to act hard
that's just it, it's an act but don't confuse that
if you choose to chit chat with a mack fully packed
you're bruised, black, blue and blurple
you'd never get a chance to bust back
I don't have to be rappin' or dancin' in a circle
to make the people react
I could be enjoying the be	-boying
I'm already on the map and made my money living fat
no need to profile and flash stacks
I'm way past that
Master Card and a little cash for snacks
munchies, after partaking from breaking nugs
down out of fat bud stash stacks
ahh, I do my floor work on linoleum
exploring the crevices of my woman's ass crack
I rhymin' in the SF studio on Napoleon
and I really love this jazz track
I'm running game now I'mma win
I'm on my last lap
you want to dance with me?
fast tap chance jacking for ASCAPs, checks, advance
and that's wack, I mash back

when I speak I slice the words up like a slasher
private party crasher, dasher, rational thinker
sparkle a twinkle, third eye glimmer

I like to let it simmer 'til the lights get dimmer

and come up with a solution for the pollution

the life of a star come hook us up

pages of loose leaf, blazing the keef

so when they hear you style they be proud of you guys
search from land to land
go from a thousand to a hundred to ten

Well life just ain't sugary and buttery, is it?
now what, are we fooling ourselves thinking that it is?
I'm thinking that these kids need to know it from the jump

I could play it like a trump
make you sicker than the mumps

and sometimes it don't come at all
you run you fall come one for all for one
depending on exactly where you from
'cause the only way to be immortalized to be organized
and be able to be mobilized and look over the skies

and freedom of man original with the tan
can I expand? can I feel the crowd?
if you don't want me to touch you then, uhh, speak up now

when raps and shows paid trifling days everybody
got to eat but we all need food for thought
caught up in a real live struggle to the grave
some are just sick cause they want to' be saved 
by the preacher man but 
I'm ah reach you men open them up way back when
African we was still rappin and beating on skins
what the people say gotta' shed a little bit of light
my insides is a beauty that is way beyond comparison
and I just want to share it all with you

Let your mind be free let your heart and your soul 
Just grow and let your life succeed as you wind on down the road
and let it be open your eyes so you see
open up your ears and what appears it's something true and clear
and I hear transprojection is love metaphysically here it is
I'll keep it in my soul, so I will show no fear were transmitted
I'm loud and clear as for those who see the light
behind the rhymes of Mikah 9 they know the time
And I see you and you make it through some of you don't hear me
All I can say is it's all love and that's the way it gotta be
Must we rob, rape, and murder one another for eternity?
As concerned to me
I would much rather we try to help each other
Allthe way down the road but almost every time I turn around
I hear the sound of bullet rounds fly through air
I'm well aware we're not prepared to
have conversation with celestial anatomy 
of Hereon and day by day we study in astronomy
and converse in astrology and Hereon
Live my days so let's partake so let's all take flight
We used to love light to guide your way through fright
and all of those spy satellites
It's called love, my friend
I must transcend on wish and waggle will
and this is where my story ends

Who is that standing on stage with the micro
psycho-analyzing every sucka in the room
whom could it be that slicing up the energy

they alive as long as they know something dependable
we can rendezvous and vibe if you boo then that's offendable
there may be discipline resulting in an experiment
to see if yo limbs are bendable
if your jaw bone's breakable

Hailey Cramer,"Yeah, for all the festival heads, check it out

Alright it's that time of the year you've been waiting for, for months now
Saving up your pay trying to figure all your funds out
It's kinda funny when you think of all the fun
How it's taken this long to shake last year's comedown
Forget the past, as soon as December starts
Grab your parents' credit card and hope that you don't get in last
Yeah, 'cause if you let it pass these days
A week late can mean paying triple when you bpay off ebay (true)
It's hard to figure out what tickets you want, should it be Falls Festival or Pyramid Rock?
Well for me, I really don't care 'cause I don't listen to rock, or hip hop
I just wear earplugs and sit there and watch
If your favourite band's there you'll think you'll never forget
You'll probably get that wasted you won't remember their set
But if you're a festival head then you already know the plan
Go and pack up all your shit 'cause you're going on a trip for those summer days

Summer days
Oh, summer days
Summer days
For those summer days
I love summer days

Man I'm not squishing in the back
I'm telling you, shotgun front
Nah, bullshit man

Now when you finally make it there from driving up with your crew
You better get your mind set on finding something to do
'Cause you'll be stuck there lining up in the queue
Moving bumper-to-bumper until your arse hurts, all to get your car searched
And if your alcohol you're stressing 'cause you need it bad
Stashing bottles of vodka up in your sleeping bags
Maybe get a spare tyre with a heap of cans
It doesn't matter, everybody has their secret plan
Once your crew start picking your spot
Unpacking, realize all the things you forgot, or shit that you lost
Man, I swear I brought my pillows and socks
And dudes too excited already sitting there sloshed
It doesn't take long before you find somebody blazing up
Mate, what are you doing, I said to save the bud for Xavier Rudd
It's always the cheap fuckers who ain't paid enough, yep
But please note that we don't condone taking drugs

Summer days
Oh, summer days
Summer days
I love summer days
I love summer days

Man, how cold is it inside this tent?
I know, it's freezing man, Jesus Christ!

Now as soon as the sun rises you'll be ready to start
At six o'clock standing there outside your tent with a glass
You're in it for the long haul, it doesn't end when it's dark
We all know you've got your friends to make your energy last
And you gotta time it so you peak it while the acts play
Try and jump the fence and start sneaking into back stage
If you get caught by police then try to act straight
Nah, they're not those pills, I need them for my back pain
And dudes are flying, saying to their mates ""I love you man!""
Or on a walk so they can go and call their Mum and Dad (it's Pez)
And then there's people who so desperately just need a friend
They're going up to anybody trying to have a D&M (yeah, my family)
The next stage is you won't even watch the bands live
You're having too much fun talking shit around your campsite
Getting wasted while you bake in the sun
What can I say, yo, it's a fucking good way to get drunk
I love

Summer days, summer days
Oh, summer days, summer days
I love summer days
I love summer days

Hey, what happened to you guys last night?
I didn't even hear the countdown or anything

Now by the last day you're probably thinking summer's the worst
'Cause all that time out in the sun left you covered in burns
And smothered in dirt, the sight of all the dunnies is worse
And all the food shops are gone when you're so hungry it hurts
All you wanna do is sleep but you got packing to do
Then squash up in that car and jump back in a queue
Yeah, I know we all complain about the pain when it ends
But next year we’ll save up and do the same shit again
I love

Summer days, summer days
Oh, summer days, summer days

With a clit ring in my nose then quit bringin' my flows

Can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
See what you're seein' is a genius at work, which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first
'Cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time
I sung like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump and Grind"" comes on
More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave
Screamin' at the sky, 'til clouds gather, it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it, the parents are pissed but the kids love it

Haindling,"Er hängt mit seinen Freunden in der Wand
Da rutscht ihm das Seil - oh
Da rutscht ihm das Seil aus der Hand!
Er hat sich seine Finger halb erfroren
Und hat alle Freunde -
Alle miteinander verloren.
Er hat seine ganzen Freunde verloren,
Seine ganzen Freunde.
Er hat seine besten Freunde verloren,
Seine besten Freunde!
Und in der Disco tanzen sie wie die Wilden,
Der allerbeste kriegt den erste Preis.
Doch er hängt noch in der Wand
Und hat den ersten Preis in seiner
Haberfrorenen Hand -
- Als erster Preis - ein Edelweiß!
Das ist ihm jetzt schon oft passiert,
Daß er auf einen Schlag alle Freunde verliert.
Dabei hat alles so gut angefangen
Bis auf das rutschige Seil in seiner Hand.
Er hat seine besten Freunde verloren,
Seine besten Freunde.
Und in der Disco tanzen sie wie die Wilden
Ganz verbissen um den erste Preis...

Wearing smells from laboratories

Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

Hairy Patt Band,"Little ditty about Jack and Diane
Two American kids growin' up in the heartland
Jacky's gonna be a football star
Diane debutante backseat of Jacky's car

Suckin' on a chili dog outside the Tastee Freeze
Diane's sittin' on Jacky's lap
He's got his hand between her knees
Jacky say ""Hey Diane lets run off
Behind a shady tree""
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks slacks
Let me do what I please.
And Jacky say

Oh yeah life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone, they walk on

Jacky sits back reflects his thoughts for the moment
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean.
Well you know Diane, we oughtta run of the city
Diane says ""Baby, you ain't missing' no-thing""
Jacky say a

Oh yeah life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone, 

Gonna let it rock
Let it roll
Let the Bible belt come down
And save my soul
Hold on to sixteen as long as you can
Changes come around real soon
Make us women and men

Oh yeah life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone,

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

halt dir die Flinte an den Kopf, und missbrauche dich Kokser,
Mein MSN ist voller Frauen wie Kloster.
Die letzte Wahrnung,
wer will Crack vom Bahnhof,
Ich bin Desperado, das ist Düsseldorf.
Zu Boden geht man oft, aber aufsteh'n muss man immer,
ich gehöre in den Knast, wie zu einer Mutter Kinder.
Frage mich, wo haben sich die Gangster versteckt,
und sie stinkt, doch hatte sie von Dancestar im Bett.
Rapper meinen sie Dealen, denn sie kaufen Gras,
Ich werd öfter nach Pillen gefragt, als ein Frauenarzt.
Mach auf Ghetto, geh und hol deine Gasknarre,
Ich hol euch Penner auf den Boden der Tatsachen.
Und du Clown ich fick dein lustigen Rapper,

Hakan Abi du hast recht, hier spaziert der Banger,
bevor man uns f*ckt, da können Kastrierte schwängern.
Ich bring maskierte Männer, du bist ein Hurensohn,

Wer ist gegen meine Kraft?, du scheiß Skateboardfreak,
ihr seid Jankies wie das New Yorker Baseballteam. 
Du hast Straßenverbot, wenn der Pate dich holt,
ja ich schlage dich tot, Assphalt Massaka.
Farid Bang, er bleibt ein Pascha bis er stirbt,
denn ich weiss, ihr fühlt mein scheiß wie ein Gas-Wasserinstallateur.

wer ist Ghetto und wird seine Hände antonnen.
Und ich mit euren Müttern jetzt Sex hab,
ich bin wie Hero, wenn ich komme drücken sich Rapper.
Guck dich an, du bist nur ein Penner aus der Gosse,
breche Frauen die Herzen und Männern ihre Knochen.
Und mich ändern nicht die Fotzen, denn ich zieh die Pumpgun,
ich hatte mehr Blind dates als Stevie Wonder. (:DD)
Ich box mich im Club, bin der Boss in der Hood,
pumpe Stoff in die Brust, Anabolika.
Was Juvelen, du Esel, du Anfänger,
Ich hab mehr Seitensprünge, als Stuntmänner.

Nachdem ich mit dir fertig war, stand sie auf Nazis.

Ihr könnt weiter cyphern, hier kommt das Bestattungsinstitut
Summer, ich wuchs auf hier in Rheydt mit Versagern
Doch dachte schon an Para, als Michael noch schwarz war
Mach Tausend Männer platt, häng mit Frauenhändlern ab
Die dich weghauen werden, falls du Außenstände hast
Viele der Fotzen sind leider viel zu sentimental
Deshalb mache ich Psycho-Terror und ficke sentimental
Früher war ich immer der, der kein Visum bekommt
Heute heisst es Gucci, Prada oder Yves Saint-Laurent
Es ist Summers, es ist Farids, es ist Eks Welt
