Joe Puma,"It's hard to learn 
How tears can burn one's heart
But that's a thing that I found out
Too late I guess, Cause I'm in a mess

My faith has gone 
Why lead me on this way?
I thought there'd be no price on love
But I had to pay.

If I could perform one miracle
I'd revive your thoughts of me
Yet I know that it's hopeless
You could never really care.
That's why I despair!

I'll go along hoping 
Someday you'll learn
The flame in my heart, Dear,
Forever will burn!",Yardbird Suite,1957
Joe Puma,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul,1973
Joe Puma,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".",Mood Indigo,1984
Joe Puma,"I'll never stop loving you
Whatever else I may do
My love for you will live 'til time itself is through
I'll never stop wanting you
And when forever is through
My heart will beat the way it does each time we meet
The night doesn't question the stars that appear in the skies
So why should I question the stars that appear in my eyes
Of this I'm more than just sure
My love will last and endure
I'll never, no, I'll never stop loving you

I'll never stop loving you
Whatever else I may do
My love for you will live 'til time itself is through
I'll never stop wanting you
And when forever is through
My heart will beat the way it does each time we meet
The night doesn't question the stars that appear in the skies
So why should I question the stars that appear in my eyes
Of this I'm more than just sure
My love will last and endure
I'll never, no, I'll never stop loving you
",I'll Never Stop Loving You,1999
Joe Puma,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1999
Joe Puma,"Talking by the pool of light, language from America.
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd
They are not a melting pot, say no, say no tapestry
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd

She takes his hand and she says you'll stay
She's lost in the crowd
King
Wire them up, fire them up
The life and times, the art and talk
Wire them up, fire them up
The life and times, the art and talk

Lovers run camp Africa, Bars in town are civilised
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd
Panorama, Citylife
Youth's dance proud from the waist down
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd

Shot from where the action is, a rhapsody in black and blue
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd
Love lies under western eyes, powerful yet transient
She puts on the film of him, King is white and in the crowd

It don't mean a thing
All you got to do is sing
(doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah

Joe Puma,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In,2001
Joe Puma,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,2001
Joe Purdy,"You and I 
We didn’t work out
Darling that was only the first round
If it’s true love then try, try again
Would you really expect for us to win right away?
You know they say
Catarina won’t you come and run with me now?
We don’t deserve this
Second chance at this
Step up and take a weekend
Well we could pop a train or a one-way ticket out
We can just get in my piece of shit car and drive all night ‘til the gas runs out
We could stay right here, watch the city cave in
Lick our wounds until they’re warm again

And I don’t care anymore who sees this mess 
‘Cause you’re the only one I’m trying to impress here
My dear, Catarina 
Won’t you come and run with me now?
No, we don’t deserve this
Second chance for this

Joe Purdy,"It was a fine day in the fifth grade
When mary may let bobby walk her home from school
He had her books in hand
And he was listening to every word she said
Like it was the gospel of the prophecies
And he loved the way her hair fell across her dress
Went home singing who wrote the book of love
And try a little tenderness

The next day on the playground
Bobby sat mary down on the swingset behind the sandbox
And she said, ""Bobby I just wanna play,
So what is it you have to say?""
He said, ""Mary, marry me.
We could live out by the sea
Like they do on the movie screen
Oh, marry me, Mary May
Before you go back to play""

It was graduation day
They were waiting on a plane to take mary away
Said, ""there's nothing left for me here but you
Bobby, I hope you can find yourself through
There's so much that I wish to know
And I have to do this on my own
And I hope you can understand
Bobby, write me when you can""

He said, ""take my high school ring
So time to time now you can think of me
And there's just one more thing before you leave""

He said, ""Mary, marry me
We could live out by the sea
Oh, like they do on the movie screens
Oh, marry me, Mary May,
Before you are fly away""

There's so much time has past since that day
And Mary stopped writing years ago
And Bobby never took his music on the road
Guess he never really gave up hope
Though Mary she's got everything she thought she wanted
Got a Phd, she is an independent business woman
Climbin' up the corporate ladder
Though it really don't seem to matter
She is lonely beyond belief
So one day she went home
Looking for the only love she'd ever known

She found him once again
Playing circuit at the Holiday Inn
Still singing the song about the one he lost long ago
Just goes to show you never know

She took his hand in hers
Not everything she had planned and rehearsed
She said, ""Bobby, marry me
We could live in a apartment building with the window hue
We could take in movies on the weekend
Or plan our vacation
Take a honeymoon by the sea
Oh Bobby, won't you just marry me?
Won't you just marry me?
Oh please, marry me""

Joe Purdy,"Sitting in a Dixon garden, wishing that you and I weren't parting
For the last time, the last time
And I said, ""Why you want to get married anyway? That man's got a family""
And then you say, ""Couldn't wait on you forever, or could I?""
""Guess not""

There's an awkward silence for the first time, so many years
And as I recall you used to be mine, not some property of his
And I sing ""Ah la don't go, ah la stay
Ah la don't go, don't go away.""

Maybe I should apologize, for I treated you so
And I'm so sorry that I left you here, I just wish I could have known
You say, ""You never can tell, and it's not your fault
See these things just happen when you're dealing
With the hands on a clock of a woman""

""And he treats me fine, and anyways I'm getting older""
She said, ""Oh but I still miss you sometimes,
When the weather's getting colder""
And she sang ""Ah la don't go, ah la stay
Ah la don't go, don't go away.""

Do we say goodbye, or just see you later?
She said ""Don't make me cry,
'Cause it's enough just to know
That I won't ever hold you close
And I won't ever smell your skin,

I scream out loud 
Oh god forbid you could have left me out 
Of your wicked intentions, hateful fools to see 
And I wish you had not been born 
While we have to meet 
And I hope this isn't love 

So carry on with your cutting people down 
He may fall in love as he falls to the ground 
And you never seem to care what we feel inside 
As long as no one gets near the safes that you hide 
And I hope this isn't love 
And I hope this isn't love 

Last night I had the sweetest dream 
That you were nowhere near me 
That you could not cut me 
That you do not affect me 
That I had my sanity 
That was just a dream 
That was just a dream 

So go away 
Why cant you leave me be 
Because I love your face and need for me

When Mary May let bobby walk her home from school 
He had her books in hand 
And he was listening to every word she said 
Like it was the gospel of the prophecies 
And he loved the way her hair fell across her dress 
Went home singing who wrote the book of love 
And try a little tenderness, yeah 

The next day on the playground 
Bobby sat Mary down on the swingset behind the sandbox 
And she said, bobby I just wanna play, 
So what is this you have to say? 
He said, Mary, marry me. 
We could live out by the sea 
Like they do on the movie screen. 
Oh, marry me, Mary May, 
Before you go back to play 

It was graduation day 
They were waiting on a plane to take mary away 
Said, there's nothing left for me here but you 
Bobby, I hope that you can find yourself through 
There's so much that I wish to know 
And I have to do this on my own 
And I hope that you can understand 
Bobby, write me when you can 

He said, take my high school ring 
So time to time now you can think of me 
And there's just one more thing before you leave 

He said, Mary, marry me 
We could live out by the sea 
Oh, like they do on the movie screen 
Oh, marry me, Mary May, 
Before you are fly away 

There's so much time has past since that day 
And Mary stopped writing years ago 
And bobby never took his music on the road 
Guess he never really gave up hope 
Though Mary shes got everything she thought she wanted 
Got a P-H-D, she is an independent business woman 
Climbing up the corporate ladder 
Though it really don't seem to matter, 
She is lonely beyond belief 
So one day she went home 
Looking for the only love she ever known 

She found him once again 
Playing circuit at the holiday inn 
Still singing the song about the one he lost long ago 
Just goes to show you never know 

She took his hand in hers 
Not everything she had planned and rehearsed 
She said, bobby, marry me 
We could live in a apartment building with the window hue 
We could take in movies on the weekend 
Or plan our vacation 
Take a honeymoon by the sea

Wont you just marry me?

Joe Purdy,"I was born an only child
On a warm Jersey night.
My mother was a dressmaker,
My father drove a truck
My family never was much good
When it came to money-luck...no.

Me and my best friend took to stealing
When we were only 16.
And one year in the county jail
Made a man out of Tommy and me.

We caught the train to New York,
We thought we were so tough
We started fighting for quick cash,
We decided we didn't need the money that bad.

We were the runaway children
Always lost in the dark
Trying to forget where we came from,
Trying to make a new start.
Oh, but it was so hard.

Earned my first honest dollar
Workin' at the mill outside of town
Tommy went elsewhere
Never did like the sound of a poor man cryin'.

Tommy got mixed up with people,
The kind of people you just don't get mixed up with
And they beat him so bad, he...
He almost didn't live to regret it...but he did.
Uh, thank God he did.

We were the runaway children
Still lost in the dark
Trying to forget where we came from
Trying to make a new start
Oh, but it was so hard...so hard...it was just so hard.

But Tommy moved eight years ago
Out to Las Vegas
Now he sweeps the floors in the casinos
Oh, and he gambles when he's able.
When will he ever learn?
When will he ever learn?

And me, I went back home,
Oh, and I made it just in time
To say I'm sorry for what I'd done
Right before my mother died.

Now I drive a truck
Just like I swore I never would,
But I need the money worse than I need the luck.
I know my old man just did the best that he could with what he had.
It's funny the things we finally learn how to have of

I just need to get home
And I'll be back here before you know

Hungry now get a bite to eat
And the pilot sits down to rest his feet

Another little one walks out with nothing

She turns her back, guess I caught her eye

Call a friend at home, says ""I wish you were here
Oh how I wish you were here""

I talk to a stranger to pass the time,
Says, ""How are you, boy, 'cause I'm doing fine.""

I turn to reply but the stranger was gone

Joe Purdy,"Well Jamie could get closer if she tried
Sometimes she gets lonesome late at night
She walks the streets where good love has gone bad
She worries for the one she never had

She says, I still got some gentle in my bones
Sometimes I just need someone else to know
And I will walk until these clothes are soaking through
And take comfort in these broken town blues

Last time that I saw her we were young
She told me just how restless she'd become
She cut her hair and took on a new name
Just goes to show that some things never change

And she said, I still got some pony to my step
Sometimes I just need someone in my bed, yeah
And I will toast the dark and dance with worn out shoes
And take comfort in these broken town blues

She said, get back in this city where you belong
Come sing me some of your country boy songs
And tell me all your secrets, I'll pour you wine
And if it gets late enough, I'll tell you mine

And she said, I still got some crazy in my head
For the most part I ain't got no regrets
So I will walk this rainy city here with you
And take comfort in these broken town blues",Broken Town Blues,2007
Joe Purdy,"Well I live in the canyon
Where the old coyotes howl
And they come down from the mountains when the dogs begin to growl
And they meet up in the darkness where they fight until the death
When the morning sun is rising I will bury who they left

And oh, they call me Canyon Joe

And I stay in the cabin
Where I work my hands to bleed
Swing the hammer to the nail
And I swing the axe onto the tree
And I once cleared these woods
Yeah there used to be a path
And now the trees have overgrown just to prove that nothing lasts

And oh, they call me Canyon Joe

The old man went crazy
He lives high up on the ridge
He used to tell me all the stories of the church house and the bridge
But the bridge, she washed away your sin
The church house- it got burned
'Cause this world has gone angry and some people never learn

And oh, they call me Canyon Joe

And I once loved a woman
Yes and Georgia was her name
We met out in the foothills of the Ozark Mountain Range
We saw the world together
Least the parts that we love most
She still comes to me in dreams
I am still haunted with her ghost

And oh, they call me Canyon Joe

And all my thoughts are heavy
My beard, it has grown long
And I search the face of six-strings for an old familiar song
But the chords, they all sound foreign like the places that I've been
So I close my eyes to sleep
Tomorrow I will try again

And oh, they call me Canyon Joe
Oh, oh, they call me Canyon Joe
Singing oh, oh, they call me Canyon Joe",Canyon Joe,2007
Joe Purdy,"Pick me up softly, I don't know the shape that I'm in
I dropped through the windows and down through the buildings
And up to the front door again
There was a gunfight out in the moonlight
To settle the matters at hand
So pick me up stranger, pick me up softly
I don't know the shape that I'm in

[Chorus]
And I did my best with my time in the West
And I tried not to leave anyone in distress
And I have stood tall yeah and I never lied
That's a lie
But I surely tried
To do everything I could do right

Pick me up softly, I don't know how much I've been hurt
One bullet missed me, the other one kissed me
And left me to die in the dirt
They killed every last man and shot down my Suzanne
It's over whatever it's worth
So pick me up stranger, pick me up softly
I don't know how much I've been hurt

[Chorus]

Pick me up softly, I don't know long I have left
Oh I am not hurtin', but death is a-certain
There's a bullet that lays in my chest
I'm flooded with memories and people and sweet dreams
And words to my favorite songs
And I'll buy the last round if you lay my head down
And sing one for me when I'm gone

Joe Purdy,"There's a lady, Spanish roses in her hair
And they cover the crown of thorns she wears
And the blood from her lips as she sings
Do it all for the glory of thee

And they carry her down, down, down
Down in the cold, cold, ground
By the river she used to pray
Forever now she will wait
For the king to come

And the boys who would crave her perfect skin
And she burned herself, she thought it would please him
And the iron chain spiked around her waist
And the poison that she used to hide her face

And they carry her down, down, down
Down in the cold, cold, ground
By the river she used to pray
Forever now she will wait
For the king to come

And she made a bed of broken glass and stone
She slept at night to prove the faith was strong
And when her broken body finally gave
There grew Spanish roses by her grave

And they carry her down, down, down
Down in the cold, cold, ground
By the river she used to pray
Forever now she will wait
For the king to come",Isabel and the King,2007

Joe Purdy,"She was just a year ahead of me
But that meant so much back then, you see
When the high school boys caught wind of me
They threw me in the mud

And I fought my way to the car that night
And I cursed the water, and I cursed the light
But I learned to swim, and I learned to fight
For the things that mean the most

And oh, 
Sweet Samantha dear, I know it's been so many years
And I hope that they have been kind, my friend
Oh, I think about you now and then

Joe Purdy,"One more drink 'fore he split town, 
Pulled up in a rose pink cadillac
He was singin' with the top down girl from the north, 
Dylan and Johnny Cash
He won the car on a card game listenin' to The Boss, 
He keeps his clothes in a gunney sack
She said, ""Tell you what sailor, if you take me outta here, 
I'll do anything that you ask,
'Cause I don't wanna die like the people down here 
But I feel that I'm fading fast.""

He looked over to her chestnut hair, 
He said ""I don't believe in love.""
But he knew good and well she was the only girl there, 
So he figured it was close enough

And they hopped in the car, rolled the windows down far,
And they headed through the desert plains
And she didn't even mind when they crossed the state line 
And the sky opened up with rain
And they went three states 'fore they even spoke a word, 
He leaned over just to ask her name
She said, ""Take me to the 61 highway, sailor, 
And you can call me Queen Jane,
'Cause the only thing I stole from the town 
Was a crown that I took from a beauty queen.""

And he looked over to her deep green eyes, 
Knew that she was just as cold as him
So he went to the trunk, grabbed the pistol from inside, 
And told Janey of his plan

And they went to the store she put the gas in the car, 
He came out running with a case of beer
And he jumped in the back with the money in the sack 
And Janey she took the wheel
And they ran off in a blaze in a sweet summer haze, 
To the bullets of the cashier
""You keep your head down sailor 
'cause I might need ya' later, just holler if you can hear,
'Cause I'm gonna need a man, 
Not a farmer girl tan and a cadillac souvenir.""

And they camped out by the railroad bridge, 
And they made love all night,
Watched the sun come up over Mercury Ridge, 
From a hilltop outta sight.

They hit five more banks and their small-town safes 
And they knew that they could get out fast
Had the time of their life but they had to have a talk, 
'cause they knew that it couldn't last
They made friends with the man at the Mexico border, 
And they left him with a bag of cash
She said, ""I tell you what, sailor, 
I don't care about that paper 
But I'm happy that we passed,
'Cause I'm feeling pretty tired 
And I'm carrying a child and we both need a rest.""

And they settled down to a house near the water, 
Where they would live to be old and gray
And many years later and the kids are all older, 
And they tell 'em 'bout the good ole' days.",Outlaws,2007
Joe Purdy,"Happy New Year Santa Rosa here I am
I was brought in by the weather and the cold
I was heading towards the West to find the sand
I guess I'll have to settle for the snow

And I am just a stranger to this town
I'm lonely and I'm restless and I'm stuck
And I wish I knew a way to get back down
And I wish I had a shovel in this truck

And the state police won't let me on the street
I told 'em my story - they don't care
There's an old dog just lying at the feet
Of a girl who once wore flowers in her hair

And my heart lies fifty miles ahead
Underneath a bridge just out of sight
Where she sits beneath the covers of a bed
Where she waits for me to meet her in the night

And this old town was named after a rose
That blooms along the hillside in the cold ground
But my heart has been broken and it's closed
Like the freeway that would take me out of town

And just because I ain't got no regrets
That don't mean I didn't get it wrong
My love is like a homemade Summer dress
And I am just a lonely Winter song

I dust off the snowflakes from the hood
And I talk to an old friend on the phone
She says, ""I think that the calm could do you good
You know you've been driving for so long""

So Happy New Years babe, I guess this is goodbye
And I hope that you find someone you can hold
And if you hear that midnight whistle cry
Please think of me in Santa Rosa in the snow",Santa Rosa in the Snow,2007
Joe Purdy,"Well give me something that I can look forward,
Give me a reason and I'll sing some more.
I don't need no lies,

Tell me that you feel it too.

I promise not to write you no more love letters.
I promise not to tell you how you are much better,
Than anything I could have hoped to have had.
Just hate when good love goes bad.
Just shame when good love goes bad.

I haven't been here since I can't remember,

So I'll give you the ones, 
That I don't forget,

Where'd you come from?  
And where are you goin'?  

And you were the one for me last night,
When the whiskey was gone, 
And the glasses dry,
And you sat at my table,
And we talked for a while,
And I knew you, 
Though I'd never known you.

I'll sing you a song if you want me to, 
And the verses aren't quite on, 
But the words are true, 
And I mean you no harm, 
You might think I do,
How I wish, 
You would change your mind.

Only stay away on my day of rest
 
Oh, you can kiss me on a cool day, a hot day
A wet day, which everyone you choose
Or try to kiss me on a gray day, a May day
A pay day, and see if I refuse
And if you make it on a bleak day
A freak day, a week day, why you can be my guest
But never, never on a Sunday",Never on Sunday,1995
Joe Raposo,"I believe in little things 
That you can hardly see 
Like honeycomb and spider webs 
And starfish in the sea 

I believe in little things 
Like icy drops of rain 
That melt into the morning mist 
When winds are warm again 

I believe in little things 
Like colors in the sky 
And noticing the waves roll in 
And how the flowers die 

Knowing they'll be back again 
Whenever it's July 

I believe in little things 
Like you and me 
And just how big 
Little things can be",Little Things,1993

Sweeping the clouds away
On my way to where the air is sweet

Joe Reilly,"Don't look so sad
I know it's over
But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad
We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time
For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness
When you leave me

Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me
One more time",Good Night,2011

And a dress for Josephine.

I asked her could we meet

Joe Reisman,"You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
I am happy with the Lord

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where all good people go to pray
I prayed the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

I searched and I searched but I couldn't find
No way on earth to find peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
Yes, we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord

You'll search and you'll search but you'll never find
No way on earth to find peace of mind

Get down on your knees and pray
Then your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find a way",Crying in the Chapel,1999

And loving you, it seems to beat a Rhapsody.

Now when school is over
And the weekend's come
My mind's made up
To have some fun

I call my baby

And I count my loot
I comb my hair and
I brush my suit

Gonna lose my blues
Swing my baby in

Well, as soon as I get
To the sugar shop
I'm gonna grab my baby
And start a hop

Dancing and a jumping
And a carrying on
When the music stops
I'll still be gone

When the hop is over
To the house, I go
I love my baby
And I tell her so

We kiss goodnight
And my head, I lose
And I bound away
In my rocking shoes

Joe Reisman's Orchestra,"You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
I am happy with the Lord

Just a plain and simple chapel
Where all good people go to pray
I prayed the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

I searched and I searched but I couldn't find
No way on earth to find peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
Yes, we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord

You'll search and you'll search but you'll never find
No way on earth to find peace of mind

Get down on your knees and pray
Then your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find a way",Crying In The Chapel,2002
Joe Reisman's Orchestra,"A boy found a dream upon a distant shore
A maid with a way of whisp'ring ""si senor.""
Each night while guitars would softly play,
The tune seemed to dance 'round the words that he'd say:

Amapola, my pretty little poppy
You're like that lovely flow'r so sweet and heavenly,
Since I found you, my heart is wrapped around you
And loving you, it seems to beat a Rhapsody.

Amapola, the pretty little poppy
Must copy it's endearing charm from you.
Amapola, Amapola, how I long to hear you say ""I love you.""

Once more to repeat what his heart had to say",Amapola,2005

That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending

With one small step upon the stair

If you were a king up there on your throne
Would you be wise enough to let me go
For this queen you think you own
Wants to be a hunter again

Wants to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again
So let me go

The T.V's on, the sound is down

Wants to be a hunter again
Wants to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again

Let me leave

For the crown you've placed upon my head feels too heavy now

I want to see the world alone again

Joe Sample,"I guess I flew too high
Icarus falling from the sky
But in the dense rainforest heat
Somehow I landed on my feet
With the will to survive

And in the heart of darkness
Without a chance of rescue
I never quit, I just refused
I thought of you
Somehow I know I'd find you
Following my heart's compass
And your love
Your love was leading me back to you
Now the ordeal is over
Now I can feel your heartbeat
And your love
Your love is leading me back to you

Daylight began to show
A jungle painted by Rousseau
I walked around in circles lost
Above the spidermonkeys laughed
At my failure below

And in the heart of darkness
Without a chance of rescue
I never quit, I just refused
I thought of you
Somehow I know I'd find you
Following my heart's compass
And your love
Your love was leading me back to you
Now the ordeal is over
Now I can feel your heartbeat
And your love
Your love is leading me back to you

Some people think you've got to live your life one way
I disagree
I'm not gonna pay attention to them anyway
It's got nothin', Nothin' to do with me

Life is so short, We've got
Not time to waste at all

I just wanna ride
Get on my bike and ride
I just wanna ride

Don't want 'em anymore

If I could turn back the hands of time you know I would

Better keep movin', blend in with the crowd
I can't believe I'm acting like a child
One thing I know your driving me wild

I got something on my mind
How did we get here? Where are we going?
Why is life so hard

I read the stories, see the photographs
World's a crazy space
Got to hold on to my dreams
There's just no other place
There's just no other place

I believe
We can change anything
I believe
We can rise above it
I believe
There's a reason for everything
I believe
In my dream

I've seen the shadows, of the living
I've seen them turn and walk away
And I keep searching, for the right words
To send these thoughts away

There's a picture, I like to look at
A picture of a beautiful face
And I see something, in her eyes
Sends me to a better place
Sends me to a better place

Joe Satriani,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water,2005
Joe Satriani,"You tell me what you're never gonna be
And I'll show you what you just can't see

If you don't, then don't bother making no plans

Seeing what you want to see

Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain
Unchain your brain

You won't get nothing if you got no wheels
If you got no wheels you'll never know how it feels
There's no reason for the things you said
Don't get moving you'll pretty soon be dead, dead and forgotten

Free living the life of a king
You can't have everything

One step back and you're out of the heat
There's just one thing when you set yourself free
You have a good time boy but watch out for me

Joe Satriani,"(Hello, mirror, so glad to see you, my friend, it's been a while)

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage run through my head
Patterns of my live have thawed and torn me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament
Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends
Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this un-swept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are halfway through.
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.
We will comprehend the word serenity, and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone.
We will see how our experience can benefit others.
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.
We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.
Self-seeking will slip away.
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.
Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us.
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.
Are these extravagant promises? We think not.
They have been fulfilled amongst others
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.
We will always be true to our principles.

You're only as sick as your secrets
But the truth shall set you free.
The truth is the truth.
That's all you can do is live with it.",Repentance,2007

'Cause they don't know about the business we be handling (But let em know!)
Constant hits keep em scrambling
Till the stores, till the shelves dismantlin' (And?)
And what's that joint ninth sampling?
Pooh and 'Te on the mic, them bastards them, (Damn!)
And your women, we attractin' them
And if you ever wanna know what's happening
We tell 'em

It's Joe Scudda!

I wake up every morning, holding my dick
Going through life like I know I'm the shit, ya ain't fucking with me
So why try? Why go that route?
Why take that street? You can't take that heat?
Man your whole flow weak, we will take that beat
Put our own words on it, we will make that street
To the crowds and the masses, and all I ask is
Don't settle for the average, rap cabbage-
Heads; yeah you heard what I said, we the best here
'Cause our worst days be better than your best years
We your worst fears
So get up, get out, and get somethin'
Man, its only getting worse here

And we here forever so understand me

Joe Scudda,"Hey, you know what?
That lil' stuff between your legs ain't gon' keep me
And neither is you callin' me every five minutes
Like you need to know what I be doin'
I'm at where I'm at, and I'mma be where I'mma be
And that's about all you need to know
And you need to use your inside voice when you talk to me
'Cause all that raisin' your voice to me in front of your friends
In the car on your cell phone,
It's not hot, it's not cute, and it ain't gettin' you nowhere
And it's about to get you fired
So, calm it down

She thought that making me wait was the way to get me hooked
Now, fellas we all know that's the oldest trick in the book
What you do, you wait around, wait until she break down
One day at the crib, she gonna let you break ground
Soon found out she was so real with it
One year, no love man who would deal with it
Me? I fell for it, romancin', financin'
A couple years back I would've told you there was no chance in hell
But oh well, here I was
That's how it be when you're falling in,
Uhm, I wouldn't say that
Well, maybe it was
Them trips to the Gentleman's Club...oh well
They made me feel like I was givin' but I was gettin' back
Man that story 'bout the cow and the milk ain't a fact
'Cause if you wait too long, the milk goes sour
And I like my love hot, no more cold showers

So, silly little girl, simple little girl
You didn't want me when I want you, you
I'm on them other girls, I don't want you in my would
And there's not a single thing that you can do, do
You're playin' on my phone, and you won't leave me alone
I think it's finally time for you to get a clue, clue
You told all your friends about the time we used to spend
And I'm 'bout to run it all throughout your crew, crew

Ooh, I called Pam
You know the one who always liked me
You tried to tell her that I had a drip just to spite me
But she didn't buy, guess what?
We're down to tryin'
And we did a lot more than kiss, I can't deny it
I took her to the Hyatt, tied her to the terry
Took Tasha to the Hyatt, oh yeah I went there again
And starin' in my windows, it's just not hot
Always knew you were a freak, never knew you liked to watch
And I'mma call the cops next time you come to my job
And my new girlfriend, she from the hood, she kind of suave
When she take out them earrings, crunch time--punch time
Believe me, I know, let me tell you 'bout this one time
I came home late, didn't call, wait that's not the point
She gets in another fight, she goin' back to the joint
So, don't waste your time, we both know you can't fight
Now, quit hidin' in the bushes and go home, goodnight

Yo, I knew this silly chick was diggin' me
I told her I had a girl, but if you keep it on the low, you can get with me
See I done switched the game up
Now she ask when I'mma leave her
Leave her? You know the answer last time that came up

Why you keep stressin'? Just keep undressin'
This a headache, man I swear I never learn my lesson
Told myself about these undercover villains
All these silly chicks end up always catchin' feelin's
And what am I 'sposed to do when a late night freak in the jeep
End up gettin' a little too close to you
Close to who? Close to me?
Nah, my little thing on the side, this ain't how it's 'sposed to be
Supposed to hit it (hit it), quit it (quit it), and hit it again
Chill for a while then flip it again
But she started acting crazy I split to the ends
She told her girl how I get down, now I'm hittin' her friend

So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love,2006

Joe Shulman,"Why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine
Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you

We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me

So Joe Sinistr came through the armed recruit to blank crews 
My six will fix another one greedy 
For real, let's peel they hats back for deal slow 
And we'll catch clown, with they pants down real low
The screwball better work a RuPaul and switch fast 
Or we'll be in the cornfield, killin your bitch ass 
And Timb's roam through bad bad odor but it is home 
Wild flex and more sex than Mad Cobra 
So take it easy ?just to mash a kraut? mine's the cheesiest 
And I'm sworn to keep their eyes on more than CBS

I mob just any nigga, I don't care who he 
I still get doughs, takin off bitches Girbauds 
And lamp with Erick, a champ merit cause I flip foes 
See these screws loose, I repeat, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice

Crowd participation 
Shit, I'm so upset, I feel like snappin niggaz neck 
But I'ma chill and let Joe get wreck

The funk dog as I come low to piss on hydrants 
And howl at half moons and White Owls and mad tunes 
Live quite fowl, leavin Lifestyles in bitches bathrooms

My style is more Fear-ed than Black Planets 
And I fuck your shit, suck my dick for explicit 
I let clips at your name, pay rent in your brain 
And I gets wicked, wick-wick-wicked 
And keeps a full clip in case the bullets get evicted 
And now to twirl up the fat nigga, seek psychiatric 
I devour worlds and Galactus 
I gets mean troop, grabbin Christine around the block 
At sixteen, spittin the green pea soup 
And cock nines, when niggaz got slime, the only men 
Puffin Nick Nick Nick's- with -elodeon

And it could be you tomorrow night, telling how it use to be.

Cause it was whiskey talking to her Lord
I swear it wasn't me
But a man who drinks,
He never thinks how it's gonna be.

Joe Stampley,"Who was once a bull-hooking son of a gun
Now who keeps a pint hid out behind chute number one
Who was riding high till a pretty girl rode him to the ground
Any kid knows where to find me, I'm Bandy the rodeo clown

In the riding and the roping I was closing in on number one
Now in dreams at night I ride on that silver saddle I never won
Since she left me the whiskey takes me to the rodeo grounds
Where the cowboys think I'm handy, I'm Bandy the rodeo clown

I could ride em all the bulls and the broncs knew I was boss
But the ride that woman took me on broke a whole lot more than this old cowboy's bones
While the tears on my makeup melts my painted smile into a frown

A gal like my first ex-wife
You Moan The Blues for me and for you

I have known a few my self
And the gal that loved me half as much
As she loved somebody else.

And the lonesome whistle whine
I know that feel; so cold, so real
When the blues come around at midnight.

Joe Stampley,"I've traveled all around this country
In my time I thought I'd seen it all
But today I took a detour down a back road
Through a little town whose name I can't recall

There were old men on benches playing checkers
Children playing hop scotch on the square
And high above a statue of an unknown soldier
Old glory was waving in the air

Suddenly I realized what I'd too long forgotten
Chill rose up like mountains on my skin
Overcome with a feeling
I knew I was seeing
America all over again

Americana
Picture of a people proud and free
Americana
And I'll keep holding to the dream
You're still what living means to me

I knew the stop would throw me off my schedule
But I parked around behind the Five and Dime
There's something about a small town in the Summer
Like a Norman Rockwell picture back in time

Kids were courting at the Rexall soda fountain
Like we did before they built the shopping mall
I saw so many reasons why I love this country
You know some things never really change at all

As I left the two-lane road
And pulled back on that super high way
I thought of what I'd seen back in that town
And it hit me like a freight train
That a stone's throw from the fast lane
America is still safe and sound",Americana,2000

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1987

Like to burn the fabric
Outta their inner lines
Sheet lightning going down through the pines

Crossing train tracks on switchbacks
Through the lands of the living

The sun glass vision and the golden clef
And the ghetto rod divine which notes are left

Oh brothers I'm talking I'm talking
He's got the solo on a wire
This calls for a flock of angels
To hover over the holy pyre

And the ghetto rod divines which notes are left.

Golden rain it's the piss of Zeus
Mixing with the dead yellow Swing insects juice
Caught in the windshield headlights and sluice

Real people, especially when it's hungry

Final decisions are made by the club
And implemented by the shadow of a glove
And sitting in a coffeehouse reading words
We got popcorn salesmen for protection from the world
Went through extensive preparations
I learned all about the other nations
When freedom was defined as a word in a book
I learned if you're plugged into something then baby you're hooked

Into Gangsterville
I searched for a rose or some sweet juice of water
Gangsterville, people are giving
A black lady sobbed on a step--God bless the little born

On the other hand, sitting next to a evil crew
They just got down from floor eighty-two
Been selling Indian reservations
Coming in looking for some jazz and a little libations
I like the same kind of beer
I gotta get right out of here
I'm going to New Orleans--gonna buy me a prayer
Gonna call somebody from a call box there

Bring your money to the shore
No automatic weapons on the jetty
Oh Gangsterville, electro shields on the phalanx
Club the Mayor in the streets, it's a chewable fecie

Got enough shrinks working on us
To defy paralysis, identify analysis
Just wanna hold my carburetor bible
Snapping to attention, eyes on the horizon
Keep your filter clean, wipe the oil from your dreams
Keep our hopes pinned to the Southern Cross

Go buy a rose at the movies on a train 
Get married by a biker, go hang a priest 
Walk tall with a dwarf and you'll find relief 

Leaning strategically on a Desoto at muscle beach 
A four thousand car pile up made the freeway screech 
Not talking about rubber but stereos 
And the loudest one drilling was for Oreos 

Where was I gonna find you, 
Where was I supposed to look? 
In some glittering diamond in the vallay 
Or in the harpoons or your opium hooks?

There were three armed raids on the bank
And would there be a kiosk at the gates of heaven

In a Coney Island for the blind

And late night barroom brawls
With real or imaginary friends and enemies
Who strike their heads when they fall
On the chassis of a classic Bull Nose special
That adorned our living room wall
Nobody'd be disappointed, if you're the one they wanted
Blazing out across the waterfall

Does it say how to mend a heart

In old Genoa
Behind some dump truck driver's door
There as a lady who was dressed up
Like Marlene before the war
Opinion held that she was ice
Oh but you could glimpse paradise
If you leaned close in the dark
And you told her how to mend a heart

Wait for all the lights,
All the lights in town to go out,
Avoid looking in the mirror
Turn the car and go south
Follow the Pole Star
Until she changes her petticoat
Check into a desert motel
And let the dam in the waters go broke

Joe Strummer,"[Chorus]
Gonna take a nitcomb 
To get rid of me 
Cause I just realized 
That it was meant to be 

And I'm singing 
To all the torn betting slips 
Flying around my feet 
I'm talking to all the chewing gum 
That's stuck everywhere on the street 

And they're ringing the bells 
All over the city 
On a Saturday night 
Nobody knows why 
But they know its gonna be alright 

[Chorus]

And I'm standing at the sale 
Of the shoes of bankrupt men 
I just had to buy a pair 
To show I can live again 

And they're ringing the bells 
All over the city 
On a Saturday night 
Nobody knows why 
But they know its gonna be alright 

[Chorus]

And they're banging 
On the sheets of metal and sheets of gold 
And these were the finest shoes 
That were ever sold 
It's raining on roofs 
And raining on drums 
Love buys a six-pack 
And gives it to the bums 

And they're ringing the bells 
All over the city

Nobody knows why 
But they know its gonna be alright",Nitcomb,1999

Blowing off old Parchman farm
On the road to rock 'n' roll
They'll try to hook you by the eye
There's a mirror in your soul
You should turn it to the sky

On the road to rock 'n' roll
The lonely sing a soulful song
Leave a little light in the wilderness
For somebody to come upon
On the road to rock 'n' roll
With everybody deep in their dreams
And the snow is falling on the city
Ask the music what it means

Joe Strummer,"Well it was a techno D-day out on Omaha beach 
I was a reserve D.J. playing Colombian mountain beats 
Andres Landero, ay mi sombrero 
Hold onto your hats, we gotta go

Because the noise inspectors with the sound detectors 
Were coming on down the beach 
And the counselors wanna pounce on us
There we go disturbing the peace 
And the Cornish sun had only just begun
To sink into the western sea 
So to keep it low so the cops don't know
I spun my Harry Belafonte 

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

On a techno D-day, a techno D-day
Out on Omaha beach
Where the troops believe in a life of freedom
And this is all about free speech

The day became night by the campfire light
The crowd began testifying
Using the headphones for a mike, for tenor saw's delight
I sang another new sound is dying

On a techno D-day, a techno D-day
Where the long arm of the law cannot reach
On a techno D-day, a techno D-day
We waited on Omaha beach
We waited and we waited

Behind me in the booth was the techno crew
Ready with the crucial beats
Still, they said keep it low, spin your calypso
We're waiting for Babylon to retreat
The crowd was ready to riot, they were sick of being quiet
We're still waiting for the signal to go
Then the walkie talkie gear spat out the all clear
And the boys hit the decks in full flow, go, g-g-go

It was a techno D-day, a techno D-day
Way out on Omaha beach
Where the troops believe in a life of freedom
And this is all about free speech

Tonight there was a power cut in the city of madness 
And all conversations died in the burst of a solar flare 
In the darkness an angel won the beauty pagent 
Stroboscopic snowflakes fell from the stratosphere
And all the neon blew down funky Broadway 
And shorted out the eastern shore 
Only saxophones and beach trombones 
We're left to shout out, 
""We all need a little more.""

Joe Strummer,"Sometimes there's no star shining 
Scouting the edge of the universe 
Sometimes you can't see the horizon 
Between the ocean and the earth 

And just when you're thinking about slinkin' down 
I'm gonna pull you up ? I'm gonna pull ya round 
May I remind you of that scene 
The spirit is our gasoline 
May I remind you of that scene 
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen 
May I remind you of that scene 
Let a million mirror balls beam 
May I remind you of that scene 

And you say ? living ain't nothing but hassles? 
In a Manilla envelope rain 
And driving coal all-night to Newcastle 
It's getting to be a repetative strain 
And just when you're thinking about 
Going down the drain ? 

May I remind you of that scene 
The spirit is our gasoline 
May I remind you of that scene 
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen 
May I remind you of that scene

Nor can they count their numbered days

And the late news breaks early

Joe Strummer,"I was crawling through a festival way out west 
I was thinking about love and the acid test 
But first I got real dizzy with a real rocking gang 
Then I saw the Coma Girl and the excitement gang 

And the rain came in from the wide blue yonder 
Through all the stages I wandered 

Coma Girl and the excitement gang 
Mona Lisa on the motorcycle gang 
Coma Girl
Coma Girl 
Coma Girl was beating with the Oil Drum gang 
Some fast food fanatic was burning down the burger van 
Somebody was wailing off their head 
Nobody was ripping the teen scene dead 

And the rain came in from the wide blue yonder 
I thought you and me might wander 
Chorus 

As the nineteenth hour was falling upon Desolation Row 
Some outlaw band had the last drop on the go 
Let's siphon up some gas let's get this show on the road 
Said the Coma Girl to the excitement gang 

Into action everybody sprang 
The oil drums were beating out dulang dulang

Joe Strummer,"Once I got to the mountain top, everywhere I could see
Prairie full of lost souls running from the priests of iniquity
Where the hell was Elijah
What do you do when the prophecy came was true

You cannot take the walls of Jericho
Put your lips together and blow
To the very top
Sayin' the truth crystallizes it like jewels in the rock, in the rock

Get down Moses - part another sea
Carve another tablet out of L.S.D.
Get down Moses - out in Tennessee
Get down Moses - down in the street
The blood washing down all the gravel to our feet
Get down Moses - down in the pit

Lying in a green, cross bound field
Crashing on a downtown strip
Looking in the eyes of the diamonds and the spies and the hip
Who's sponsoring the crack ghetto
Who's lecturing who's in the know and in the don't know

You better take the walls of Jericho
Put your lips together and blow
Goin' to the very top
Where the truth crystallizes like jewels, in the rock, in the rock

Get down Moses - from the eagle eyrie
You gotta to make new friends out of old enemies
Get down Moses - back in Tennessee
Get down Moses - down with the dreads
They got a lotta reasoning in a dread head
Get down Moses - down in the street
Get down Moses

Get down Moses - part another sea
Carve another tablet out of L.S.D.

Joe Strummer,"Well I'll tell you one thing that I know
You don't face your demons down 
You gotta grapple 'em Jack and pin 'em to the ground
The devil may care, maybe god he won't
You better make sure you check on the do's and the don'ts

Crawl up a mountain 
To reach where the eagles fly
To show you can glimpse from the mountian top 
Where the soul of the muse might ride

And if you put it all together
You won't have to look around
You know you cast a long shadow on the ground

Then one day I could tell my tracks
About the holes in the soles of my shoes
And that's the day I said I'm gonna make the news

And fallen back in the garden
The days so long ago
Somewhere in the memory 
The sun shines on you boy

And playing in the Arroyo's
Where the American rivers flow
From the Appalachians 
Down to the Delta Roads

A man can think so long 
His brain could well explode
The strings runnin' through the junctions 
A king comes down the road

And if you put it all together
You won't have to look around
You know you cast a long shadow on the ground

Listen to the country
The night jar and the bell
Listen to the night stream lineup 
Soundin' like the wolves of hell

Head for the water
The waters of the cleansing spell
It was always our destination
On the express of the never do wells

And we rocked through Madison's city
And we didn't even know she was there
And when we hit the bumpers in Memphis
Beale street didn't have no prayer

And I hear punks talk of anarchy
I hear hobo's on the railroads
I hear mutterings on the chain gangs
It was those men who built the roads

And if you put it all together 
You didn't even once relent
You cast a long shadow
And that is your testament

Somewhere in my soul
There's always rock and roll

Can find anywhere in the world

The hope of a new century comes 
Was it all the amphetamine presidents 
And their busy wives 
Or did Manhattan crumble 
The day Marlyn died 

All your life, dreamer of dreams 
Somehow connected with the silver screen 
Half closed eyes, you realize 
Loving the life that is paradise 
And the Technicolor 
I dream a parade like some club house 
Club house serenade 
Every dog must have his day 

Ramshackle Day Parade 
We're going on though 

This is the ramshackle day parade 
Of all those lost, unborn, and unmade 
And who's heads got filled with a neon lava 
And remain buried underneath this road 
Ramshackle Day Parade 

Taken' the freight elevator 
And the incinerator 
To the hopped up G-men riding 
Refrigerated alligators 
Faces of the civil wars, and holograms holding 44's

Bring out the banners of Stalingrad 
Here come the marching band

Joe Strummer,"Some dreams are made for children
But most grow old with us
And when the air can hope to hold on
And to the ground from dust to rust

Burning lights in the desert
Such a sign only you would know
Your running tires, they're out of pressure
Such a sign only you would know

And I've been a long haul driver
Moving things but the cops don't know
Now I can see the writing
You are the last of the buffalo

Burning lights in the desert
Such a sign only you would know
Your running tires, they're out of pressure

When I realize I've left no trace

All deaf to protests while the attackers fled

Joe Strummer & the Mescaleros,"Sometimes there's no star shining 
Scouting the edge of the universe 
Sometimes you can't see the horizon 
Between the ocean and the earth 

And just when you're thinking about slinkin' down 
I'm gonna pull you up ? I'm gonna pull ya round 
May I remind you of that scene 
The spirit is our gasoline 
May I remind you of that scene 
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen 
May I remind you of that scene 
Let a million mirror balls beam 
May I remind you of that scene 

And you say ? living ain't nothing but hassles? 
In a Manilla envelope rain 
And driving coal all-night to Newcastle 
It's getting to be a repetative strain 
And just when you're thinking about 
Going down the drain ? 

May I remind you of that scene 
The spirit is our gasoline 
May I remind you of that scene 
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen 
May I remind you of that scene 
Let a million mirror balls beam 
May I remind you of that scene 

I'm gonna pull you up ? I'm gonna pull ya round

Nor can they count their numbered days 
No flower can says what perfume is 
We got all this and Bird and Diz

Joe Strummer & the Mescaleros,"Once I got to the mountain top, everywhere I could see
Prairie full of lost souls running from the priests of iniquity
Where the hell was Elijah
What do you do when the prophecy came was true

You cannot take the walls of Jericho
Put your lips together and blow
To the very top
Sayin' the truth crystallizes it like jewels in the rock, in the rock

Get down Moses - part another sea
Carve another tablet out of L.S.D.
Get down Moses - out in Tennessee
Get down Moses - down in the street
The blood washing down all the gravel to our feet
Get down Moses - down in the pit

Lying in a green, cross bound field
Crashing on a downtown strip
Looking in the eyes of the diamonds and the spies and the hip
Who's sponsoring the crack ghetto
Who's lecturing who's in the know and in the don't know

You better take the walls of Jericho
Put your lips together and blow
Goin' to the very top
Where the truth crystallizes like jewels, in the rock, in the rock

You gotta to make new friends out of old enemies
Get down Moses - back in Tennessee
Get down Moses - down with the dreads

Joe Strummer & the Mescaleros,"Well I'll tell you one thing that I know
You don't face your demons down 
You gotta grapple 'em Jack and pin 'em to the ground
The devil may care, maybe god he won't
You better make sure you check on the do's and the don'ts

Crawl up a mountain 
To reach where the eagles fly
To show you can glimpse from the mountian top 
Where the soul of the muse might ride

And if you put it all together
You won't have to look around
You know you cast a long shadow on the ground

Then one day I could tell my tracks
About the holes in the soles of my shoes
And that's the day I said I'm gonna make the news

And fallen back in the garden
The days so long ago
Somewhere in the memory 
The sun shines on you boy

And playing in the Arroyo's
Where the American rivers flow
From the Appalachians 
Down to the Delta Roads

A man can think so long 
His brain could well explode
The strings runnin' through the junctions 
A king comes down the road

And if you put it all together
You won't have to look around
You know you cast a long shadow on the ground

Listen to the country
The night jar and the bell
Listen to the night stream lineup 
Soundin' like the wolves of hell

Head for the water
The waters of the cleansing spell
It was always our destination
On the express of the never do wells

And we rocked through Madison's city
And we didn't even know she was there
And when we hit the bumpers in Memphis
Beale street didn't have no prayer

And I hear punks talk of anarchy
I hear hobo's on the railroads
I hear mutterings on the chain gangs
It was those men who built the roads

And if you put it all together 
You didn't even once relent
You cast a long shadow
And that is your testament

Somewhere in my soul
There's always rock and roll

Half closed eyes, you realize 
Loving the life that is paradise

Taken' the freight elevator 
And the incinerator 
To the hopped up G-men riding 
Refrigerated alligators 
Faces of the civil wars, and holograms holding 44's

Why it should be thus all the day long

Leaving our home so lonely and dreary
Then do we wonder why others prosper

Life was so bright and gay everything complete
But I fell for another who led my life astray
So I'll live in sorrow till my dying day

Down the highway of sorrow I'm traveling alone
I've lost all my true friends I've lost a happy home
I'm heading for destruction I'm on the wrong track
Down the highway of sorrow there's no turning back

I went back to my darling I got down on my knees
I begged her with tear rimmed eyes to give my poor heart ease
But she was hurt so deeply she could not forgive
So I'll live in sorrow as I long as I live",Highway of Sorrow,1991

They're ringin' for you and for me
Let's all kneel down at the altar
And pray that our souls might be free.

I'll meet you in church Sunday morning
And we'll all kneel down and pray
We'll pray to our Lord up in heaven
To guide us safe home on our way.

It's a place where we all meet on Sunday
To worship our Lord up above
And let all of our sins be forgiven
And meet with our loved ones above.

In heaven I hear a voice callin'
From the land where there's one endless day
Let's all be prepared to meet Jesus
The path is narrow to that home far away.

since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.
 
Fool am I to hear a old love song.
And wanna cry but the melody keeps haunting me 
reminding me how in love we used to be.
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart saying together forever.

In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids

No football hero or smooth Don Juan

Joe Tex,"Girls listen, I'm gonna cool you cooks to something
Listen to this
Men are gettin scarce girls
They're gettin' scarce as hen's teeth, yeah

Men are gettin' scarce girls
Gettin' scarce as hen's teeth, yeah
There used to be a time
When a woman could get a man with just her charms

Now in order for a woman to get a man
She gotta, she gotta take him
She gotta take him, she gotta take him
She gotta take him right out of another woman's arms

Men are gettin scarce girls
Oh their gettin' scarce girls
Gettin' scarce as hen's teeth,(ha ha)
And that's mighty scarce

Listen to this
I was talkin' to this woman the other day
Now she said, she was gonna quit her man
'Cause he's got a raggedy car

Can you get to that, look here, huh
Women are funny though
Every time her car is runnin' good
They say chile, that's my car

Soon as it gets to runnin' bad
She say ah I don't want that old car
That's his car
Listen she gonna say to me

She said the other day, she said
It runs hot, it burns oil
This old car is beat and rundown
The other day the battery fell dead

Right in the heart of town, embarrassin' me
Let me tell you one thing baby
You tell that man to get a tune up on that car
Get a new set of spark plugs, some brand new tires

And a new water pump and you keep that man
'Cause let me tell you one thing right now
Men are gettin scarce girls
Ah their gettin' scarce girls

They're gettin' scarce as hen's teeth
And that's mighty scarce
Hold it band, hold it, hold it a minute
Say Miss Lady, now you just gonna sit there at that table

And eat all the barbecue and ain't gonna give me none
Say what? Oh not you again
Say LeRoy, here's this woman with them skinny legs again
She got a greasy mouth this time

Come over here and get this greasy mouth woman
She reminds me of them folks up in Navisoda, Texas
Eatin' barbecue and drinkin' red soda water on the 19th of June
Look here, give me a piece of that barbecue

And kiss me with your greasy mouth
I was talkin' to this woman the other day
Now here's a woman that was gonna quit her man
'Cause he wasn't makin' enough money on his job

Talkin' 'bout how much tax Uncle Sam take out of his money
She went on to say something like this
She say they take tax and more tax and they keep on takin' that tax
Why he take so much money from my man

We ain't got enough to relax
Well let me tell you one thing baby
You let that man stay on that ole measely job
And let him keep bringin' home that little 72.50 every week

And you keep that man
'Cause Uncle Sam is gonna get his baby
Don't you worry about that

Joe Tex,"You'd better hold on, hold on to what you've got
You'd better hold on, hold on to what you've got
'Cause if you think nobody wants it
Just throw it away and you will see
Someone will have it before you can count one, two, three
Yes they will, yes they will
Listen fellows, you know it's not all the time
That a man can have a good woman
A women he can call his very own
A woman who will stay right there at home
And mind the children while he's gone to work
A woman who will have his dinner cooked
When he comes home
Where some men make mistakes is
When they go out and stay because they feel
That no other man wants his woman but him??
But listen, if you think no other man wants her
Just throw her away and you will see
Some men will have her before you can count one, two, three
Yes he will, yes he will

Listen girls, this goes for you too
Because you know I've seen so many women who've had so many good men in life
Men who would stand by them through thick and thin
Men who'd go to work everyday and
Bring home their hard earned pay
Men who'd give their woman anything
That their little hearts desired
Where some women make mistakes is
When their men go out and let 'em play they would stay
Because they felt that no other woman wanted him but her
Listen, if you think no other woman wants him
Just pitch him out in the street and you will see
Some woman will have your man
Before you can count one, two, three
Yes she will, yes she will",Hold What You've Got,1995

May just be passing fancies and in time may go

Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Joe Thayer,"You make me feel so young
You make me feel as though spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy in-div-dual

The moment that you speak 
I wanna go play hide and seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots 
Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young 
You make me feel there are songs to be sung Bells to be rung 
And a wonderful spring to be sprung
And even when I'm old and gray 
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cos you make me feel so young",You Make Me Feel So Young,2010

Joe Thomas,"You're a black butterfly
With your wings frayed and torn,
Laughter's your's so is scorn
As they point to you in shame. 
You're a black butterfly
With your wings near fire,
But confess when your tire,
Is the candle worth the flame?
Your Queen of the Night
But with morning's early light
There's not a hear to really call your own;
So before it's too late, 
Change your ways and repent,
Take my love that was meant
For black butterfly along.

She didn't say no

I leave it to you
She did just what you'd do too

She didn't say yes
She didn't say no
For heaven was near
She wanted it so

Above her sweet love was beckoning
And yet she knew there'd be a reckoning

She wanted to climb
But dreaded to fall
So bided her time
And clung to the wall

But feared to lose her equilibrium

I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Are still around us

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings
