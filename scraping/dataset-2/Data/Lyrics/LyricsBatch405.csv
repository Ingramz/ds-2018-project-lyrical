James Carter,"I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once use to be
And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring 
I can't believe their song
Once love was king but kings can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same never be the same again
 
I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once use to be
And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring 
I can't believe their song
Once love was king but kings can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside",I'll Never Be the Same,2000
James Carter,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know,2003
James Carter And The Prisoners,"One evening as the sun went down
And the jungle fire  was burning,
Down the track came a hobo hiking,
And he said, ""Boys, I'm not turning
I'm headed for a land that's far away
Besides the crystal fountains
So come with me, we'll go and see
The Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
There's a land that's fair and bright,
Where the handouts grow on bushes
And you sleep out every night
Where the boxcars all are empty
And the sun shines every day
On the birds and the bees
And the cigarette trees
The lemonade springs
Where the bluebird sings
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
All the cops have wooden legs
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
The farmers' trees are full of fruit
And the barns are full of hay
Oh I'm bound to go
Where there ain't no snow
Where the rain don't fall
The wind don't blow
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
You never change your socks
And the little streams of alcohol
Come trickling down the rocks
The brakemen have to tip their hats
And the railroad bulls are blind
There's a lake of stew
And of whiskey, too
You can paddle all around 'em
In a big canoe
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
The jails are made of tin
And you can walk right out again,
As soon as you are in
There ain't no short-handled shovels,
No axes, saws or picks,
I'ma goin' to stay
Where you sleep all day,
Where they hung the Turk
That invented work
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

I'll see you all this coming Fall
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains""",Big Rock Candy Mountain,2000
James Carter Organ Trio,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misterio,2011
James Carter Organ Trio,"Woke up this morning, felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old walking blues
I woke up this morning, felt around, felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old, mean old walking blues

Leaving in the morning if I have to, robbed blind
Ive been mistreated and I don't mind dying
I'm leaving in the morning if I have to, robbed blind
Ive been mistreated and I just don't mind dying

She got a Belgium movement from her head down to her toes
Breaking on a dollar most anywhere she goes

Well I got a good woman coming my way
Tried to try, some electric panting, some electric chilling crying
But, ooh, mistook, misgiven
Got me up and walking baby, but I'm walking blue, walking blue

Well some people say boy, the walking blues ain't bad
It's the worst old feeling I most ever had",The Walking Blues,2011
James Chance,"I feel good 
I knew that I would now
So good 
So good 

I've got you
I feel nice 
Like sugar and spice

So nice 
So nice 
I've got you

When I hold in my arms
I know that you do me no harm",I Got You (I Feel Good),1981
James Chance,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic,1981
James Chance,"I walk along the street of sorrow
The boulevard of broken dreams
Where gigolo and gigolette
Can take a kiss without regret
So they forget their broken dreams

You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow
When you behold your shattered schemes
Gigolo and gigolette
Wake up to find their eyes are wet
With tears that tell of broken dreams

Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down
But I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town

The joy that you find here you borrow
You cannot keep it long it seems
Gigolo and gigolette
Still sing a song and dance along
The boulevard of broken dreams

Here is where you'll always find me
Always walking up and down
For I left my soul behind me
In an old cathedral town

The joy that you find here you borrow
You cannot keep it long it seems
But gigolo and gigolette
Still sing a song and dance along
The boulevard of broken dreams",My Infatuation,2003

James Chatburn,"Life tempo unsustainable
Try memo all my days in full
Time encroach 'til I can’t escape it all
Or die in the hope of the unobtainable
Drivin' this road's like lucid dreamin'
Sleep through the daytime, fly through the evening
If idol dreaming give life to my demons
Then please don't wake me, I'll die while I'm sleepin'
Man I swore I never been here before
This tour's like a storm, blew me up on the shore
Don't know if I'm coming or going or who's runnin' this show
And whether it's curtains or encore
And everyday I spend in space and dimension
Feelin' like I snap so frayed from the tension
Breaking the connection, chasing my redemption
Looking in the wrong place for perfection
I brought a piece of the road into the peace of our home
You the cornerstone of every bit of peace that I've known
But this fever to roam, I can't leave it alone
It claws at my flesh and it's deep in my bones
The music brought me back to life
But it was you that wore the sacrifice
Lost time, lost sleep, lost point of view
Lost high, lost me, lost all but you

If we go higher
Tryna tame the clouds
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Lost in the night rain
Only way is down
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Still we go higher
Tryna sate this thirst
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
'Til we fly into the sun
And fall in flames to Earth
Earth, Earth
Ooo-ooo-oo

Higher
Higher
Higher
Ooooh

She used to say
You make me wanna run to you
I'm so proud of your accomplishments
Looked at me like I had hung the moon
Now she looks at me like I'm blockin' it
'Cause when you're deep on a tour, no rest
Not feeling human, like you failed the Turing test
She don't want you to bounce too soon man
I feel like Andy Kaufman, the Man on the Moon, and
When I'm feelin' half-human
I'm still hard to kill like Vents and Rasputin
And when life put the boot in
You gotta hit 'em with the fire, Street Fighter, Hadouken
Twenty-four-seven ride the clouds on a seven-four-seven
Lights out? Damn
I’ve never felt more present than I have right now
Shook to life by the landing gear
Inflight radio playin' Chandelier
Now I'm standin' here with no standing room
Waiting on an old man to grab a bag or two
Then he tipped his hat and asked what I do
I said 'dude this is what I do'
And I'mma be consumed by all this so called fun
I'mma burn up soon tryna touch the sun

If we go higher
Tryna tame the clouds
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo
Lost in the night rain
Only way is down
Ooo-ooo-ooo-oo

James Chirillo,"Its not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

It isn't your sweet conversation 
That brings this sensation, oh no 
Its just the nearness of you 

When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me 
All my wildest dreams come true 

I need no soft lights to enchant me 
If you'll only grant me the right 
To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",The Nearness of You,1994
James Chirillo,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1999
James Chirillo,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

James Chirillo,"Took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, 
I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.
She didn't mean it, 
I should have seen it, 
But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why, 
And wonder why?
I thought I found the gal I could trust, 
What a bust, this is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be just friends?""",Can't We Be Friends?,2000
James Chirillo,"Samantha, you're all
I'll ever adore,
So forgive me, do,
If I say to you
What I've said so often before.

I love you, Samantha,
And my love will never die.
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one-gal guy.
Together, Samantha,
We could ride a star and ride it high.
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one-gal guy.
And if some distant day
You decided to say,
""Get along, go away, goodbye!""
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one-gal guy.
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one gal guy.","I Love You, Samantha",2000
James Chirillo,"I'm always chasing rainbows
Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometimes
I never even make a gain
Believe me, I'm always chasing rainbows
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain
 
I'm always chasing rainbows
Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky

I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometimes
I never even make a gain
Believe me, I'm always chasing rainbows
",I'm Always Chasing Rainbows,2000
James Chirillo,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender

James Christian,"I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race? A prettier face!
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game is not the same 
No way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take

Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy
What a kick just a buddy and me
We had every big shot good-time band on the run boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race
Got out of the place
I went back home got a brand new face
For the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change
Oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll be back again
I just hope you understand 
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take
Freedom
You've gotta give for what you take

Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get

I say that's what you get

That's what you get for changing your mind

And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes
Do not make the man

I'll hold on to my freedom
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now 
I've got to live",Freedom,1996
James Christian,"Take me to that place, higher
Go, hold on, go
(Take me higher)
(Take me higher)

In my mind I see the possibilities
When it comes to love there are no boundaries
Do you think that you and I can work it out
That's what true love's about
Baby we can find an answer if we look inside our hearts
Love will be there waiting for us
Baby we can rise above it if we leave our doubts behind us
We can learn to fly high above us

There's a place up in the sky
Where the sun is shining
Take me higher
(Take me higher)
There's a place I long to be
Where the birds are flying
Take me higher
(Take me higher)

See it on the news, there's trouble everywhere
Gotta reach out show somebody that you care
It ain't good to let the bad news get us down
Let's spread some love around
Even if you want to go there, to a place above the clouds
Got to feel the power of love
Baby we can rise above it if we leave our doubts behind
We can learn to fly high above us

There's a place up in the sky
Where the sun is shining
Take me higher

James Christian,"Everyday I hear a different story,
People saying that you're no good for me,
""Saw your lover with another and she's making a fool of you""

If you loved me baby you'd deny it,
But you laugh and tell me I should try it,
Tell me I'm a baby, and I don't understand

But you know that I'll forgive you,
Just this once, twice, forever,
'Cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back,
Just as long as we're together.
And you do

[Chorus]
I don't want your freedom,
I don't want to play around,
I don't want nobody baby,
Part time love just brings me down.
I don't want your freedom,
Girl, all I want right now is you.

Like a prisoner who has his own key
But I can't escape until you love me
I just go from day to day knowing all about the other boys
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool to give you all that I do
I bet you someday baby someone says the same to you
But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once twice forever
'cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do

James Christian,"For awhile, to love was all we could do 
We were young and we knew 
In our eyes were alive 
Deep inside we knew our love was true 
For awhile, we paid no mind to the past 
We knew love would last 
Every night, something right 
Would invite us to begin the day 
Something happened along the way 
What used to be happy was sad 
Something happened along the way 
And yesterday was all we had 
And, oh, after the love has gone 
How could you lead me on 
And not let me stay around  
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone 
What used to be right is wrong 
Can love that's lost be found ? 
For awhile, to love each other with all 
We would ever need 
Love was strong for so long 
Never knew that what was 
Wrong, oh, baby, wasn't right 
We tried to find what we had 
Till sadness was all we shared 
We were scared 
This affair would lead our love into 
Something happened along the way 
Yesterday was all we had 
Something happened along the way 
What used to be happy is sad

You're daring
You're different in the woods
More sure
More sharing
You're getting us through the woods
If you could see
You're not the man who started
And much more openhearted
Than I knew
You to be

It takes two
I thought one was enough
It's not true
It takes two of us
You came through
When the journey was rough
It took you
It took two of us
It takes care
It takes patience and fear and despair
To change
Though you swear
To change
Who can tell if you do
It takes two
It takes two

You've changed
You're thriving
There's something about the woods
Not just
Surviving
You're blossoming in the woods
At home I'd fear
We'd stay the same forever
And then out here
You're passionate
Charming
Considerate
Clever

It takes one
To begin, but then once you've begun
It takes two of you
It's no fun
But what needs to be done
You can do
When there's two of you
If I dare
It's because I'm becoming
Aware of us
As a pair of us
Each accepting a share
Of what's there

We've changed
We're strangers
I'm meeting you in the woods
Who minds
What dangers
I know we'll get past the woods
And once we're past
Let's hope the changes last
Beyond woods
Beyond witches and slippers and hoods
Just the two of us
Beyond lies
Safe at home with our beautiful prize

It takes just
A bit more
And we're done

We had none

I was given those beans!
You persuaded me to trade away
My cow for beans!
And without those beans
There'd have been no stalk
To get up to the giant's
In the first place!

Wait a minute, magic beans
For a cow so old
That you had to tell
A lie to sell it
Which you told!
Were they worthless beans?
Were they oversold?
Oh, and tell us who persuaded you
To steal that gold

See, it's your fault
No!
Yes, it's you fault
No!
Yes, it is!
It's not!
It's true

Wait a minute
But I only stole the gold
To get my cow back
From you!

So it's your fault!
Yes!
No, it isn't!
I'd have kept those beans
But our house was cursed
She made us get the cow to get
The curse reversed!

It's his father's fault
That the curse got placed
And the place got cursed
In the first place!

Oh!
Then it's his fault!
So
It was his fault!
No
Yes, it is
It's his
I guess

Wait a minute, though
I chopped down the beanstalk
Right, that's clear?
But without any beanstalk
Then what's queer
Is how did the second giant get down here
In the first place?
Second place?

Yes!
How?
Hmmm
Well,
Who had the other bean?
The other bean?
The other bean?
You pocketed the other bean
I didn't!
Yes I did
So it's your-
No, it isn't
'Cause I gave it to my wife!
So it's her fault!
No, it isn't!
Then whose is it?
Wait a minute!
She exchanged that bean
To obtain your shoe
So the one who knows what happened
To that bean is you!
You mean that old bean
That your wife, oh, dear
But I never knew,
And so I threw-
Well, don't look here!

So it's your fault!
But-
See, it's her fault!
But-
And it isn't mine at all!
But what?
Well, if you hadn't gone
Back up again
We were needy
You were greedy!
Did you need that hen?
But I got it for my mother!
So it's her fault then!
Yes, and what about the harp
In the third place?
The harp, yes!
She went and dared me to!
I dared you to?
You dared me to!
She said that I was scared
So she dared me!
No, I didn't!
So it's your fault!
Wait a minute!
If you hadn't dared him to
And you had left the harp alone,
We wouldn't be in trouble

In your mind for to forgive her
In walks with another one of your friends through the door

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine

I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

Runnin' across the meadow 
Pickin' up lots of forget me nots

You make me feel so young

If you`re young at heart 
For it`s hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind 
If you`re young at heart 
You can go to extremes with impossible schemes 
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart (as) it seems 
And life gets more exciting with each passing day 
And love is either in your heart or on its way 
 
Don`t you know that it`s worth every treasure on Earth 
To be young at heart 
For as rich as you are it`s much better by far

Look at all you`ll derive out of being alive 
Then here is the best part

But these four walls close in more every day
And I'm dying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a-tumblin' down
I could see it so clearly but you're nowhere around

The nights are lonely the days are so sad and
I just keep thinking about the love that we had
And I'm missing you
And nobody knows it but me

Ooh ooh
Oh nobody knows
Oh no

How blue can I get?
You can ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know I'll be loving you still

James Davis,"There's a letter on the desktop that I dug out of a drawer
The last truce we ever came to in our adolescent war
And I start to feel the fever from the warm air through the screen
You come regular like seasons shadowing my dreams

And the Mississippi's mighty but it starts in Minnesota
At a place that you could walk across with five steps down
And I guess that's how you started like a pinprick to my heart
Now you rush right through me and I start to drown

And there's not enough room in this world for my pain
Signals cross and love gets lost and time passed makes it plain
Of all my demon spirits I need you the most
I'm in love with your ghost

Dark and dangerous like a secret that gets whispered in a hush
When I wake the things I dreamt about you last night makes me blush
And you kiss me like a lover then you sting me like a viper
I go follow to the river play your memory like a piper

And I feel it like a sickness how this love is killing me
I'd walk into the fingers of your fire willingly
And that's the edge of sanity, I've never been this close
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost

Unknowing captor, you never know how much you
Pierce my spirit but I can't touch you
Can you hear it, a cry to be free?
I'm forever under lock and key as you pass through me

Now I see your face before me, I would launch a thousand ships
To bring your heart back to my island as the sand beneath me slips
As I burn up in your presence and I know now how it feels
To be weakened like Achilles with you always at my heels

This bitter pill I swallow is the silence that I keep
It poisons me, I can't swim free, the river is too deep
Though I'm baptized by your touch, I am no worse than most
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost",Ghost,2004
James Davis,"I remember the times we spent together
On those drives
We had a million questions
All about our lives
And when we got to New York
Everything felt right
I wish you were here with me
Tonight

I remember the days we spent together
Were not enough
And it used to feel like dreamin'
Except we always woke up
Never thought not having you
Here now would hurt so much

Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
And every night I miss you
I can just look up
And know the stars are
Holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you tonight

I remember the time you told me about when you were eight
And all those things you said that night that just couldn't wait
I remember the car you were last seen in
And the games we would play
All the times we spilled our coffees
And stayed out way too late
I remember when you said and told me about your Jesus
And how not to look back even if no one believes us
When it hurt so bad sometimes
Not having you here...

I sing,
""Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
And every night I miss you
I can just look up

Holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you tonight""

Compose apologies, To bring you back to me. 
What words were written for: 
One girl whose pages tore. 
I'll bet you never knew, With a letter came a fool for you. 
She says she'd worked it out, 
This room's not big enough for two. 
He swears she'd work his words out, If she ever knew. 
How do I find her, Bearing my heart in hand. 
Last winter, Anne Arbour Was all I had. 
I still wear your heart around my throat 
I still wear your heart around my throat 
With barely the air not to choke. 
Never, not ever again. 
I finally replaced every promise you've taken away. 
Now that it's over, I'm older and colder this way. 
I finally replaced every promise you've taken away. 
How do I find her, Bearing my heart in my hand. 
Last winter, Anne Arbour was all I had.

James Dewees,"I think I've waited long enough. 
Our world was once forget-me-nots and now I wait another year. 
I need you here. I think I've heard this once before, but it's not you walking through my door. 
Don't bother it now, let sleepers lie. 

Bygones have all gone by. Forgot what we fought for, hard as I might, I don't have the will to fight. Forgive and forget whatever was said because we're growing up by the hour. I never would let it go on like it did... all good things have endings.",Forgive and Forget,2001
James Dewees,"You've got some nerve I never knew

We're loyal like brothers
Just us versus all the others
You the one for, you the one for me

I trusted misleading promises worth repeating
How could you do this to me?

Red letter day that I learned
I'm sure you'll get what you deserve
I see it all much clearer since
Far past the point of this

You the one for, you the one for me

I trusted misleading promises worth repeating
How could you do this?
How could you do this to me?

And if it's a lie
I don't want to be the one who signed
I'm not the one who falls down
It's over now

If you want to try
Try to forget it
I'll say it's over, I'm gone

no way to speak

until the end of time
you're all I need, my love, my valentine

All of my life
I have been waiting for
all you give to me
you've opened my eyes
and showed me how to love unselfishly

I've dreamed of this a thousand times before
but in my dreams I couldn't love you more
I will give you my heart

I knew this could be the one who would make me an honest man

She was like the way she was

Lights went down on graduation then on a wedding ring
We bought our first house and had a baby on the way

No, I didn't know how to say what it felt like

She was just like she was
She could love you on your worst day
And didn't care about the mistakes

But they need a mother's care
I tried my best to raise her right
I just couldn't braid her hair

All I could see was my May

And I didn't know how to say what I felt
No, I didn't know how to say what it felt like

James Eubanks,"I'm the best friend he's got
I'd give him the shirt off my back
He knows he can trust me with his life
But he's tryin' to leave me alone
Leaves me alone with his wife

I wish he didn't trust me so much
I think he really trusts me too much

How can he be so blind?
We've both got the same good taste
He should know when he's gone on his business trips
I can't help watchin' his woman
'Cause I'm losin' my grip

I wish he didn't trust me so much
I think he really trusts me too much

Though I swear, all is not my will
But there's a way
There's a way she make me feel
Lord, I'm scared, so scared of what I do
If she starts feelin' same way too

You shouldn't trust me so much
(We got a problem)
I think you really trust me too much

It's not that she leads me on
I'm gettin' there all by myself
But just being with her all, all alone
I can't help but hopin'
That he never comes home

I wish he didn't trust me so much
I think you really trust me too much

I wish he didn't trust me so much
(Ooh)
I think he really trusts me too much

Caught up in the middle

James F. Hanley,"Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again?
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, I do love you""

It seems that I'm the only one that I have been thinkin' of! 
What kind of man is this, an empty shell? 
A lonely cell in which an empty heart must dwell! 

What kind of lips are these, that lied with every kiss? 
That whispered empty words of love that left me alone like this? 
Why can't I fall in love like any other man?

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things [#],1998
James Fauntleroy,"I met this bitch in LA shopping on Melrose
She had designer clothes on and some French tip toes
She was slim up in the waist and drove a pink Mustang
But all she wanted me to do was buy her weed all day
I met this bitch in NY she was oh so fly
Front row at fashion week was her favorite pastime
All she talked about was dressin Express and her favorite lines
But little did I know she had a million other guys
Then this bitch out in the A with a big ol ghetto booty
Always wanted to do me
Kept it wet like a jacuzzi
Had to switch to her hips, carried herself like a lady
Then the homies finally told me she a stripper and she crazy
Now It's LA, NY, Atlanta kind of bitches
That love stripping and clubbing, and tanning kind of bitches
It don't matter where they from or if they shape is different
They all got a quality that just comes up missing

That's what I get for falling in love with bad bitches

Can't trust a big butt and a smile

Met this bitch in the IE used to work at the mills
Part time, went to college, Cal State in the hills
Bitch would claim she always studying so we would just be texting
Til I seen her in the club sipping drink in Game section
Met this bitch in DC on paper she travel weekly
Always listen to Lauryn Hill and Dilla on the CD
Said she don't know nobody and that she just a fan
Then I seen her backstage with the credentials I had
I met this bitch out in Miami crazy body she be tannin
She party with the best of em and drink what she was handed
And you know how it go I thought she was the best
Til I seen her court side three seats to the left
It go IE, DC, Miami kind of bitches

If I die today my nigga was it business? Was it personal?
Should this be my last breath I'm blessed cause it was purposeful

Know you chose me for a purpose, I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner, was never born to be perfect
Sucka for women licking their lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
And violent, and hopeless
I saw but never noticed that a college point is right to be
'All you can be' posters
Rest in peace to Tiffany
I don't know if this is the realest shit I wrote
But know that the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it, and sealed it in a envelope
And knew one day you would find it
And knew one day that you would come back and rewind this, singing

Just grow with me, go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon' smoke with me

I go Bobby you go with me damn
Listen here, I'll tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows them
Don't you ever go expose them

Emotions I hardly ever show
More for you than for me
Don't you worry yourself

Pops came late I'm already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days

James Fauntleroy,"How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
Twenty on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
Twenty years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend 'em a ear or two how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
Twenty on six, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a silly tan complexion
Asked me for ten grand
Stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, beat it
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, my son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me how much a dollar cost

It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car and tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
A reason why he was mad at a stranger like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
Have you ever opened to Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need
Tell me how much a dollar cost

It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies
I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin'
Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', I did compromise
Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa's old medicine
Reekin' from your skin, moonshine and gin
Nigga your babblin', your words ain't flatterin', I'm imaginin'
Denzel be lookin' at O'Neal
'Cause now I'm in sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up
I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
You looked at me and said, your potential is bittersweet
I looked at him and said, every nickel is mines to keep
He looked at me and said, know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehova, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve
Of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God

I wash my hands, I said my grace, what more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone

Look me in my eyes and tell me what you see
You watch the homie come up from a mustard seed
Ain't looking for no problems, just a chance to eat
And I make mama a promise I'm gon' plant my feet
Had some trouble on the campus for the skills I lack
But I double all the profits and I'm quick to stack

Two tone double lard tucked in the back scene on the beach
Supremes on my feet

And anagrams

And Cuban rum
And towels from

Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought

James Ford Murphy,"A long long time ago
There was a volcano
Living all alone in the middle of the sea

He sat high above his bay
Watching all the couples play
And wishing that he had someone too

And from his lava came
This song of hope that he sang out loud
Every day
For years and years

I have a dream
I hope it will come true
That you're here with me
And I am here with you
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above
Will send me someone to lava

Years of singing all alone
Turned his lava into stone
Until he was on the brink of extinction
But little did he know
That living in the sea below
Another volcano
Was listening to his song

Everyday she heard his tune
Her lava grew and grew
Because she believed his song was meant for her
Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea
As he sang his song of hope for the last time

I have a dream
I hope it will come true
That you're here with me
And I am here with you
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above
Will send me someone to lava

Rising from the sea below
Stood a lovely volcano
Looking all around
But she could not see him
He tried to sing to let her know
That she was not there alone
But with no lava, his song was all gone
He filled the sea with his tears
Watched his dreams disappear
As she remembered what his song meant to her

I have a dream
I hope will come true
That you're here with me
And I am here with you
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above
Will send me someone to lava

Oh they were so happy
To finally meet above the sea
All together now their lava grew and grew
No longer are they all alone
With Aloha as their new home
And when you go and visit them this is what they sing

I have a dream I hope it will come true
That you will grow old with me, and I will grow old with you

Your skies may look dim and grey
But know your breakthrough’s not far away

I know you’re praying for a change
To see a sunny day
Nothing good has come your way for so long
You need someone to understand this place your heart is in
You just want to dream again and believe

I’ve been where you are
Almost at the breaking point in my life
I know you say it’s impossible
But you’ve got to hang on cause it’s just about over

All of your dreams
All of your desires are coming to pass
So I’m telling you don’t lose your faith
Hold on to His word don’t give up

Your skies may look dim and grey
But know your breakthrough’s not far away

I know you’re praying for a change
To see a sunny day
Nothing good has come your way for so long

To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The only one my arms will ever hold

Only for nights in Ballygrand,
I would swim over the deepest ocean,
The deepest ocean to be by your side.

But the sea is wide and I can't swim over

I wish I could find me a handy boatman
To ferry me over to my love and die.

Of happy days so long ago.
My boyhood friends and my own relations.
Have all passed on like the melting snow.

So I'll spend my days in endless roving,
Soft is the grass and my bed is free.
Oh to be home now in Carrickfergus,
On the long road down to the salty sea.

And in Kilkenny it is reported
On marble stone there as black as ink,
With gold and silver I did support her
But I'll sing no more now till I get a drink.

James Galway,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Windmills of Your Mind [From The Thomas Crown Affair],1991

That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Unforgettable,1992

I wish I could find me a handy boatman
To ferry me over to my love and die.

Of happy days so long ago.
My boyhood friends and my own relations.
Have all passed on like the melting snow.

So I'll spend my days in endless roving,
Soft is the grass and my bed is free.
Oh to be home now in Carrickfergus,
On the long road down to the salty sea.

And in Kilkenny it is reported
On marble stone there as black as ink,
With gold and silver I did support her
But I'll sing no more now till I get a drink.

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Down in the Congo,
All the swinging monkeys do this dance,
Come to the jungle and see the animal attraction.

Don't get dressed for going on a cruise.
The thing to carry is an extra pair of dancing shoes.

James Gang,"The Pain Of Losing You Well It Made Me An Angry Man
Was There Something Else That I Could Do? Or Was It Over?
Had I The Chance?
So I Listened Once Again To My Bluebird Sing
Oh Yes And Children How She Made The Mountains Ring
Now When Hearts Be Stilled That Gentle Voice Is Spring
Oh My Precious My Soul Says To My Blue Eyed Sparrow
Come Back, Come Back. I Can Peal Away The Cages
Come Back, Come Back. I Can Put Away The Rages
Come Back, Come Back. Can We Turn The Next Page Together?
Listen To My Bluebird Laugh She Can Tell You Why
Deep Within Her Heart You See She Knows Only Cryin'
There She Sits Aloft At Perch Strangest Color Blue
Flying Is Forgotten Now Thinks Only Of You
Get Into All Those Blues Must Be A Thousand Years
And Each Is Differently Used You Just Know
You Sit There Mesmerized By The Depth Of Her Eyes
I Can Tell You No Lies
She's Got Soul, She's Got Soul She's Got Soul, She's Got Soul
She's Got Soul
Soon She's Goin' To Fly Away Sadness is Her Own
Give Herself A Bath Of Tears And Go Home

* Lovesweat

Blue for the blue - I feel when I'm feelin' down
On the ground - feelin' down that could be most anyday
Green for the eyes - take a look around
When the sun goes down - and the sun goes down
In the strangest way -
Red for the light - gotta stop this thing
Find a song to sing that is everything
That I meant to say - meant to say -
Pray for the mice that are blind like the world
Never see the good that is done to the bad
It's too late to see
Two of us make it easier, to read the signs
Memorize the lines - you play with me
One for the road - I'll be on my way
Come another day - when the things we say
Find a way to be - way to be -
Solo:
Autumn calls for a change of year
Bringin' winter near us - greens are brown
And disquise a sign -
Wintertime is a razorblade - that the devil made
It's a price we pay for the summertime
Springdays come it's hard to know
Where the rain comes from - where the children go -
It's a nursery rhyme - nursery rhyme

I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone

James Gillan,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.

You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.

You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gall'ry, You're Garbo's sal'ry,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.
You're the time of the Derby winner.

You're the boats that glide on the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're a Nathan Panning, You're Bishop Manning,
You're broccoli.
You're a prize, You're a night at Coney,
You're the eyes of Irene Bordoni,

And the lost places
From a dream that never brings them back
And the sad truth is nothing but a cold hard fact

Over the miles yet to cover
A ghost in a hurry to fade
I'm taking it one way to nowhere
Afraid you might be there

Counting the burned bridges
Trailing this rusted wreck
As our back pages
Scatter in the dust we left
Like a pearl necklace
Fallen from around your neck

A rendezvous unknown

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song

All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be

And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

Te dijo te amo

When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

All the way from Waterloo

To the boudoir where she sat
She said to 'im, in French of course

James Hall,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais

James Hall,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1972
James Hall,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody

Cut in the starry firmament

On an island of cement

With all my half remembered dreams

A lollipop to stain your lips

We've seen each other once and already we've spoken twice
So stay or at the most a moment longer to hear me say
I really did miss you the last time that you went away
I'm serious, I must have you, I won't waste your time
And have you wishin' that somehow you could replace the time
I don't do any magic tricks to try and make the mind
I just convinced that the reality is that you have to race the time
She said ""You a playa ain't you, could have what you want can't you""
I replied that I'm also an artist baby I could paint you
In the frame and I don't try hard to not be the same

Traveling miles and miles from home 
Blood still stains the ground we walked 
Soaking into the roots of trees 
Giving strength to mother earth 
This land is not their land 
Head held high above the torment 
Tousands die in wars 
Murdered, killed, and slaughtered 
Hear the hearts of our lost warriors 
Beating to the pounding drum 
This ground was once ours 
Now a wasteland of destruction 
Polluting the waters we drink 
Polluting the air we breathe 
Forced in the corner suffocating 
Outcasts grouping for the next to ride 
Through a smoke filled remonition 
Tellers of the future speaking of the new beginning 
One warrior will rise to defend against this place 
A killa of anybody, who goes against you and I 
Thousands of souls giving him power 
Anybody kills until the future is fulfilled 
Through darkness light shines under the rain from the diamonds 
Showering upon the same roots 
Roots that we shared with blood 
Let those roots bring the tree 
The tree that brings truth to this beginning

A girl worth fighting for
That's what I said

Moon with eyes that
Shine like stars

My strength, adore my
Battle scars

Wear or what she looks like
It all depends on what
She cooks like
Beef, pork, chicken, mmm

Bet the local girls thought
You were quite the charmer
And I'll bet the ladies love
A man in armor
You can guess what we
Have missed the most
Since we went off to war
What do we want?
A girl worth fighting for

My girl will think I have no faults
That I'm a major find
How 'bout a girl who's got a brain
Who always speaks her mind?
My manly ways and turn of
Phrase are sure to thrill her
He thinks he's such a lady killer

I've a girl back home who's
Unlike any other
Yet the only girl who'd
Love him is his mother
But when we come home
In victory they'll line up
At the door

I hope 'twill never depart

That's where I believe
The realm of soft delusions
Floating on the leaves
On a distant shoreline
She waves her arms to me
As all the thought police
Are closing in for sleep
The dilly dally
Of my bright lit stay
The steam of my misfortunes
Has given me the power to be afraid
And in my mind I'm everyone
And in my mind

Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this life
It's what you take that makes it right

I'm beautiful, you're beautiful
As beautiful as the sun
Wonderful, you're wonderful
As wonderful as they come
And I can't help but feel attached
To the feelings I can't even match
With my face pressed up to the glass, wanting you

In the slipstream
Of thoughtless thoughts
The light of all that's good
The light of all that's true
To the fringes gladly
I walk unadorned
With gods and their creations
With filth and disease
Porcelina
She waits for me there
With seashell hissing lullabyes
And whispers fathomed deep inside my own
Hidden thoughts and alibis
My secret thoughts come alive

Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this life
Without a care in this life

And I walk and no one knows my name
And I come will you help me find my way

Will I come find you, if I fall away in there

I look out at the stars
I need a day with you, 
we're running thru the woods
The warm air and the sky
Clear blue

The morning breeze caught in a dream
I hear a voice it's getting to me
Lost in the light
Your fading light

You're holding onto me, 
there's so much noise inside
It's like a rising tide
And if you stay tonight 
you'll help me to forget
The crashing waves in my dreams
Gray and white

Summer days they waste away
The morning breeze caught in a dream
I hear a voice it's getting to me
Lost in the light

Close the door till it's news day

the tide pulls slowly

Tonight I feel so alone, 
tonight I wandered far from home

lights wash over me

I know that you will never change,
your heart is cold and scarred will remain

but you're bad company

To say?

And since you know we're always changing
How can it be the same?

And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart won't fall apart
Each time you hear his name?

I know the way I feel for you is now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever, forever

How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way?
How do you not run out of new things
To say?

And since you know we're always changing
How can it be the same?

And tell me how year after year
You're sure your heart won't fall apart
Each time you hear his name?

I know the way I feel for you is now or never
The more I love, the more that I'm afraid
That in your eyes I may not see forever, forever

If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day to make it better as it grows
With any luck than I suppose

When you have hate for your brother 
How can you say ""God bless the children"" 
When we have homeless mothers 
Something's very wrong; something's going on 
And it's gone too far, we've got to change it 
Through our children's eyes 
We can see the lies

Sickness and poverty circle and linger 
Closing in on their prey 
Something's very wrong; something's going on 
And it's gone too far, we've got to change it 
Running from our fears 
We just waste our years 
Passing by the things that really matter 

Don't you know any kind of love

James Ingram,"I watch the world; it breaks my heart
How many lives are thrown away
To change the world
We'd have to start with each of our children
We'll never stop our ways of war
If we don't stop to love a child
We've got to give them something more
More than we've ever given before

Sing for the children
Take time for the children
And love can be learned if we just teach it
Bring to the children 
A dream to believe in
And then have the strength to help them reach it

I close my eyes
My father's face is always there
Though he is gone
He sees me through my darkest days
He lives here inside of me
If we could give each child that much
The world would be a better place
A tender word and a loving touch
Are a small price to pay for saving the life

Sing for the children
Take time for the children
And love can be learned if we just teach it
Bring to the children 
A dream to believe in
And then have the strength to help them reach it

The children need us now
If you think that they can wait another day
You're wrong as you can be
They have just so long to be children
We must be strong, strong for the children

A single spark can start a fire
A single voice begins the song
That turns the world into a choir
As over and over the voices are raised

This is the night that I've been living for
Now we're together
And I can't let you go
And, baby
This is the magic that I'll be living for forever

Don't ever change, change for me
Stay just the way you are
I'll never ask for more
Can't you feel this heart found in those eyes of yours
Love like none before in my life

All of my tomorrows you changed in a touch
Loneliness is over now

I could never face even one more day

And you love them with your heart
And it doesn't disappear if you're apart
When you love someone

When you set them free
And if that love is true
When you love someone 
It will all come back to you
Nights I wondered was I too much that we gave
If we gave in more could we have both been saved
And I guess we have crossed the line
Never knowing what was yours
And what was mine

And through it all, I still have no regrets
Just promise me - promise me
You never will forget - you never will forget

James Ingram,"My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable
Yet, you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little bit weak?
When you open it to speak, baby
I could smile

Don't change your hair for me, baby
Not if you care for me, baby
Stay my little valentine's, oh, please stay
Oh, oh, stay baby
'Cause each day is Valentines Day

",My Funny Valentine,1999
James Ingram,"Compliment what she does
Send her roses just because
If it's violins she loves
Let them play

Dedicate her favorite song
And hold her closer all night long
Love her today
Find one hundred ways

Don't forget there could be
An old lover in her memory
If you need her so much more
Why don't you say?

Maybe she has it in her mind
That she's just wasting her time
Ask her to stay
Find one hundred ways

Bein' cool won't help you keep a love warm
You'll just blow your chance
Take the time to open up your heart
That's the secret of romance

Sacrifice if you care
Buy her some moonlight to wear
If there's one more star she wants
Go all the way

In your arms tonight
She'll reflect that she owes you
The sweetest of debts
If she wants to pay, find one hundred ways

In your arms tonight
She'll reflect that she owes you
The sweetest of debts
If she wants to pay, find one hundred ways

You better believe it or love her today
Find one hundred ways
I'm telling you to love her today
Find one hundred ways

Oh, love her , love her now
One hundred ways
Yeah, you've got to love her today
Find one hundred ways

Love her today
Won't you find one hundred ways, yeah?

James Ingram,"Somewhere out there beneath the pale moonlight
Someone's thinking of me and loving me tonight
Somewhere out there someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another in that dream somewhere out there

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishin' on the same bright star
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there, if love can see us through
Then we'll be together somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishin' on the same bright star
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there, if love can see us through
Then we'll be together somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true",Somewhere Out There,1999
James Ingram,"I watched you leaving and
never tried to get you to stay
Somehow I talked myself into
believing that
It s just another game we play

But the moment you re gone
the heartache begins
Like an ocean of sorrow that I
keep drowning in
Should I reach for the phone or
wait for your call
I don t care who was wrong I
won t go there at all

[CHORUS:]
Oh I wish you were here
It s sometimes like these that I
desperately need you
And I wish you were here
There s a world of love 
inside to share
I wish you were here

And the thing that keeps us
from drifting apart
Is the fact that we re bound by
the soul and the heart
Every power on earth every
storm we ll survive
Come hell or high water love
won t denied

Oh I wish you were here
It s times like these that I

When we should be making up 
Let s get past the pride
And reach down inside for love

Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat

She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

Years go by I'm lookin' through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel on the pages in-between

My blood runs cold

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye

I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
Too see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold

It's okay I understand
This ain't no never-never land
I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on

Take you car, Yes we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yea, I guess I gotta buy it!

How can it be the same?

As we went to sleep, choosing words that last forever, ooh
And when I'm feeling lost, thinking that I cannot find my way
Those words still come to me while I'm kneeling down to pray

And don't let go of the promises in what he said
Troubles don't last always""

Don't let go to the mystery of his word
'Cause joy's gonna come in the morning
Don't let go, don't let go, ooh

I remember times I try to do it all my way
It always seemed to end with me falling on my face, ooh

Kneeling down to pray

I can feel my daddy say, ""Keep the faith and hold on
Don't let go of the promises in what he said
Troubles don't last always"", ooh

Don't let go to the mystery of his word

And I know they can be heard everywhere
Through the trials and tribulations we go through
We can hear them singing everywhere"", yeah, everywhere

The last truce we ever came to in our adolescent war
And I start to feel the fever from the warm air through the screen
You come regular like seasons shadowing my dreams

And the Mississippi's mighty but it starts in Minnesota
At a place that you could walk across with five steps down
And I guess that's how you started like a pinprick to my heart
Now you rush right through me and I start to drown

And there's not enough room in this world for my pain
Signals cross and love gets lost and time passed makes it plain
Of all my demon spirits I need you the most
I'm in love with your ghost

Dark and dangerous like a secret that gets whispered in a hush
When I wake the things I dreamt about you last night makes me blush
And you kiss me like a lover then you sting me like a viper
I go follow to the river play your memory like a piper

And I feel it like a sickness how this love is killing me
I'd walk into the fingers of your fire willingly
And that's the edge of sanity, I've never been this close
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost

Unknowing captor, you never know how much you
Pierce my spirit but I can't touch you
Can you hear it, a cry to be free?
I'm forever under lock and key as you pass through me

Now I see your face before me, I would launch a thousand ships
To bring your heart back to my island as the sand beneath me slips
As I burn up in your presence and I know now how it feels
To be weakened like Achilles with you always at my heels

This bitter pill I swallow is the silence that I keep
It poisons me, I can't swim free, the river is too deep
Though I'm baptized by your touch, I am no worse than most
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost
I'm in love with your ghost, I'm in love with your ghost",Ghost,2008

Darlin' Stay. Why don't you be with me tonight? Stay. We can make love till the morning light. Baby Stay. I can make everything all right. Just tell me what to say 'cause i really don't want you to go.

Just look at us now
With our head in our hands
No where to run it seems we've
Run out of plans
Mirror is full of emptiness
But I'm still standing
Right here trying to understand
The reasons for you and me.

Chorus (x2)
Now some people wish
And some people pray
But I'll just sit and wish away.

Now If I said I wasn't
Job would you still try and test me and if I said
I could cry would you still
Try to make me break me
Mistake me

For we have come so far
Like a mile fall of letters and songs
It seems my friend but anyway

No where to run it seems we've
Run out of plans
Mirror is full of emptyness

Right here trying to understand

James Karolides,"Everyone knows him as Old Folks
Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain

James Keelaghan,"I had a dream the other night when all the world was still
That I walked out with Abraham below a fortress on a hill
We looked across the Saint Charles River to the heights that bear his Name
And talked of things that had transpired since the last time that he came
Says I on these fields grazed your cattle raised on these your kith and kin
And on this field was fiery battle Montcalm to lose and Wolfe to win
Says he but they both died of wounds inflicted by the cannonade
These wounds it seems were never healed, they fester to this day
Abraham
When will this fighting end
When will we learn to recognize
Who is foe and who is friend
Abraham
This field that bears your name
For one a field of victory
For one a field of shame
What of your children Abraham dispersed from this your plain
The continent they conquered though they did it in another's name
The land they won but for their strife the profits went astray
The money never crossed their palms or let them have their say
Abraham
Are we sometimes bound by pride
Too mindful of our hopes and dreams to let the anger slide
Abraham
Abraham
When will this fighting end
When will we learn to recognize
Who is foe and who is friend
Abraham
This field that bears your name
For one a field of victory
For one a field of shame
What of the future Abraham will we achieve some peace
From these solitudes we wander in will there be a release
Will my children learn to find a way to bridge the distance I have not
To learn the scars of history are sometimes best forgotten
And I had a dream the other night when all the world was still
That I walked out with Abraham that Abraham was living still
And in the dream we parted, as families oftimes will
Our questions left unanswered though not through lack of will
Abraham
The questions linger on
There is no hope in all this strife
There is no right or wrong
Abraham
This field that bears your name
For one a field of victory
For one a field of shame

James Keelaghan,"Johnny Mack lived near Maple Creek
He was long and lean and tough
A level head and a steady hand
And a wizard with the puck
And once across the blue line oh
He'd never let you down
You could tell by the look in his coal black eyes
That boy was glory bound
He could bring the home town to its feet
With a goal in overtime
The scouts had pegged him sure enough
It was just a matter of time
If there was any justice in this world
He'd be picked in the second round
Cause he had the goods there was no denying
That boy was glory bound
One afternoon before a game
I stopped by Johnny's place
With my father's car and a feeling in my heart
That night we'd take first place
But there was something that he'd left behind
He'd fetch it back in town
I never dreamt it at the time
That fate would strike him down
Oh, we phoned the Mounties when he didn't show
They found him in a ditch between here and Shaunavon
Roof caved in and it's fifty below
Sirens wail, blizzard blows
Johnny died young but I grew old
And since that time I've come to think
When I see his name engraved on trophies
Or his picture in a case in the Kinsmen's rink
He somehow slipped the bonds of time
He's gained himself renown
And I've started on that slow slide back
But he's forever glory bound
And I've started on that slow slide back
But he's forever glory bound",Glory Bound,1993
James Keelaghan,"Somewhere inside my soul there is an echo of my youth
Some pithy little saying that contained a grain of truth
If patience is a virtue, persistence is its mark
It's better light a candle than stand and curse the dark
But if we stand together we might turn this world around
Hold your ground
In the corridors of power where our voice is seldom heard
The status quo is what they want, they can get it with a word
For us it takes a thousand voices, a million angry shouts
To notify the ship of state to bring its course about
But if we pull together we might turn this ship around
Hold your ground
Oh, this world is changing
Spinning out through space and time
Oh, it's rearranging
All the things we thought were yours and mine
You've got to hold your ground
Hold your ground
Hold your ground
Sometimes it seems the motion is strictly retrograde
There are so many reversals of advances that you've made
The things you thought were changing have shuddered to a halt
But if we stand together we might turn this world around
Hold your ground
Hold your ground
Hold your ground
It isn't for the faint of heart to bet when the odds are long
And neither is it easy to be right in face of wring
You must proceed from strength to strength, although the road is rough
And sometimes human courage just isn't quite enough
But if we stand together we might turn this world around
Hold your ground
Hold your ground
Hold your ground
Oh this world is changing",Hold Your Ground,1993

You said I was lonely that made me unkind
You said I should buck up and shoulder the road

Lilting light through morning bright
Soaring from the limb
And if I were that Robin's song I'd soar without delay
And be the first thing that you hear
As you begin your day
I wish the Northern Lights were of a fabric apprehended
That from these earthbound human hands
Those lights could be suspended
I wish the northern lights were mine to hem and sew and weave
I'd make a cloak for you to wear
To keep you from the breeze

All of the stars in the sky
Oh never the answers
Always the wondering why
I wish my hand could touch the place within your heart that's hidden

James Keelaghan,"Of all of Kiri Ito's joys, the thing she loved the best
Was to play her prized piano when the sun had gone to rest
I used to hear the notes drift down along the silent water
As Kiri played the notes and scales for her dear sons and daughters
Now me I played piano though not as good as Kiri
She went in for that long haired stuff but my she played it pretty
The old piano had a tone would set my heart to aching
It always sounded sweetest though when it was Kiri playing
In December when the seventh fleet was turned to smoke and ashes
The order came to confiscate their fishing boats and caches
And Kiri's husband forced to go and work in labour camps
And Kiri left alone to fend and hold the fort as best she can
But the music did not drift as often from up the cove at Kiri's house
And when it did it sounded haunted played with worry played with doubt
For Kiri knew that soon she too would be compelled to leave
And the old upright would stay behind and Kiri she would grieve
I loaded Kiri on the bus with stoic internees
The crime that they were guilty of was that they were not like me
And if I was ashamed I didn't know it at the time
They were flotsam on the wave of war they were no friends of mine
I went up to Kiri's house to tag all their belongings
And set them out for auctioneers who'd claim them in the morning
One piece that I thought I'd keep and hold back for myself
Was that haunting ivory upright that Kiri played so well
But Kiri had not left it there for me to take as plunder
She'd rolled it down onto the dock and on into the harbor
That old upright in strangers' hands was a thought she couldn't bear
So she consigned it to the sea to settle the affair
So many years have come and gone since Kiri's relocation
I look back now upon that time with shame and resignation
For Kiri knew what I did not that if we must be free
Then sometimes we must sacrifice to gain our dignity
Yes Kiri knew what I did not that if we must be free
Then sometimes we must sacrifice to gain our dignity",Kiri's Piano,1993

Some have names, some you know
Some will remind me of you
So many things here and gone
Some don't fit, some belong

Time's advancing, it waits for no one
This much I see: that time is a river and on it we're flowing
We're rocking and rolling till we reach the sea

James Keelaghan,"River of blue cut through the valley
Swept past the willows and the sandy bar
Ran so swift, locked in my memory
But the way things were is not the way things are
We used to swim in the crook of its arm
In the summer heat who could be blamed
Avoided the rapids as best as we could
Never thought that that stream could be tamed
Long ago I gave up that riverside valley
Traded coulees for towers of steel
Abandoned the vistas and valleys of childhood
For the things that they told me were real
No more would I run with the speed of a colt
Cross the gravel down by water side
To race with the twig I threw in at the bend
Couldn't beat it though god knows I tried
Now the river's not running as fast as it did
There's a dam there restricting the flow
And I don't run either as fast as I could
Guess that river and I have grown old
Now it's strange in returning to places of youth
It seems your memory has made a mistake
Cause the place that once scared you with white water running
Has been turned by decree to a lake
Makes me think about how too I smoothed out the wrinkles
Made the waters as calm as you please
Makes me think about how that river and I
Were both happier when we ran free
Now the river's not running as fast as it did
There's a dam there restricting the flow
And I don't run either as fast as I could

It only wants to be close to you.

Wherever you go, my heart will go, too.
What can I do?
It only wants to be close to you.",Close to You (I Watch the Sunrise),
James Kilbane,"Cowboys don't cry, heroes don't die
Good always wins, again and again
Love is a sweet dream that always comes true
If life were like the movies, I'd never be blue

[Chorus]
But here in the real world
It's not that easy at all
When hearts get broken
It's real tears that fall
Darlin' it's sad but true
Cause the one thing I learned from you
Is how the boy don't always get the girl
Here in the real world

I gave you my love, but that wasn't enough
To hold your heart when times got tough
And tonight on the silver screen
It'll end like it should
Two lovers will make it through
Like I hoped we would",Here in the Real World,2007
James King,"Just a few old memories 
Slipped in through my door 
Though I thought I had closed it 
So tightly before 
I can't understand it 
Why it should bother my mind 
For it all belongs to another place and time 

Just a few old keep-sakes 
Way back on the shelf 
No, they don't mean nothin' 
Well I'm surprised they're still left 
Just a few old love letters 
With the edges all brown 
And an old faded picture 
I keep turned upside-down 

Just a few old memories 
Going way back in time 
Well I can hardly remember 
I don't know why I'm cryin' 
I can't understand it 
Well I'm surprised myself 
First thing tomorrow morning 
I'll clean off that shelf 

Just a few old keep-sakes 
Way back on the shelf 
No, they don't mean nothin' 
Well I'm surprised that they're left 
Just a few old love letters 
With their edges all brown 
And an old faded picture 
I keep turned upside-down 
",A Few Old Memories,1995
James King,"I'm lonesome tonight while the moon's shining bright
Thinking of you, little dear
I'm here all alone in our little cabin home
I'm counting the stars in the blue

   Lovesick and sorrow is what you brought to me
   Oh why, tell me why, did you go
   You left me to wander in this whole wide world alone
   I'm counting the stars in the blue

I dream every night as I lay in my cabin
And pray to the One up above
To keep you for me and someday you'll return, dear
I'm counting the stars up above

I'll take your picture and frame it in gold
Reading love letters from you
I'm longing to see you in our little cabin home
I'm counting the stars in the blue

",Lovesick and Sorrow,1995
James King,"Once I thought your love I'd win
But your old flame showed up in town again
Now I know your love I lose
I've got a one way ticket to the blues

I've got a one way ticket to the world that's full of tears
All my dreams and hopes are gone we built up through the years
Seems I can't win I always lose
I've got a one way ticket to the blues

[ fiddle - steel ]
 I've tried to find somebody new
But in my heart there's only room for you
You gave me something I can't lose
I've got a one way ticket to the blues

I've got a one way ticket...
",One Way Ticket to the Blues,1995
James King,"Theres a lot of strange men in cell block ten
But the strangest of them all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time staring at the wall
Staring at thewall

As he stared at that wall so strong and tall
You could hear him softly curse nobody at all
Ever climbed that wall but i'm gona be the first
Yeah i'm gona be the first

The warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
For there is no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall
If you ever touch that wall

Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall
He never made that wall

Theres never been a man ever shook this can
But I know a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jail break plan
But I know it was suicide
I know it was suicide
",The Wall,1995
James King,"You can see the ad in the morning paper this house for sale the owener's leaving town
He won't need it any longer he'll like the price you'll give
For the big house on the corner where love used to live
She was all I had all I ever wanted but now she's gone so I can't stay in town
I'm the lonely man that's selling for most any price you'll give
For the big house on the corner where love used to live
This happy couple used to live there until the winds of sorrow left it alone and bare
I'm the lonely man that's selling for most any price you'll give
For the big house on the corner where love used to live
For the big house on the corner where love used to live
",Big House on the Corner,1998
James King,"Just as far as I can remember she'll remain the rose of my heart
Mom took sick along in December February brought us broken heart
The reason we've not called the family reunion we knew she wouldn't be there
But since we've thought it all over mama we know that your spirit is there

Oh no I can't forget the hours you're the onlyest mom and sweeter than the flowers
No no there's no need to bother cause without you now would only hurt father
Oh no mama we'll never forget you someday we'll meet you up there

You looked so sweet we all were together brother and I close to dad
Oh mama as I passed by your coffin I didn't want to remember you dead
They all gathered round I stared at their faces all heads were bowed mighty low
That was one time we all had to face it though it hurt us so bad you know

Oh no I can't forget the hours...

",Sweeter Than the Flowers,1998
James King,"Once in my youth, I stood on this mountain 
And planted some pines in the sand 
Every day I looked their way 
But just couldn't understand 

Why they never grew like I thought they should do 
I just couldn't understand why 
Now I've rambled around this wide world through 
And today I just happened by 

   Tall pines, tall pines 
   Reaching up for the clouds 
   Tall pines, tall pines 
   I bet you wouldn't know me now. 

I'll never forget the morning I left 
The hum of the bees in the hay 
The farther I walk, the harder they talk 
How silent it seems here today 

There's an old rail fence that we built, inch by inch 
Surrounding the old family graves 
And there's one gravestone standing all alone 
There waiting to join me in the shade 

   Tall pines, tall pines 
   Reaching up for the clouds 
   Tall pines, tall pines 
   I've come home to sleep beneath your boughs.

",Tall Pines,1998
James King,"When youget this letter dearest darling
I' ll be on the train heading home
My thoughts are only of you, love
While these many moons I've roamed



    Meet me there down by the river
    Where we met that summer night
    If you still love me wear a red rose
    If you don't then wear the white



Tell my mom and dear old daddy
That I want to see them too
This world and all of its pleasures
Can't take the place of home and you



 * Refrain



I hope I'm still first in your heart, dear
Or is another there instead
When I meet you by the river
I hope the rose you wear is red

",Wear a Red Rose,1998
James King,"The world loves the winners but someone must lose
There's bound to be someone left with the blues
So why should I worry when you go away yesterday's winner is a loser today
Now I now that I find this heart to play fair but somehow I wonder if you really care
Was it love that you gave dear or just foolish play yesterday's winner is a loser today

Now I know there was someone in your life before
And I'm sure it's that someone that you still adore
Oh I wish it was different but there's no other way
Yesterday's winner is a loser today
So goodbye little darling I'm sorry we met it's easy to love but so hard to forget
Just remeber my story here's all I can say yesterday's winner is a loser today
",Yesterday's Winner Is a Loser Today,1998
James King,"Up above me are the skies like the twinkle in your eyes
These things are the colors of the blues
In the mail your letter came the ink and paper looked the same
Blue must be the color of the blues
Bluebird's singin' in the trees seems to sympathize with me
But he's not singing like he used to do
The pearly waters in the sea feel as cold as you left me
Blue must be the color of the blues

There's a rainbow overhead with more blue than gold and red
Blue must be the color angels choose
A blue dress you proudly wore when you left to return no more
Blue must be the color of the blues
Blue days come and blue days go how I feel nobody knows
Life is mighty empty without you
There's a blue note in each song that I sing since you are gone
Blue must be the color of the blues
",Color of the Blues,2002
James King,"I was working in Miami for a day or two
I decided I'd look up a girl that I once knew
I bought some flowers and went to see a girl I used to know
The lady at her door said she had married long ago

Times will change and towns will change there I was alone
And suddenly I wondered would Susie be at home
So with some flowers in my hand I walked toward her gate
Someone touched me on the arm and said you'll have to wait

Then I noticed there were people standing in the line
Some of them were holding pretty flowers just like mine
They explained that Susie had been in an awful crash
The doctors said that she had just a little while to last

When I walked into her room I felt the sense of shame
But I heard Susie whisper I'm awfully glad you came
She had been the girl that I had always gone to see
When someone that I cared for had been untrue to me

I handed her the flowers and she gently kissed my hand
She said don't be embarrassed for you know I understand
I said goodbye and as I bent to kiss her fevered brow
I heard her whisper thank you for the second handed flower",Second Handed Flowers,2005
James King,"The sun is slowly sinkin' 
The day's almost gone 
Still darkness falls around us 
And we must journey on 

The darkest hour is just before dawn 
The narrow way leads home 
Lay down your soul at Jesus' feet 
The darkest hour is just before dawn 

Like a shepherd out on the mountain 
A-watchin' the sheep down below 
He's coming back to claim us 
Will you be ready to go 

The darkest hour is just before dawn 
The narrow way leads home 
Lay down your soul 
Let Jesus in

In love our problems disappear

Got to give them all we can till the war is won

James Kirkland,"When all your loves have ended
When all your friends have flown
Who'll be around to want you
When all your loves have gone

Only a fool would do it
After the way you've done
But how many fools would have you
I know one

This fool keeps wondering why
He fell in love at all
But you might need this fool 
Around in case you fall

After the party's over
And you've had your fill of fun
If you need a fool to forgive you
I know one (I know one)

You never know you might be lonely
When all your loves have missed (fool, fool, foll)
It wouldn't hurt to keep
An extra fool on your list

After your heart's been broken
And you needs a place to run
If you'll take a fool who loves you
I know one (yes)

I know one (umm hum)
I know one",I Know One [#],1987
