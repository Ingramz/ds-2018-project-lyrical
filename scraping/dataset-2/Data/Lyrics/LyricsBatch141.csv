Diane Schuur,"Are you getting the spirit in the dark
Are you getting the spirit in the dark
People moving, ah, tell me we`re grooving
Just getting the spirit in the dark
Tell me, sisters, how do you feel
Tell me, my brothers, my brothers
How do you feel
(Do you feel like dancing)
Get up there and let`s start dancing
(Get up and let`s start dancing)
Start getting in the spirit

Diane Schuur,"Oh she may be weary
Them young girls they do get wearied
Wearing that same old miniskirt dress
But when she gets weary
You try a little tenderness

Oh man that
Un hunh
I know shes waiting
Just anticipating
The thing that you'll never never possess
No no no
But while she there waiting

Try just a little bit of tenderness
That's all you got to do
Now it might be a little bit sentimental no
But she has her greavs and care
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle
Yeah yeah yeah
And it makes it easier to bear
Oh she wont regret it

No no
Them young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Yeah yeah yeah
But its all so easy
All you got to do is try
Try a little tenderness

Diane Schuur,"You give your hand to me
Then you say hello
I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
But you don't know me

No, you don't know the one
Who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips
And longs to hold you tight
Oh I'm just a friend
That's all I've ever been
'Cause you don't know me

I never knew
The art of making love
Though my heart aches
With love for you
Afraid and shy
I've let my chance to go by
The chance that you might
Love me, too

You give your hand to me
And then you say good-bye
I watch you walk away
Beside the lucky guy
You'll never never know
The one who loves you so
Well, you don't know me

You give your hand to me, baby
Then you say good-bye

Diane Schuur,"How much do I love you? 
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean? 
How high is the sky? 
How many times in a day
Do I think of you? 
How many roses are
Sprinkled with dew? 

How far would I travel
Just to be where you are? 
How far is the journey
From here to a star? 
And if I ever lost you
How much would I cry? 
How deep is the ocean? 
How high is the sky?",How Deep Is the Ocean?,1995
Diane Schuur,"I wanna be loved with inspiration
I wanna be loved starting tonight
Instead of merely holding conversation
Hold me tight

I wanna be kissed until I tingle
I wanna be kissed starting tonight
Embrace until our heartbeats intermingle
Wrong or right

I feel like acting my age
I'm past the stage of merely turtledoving
(be careful, be careful what you do)
I'm in no mood to resist
And I insist the world owes me a loving

I wanna be thrilled to desperation
I wanna be thrilled starting tonight
(love me, love me, love me)
With every kind of wonderful sensation
I wanna be loved

I feel like acting my age
I'm past the stage of merely turtledoving
I'm in no mood to resist
And I insist the world owes me a loving

I wanna be thrilled to desperation
I wanna be thrilled starting tonight
With every kind of wonderful sensation
I wanna be loved 
",I Wanna Be Loved,1995
Diane Schuur,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In,1995
Diane Schuur,"Say it isn?t so,

Say it isn?t so,
Everyone is saying
You don?t love me,
Say it isn?t so.

Everywhere I go,
Everyone I know,

Whispers that you?re growing tired of me,
Say it isn?t so.
People say that you,

Found somebody new,
And it won?t be long
Before you leave me,
Say it isn?t true,

Say that everything is still okay,
That?s all I want to know,

And what they?re saying,
Say it isn?t so.

",Say It Isn't So,1995
Diane Schuur,"I want a Sunday kind of love 
A love to last past Saturday night 
And I?d like to know it?s more than love at first sight 
And I want a Sunday kind of love 
Oh yea yea

I want a a love that?s on the square 
Can?t seem to find somebody 
Someone to care 
And I?m on a lonely road that leads to no where 
I need a Sunday kind of love

I do my Sunday dreaming, Oh yea 
And all my Sunday scheming 
Every minute, every hour, every day

Oh I?m hoping to discover 
A certain kind of lover 
Who will show me the way 

And my arms need someone 
Someone to enfold 
To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold 
Love for all my life to have and to hold 
Oh and I want a Sunday kind of love 
Oh yea yea yea

I don?t want a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, or Thursday, Friday or Saturday

",A Sunday Kind of Love,1995
Diane Schuur,"What good are words I say to you? 
They can't convey to you what's in my heart
If you could hear instead
The things I've left unsaid

Time after time
I tell myself that i'm
So lucky to be loving you

So lucky to be
The one you run to see
In the evening, when the day is through

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
You've kept my love so young, so new

And time after time
You'll hear me say that i'm
So lucky to be loving you",Time After Time,1995
Diane Schuur,"Words of praise
in a well turned phrase 
never seem to spring
from my heart,
I'm never one who reaches
for sentimental speeches;
I'm not versed and I'm not rehearsed 
in the kind of words that are smart,
Still I can speak sincerely
and tell you just as clearly.

You're a sweetheart
if there ever was one,
If there ever was one it's you.
Life without you 
was an incomplete dream,
You are every sweet dream come true.
My search was such a blind one
and I was all at sea,
I never thought I'd find one 
quite so perfect for me,
You're a sweetheart if there ever was one,
If there ever was one it's you",You're a Sweetheart,1995
Diane Schuur,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

That I'd ever meet one And such a sweet one
Till I met you

When did you leave heaven? How could they let you go?
How's ev'ry thing in Heaven? I'd like to know
Why did you trade Heaven for all these earthly things
Where di you hide your Halo?

Diane Schuur,"[1st verse:]
Too long I held you close to my heart
Too much I loved you right from the start
Too soon you vanished out of my dreams
Too late to start all over it seems
[Refrain:]
It's over, all over
And soon somebody else
Will make a fuss about you
But how about me?
It's over, all over
And soon somebody else
Will tell his friends about you
But how about me?
You'll find somebody new
But what am I to do?
I'll still remember you
When you have forgotten
And maybe a baby
Will climb upon your knee
And put its arms about you
But how about me?
[2nd verse:]
Moonlight was beaming down from the skies
Lovelight was gleaming deep in your eyes
Sunlight for just a moment and then
Twilight and I was lonely again

Diane Schuur,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

Diane Schuur,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,1999
Diane Schuur,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

But it's you I was always dreaming of
And for the first time in a long time I'm in love

For the first time in a long time I believe in myself
And it makes it all so easy to love somebody else

When we met my heart was heavy with care
But with you I'm feeling lighter than air
I could fly to the moon and stars above
'Cause for the first time in a long time I'm in love

They say the world is made for those who love
And now I know it's true

For the first time in a long time
I'm truly alive

Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,1978

There were four generations of love on her face.
She was so wise, no surprise passed her eyes,
She'd seen it all.

I was a child, oh, about three or four.
All day I'd ask questions.
At night I'd ask more.
But whenever; she never, would ever, turn me away.

I'd say how can I be sure what is right or wrong ?
And why does what I want always take so long ?
Please tell me where does God live
And why won't He talk to me ?

I'd say, Grandma what is love ?
Will I ever find out ?
Why are we so poor, what is life about ?
I want to know the answers before I fall off to sleep.

She sort of smiled as she tucked me in.
Then she pulled up that old rockin' chair once again.
But tonight she was slightly, remarkably
Different somehow

Slowly she rocked, lookin' half asleep.
Grandma yawned as she stretched.
Then she started to speak.
What she told me, would mold me, and hold me
Together inside.

She said all the things you ask
You will know someday.
But you have got to live in a patient way.
God put us here by fate
And by fate that means better days.

She said, child we are all moons in the dark of night.
Ain't no morning gonna come 'til the time is right.
Can't get to better days lest you make it through the night.
You gotta make it through the night, yes you do.

You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it through the night.
Oh, you will see those better days
But you gotta be patient.
(Be patient) oh baby, be patient.

Later that year, at the turn of spring,
Heaven sent angels down and gave Grandma her wings.
Now, she's flying, and sliding, and gliding
In better days

And although I'm all grown up
I still get confused.
I stumble through the dark
Getting bumped and bruised.
When night gets in my way
I could still hear my Grandma say
I can hear her say,
I can hear her say.

(Be patient) You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it through the night baby.
(Be patient) Oh,  you will see those better days
But you gotta be patient.
Child, do you hear me, yeah.

(Be patient) You can't get to no better days
Unless you make it, you got to make it
You got to make it
You got to make it through the night

(Be patient) Oh Grandma, oh Grandma
Do you see me now, lady
Oh oh oh oh oh

(Be patient) She used to sit me on her knee
She used to comb my hair
She used to tell me stories

Dianne Reeves,"You could smile away the storm clouds
Even fill an empty space
And it feels just like sunshine baby
When that smile lights up your face
I'm so glad we're together

I can't dream of a better place
That I'd rather be
Than right here with you loving me
With a smile that makes the angels start to sing

La la la la la la...
La la la la la la...

And I know there's no better place
That I'd rather be
When you hold me close in your arms
I can feel your heart beat inside of me

I have found my oasis
A treasure island in the sea
Waves of love and understanding
With a smile that captivated me
I will cherish the day
That you chased all my storm clouds away
With your smile",Smile,1994

Dianne Reeves,"Day after day alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that he's just a fool,
And he never gives an answer,
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.
Well on his way his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice,
But the fool on the hill
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill",The Fool on the Hill,1996

Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,1996

What is there to moon glow, when love has passed you by
Then there came a midnight and the world was new
Now here am I so spellbound, darling
Not by stars, but just by you
 
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At Last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven 
For you are mine at last
 
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song

The way he should
'Cause I got it bad, and that ain't good

But when the weekend's over
And Monday rolls around
My man and me,
We pray some,
We gin some
And sin some

Like I love him
Nobody could

Now folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
I'm glad I'm mad about him
I can't live without him

Lord above me,
Make him love me

Took the time to touch, to share
Worlds apart the night we met
We braved the odds and won the bet

Not perfect yet but close enough for love

How old-fashioned, pure romance
Shared a kiss and shared the dance
Shared the body and bouquet
We'll taste the wine another day

When you and I are close enough for love

Not just lovers, more than friends
Who knows where one starts, one ends
Tracing lights through sleepless nights
That I'll remember always

Always long goodbyes and tearful looks
Hold up well in poems and books
But you and I have life to hold
The greatest story never told

Not perfect yet but close enough for love

That brings a day so gently
And bathes the leaves
Of memories
That fell so long ago

In all these early hours
Though I were there
Once more to share
A love lost long ago

Crassness of youth
Concluding only half of the truth
Exuding only one small percent
Of what I surely felt for you

And then one morning
That brought a day so gently

My welcome reprieve
My pleasant reprieve
It would be simple
To be seized away
By the heat of your smile
By the words that you say
What to do my love
With the passion you bring
With your sincere emotion
Such a fragile thing
Should I risk what is precious, my friend
For a fleeting indulgence
For a fated end
Skilled in the game of chance
I'm tempted
When you ask me to dance
But the urgency that is now your voice
Leaves me shaken and sober
Leaves me only one choice
On this bitter sweet night
I must tell you goodbye

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
Putting up reindeer
Singing songs of joy and peace

Oh I wish I had a river, I could skate away on

But it don't snow here, it stays pretty green
I'm gonna make a lot of money
Then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene

I wish I had a river, I could skate away on
I wish I had a river so long, I'd teach my feet to fly
Wish I had a river, I could skate away on

I made my baby cry, he tried hard to please me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees

I need a river, I could skate away on

You see I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've lost the best baby that I, that I ever had

Oh, I wish I had a river, I could skate away on
Wish I had a river so long, I'd teach my feet to fly
Oh, oh oh wish I had a river, I could skate away on
My baby said goodbye

Dianne Reeves,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her
And you know that she's half crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.
And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind.
Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.",Suzanne,1999

I Got on the phone, and called my man,
Said get here daddy as fast as you can
TV is the thing this year, oh
TV is the thing this year,
Radio was great, but now it's out of date
And TV is the thing this year
Now he turned my dial to channel one
I knew that this was gonna be fun
He turned my dial to channel two
That station thrilled me through and through
He moved one notch to channel three
I said oh how I love what you're doin' to me
He said, wait a minute, let's try channel four
Just about that time someone knocked on the door
TV is the thing this year, oh yes

The way he eased into channel five
That man musta had fluid drive
He moved once more to channel six
Then he opened up his bag of tricks
On channel seven the show was late
But we got our kicks on channel eight
He turned my dial to channel nine
Said Baby, your set is workin' fine
He moved on up to channel ten
Then we started all over again
He finally hit channel eleven
I cried mama, he treats your daughter so good!

Over the weekend
Must have a change from the sight of this strange lonely town
Over the weekend

Far from the noise of the crowd
There must be some place for me
Where I can shout to the clouds
Shout that I'm free

High on a mountain top
Time and the world will stop, I know what ill find
Love uninhibited, nothing prohibited
If its insane I don't care, let me lost my mind

Monday will seem as unreal as a dream in the night 
Over the weekend
Back on the train I could never explain my delight
Over the week end

Will I have any regrets
Back in the hole in the wall?
How long before I could get
The thrill of it all?

I think that I can hold on
To love when it's over and gone
I'll let the curtain descend
Over the weekend

Oh, love, love, love

Gave you a buzz, that's all

We use to have a ball
Not that I'm lonesome without you
I thought I'd just pay a social call

Being here with you again
Has brought such precious memories
Awaking many feelings
I feel so alive again
Sitting here talking to you
Late into the night
Feels like we've never ever been apart
You've always been in my heart

I vividly remember things we used to do and say
And laugh and dance and ooh
You were my boo
How we ever parted 
I guess life just ends up being
Then we went our separate ways

Singing has been so amazing
So many wonderful things
I've worked for, prayed for
Have filled my days
But while this fabulous life is taking place
That one special love has not filled sacred space 

Now I feel the heat, the fire, the sweetness
As you hold me in your arms
There's no way I want to go
But baby, take it slow

Yo I'm in the eye of the storm, where the pressure's on
And MC's is dressed funny like a leprechaun
I chop rappers up like chicken seczuan
Sells a squads off like a slave auction
Aiyyo my zodiac sign read caution
On stage, I make your seed to an or-phan
Yo, my age an algebraic equation
Niggas want some? I hit em wit a portion
Son, The Fifth foursome, armed at the door son
M-illi-tilla, Dice Raw, quick draw son
You don't want no more son? That's when more come
And drag a nigga Eerie Avenue to Oregon, you're all done
Ladies and gentlemen
Select the weapon at the gate upon entering, The Roots instrumentaling
Spark shit, them niggas try to talk shit
We hit em like the L at 60th and Market
South Philly clip a hold into a nigga park it
Take sneaks, chains and rings and bracelets
Split back this like we the therapist
Adrenaline, Fifth mic terrorist, once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

Zigga zigga zigga tryin to get a grip but still slip, so lift me up
Ever since I was a pup I was designed to erupt
You get to know me, you poke me slowly, when caught puzzin'
Some niggas thought they was, when of course they wasn't
Punked em wit a dozen of pellets all in they skelet
Transform, from the norm, start to brainstorm
Yeah Malik be from The Roots, he ain't gone
I took the wrong exit, the sign said Langhorne
I'm trapped up in about five worlds wit live pearls
Shouts to Armour Akquan who's name is Jalil
The moat is deep water so let your hand expand it
Demandin', takin' you back like Knots Landing
I'm Ralph Cramdon, we out, you'll see in Hampton
Yo what the what the what the, what the what the what the
Pivot on this concrete earth until I rot
Didn't figure how to conquer it yet but still I plot, once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

Beans passed the mack and we held em, like hostages
Rappers see me, hide they face like ostriches
Dice'll grind your brain into little sausages
Underwater rap, you know who the bosses is
North Philly baby, that's where that Raw shit is
You'll get blown out the sky once you get talkative
A-D devise rise, I fathered it
So when you see me on the street, don't bother kid
Just be on your merry way, or you might get slit
Ask around, wonderin' what Dice Raw did
Lay you on floors like ya gettin' carpeted
You need a special kind of mic for retarded kids
Me against you's like Kane verse the Partridges
You want to battle, change your name to The Forfeiters
Cause that's what you do, face to face wit raw niggas
I give you a bad case of the fucked-up jitters, once again

Once again 'gain, ladies and gentlemen, yo adrenaline

They used to talk shit, but I'ma quiet them
Kick in the door wit my boys stick to riotin'
First nigga that flinch, I'ma fire em
Tape 'em up, grip his hands, and plyer em
Know the bricks is in here, where you hidin' 'em?
Don't die in the shit that you lyin' in
Used to get fronted bricks, now I'm buyin' 'em
Used to cop off my man, now I'm supplyin' him
Paid the front row seat watchin' Iverson
First class air crafts what I'm flyin' in
To L.A., Shaq, Eddie, Kobe Bryant and them
Save the jokes for Chris Tucker, Richard Pryor and them
Used to shotgun in cars, now I'm drivin' 'em
Used to hustle 'round bars, y'all was robbin' them
Ran up in y'all spot wit Rob and them
Grew up, two-four, wit Pie and em
But do my dirt, twenty first, wit Kyle and them
Nigga Pop, nigga Buzz, little Mark and them
Brother news, nigga schooled Marley Park and them
Nigga jump, pull a pump, low sparkin' 'em
I know shit right now gettin' dark to them
Tore they body all up, ain't no chalkin' 'em
Too sharp for them, move out in the dark on em
These Illadel foul streets what I'm stompin' in once again

And do you need it?  (Yeah, I need it, man)
Well, they got it (They got what?)
Everything, so let's take it (Take, take, let's take it)

[Verse 1]
Niggas can act like, act like they, they want it
Knowin' that they don't want jackshit, them niggas fronted
When it came down to stackin' mills and smackin' grills
Them patty-cake niggas thought that they needed to chill
When all the real nigga feels is a need to kill
Unrevealed, the catastrophic, we gotta stop it
They tryin' to kill us, so all my niggas better watch it
Tap water and Newports, yo man, that's that hot shit
Mixed with Hennessey and a blunt, it gets toxic
But fuck it, pass the la, let's get high
I'm goin' in shootin', does any man wish to die?
This ain't metal gear, solid, you can't pause my killin'
I'm bustin', lick off them head for a schillin'
I can't be happy, 'cause what's happy?
I'm from a place where everyone's strapped and tryin' to clap me
Flesh and bone turn to stone, so if you want it, ask me

[Verse 2]
If you and I, me and you, we ever verse
Then I don't know yo, the shots might disperse
'Cause I got, got you on scope, kid, hundred yards away
Grassy Knoll raw dog might blow that ass away
Talk, talkin' that dumb shit, caps I'm peelin' it
This be a-ro-ro-rockin', all ya feelin' it
My gat, concealin' it, fuck that, revealin' it
Let the young brothas know beef, then how to kill it
Or get your face slammed on a skillet and then you're sauteed
A new law's laid, it's the Raw Brigade
Or Raw Family Stone
Hammer and hip-hop goin' straight up to your dome
Keepin' your own words shinin' just like chrome, so what?
If y'all want something over here, then come get a piece
I'll damn sure cut y'all a slice
But ya might lose your life when ya gamble with Dice

The whole goddamn world's on fire, and it's burinin' like a stack of logs
Beware if your pockets resemble a catalog
That's fat, down here niggas got cattle prods
What's that?  Fuck it man, it's all gone to the dogs
In fact, it's like a fuckin' sauna, it gets so hot
Sometimes you just want to, you know, ka-ka-KLOCK
Ka-ka-KLOCK KLOCK for no reason
That's why you breathin', fuck do y'all niggas believe in?
It's lava, clips, revolvers, there's eruptions
Everytime niggas be like ""Whassup then?""
And you can feel the tension vibratin' off a brick
Babies hangin' like cell phones (?)
Fuck the feds, when you see the CIA on your strip
You MIA out this bitch, you can't play with these pigs
Niggas are trippin' and I'm flippin', straight stick the clip in
Back me up against the wall, Raw starts spittin'

[Chorus 2x]
Yo, it's so much drama, who do we shoot at first?
As time goes on, the fire burns, it gets worse
It's a million degrees, and the street's about to burst
Because the ghetto's the hottest show on Earth

[Verse 2]
Shit be gettin' wilder and crazier by the millisecond
Walk around protected, or walk around naked
'Cause nothing's sacred, not even Granny's tennis bracelet
She gave you on her deathbed, niggas'll still take it
Man, I was raised on a constitution written by thugs
Niggas that G, kill, lie like prayer rugs
It's deranged, pocket full of shells like loose change
It's fucked up when your bull start actin' strange
I seen people give up lifelong dreams for gravy
Get snitched on by their team, or set up by their lady
Who gives a fuck?  Not even us, 'cause God (?) all I trust
But, my first thought is to bust, can you dig it

[Chorus]

Yo, it's a million degrees outside
And we're burnin' up, we're burnin' up
Yeah, it's a million degrees outside
And we're burnin' up, we're burnin' up
Yeah, it's a million degrees outside

Yo, they got us locked down, in a cell under the ground
Tryin' to push for a mainstream sound
Yo, they got us locked down, in a cell under the ground
Tryin' to push for a mainstream sound
Every artist locked down, in a cell under the ground
Tryin' to push for a mainstream sound
Every rapper locked down, in a cell under the ground
Tryin' to push for a mainstream sound

Man, it used to feel like hip-hop had a lock on my soul
And a deal was the only way I'd get parole
I got knocked years ago when I wrote my first rhyme
Ever since then, I been locked down doin' time
Payin' dues with a lot to gain, but more to lose
I play the game, but they keep changin' the rules
The studio's a holding cell for lyrical criminals
Doing demo tapes, hold mics like shanks
Battlin', that's like a fight in the yard
Lines chase niggas down like Lieutenant Gerard
But I love it there, and some say that I'm institutionalized
Freestyling's our only form of exercise
I don't lift weights, lift my mind to a higher state
If your shit's wack, you just can't relate
I have nightmares of bein' back on the streets
But when I wake up in my cell, I feel relief
Bein' on tour is like bein' transferred to jail
And the companies reattempt to boost your sales
In my last case, they came at me with a deal
The D.A., I mean A&R, said ""You can still keep shit real
But instead of Raw, be Dice Chill
Give us some hits with some commercial appeal""
I refused, then sent back to my cell
And from next time, a poet's memoirs from jail

They strangle me with barbed wires of fire, fuck a mainstream vision
The label is the feds, they want to find me and sign me
With a market and promotion behind me, but they slimy
My cellmate Dice Raw is nice, why'all
I assassinate rehearsal, if I go commercial I'll slice why'all
Studio's solitary, so I'm soliterrorizin' MCs
Steve G's, freeze, melt, refreeze
Mics get raped on my cell block, we battle for commissary
Parole boards for adversary
I lost the trial, I lost the case
What a waste, judge threw the rhyme book in my face
But my brain left and right is like the unstoppable engine
Locked down, pushin' for mainstream like syringes
Fuck a C.O., my shit's gone gold like C3PO
Ask Kelo, he know we go T-O
The top, this is cell block hip-hop
Yo, the underground keep the shank hot
Locked down with MCs doin' life bids
Beware when the pen zags and zigs

Aiyyo, it was far from warm, the middle of a storm
And fifth Dynasty was on our way to perform
It was me, Steve G's, Dice and the Quick Drawn
And we got pulled over, we knew something was wrong
The law wasn't concerned with license and registration
Insurance information, or our point of destination
But peep, they got us up out the Jeep five deep
And took a look and saw the mics up under the seat
And start'd snappin', flippin' and shit like ""Who's rappin'?""
Got on the radio and signaled back to the captain
Who warned them we was known for action
""Use caution, and get them contracts from when they brought us back"" and
The fingerprints matched and linked identities
D.T.s was like ""Shit, it's the fifth MCs""
Ain't no escapin', locked us in a lab and started tapin'
Mandatory, the judge said ""Fuck jury deliberation""
Maximum incarceration
In these camps for concentration we call radio stations
A place where hip-hoppin' is against the law
Forever locked down within a lower corridor
Of sound, where they sniff out cells with bloodhounds
Pure MCs, MCs' remains is found
Pick the park when a record executive's around
Yo, we bubble to the top notch round

Dice Raw,"Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

Yo, talk about paying the ultimate price
Hurricane been incarcerated all of his life
Started out at like twelve 
Trapped in a belly of hell

Grew into a man inside of a cell
Yo, anger just swell up
At a early age that develop
Hot head and now it ain't shit y'all could tell him

They said he's on a road to become a felon
But instead he swung blows that'll split your melon
He did his thing and was the king of the ring, undisputed
Started making noise but they tried to mute it

They put him through it
For him to make the system look stupid, [yo]
They rather look you in the face and shoot it
And leave your spot looted [or what]

Or leave your whole life blank futured and caught
When you scream at it and do it
With sweat leaking from the outline of your solid
Don't understand the point that you at

Or how the hell you came to it?
Flashback to images of that night, out in Patterson
They pulled him over heading home from a gathering
And when they told him the charge it kind of baffled him
Murder in the first for the champ, we on that again?

Accuse a Hurricane
Ain't change a damned shame
It's life for Hurricane, Hurricane

Could y'all stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?
You tell me that you know the pain

Yo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever, imagine your locked down forever
Could ya'll stand the weather?
You built for that weather?

Yo, know what'm saying?
Know what'm saying?

You gotta fight for what you believe in
Nobody knows the troubles seen
This flick left me wondering
'What can become of kings and young kids?'

Summer dream deferred, incident occurred, freedom blurred
A freedom that would only be retrieved again in words, later on
The cops, y'all know what they be on
A nigga's life is like a field that they play upon, away and gone from

Natural lifer, a soul he had to fight,
Learn it himself, sleep days, stay up half the night
Amongst dead man walking, he got afterlife exercising,
Developing his knack to write

Never leaving his cell, in this world he trapped himself
What he loved on the outside world, detached himself
You know the cards Blacks get dealt by the system
He drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions

This picture proved to be bigger than Black and White
A young soul named Lesra brought him back to life
It's amazing to a man what a book could do
And how certain books seem to look for you

This is the story of a champion's fall and rise
The story left me wiping my eyes
Peace are you

[Chorus]

Yo, yo, forever, imagine your locked down forever 
Could y'all stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?
You tell me that you know the pain

Yo, imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever and ever yo, locked down forever
Could you stand the weather?
Yo, yo I can't even explain the pain
Just imagine if your life was like a hurricane

Yes, I am the inescapable, the irresistible,
The unnegotiable, the unchallenged [who dat?]
I am time
I scroll in measurements, control the elements,

I hold the evidence, I tell the story [say what?]
I am time
I know no prejudice, I bare no sentiments
For wealth or settlement, I move forward [who you?]

I am time
You can't recover me, conceal or smuggle me,
Retreat or run from me, crawl up or under me,
You can't do much for me besides serve

Me well and have good dividends returned to you
Or attempt to kill me off and have me murder you
Many have wasted me but now they are facing me,
Treated me unfaithfully and now endure me painfully

Plaintively, I wait to see what history will shape to be,
Who's hearts will never die inside the sake of me
Angel's scribe the page for me,
Keep a full account of all the names for me
And make a special mark for Hurricane who (?) patiently

[Chorus]

Yo, yo, a Hurricane forever,
Imagine your locked down forever 
Could you stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?

I can't even explain the pain
Imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever, imagine your locked down forever and ever, ever
Could you hold it together?

Yo, can't explain the pain with words, know'm saying?
Just imagine if your life was like a hurricane

The clouds clashed and the heaven's gave birth to star
God placed it in a man on the day he was born
Convicted minutes after, a true natural disaster
Framed for manslaughter, the Hurricane Carter rising

From out the south water, like torrential rains
In the ring no opponent escaped unscathed
You can't believe the world we live in's injust
All I see is more proof, there's no place for us

They had my man Carter locked in a cage, like an animal
Drive him to the point where the mind work mechanical
Or works by remote control 
It was done to all of us, they tapped directly into our soul

Either it's sing-sing, or it's bars around your mind
There's no where to run, no where to hide
In a six-by-six a guilty man cries
For repentance and lost is what innocence is

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the bilnd
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

[Chorus]

Your locked down forever 
Could you stand the weather?
Could you hold it together?
I can't even explain the pain, know'm saying?

Your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Forever, imagine behind bars forever
Could you stand the weather?
You built for that? Is you cut for that?

Don't be telling me that you know the pain
Your life was like a hurricane, yo

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind",Hurricane,2000
Dice Raw,"Lyrically versatile
My rap definition is wild
I wrote graffiti as a juvenile
Restin' on deuce trey
And used to boost gray Kangol's
With 555 Soul's from the streets
Of the Ill-a-delphiadaic insane
For monetary gain, niggas is slain on the train
It's homicide
For wealth stealth missions for crack
In the alleyways, where niggas get grased in the back
From stray shots
Clips with hollow tips, for your spine or
Either remain calm, catch a rhyme, to your mind
Niggas ya know my style
I run a-motherfuckin-rap-muk
When Malik get a U-Haul truck
I stand five, foot seven, in command of the party
And scam like Uncle Sam
I'm never caught up in the glass eye
Of your action cam, cause I'm down low
Artistic exquisite rap pro, that get the dough
It's the Philly borough dread
Thoroughbred for dolo
I bag solo, like a nigga that boost Polo
Steppin' through the corridor, of metaphors
Lookin' over my left
Shoulder the mic, still feel colder than before
With this jasz shit I hit your jaw
Dice Raw, get up on the mic, my young poor
I be the nigga blowin' up the spot on tour
Surely real to the core, old school like eighty-four
I never die, and raps till my lungs collapse
Then relax until my knack for tracks
Bring it back, on time
When I rhyme my rep remain
Either go against the grain or your ass is found slain
I overcome, niggas want styles then I throw you some
Show you some, get on the mic and take it over son
Dice Raw, the motherfuckin' Wild Noid
Get on the mic and perpetratin is void

Ya leave niggas missin' in action like their dads in the projects
My style like an old mac, travel round and catch wreck
I'm ill versatile, with the skill no more
Wack MC's wanna flex but their styles they bore
Got to know the real meaning of the ill shit, kid
I do mad damage but never will catch a bid
With my knapsack, full of ill shit that I just boosted
From the corner store when I let loose more
Flavor that's me, rippin' heads off from the seams
Niggas didn't play like Jeru and Come Clean
[he heh ha ha ha] I beat down on they heads like drum machines
Or 808's cause my style flows out great
And superspectac, with all the raw rap
Pull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack
Now do you feel the pain of course
I guess you're believin' that I'm insane
When I'm taggin' my name, upon the train I got so much pride
I got so much soul, with lyrics high
To make niggas stop drop and roll, now check me out one time
For your ass, fat styles equivalent
Of an AIDS infected Glock blast
Niggas know my style, plus they know they want more
Props from Mount Vernon, to Mount Rushmore
OK kid, you know my style is buckwild literature
That you can never get when I'm thinkin' your particular
Flavor that you want
I sit back and smoke a fat blunt in class
Teachers can kiss my ass, I'm twice, Dice
Nigga de Raw, never take a bad fall
Smack your head up against the wall
Like playin' handball, my style's ill
I slam like Hulk Hogan, Dice Raw bettin' on my arm
Niggas know my slogan while I breathe your last breath
Niggas better watch they step, fat bull catch wreck
Ill, gots ta keep you in check
With the hellified beats and hard rhymes
Niggas know my style, when I go the whole nine
I beat down punks, cut em up into fruit chunks
Like fruit salad, my style's smooth like white owl
Blunts, so whatcha want if you got beef then come get it
If ya don't well then forget it
My rap style's exquisite, I'm Raw Daddy
Like niggas with no Trojans on the stage when I rhyme
I gots ta keep, my composure
Where I'm from it's like a whole different world
Hoppin' a train honey dip and I'ma snatch your squirrel
Most corrupt, motherfucker in the tenth grade
Juvenile cause Jeff McKay could not fade
Don't ask me honey I'm not the one for stressin'
If you wanna know better ask BR.O.Th.E.R ?
Cause he know the time like I know the time
When I grab the microphone
It's like, summertime, laid back, to recline
In my La-Z-Boy chair
Dice Raw, the Wild Noid
I'm the fuck up outta here","The Lesson, Pt. 1",2003
Dice Raw,"Yeah, to all the Jim Carrey ass large co-op
KnowhatI'msayin? Large co-op, what the fuck?
To the clones, we bless the domes
Blow the vial, you know my style, large co-op
Freestyle all the way son
Dice

First of all let's talk about these ill capers
And fly ass frontin' bitches that now caught vapors
Niggaz run up on you with guns, snatchin' papers
Outlined body chalk, is how they would scrape ya
From off the pavement, I hate gettin' locked up
Cause that upstate bus reminds me of the slave ships
But then the bible never saved shit
I guess that's why every juvenile is in the same predicament
You want to slang crack, or hold tecs, and do the concept
You can't make loot, when your moms is smokin' up the product
I try to tell ya, don't let these streets fuckin' fail ya
The way niggaz be gettin' clapped shit'll fuckin' scare ya
But in the dark, we ran wild, so we killin' 'em
Niggaz scared, can't stand still, like fuckin' helium
Fake niggaz, they don't go platinum they go aluminum
Got em cloned the fuck up son, that's why we losin em
I'm lookin' at this niggaz longevity
To make a big play, but then it might be a mistake
Cause if I get sent to D.C., I'm sendin' Dice to DE
With three p's, so when I get out, he can see me
For real, 'cause the streets is filled with snakes and rats
The snake will be that bitch and that rat will be that cool cat
With swollen pockets we gonna take you back home
Master Allah Rule Savior, never clone

Yo, I use the mic to slap you in the face and erase your taste
Disgrace your date put your title to waste
Dominant lyrical grace, from a place called wild
Illadelph Isle Pensy, that's the residency
Consist in currency, my pockets never empty
Some cats, believe they MC but we know they all fraud
Do a show in Philly niggaz wouldn't applaud
Nobody know your record nor who you openin' for
Can tell your squad's artificial while approachin' the door
So you should prepare, for lyrical terror that's pure
Step up to the reservoir, of the soul proprietor style
Messiah or, the higher law down with Dice Raw
The matador, shorty connoisseur
Stompin' whatever you build to the floor
Similar to that of a dinosaur
I told you I'm the rap predator
You insist to imitate, what for?
Superstar niggaz is ten percent real, ninety percent invented
For a fuckin' record deal
Comin' with somethin' veterans can't feel
I hit you like a steel anvil
Because you grafted off the next man's skill
But still I remain mellow, seein' the theatrics of Othello
Run over tactics of the
See-L-O/N-E-S fess
The phoniest cats is felonious (word)

Dice Raw the juvenile lyricist corner store terrorist
Block trooper, connoisseur of fine cannabis
Focus never weak, blow up the spot like plastique
Leave a nigga shook, to the point, he won't speak
Never half-assed, always live and direct
On bitches try to punk smell the panty and raw sex
Mad lights I had to black out, when fake niggaz act out
Or step out of place, they get slapped in they face
All y'all niggaz is fake, tryin' to emulate my style
What grown man? In this game, to me you're a child
I trained wack MC's, in camps like ex-marines
Why the fuck you think you went home and had bad dreams
Of horrifying things, that your ass never seen before?
You traveled to the realm of Dice Raw
Where clones get they dome blown with chrome microphones
It's not your fault black, just the fact you wasn't shown
You'll come through this like a smurf
I got you rollin' stop off the earth
Represent while I been like this since birth
And I won't be the last but I definitely was the first
Dice Raw big car Logan's Isle sol-dier

Don't come across that line or pay a cost
Knuckle games and hammer cocked ain't nothing sweet or soft
Win lose or draw to the jaw take one
Deranger lyrical launcher, or station
No conversation is needed, my task completed
Read a nigga up and down in the cut where I'm seated
Snatch you from your cloud of cannabis you ignoramuses
You laid on your lap, when I attack your glamorous
Lifestyle, I banged your head up with the white fowl
My character a product of this two-one-fifth trife style
I breeze through areas niggaz would fear to walk in
Balance the talkin', that galactic style as of a falcon
Your Star Trek ass will wrinkle
Spill these words and form into a sprinkle
Cap you're brought up and the name of twinkle
My insight will crack the windpipe of y'all niggaz
Whether small, middle-sized, or tall niggaz
Just tie your name next when I start to X
Givin out flex pains of death so fuck a raincheck
The insane vet, whether you ganked the brain wet
You proceed to lame check, the opposite of same sex
I annihilate your type if you violate
Makin' your blood rush, you post never a higher rate",Clones,2005

Once again, 'gain 
Once again, 'gain 
Once again, 'gain, 'gain 
Ladies and Gentlemen 
Once again, 'gain 
Once again, 'gain 
Once again, 'gain, 'gain 
Yo, adrenaline 

Yo, I'm in the eye of the storm where the pressure's on 
And MC's are dressed funny like a leprechaun 
I chop rappers like chicken suizceiun 
Send a squad off like a slave auction 
Yo my zodiac sign read caution 
On stage, I'll make your seed to an orphan 
Yo, my agent have to break equation 
Niggas want some? I hit 'em with a portion 
Son of fifth foursome, armed at the door, son 
In milita, Dice Raw quick draw, son 
You don't want no more son? That's when more come 
And drag a nigga Eerie avenue to Oregon, you're all done 
Ladies and Gentlemen, select a weapon at the gate 
Upon enterting The Roots' instruemtalin' 
Spark shit, them niggas try to talk shit 
We hit 'em like The L on 60th and Market 
South Philly click will hold it til a nigga park it 
Take sneaks, chains and rings and braclets 
Split back, just like we the therapist 
Adrenaline, fifth mic terrorist 
Once again 

[Chorus] 

Nigga, nigga, niggas tryin' to get a grip 
Bu still slip, so lift me up 
Ever since I was a pup I was designed to erupt 
You get to know me, you'll poke me slowly 
When caught fussin' 
Some niggas thought they was, when of course they wasn't 
Punked 'em with the dozen 
The pellets all in they skellet 
Transform from the norm, start the brainstorm 
Yeah, Malik be	 from The Roots, he ain't gone 
I took the wrong exit, the sings to lay on 
I'm trapped up in about five worlds with live pearls 
Shouts to armour and ??? whose name Jahlil 
The moat is deep water so let your hand expand in 
Demandin', taking you back like Knots Landing 
And Ralph Cramden, we out, you'll see in Hampton 
Yo, what what what what what what the...? 
I get wicked on this concrete earth until I rot 
Didn't figure how to conquer it yet 
But still I rock once again 

[Chorus] 

Beans passed the mac and we held 'em, like hostages 
Rappers see me hide they face, like ostriches 
Dice'll grind your brain into little sausages 
Under water rap, you know who the bosses is 
North Philly, baby, that's where that raw shit is 
You get blown out the sky once you get talkin' it 
Hey, take the vibe raw, I fathered it 
And when you see me on the street don't bother kid 
Just be on your merry way or you might get slit 
Ask around, wonderin' what Dice Raw did 
Lay you on floors like you gettin' carpeted 
You need a special kind of mic, for retarded kids 
Me against you's like Kang vs. The Partridges 
Want to battle? change your name to the forfeiters 
Cause that's what you do, faced to face with raw niggas 
I give you a bad case of the fucked-up jitters 
Once again 

[Chorus] 

They used to talk shit, but I'm a quiet 'em 
Kick in the door with my boys, stick to fryin' 'em 
First nigga that flinch, I'm a fire him 
Tape him up, grip his hands, and plyer them 
Know the bricks is in here, where you hidin' 'em? 
Don't die in the shit that you lyin' in 
Used to get fronted bricks, now I'm buyin' 'em 
Used to cop off my man, now I'm supplyin' him 
Paid a front row seats, watchin' Iverson 
First class air crash when I'm flyin' in 
To L.A., Shaq, Eddie, Kobe Bryant and them 
Save the jokes for Chris Tucker, Richard Pryor and them 
Used to shotgun in cars that I'm drivin' 'em 
Used to hustle 'round bars, y'all was robbin' 'em 
Run all up in yo' spot with Rob and 'em 
Grew up, two-four, with Pry and 'em 
But do my dirt, twenty first, with Kyle and them 
Nigga Pop, nigga Buzz, little Mark and them 
Brother knews, nigga schooled Marly Park and them 
Nigga jump, pull a pump, low sparkin' 'em 
I know shit right now gettin' dark to them 
Tore their body all up, ain't no chalkin' 'em 
To sharp for them, move out in the dark on 'em 
These Illadel' foul streets when I'm stompin' 'em

Now lets go! you know I'm politically incorrect
At the show I start it with a can I get a ho and the hoes go retarded
The popo tape off the stage for caution, its badlands north philly get it in!

Talk jive with, you take dive with it,
Connive with it, depart and arrive with it,
Harsh thrive thats why its part I with it
I did it, make rhymes in 5 minutes,
Mind of a dentist, crimes of the diminished,
Press rewind see what you find in my image,
Take you nigga's back to that line of a scrimmage,
Riq you know we pull a freak with the flow,
Talks cheap thats why we speak with the dough,
Ill techniques sure I'm sleek with the flow,
Its cold outside niggas sleep with the snow,
I tweak in the low tone,freak when the o-zone,
I can't help hiding my seat oh its so known,
I only do what got to because its possible,
And climbing over whatevers known as an obstacle.

[Chorus]

(Black Thought)

I can't help it, maybe I'm selfish,
Maybe the way I'm running is becoming a hell freeze,
All I can see is smoke from tortoise shells that sell shit
50's I feel like I'm making a sales pitch,
My head already so heavy its making the scales tip,
I got my own pressure and got everyones elses,
I'm rehabilitating and still feeling rebellious,
Candidate of heart failure more pills than Elvis,
In a layer cake, half chocolate half velvet,
I'm listening to some howe Melvin,
I got so many options theres so many toxins yo,
Didn't really tell what we killing ourselves with,
I lit a cigarette and then held it,
I'm thinking of some rhymes more illa than a threatin' illment,
I'm on some bomb threat in the mail shit,
Because of all things I dealt with, nigga I can't help it

[Chorus]

[Porn]
I never said I'm ready to die, but I accept it,
Never said I""m ready for war, but I'm protected,
I don't even know when its coming but I expect it,
Lost thoughts innocent hopes an now I'm left with
Nervous conditions, addictions, in addition
To prisons that mixed in to the wrong crowd,
My life is on a flight that going down,
My mother had an abortion for the wrong child,
With the time I felt loved, thats gone now,
Thats replaced with purples rays some storm clouds,
Misery love Misery, so why make friends lets make enemies,
An now I got a habit thats wasn't meant for me,
Now I'm in a marriage that wasn't meant to be,
One more reason to change identity,
The cars, the crime, K's, penalties.

Need a liquid anesthetic, let me show you how I get it
I don't got it but I bet it, I don't worry, I don't sweat it
You can bitch, you can dead it, you can take it there like FedEx
Nothing sweet diabetic, big dog can't pet it
Pack an L then I wet it then I fill it till it's pregnant
(Take the high back) face it everybody got a favorite
I embrace it like I date it but my grandma think I chase it
(Like oh yeah) I told her that her baby moving slower
Cause the world is on his shoulders then I woke up out that coma
(And got right back) at it with a little black 'matic
Lay you down craft-matic, then I'm gone, black magic
(To the hideout) you don't want to gamble with the devil
Especially when them chewy bluies got me on another level
Cause my teacher think I'm slow but my momma think I'm special
But even she know I'm coming back like an echo.

For the statements I'm about to make I will not apologize
Niggas talk a lot of shit, really need to stop the lies
Jewels rented, cars rented, homie that ain't authentic
Acting tough on TV but to me you seem a little timid
Don't blame the nigga, blame America, it's all business
Acting like a monkey is the only way to sell tickets
Shit I can dig it, niggas gossip silly digits
White kids buy it, it's a riot when we talking about pimping
Or sipping on old English brew or whatever they think we do
Spraying double Uzi's cause you know they think we live in zoos
The problem is with this everyone seems to be real confused
The niggas on the streets to the old people that watch the news
And watch BET and the crazy shit they see
They associate with you do the same shit to me
When you look at me you see just a nigga from the projects
But can't understand this nigga's mind set but still

[Chorus]

[Black Thought]
Yo, a revolution's what it's smelling like, it ain't going be televised
Governments is hellified, taking cake and selling pies
I ain't got a crust or crumb, to get some I'd be well obliged
Murder is co-modified, felon for the second time
Never was I into chasing trouble I was followed by
Facing trouble with no alibi, had to swallow pride
Vilified, victimized, penalized, criticized
Ran into some people that's surprised I was still alive
Look into my daughter's eyes, wonder how can I provide
Got to get from A to B but how can I afford to drive?
Messed around, tried to get a job and wasn't qualified
Had to see a pal of mine, got to get the lightning rod
Now I'm in the black Impala looking for the dollar sign
Palms get the itching man I got to get the calamine
Before I fall behind, guess the grind will be my 9 to 5
I will not be conquered by, I will not apologize

Days are living fast, moves in misery
You got a song you wanna sing for me
Sing a song, singing man
Sing a song, singing man
Sing another song, singing man
Sing another song, singing man
Sing a song for me
Sing a song for me

[P.O.R.N.]
Look, I'm so twisted, so, so twisted
One life to live, and I'm willing to risk it
Terror that the world has never known existed
Left so many clues, now how could they miss it?
Sadistic, ballistic, find a word and pick it
Long as it means the world is on my shit list
Walking time bomb, my mind is on tick-tick
Countdown's on, its too late to nix it
I'm so anxious, so, so anxious
The ones I hate barely know what my name is
Have no clue that I'm armed and dangerous
Willing to spill my blood to be famous
Willing to spill my blood to make changes
Look for a suicide note to explain this
Heinous, inking the ache from my anguish
Sounds insane, you're speaking my language

[Chorus]

[Black Thought]
One for the pressing, two for the cross
Three for the blessing, four for the loss
Kid holding a weapon, walk like a corpse
In the face of transgression, military issue Kalash
Nikova or machete or a pitchfork
He killing cause he feel he got nothing to live for
In a war taking heads from men like Charles Taylor
And never seen the undisclosed foreign arms dealer
13-year-old killer, he look 35
He changed his name to Little No-Man-Survive
When he smoke that leaf, shorty believe he can fly
He loot and terrorize and shoot between the eyes
Who to blame, its a shame, the youth was demonized
Wishing he could see rearrange the truth, to see the lies
And he wouldn't have to raise his barrel to target you
His heart can't give you the years of scar tissue...

[Chorus]

[Truck North]
Uh, what you're witnessing is true dedication
Charged by the call and the cause of the nation
Countdown, minutes away from detonation
A lifetime of grunt work, this is the culmination
My manner, seems patient, inner rage lies
So deep, I can taste it, let's sacrifice lives
Past the first sensation, to paradise I fly
Delusions are lighting up the midday sky
The last days of mine spent in extreme secrecy
Wolves dressed like sheep occur more frequently
Too much faith to be scared, the petrified both fled
Those who live fearing death, might as well be dead
Towers of the occupiers, will soon fall
Martyr or mass murderer? That's your call
Mass transit or a mall? Who can watch them all?
In the name of the merciful, sing me a song

Out in the streets where I grew up
First thing they teach us, not to give a fuck
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere
Someone has to care

How I got over where the people come apart
Don't nobody care about you; only thing you got is God
Out here in these streets if you get down on your luck
You can stand out with a hand out, but nobody give a fuck
Out here in these streets every man is for himself
They ain't helpin' no one else; it's a hazard to your health
Livin' life in these cold streets
Hey, who's worryin' 'bout you, babe

That type of thinking can't get you nowhere (how I got over)
Someone has to care

Yo, when you on the corner, it's too much drama
Livin' with the police right behind ya
It's always more than a slight reminder
We livin' in a war zone like Rwanda
Before I go back to the Heavenly Father
Pray for me if it ain't too much bother
Whatever don't break me or make me stronger
I feel like I can't take too much longer
It's too much lyin' and too much flyin'
I'm all cried out 'cause I grew up cryin'
They all got a sales pitch I ain't buyin'
They tryin' to convince me that I ain't tryin'
We uninspired, we un-admired
And tired and sick of being sick and tired
Of livin' in the hood where the shots are fired
We dyin' to live, so to live we dyin'
You just like I am

Out on the streets where I grew up (how I got over)
First thing they teach us is not to give a fuck (how I got over)
That type of thinking can't get you nowhere (somebody, somewhere)
Someone has to care

Somebody's gotta care
And I swear it isn't fair
In suspended animation, we ain't tryin' to go nowhere
Out here in these streets
We're so young and all alone
We ain't even old enough to realize we're on our own
Livin' life in these hard streets
Where it's like they lost they mind
Is there anyway to find
Are we runnin' out of time out here?

Hey, who's worryin' 'bout you, babe
When you whylin' out, runnin' 'round in these streets?

Everything's changing around me
And I wanna change too
It's one thing I know
It ain't cool being no fool
I feel different today
I don't know what else to say
But I'm-a get my shit together
It's now or never
(Now or never, now or never, now or never, now or never)

I'm sick, sick of waiting in vain
Tired of playing the game
Thinking of making a change
Finally breaking the chains
Every phase, every happening craze
When it's said and done
My head is right back in a haze
I'm ready for the next chapter and page
To start acting my age and part ways
With black thought from back in the days
I'm stargazing from the back of the stage
Questioning if who y'all praise is worthy of praise
What's the phrase--bygones is bygones?
Niggas who used to be the underdog is icons
People say the light shines once in a lifetime
Is this mid-life kind of crisis a little bit like mine?
I'm thinking not now, but right now
I need some kinda sign that the future is bright now
I fuck around, do the right thing like Spike now
The quick and the dead--which is my look-a-like now
I'm moving ahead

Yo, opportunities lost because I blew 'em
On the sunniest days of my life I cried through 'em
Mom's was out the picture and pops I barely knew him
And I would pray to God, but I'm tired of lying to him
Tired of trying to run from the things inside of us
Got a lot of fam' and a lot of admirers
Who tell me that I should aspire to be changed
But when I think of changing, it's like why even try this shit?
My mind hazy and my thoughts they get distorted
I know my good and bad needs both get recorded
You do right so your soul can last
But my role was cast before I even auditioned for it
So I don't really see an end to my vice
It's just false reclamation, no end of my strife
Feel the evil overpowering
You can go ahead throw the towel in
'Cause, nigga, that's the end of the fight
When you can only see the tunnel at the end of the lights
Like (?) it's the end of your life
And I'm out

[Chorus]

When I look into the mirror and see my own image
It feels like there's something else far off in the distance
Something I wanna see, but something that's resistant
And every day the haunting is growing more persistent
I never noticed it before, but now I can't miss it
And the constant pounding's driving me ballistic
I ran from it for years, but it's still next to me
And it's growing stronger take and leaving less of me
I can't fight it now; I know it's just destiny
And I just wonder what's gonna happen when it catches me
Will it leave me face down in (?)
Or will it just start bringing out the best of me?
But is the best of me really just the worst of me?
And if so yesterday could be my anniversary
In sinners' court it's important to have church with me 
I'm trying to get rid of these ghosts that's cursing me
I feel that change is an absolute certainty
'Cause what's going on is a state of emergency

Everything's changing around me
And I wanna change too

Yo, so what you searching for? From birth
Born hurting and yearning for certain somethings
Lurking and murk them, got them turning this
Bed into a coffin, burning over passions in this passion
Or more or less over what the pastor passed us
'Cause, see, the past tense it never really passes
Phases that trap us and cage us like classes
Fogging my glasses, lost in a mass mess
Task-less dilemma to match somebody's status
And I'm average as fuck, no car cats gassing me up
Passing bucks like a casual blunt
Granted, hustling habits on the stumble, the mansion while
Bums pass, asking for a buck for some bagged bricks

While bad chicks pass in a Mercedez, damn
They say he's the bastard for chasing them
Maybe it's the patterns that make me that made me crazy

Life is fiction, competition, and contradiction
Petty perceptions, window dressing for misdirection
Love is a lotto; I know I know you know what I know
Hope is so hollow--that's why winos follow the bottle
And people pressure make death a hidden treasure
A girly pleasure, lonely language inside a letter
It's now or never--move it, move it, love it, or lose it
'Fore it's recruited, then included inside the stupid
It's things of nature; paid a player and say your prayers
Naysayers, the haters, the major players, the beggars
You 'bout it, 'bout it; don't allow it to pop without it
Then those who doubt it do or die the death of cowards
The world is yours and the world we can't afford
So ignore the law; start a fire; then start a war
If you're sick and tired of your access denied
Free will died long before Glydes and i-Pod

Yo, it's too much strain, phenomenal gain
I'm going through things, headaches, abdominal pain

Check the blue flame; lighter running out of butane
What's up with my destructive urge that's unproductive?
Choices I'm stuck with, now starting to fuck with
Contaminating family and close friends
Telling me to stop burning the candle at both ends
Ain't like I'm on a coke binge, hanging in dope dens
Or life is just a pool of Patron I'm soaked in
The darker the covenant-slash-train-wreck for you to rubberneck
You ain't felt the true pain yet so you be loving that
Hit me up at black dot gov like the government
Banana Republican, alien intelligence
Kill switch, real pissed, thinking of some ill shit

Got immunized for both flus; I'm still sick

I actually might survive through the evening
Survive my own thoughts of suicide that's competing
With thoughts of tryna stay alive which been weakened

And you in my head

What it do is done till you dead and gone
The grim reaper telling me to swim deeper
Where the people go to lo and behold the soul keeper
I'm not even breaking out in a sweat
Or cold fever but
I'm never paying up on my debt or tolls either
I'll leave the memories here I won't need 'em
If I stop thinking and lie, now that's freedom

To whoever it concern, my letter of resignation
Fading back to black, my dark coronation

If too much money talking
We make em economize
Real rap, no tale spinning, such is the life of a
Kam-I-Ka-Ze pilot
We wilin' out of control until we all make the funny papers like Comic-Con
Feared in all streets so, if you ever see me out in y’all streets
Find another one to occupy
I never hope for the best
I wish a nigga would
Turn around and walk away
I wish a nigga could
Listen to my instincts and say fuck the rest
But once you’ve had the best better ain’t as good
Weak heartedness cannot be involved
Stick to the script, nigga, fuck your improv
Like the samurai
The street’s Hammurabi Code
Play your part, shut the fuck up, and do as I was told

I was always late for the bus
Just once can I be on time
Then I start to think what’s the rush
Who wants to be on time
Feeling unlucky and if I ever got lucky it was one time
In this crazy world

Not a thing I fear besides fear itself
This is clearly a lesson learned for someone else
Reach for the crown of thorns upon the shelf
Cross around my neck
I’ve been taught by stealth
Capture this moment in time, it’s a smash and grab
And where my party people y’all finna have a blast
You say goodbye, I say hello first and last
Hello hello, Now all of y’all elevate your glass
To an example of what time will do to you
When those nameless things just keep on eluding you
When shit is new to you and lies is true to you
Words of suspects-usual, coming though to you
Man, I guess if I was ever lucky it was one time
Then I went missing looking for the sublime
A nigga stayed low, left the ladder unclimbed
Time after time, verse blank, the line un-rhymed

You ever wonder what’s the big fuss
For everyone be on time
What’s the big deal, why do they feel
The need to have us marching on line
Feeling unlucky and if I’d ever got lucky it was one time
In this crazy world

I wonder when you die do you hear harps and bagpipes
If you born on the other side of the crack pipe
Niggas learn math just to understand the crack price
Then drive in head first like the jack knife
Cause out here, yo you niggas can’t belly flop
If you wanna make the noise inside your belly stop
One time means being on the front line
Being on the front line means ducking one time
The pendulum swinging my way, couldn’t be more blind
Niggas talk to the cops? Not even one time
Cause we all going down just like the sub prime
Or a cheap ass half gallon of Ballantine
But hopping over gates to escape is sublime
Then through the alley way and down to the sub line
Tales from the streets
A life of high crime
To make it to the bottom
Such a high climb

I was always late for the bus
Just once can I be on time
Then I start to think what’s the rush
Who wants to be on time
Feeling unlucky and if I ever got lucky it was one time

And the world awaiting their shoulders as a bonus

I got a brother on the run and one in
Wrote me a letter, he said when you comin'

Oh that's right cheeseburger and a 40 ounce

For real for real I feel like
Cattle in a slaughterhouse
But fuck that grow another here's a quarter ounce
It ain't no hydro, but it gets you high though
Them niggas look like casper what the fuck do I know

At the end of this tunnel, it's red and blue lies
You got to pay the price you can never do right
One thing I know all I did is wrong
Maybe there ain't nowhere I belong
The only thing in front of me is a bullet in the head
They hoping one day that they find me dead
Until then I make a place in this world

Yo, the dead drop way until the A.M
Mumbo Jumbo niggas onomatopoeian
Call it how I see them ain't no rhyme or reason
I'm on some different bullshit everyday just like per diem
I damn with animal anguish
So love no bitch die richer than language
Guilty of sin depending on the reeds shaking in the wind
Just a question never answered out here looking for its end

I have traveled chasing demons screaming all I find I keep

Ain't nobody tell you clowns to speak
I'm an AK you down the street
Draw that bump that's built for the riots see how quiet y'all can keep
Ain't no wilding it ain't no problem
It ain't no question it ain't no beef
Cut that check then things are sweet
I'ma go buy some diamond teeth
I'll be damned if my setback gonna help you get back on your feet
No surrender no retreat
Nigga we out here trying to eat
Hashtag diamond dog tag
Money bag, nice swag, pockets need an ice bag
Toe tag, body bag
Niggas lose their lives sad
Rockets in their flight path
Breaking bad, make them bad
Choices out here thinking fast
Smoking wet and drinking bad
Soaking wet and sinking fast
Shoot them niggas making cash
Stick them niggas take their stash
The law of gravity meets, the law of averages
Ain't no sense in attempting to civilize savages
Even though I wish I could be spared my embarrassment
I'm a nigga, other niggas pale in comparison
We out in Paris yet but still a nigga perishing
No idea how much time's left, fuck trying to cherish it
A life in times unchecked, now that's American
Inherit the wind, pressure in everything

The world ain’t ready for someone like me
And life is sex, stress, drama and I’m hookin out 3
I’d rather O.D. than be the next O.G
Than fronting for a whore that already chose me
One man revolution that’s supportin prostitution
I’m trying pimp the game, where balling don’t mean hooping
And riding don’t mean cruising
It mean keep your bitch-ass moving
If you ain’t built for bruising, redrum ain’t in your blueprint
In a jungle made of concrete, every animal Jumanji
On Easy-E and PCP, ass-cash or EBT
How you monetize pigeons on a power line
On a road to the riches every dudes a dollar sign
I don’t mind, I don’t mind, long as all the smoke is mine
And the liquor store delivers faster than a Papa Johns
And I heard that def-ass caller money’s on the other line
The last episode of Good Times is my life

‘Freeze’ they say in the streets when the young players
Get rich or die trying
But the funny thing about that phrase to me
Is that these little niggas be lying
Cause don’t nobody wanna die
But everybody trying to get rich though
But the fucked thing about that
These lil' niggas don’t how to get rich so
I still run with those angels
Man I still P for those angels
Speaking with guns, sticking in tongues
Talking that Arabic and that Yiddish
Riding them trains, stashing them chains, bangles
Yeah I play for those gangsters
My tag on the wall, you niggas look up
You can still see my name yo
How did I end up where I’m at?
It’s kind of hard to explain yo
I remember all I wanted was a gold chain and a Kangol
I remember all I wanted was a gold chain and some Jordans too
Crossed that bitch, then I got that bitch
Now all I want from her’s an abortion
My mind filled with distortion
My eyelids say caution
Yeah I sold crack to get my soul back
They say it’s gonna cost a fortune
And I wonder if the lord take debit?

Dans un pays plat aussi plat qu'un plat
Aussi petit qu'un petit confetti

Il avait un tout petit zizi et un gros cul

Sa madame était une femme infâme et toute dodue
La mère Ubu.

Bêtes et méchants, les deux emmerdants
N'aimaient que l'argent et la crème Mont-Blanc
Ils avaient un plan pour un coup d'état
Pour un coup d'éclat avec un bazooka.

Sa madame était une femme infâme et toute dodue

Puis le jour vena où Ubu 
Et le roi se rencontra Twist Yayaya

Dick Bentley,"Lord Elderley, Lrd Borrowmere,
Lord Sickert and Lord Camp,
With every virtue, every grace,
Ah what avails the sceptred race,
Here you see-the four of us,
And there are so many more of us
Eldest sons that must succeed.
We know how Caesar conquered Gaul
And how to whack a cricket ball;
Apart from this, our education lacks co-ordination.
Though we're young and tentative
And rather rip-representative,
Scions of a noble breed,
We are the products of those homes serene and stately
Which only lately
Seem to have run to seed!
 
The Stately Homes of England,
How beautiful they stand,
To prove the upper classes
Have still the upper hand;
Though the fact that they have to be rebuilt
And frequently mortgaged to the hilt
Is inclined to take the gilt
Off the gingerbread,
And certainly damps the fun
Of the eldest son-
But still we won't be beaten,
We'll scrimp and scrape and save,
The playing fields of Eton
Have made us frightfully brave-
And though if the Van Dycks have to go
And we pawn the Bechstein Grand,
We'll stand
By the Stately Homes of England.
 
Here you see
The pick of us,
You may be heartily sick of us,
Still with sense
We're all imbued.
Our homes command extensive views
And with assistance from the Jews
We have been able to dispose of
Rows and rows and rows of
Gainsboroughs and Lawrences,
Some sporting prints of Aunt Florence's,
Some of which were rather rude.
Although we sometimes flaunt our family conventions,
Our good intentions
Mustn't be misconstrued.
 
The Stately Homes of England
We proudly represent,
We only keep them up for
Americans to rent,
Though the pipes that supply the bathroom burst
And the lavatory makes you fear the worst,
It was used by Charles the First
Quite informally,
And later by George the Fourth
On a journey north.
The State Apartments keep their
Historical renown,
It's wiser not to sleep there
In case they tumble down'
But still if they ever catch on fire
Which, with any luck, they might
We'll fight
For the Stately Homes  of England
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Though rather in the lurch,
Provide a lot of chances
For Psychical Research-
There's the ghost of a crazy younger son
Who murdered, in thirteen fifty-one,
An extremely rowdy Nun
Who resented it,
And people who come to call
Meet her in the hall.
The baby in the guest wing,
Who crouches by the grate,
Was walled up in the west wing
In fourteen twenty-eight.
If anyone spots
The Queen of Scots
In a hand-embroidered shroud
We're proud
Of the Stately Homes of England.
 
Lord Elderley, Lord Borrowmere,
Lord Sickert and Lord Camp,
Behold us in our hours of ease,
Uncertain, coy and hard to please.
Reading in Debrett of us,
This fine Patrician quartette of us,
We can feel extremely proud,
Our ancient lineage we trace
Back to the cradle of the Race
Before those beastly Roman bowmen
Bitched our local Yeomen.
Through the new democracy
May pain the old Aristocarcy
We've not winced nor cried aloud,
Under the bludgeonings of chance what will be- will be.
Our heads will still be
Bloody but quite unbowed!
 
The Stately Homes of England
In valley, dale and glen
Produce a race of charming,
Innocuous young men.
Though our mental equipment may be slight
And we barely distinguish left from right,
We are quite prepared to fight
For our principles,
Though none of us know so far
What they really are.
Our duty to the nation,
It's only fair to state,
Lies not I pro-creation
But what we pro-create;
And so we can cry
With kindling eye
As to married like we go,
What ho!
For the Stately Homes of England!
 
The Stately Homes of England,
Although a trifle bleak,
Historically speaking,
Are more or less unique.
We've a cousin who won the Golden Fleece
And a very peculiar fowling-piece
Which was sent to Cromwell's niece,
Who detested it,
And rapidly sent it back
With a dirty crack.
A note we have from Chaucer
Contains a bawdy joke.
We also have a saucer
That Bloody Mary broke.
We've two pairs of tights
King Arthur's Knights
Had completely worn away.
Sing Hey!
For the Stately Homes of England.

The Stately Homes of England,
Tho' rather on the blink
Provide a lot of reasons
For what we do and think.
Tho' we freely admit we may be wrong,
Our conviction that we are right is strong
Tho' it may not be for long,
We'll hold on to it
We might as well hold the bat
Till they knock us flat
Our dignity of race may
Retire into its shell
Our Minister of Grace may
Defend us none too well
But still if a child
Becomes too wild
And we're forced to use the rod,
Thank God

Dick Berk,"She's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her

Dick Berk,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell,1984
Dick Berk,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1987

Dick Berk,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you

Dick Berk,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case

That's the reason we agree

Dick Clark,"Some time ago
I wandered down into old Mexico
While I was there
I felt romance everywhere
Moon was shining bright
And I could hear laughing voices in the night
Everyone was gay
This was the start of their holiday
It was fiesta down in Mexico
And so I stopped a while to see the show
I knew that frenesí meant ""Please love me""
And I could say frenesí
A lovely señorita caught my eye
I stood enchanted as she wandered by
And never knowing that it come from me
I gently sighed frenesí
She stopped and raised her eyes to mine
Her lips just pleaded to be kissed
Her eyes were soft as candle-shine
So how was I to resist?
And now without a heart to call my own
A greater happiness I've never known
Because her kisses are for me alone
Who wouldn't say frenesí?

Bésame tu a mí
Bésame igual que mi boca te besó
Dame el frenesí
Qui mi locura te dió
Quien si no fui yo
Pudo enseñarte el camino del amor
Muerto mi altivez
Cuando mi orgullo rodo a tus pies
Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Why que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bésame con frenesí
Dame la luz que tiene tu mirar
Why la ansiedad que entre tus labios vi
Esa locura de vivir why amar
Que es mas que amor frenesí
Hay en el beso que te di
Alma, piedad, corazón
Dime que sabes tu sentir
Lo mismo que siento yo
Quiero que vivas solo para mí
Why que tu vayas por donde yo voy
Para que mi alma sea no mas de ti
Bésame con frenesí",Frenesi,2001
Dick Clark,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love [Live],2005

Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same

And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring

Once love was king but kings can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside

When the world is cold,

Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,

But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

I could live without love

Dick Conte,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1995

Just friends, but not like before

Dick Curless,"What a beautiful thought I am thinking
Concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word.

All the other birds are flocking 'round her
And she is despised by the squad
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great church of God.

All the other churches are against her
They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name.

Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake.

She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky.

In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is o'er.

I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look.

When He cometh descending from heaven
On the cloud that He writes in His Word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of that great speckled bird.",Great Speckled Bird,1979

Dick Curless,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

As I walked out in Laredo one day, 
I spied a young cowboy wrapped up in white linen, 
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay.

""Oh beat the drums slowly and play the fife lowly;
Singy the Death March as you carry me along. 
Take me to the valley, there lay the sod o'er me, 
I'm a young cowboy and know I've done wrong.""

""I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy."" 
These words he did say as I boldly walked by. 
""Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story; 
Got shot in the breast and I know I must die!"" 

""My friends and relations they live in the Nation:
They know not where their dear boy has gone.
I first came to Texas and hired to a ranchman,
Oh I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong.""

It was once in the saddle I used to go gay.
First to the dram house and then to the card house,
Got shot in the breast and I'm dying today.""

""Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin;
Get six pretty maidens to sing me a song.
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin,
Put roses to deaden the sods as they fall.""

""Go gather around you a group of young cowboys,
And tell them the story of this my sad fate.
Tell one and the other before they go further,
To stop their wild roving before it's too late.""

""Oh, bury me beside my knife and my shooter,
My spurs on my heels, my rifle by my side.
And over my coffin put a bottle of brandy,
That the cowboys may drink as they carry me along.""

""Go fetch me some water, a cool cup of water 
To cool my parched lips,"" the poor cowboy then said. 
Before I returned his spirit had left him 
Had gone to his Maker, the cowboy was dead.

Safety belts and sickness bags, jet lag downer pills 
duty free booze and fags make me feel ill 
A vapor trail from A to be	, away from normal sanity 
It all seems so absurd to me 

I've seen the carpets on the walls of hotels rooms around the world 
I never want to hear the screams of the teenage girls in other peoples dreams 

Spread the disease, from the south China sea 
To the beach hotel Malibu 
Phone my girlfriend to ask her ""How's her weekend?"" 
I say ""Hi, Terry here"", and she says ""Terry who, the hell are you?"" 

The businessmen are having fun are they on a different plane to me 
I've lost touch with reality, they all seem so absurd to me 
Like well dressed chimpanzees 

Spend and spend and spend and spend 
Will the muzak never end?

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,

A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,

Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,

And he heard their mournful cry.

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

Dick Gaughan,"It was back in nineteen forty-two,
I was a member of a good platoon.
We were on maneuvers in-a Louisiana,
One night by the light of the moon.
The captain told us to ford a river,
That's how it all begun.
We were -- knee deep in the Big Muddy,
But the big fool said to push on.

The Sergeant said, ""Sir, are you sure,
This is the best way back to the base?""
""Sergeant, go on! I forded this river
'Bout a mile above this place.
It'll be a little soggy but just keep slogging.
We'll soon be on dry ground.""
We were, waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool said to push on.

The Sergeant said, ""Sir, with all this equipment
No man will be able to swim.""
""Sergeant, don't be a Nervous Nellie,""
The Captain said to him.
""All we need is a little determination;
Men, follow me, I'll lead on.""
We were, neck deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool said to push on.

All at once, the moon clouded over,
We heard a gurgling cry.
A few seconds later, the captain's helmet
Was all that floated by.
The Sergeant said, ""Turn around men!
I'm in charge from now on.""
And we just made it out of the Big Muddy
With the captain dead and gone.

We stripped and dived and found his body
Stuck in the old quicksand.
I guess he didn't know that the water was deeper
Than the place he'd once before been.
Another stream had joined the Big Muddy
'Bout a half mile from where we'd gone.
We were lucky to escape from the Big Muddy
When the big fool said to push on.

Well, I'm not going to point any moral,
I'll leave that for yourself
Maybe you're still walking, you're still talking
You'd like to keep your health.
But every time I read the papers
That old feeling comes on;
We're, waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool says to push on.

Dick Gaughan,"Now westlin winds and slaughtering guns
Bring autumn's pleasant weather
The moorcock springs on whirring wings
Among the blooming heather
Now waving grain, wild o'er the plain
Delights the weary farmer
And the moon shines bright as I rove at night
To muse upon my charmer

The partridge loves the fruitful fells
The plover loves the mountain
The woodcock haunts the lonely dells
The soaring hern the fountain
Through lofty groves the cushat roves
The path of man to shun it
The hazel bush o'erhangs the thrush
The spreading thorn the linnet

Thus every kind their pleasure find
The savage and the tender
Some social join and leagues combine
Some solitary wander
Avaunt! Away! the cruel sway,
Tyrannic man's dominion
The sportsman's joy, the murdering cry
The fluttering, gory pinion

But Peggy dear the evening's clear
Thick flies the skimming swallow
The sky is blue, the fields in view 
All fading green and yellow
Come let us stray our gladsome way
And view the charms of nature
The rustling corn, the fruited thorn
And every happy creature

We'll gently walk and sweetly talk
Till the silent moon shines clearly
I'll grasp thy waist and, fondly pressed,

Not autumn to the farmer

There's no song before it
The words and tune are none of my own
For my joys and sorrows bore it

Beside the sea the brambly briars
In the still of evening
Birds fly out behind the sun
And with them I'll be leaving

The fallen leaves that jewel the ground
They know the art of dying
And leave with joy their glad gold hearts
In scarlet shadows lying

When hunger calls my footsteps home
The morning follows after
L swim the seas within my mind
And the pine trees laugh green laughter

L used to search for happiness
L used to follow pleasure
But l found a door behind my mind
And that's the greatest treasure

For rulers like to lay down laws
And rebels like to break them
And the poor priests like to walk in chains

L met a man whose name was time
He said I must be going
But just how long ago that was
L have no way of knowing

Sometimes l want to murder time
Sometimes when my heart's aching
But mostly l just stroll along
The path that he is taking

I'll sing you this October Song
There is no song before it
The words and tune are none of my own
For my joys and sorrows bore it

Beside the sea the brambly briars
In the cool of evening
The birds fly out behind the sun
And with them I'll be leaving

Once there was a princess
Once there was a guy
And they fell in love one wonderful day

He was just a guy
So there was the royal devil to pay

They were ordered not to speak to one another
And they knew the sorrow that would bring
Still, they promised not to speak to one another
But they didn't promise not to sing

So beneath her window tenderly he sang
All the things he promised never to say

He collected lots of corny little phrases
Like ""I love you, dear"" and ""You're for me""
But he found that when he set them all to music
They were just as good as poetry

Dick Haymes,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,1994
Dick Haymes,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?

""Good night, sleep well""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,1994
Dick Haymes,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1994

I was faithful and true but what good will it do

And do, do just as you should?

Yes you had the right touch but I was askin' too much
Won't you turn that new leaf over,
So your baby can be your slave?

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.

Finding another world.
