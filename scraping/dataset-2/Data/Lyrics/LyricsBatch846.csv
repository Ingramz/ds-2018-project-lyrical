Phil Collins,"A modern man with an old-fashioned heart.
One look at her and I fell apart.
I was always the one playing it cool.
I got caught in the act, now there's no turning back.

[Chorus:]
I got tangled in love, tangled in love.
I got tangled in love, tangled in love.
I got caught up, bought up, strangled, tangled in love.
I got tangled in love, tangled in love.


A long black dress and the call of the wild.
I was a fool to think she was just a child.
Out of my mind, out of control.
Knew that feeling too well, tried to run but I fell.

[Chorus]

I never meant to feel this way,
Now I always want to stay

[Chorus]

I got tangled in love, tangled in love. [Repeat: x4]",Tearing Us Apart,1986
Phil Collins,"You leave a trail of tears wherever you go.
One of us will hold you, the other one won't.
But I could never share your love or leave it behind.
Break his heart, not mine.

Do you remember tender moments we shared?
How could this true affection vanish into thin air?
He's not worth the trouble, baby; he's just a waste of your time.
Oh, break his heart, not mine.

Don't you walk away,
You know you're gonna miss me.
Don't you walk away, walk away.
You're gonna miss me,
You're gonna miss my love.

So don't you walk away,
Don't you walk away, walk away.
Don't you walk away, walk away.

So I'll be waiting in the backroom, baby, when you kiss him goodbye.
Oh, break his heart not mine, but

Don't you walk away,
You know you're gonna miss me.
Don't you walk away, walk away.
You're gonna miss me,
You're gonna miss my love.

Don't you walk away, walk away.
Oh don't you walk away.
I know you're gonna miss my love.
Don't you walk away, walk away.
Don't you walk away.
You're gonna miss my love.

Phil Collins,"We said goodbye to a dear old friend
And we packed our bags and left feeling sad
It's the only way
We said hello as we turned the key
A new roof over our heads
Gave a smile
It's the only way
Only way

Turn your head
And don't look back
Set your sails for a new horizon
Don't turn around don't look down
Oh there's life across the tracks
And you know it's really not surprising
It gets better when you get there oh

Well it really don't matter much where you are
Cos home is in your heart
It's a feeling that you wake with one day
Some people key p running all their life
And still find they haven't gone too far
They don't see it's the feeling inside, the feeling inside oh

Turn your head and don't look back
Just set your sails for a new horizon
Don't turn around don't look down
Oh there's life across the tracks
And you know it's really not surprising
It gets better when you get there

I'm an ordinary man
They don't tell me nothing

Hold a gun at his head
And make him drink

No matter what you say, it never gets any better
No matter what you do, we never see any change

People living without rights
Without their dignity
How loud does one man have to shout 
To earn his right to be free

You can keep your toy soldiers
To segregate the black and white
But when the dust settles
And the blood stops running
How do you sleep at night?

No matter what you say

What makes you so high and mighty
What makes you so qualified

Around you, stop

Shout out, shout it out, shout loud

Stop and think what's going on

I think they ought to know
The bubble's just about to burst
Tell them they'd better beware

Still I love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day

So everyday goes by
And everyday I fall
It makes me wonder why,
My life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
'Cause every way there is to cry,
Ourselves to sleep, we will

You'll never know, no, no, no ,no ,no
You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no ,no ,no
You'll never know
No you'll never see

The book closes and we try to forget
But I know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange

And so the light fades away
Try, try, try as I may
I can't stop thinking about you
It seems my life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
'Til then every way there is to cry,
Ourselves to sleep, we will

Everyday, everyday you know I try so hard
Everyday, everyday it gets a little harder",Everyday,1994

Don't you know, I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with somebody new
But does that mean that I'm been untrue?

I'm counting out time,
Got the whole thing down by numbers.
All those numbers!
Give me guidance!
O Lord I need that now.

The day of judgement's come,
And you can bet that I've been resting,
for this testing,
Digesting every word the experts say.
Erogenous zones I love you.
Without you, what would a poor boy do?

Found a girl I wanted to date,
Thought I'd better get it straight.
Went to buy a book before it's too late.
Don't leave nothing to fate.
I studied every line, every page in the book,
Now, I've got the real thing here, I'm gonna take a look, take a look.

This is Rael!

I'm counting out time, hoping it goes like I planned it,
'cause I understand it. Look! I've found the hotspots, Figs 1-9.
Still counting out time, got my finger on the button,
""Don't say nuttin' just lie there still
And I'll get you turned on just fine.""
Erogenous zones I love you.
Without you, what would a poor boy do?

Touch and go with 1-6.
Bit of trouble in zone No. 7.
Gotta remember all of my tricks.
There's heaven ahead in No. 11!
Getting crucial responses, dilation of the pupils.

Whipee!""

I'm counting out time, reaction none to happy,
Please don't slap me,

You were late

Now it's not like me to say the right thing
But you could've called to let me know
I checked your number twice, don't understand it
So I went home

Well I'd been waiting for this weekend
I thought that maybe we could see a show
Never dreamed I'd have this feeling
But seeing you is believing
That's why I don't know why
You didn't show up that night

I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am

Well I was there and I saw what you did
Saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin
I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

That I was lying

I'll walk away and you won't know

One wrong decision still puts her heart through hell
Does he miss her, did he forgive her
The love that they shared will always be a secret

Only she knows she still loves him, and she hates the choice she made
Wishes she could find him, tell him why she walked away
Every day gets harder livin' with herself

But you got to hold on
They'll see in time, I know
We'll show them together

I been stuck in the struggle
And I been wonderin' if I'm ever gon' bubble
I'm gettin' caught up in the dust
Instead of usin' my muscle
And every time I extend my heart to my mother
Caught up in the game now I'm back up in the hustle
Sometimes I sit and I wonder
If a nigga pull my number
If it wasn't for the Bone Thug fam'
In this world where nobody don't give a damn
But I'm still a man
Got a soul program
I'm a pump my fist
I'm stayin' ready for this
And you can put this on Wish
I never stayed in ya buis'
And when I needed a ride
You wouldn't give me a lift
And now I'm poppin' my cris

I want to change the world
You want to change ya life
I wouldn't a put up a fight
If I knew it was trite
They say everything happin' for a reason
Can you tell me why these niggas bleedin'
Needin' general assistance
Out here needin' public housing
Out here trying to make ends meet
Tryna get on their feet
But see so cloudy
And I know what you don't know
You better get on your mission and get down for your dough
See the real niggas ready out here taken control
See I'm screamin' out Mo'

Please Mr. Postman, quit bringin' these bills to my house
Quit bringin' distrust to my spouse
Casuse I'm ready for the kill on look out, look out

Cause I'm nine-to-five
And even puttin' overtime if I had to grind
I was stayin' up, slangin' up, hangin' up on the block
Duckin' the cops clocked on the night-shift
Didn't think I'd ever make it out, out, out of the ghetto
But we finally made it
Stay dedicated to the music we made yeah
Now it's on Bone Thug
Leave alone, came back the next year
Number one platinum song it blew up from the go
And what do you know (Oh no)
Eazy, rest his soul
Left us in the mess, I don't regret it
But we better get up and get it, go
Everything's gon' wrong
Especially Bone, it never been right
I knew it would of been on
We would of been tight
We would of been in the zone ridin' so high
Up in the game fire, does, lie
See we used to love makin' music
We was always in the studio, groovin'
We kept it movin', we was ready to do it (Right)
But you know I'm goin' through it
And ain't feelin this rap thing right now
They got me trippin' ready to flip
They got me trippin' ready to come get my chips

Hope nobody knows just too much
You better be good, you know up in the hood it's so,

Fired out, laughin' up
When niggas died, niggas brought around nasty junk
And to the grave, I been one of the brave
Not one of the slaves

You might have through somethin' hopin' nothin' like Bone

Now I want to stay, watch thug niggas leave the hood

Stick in the hood, mess with scrubs, it'll all be gone

He's in a quiet vibration land
Strange as it seems his musical dreams
Ain't quite so bad.

Ten years old
With thoughts as bold as thought can be
Loving life and becoming wise
In simplicity.

Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.

A vague haze of delerium
creeps up on me.
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see.
He's dressed in a silver sparked

Glittering gown
And His golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground.
Nothing to say and nothing to hear

And nothing to see.
Each sensation makes a note in my symphony.
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go.

Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know.
His eyes are the eyes that
Transmit all they know.

Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
That he is your leader
And he is your guide
On the amazing journey together you'll ride.

Don't see lights a flashin', plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay, 'n' never tilts at all.

Those days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games to only pass the time
No more electric trains, no more trees to climb
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
Now, I think I've got
A lot more than just my toys to lend

Now there's more to do than watch my sailboat glide
But every day can be a magic carpet ride
A little bit of courage is all we lack
So catch me if you can, I'm goin' back

The carpet crawlers heed their callers:
""We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out""

The porcelain mannequin with shattered skin fears attack
And the eager pack lift up their pitchers, they carry all they lack
The liquid has congealed, which has seeped out through the crack
And the tickler takes his stickleback

Phil Collins,"Play me Old King Cole

Of a kingdom beyond the skies

Brush back your hair and let me get to know your face
She's a lady, she is mine
Oh, brush back your hair and let me get to know your flesh

And all this time that passed me by

Oh wind of heaven, by Thy might 
Save all who dare the eagle's flight.

Protect them wheresoe'er they go.

Another year over, and see how they've grown 
Then we'd watch the last sunset, and walk arm in arm 
Till I see you next summer; God keep you from harm 
And if I was a flier who crashed now and then, 
She would put me together and fly me again.

And if I was a flier who crashed now and then,

But I feel in that moment, a part of me died...

At times I think we're drifters, still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister but then the passion flares again

Love has always been my shelter, for you it's been a storm
But for a while I thought we'd almost beat the rain

Now there's a hole here in my pocket where all my dreams have gone
Fallen out like so many nickels and dimes
And last of all you, you'd always been my good luck charm
I should've known that luck's a waste of time

'Cause it don't bring you love if you don't love
And it don't bring you time if you ain't got time
And it don't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And it don't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

Now there's a whole lot of life to be unsure of
But there's one thing I can safely say I know
That of all the things that finally desert us
Pride is always the last thing to go

But it won't bring you love if you don't love
And it won't bring you time if you ain't got time
And it won't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And it won't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

And now I wish you only roses, baby, without the thorns
And I hope your dreams are always within reach
And I wish you shelter, baby, from all your storms
They scared you, but they never seemed to teach

That I can't bring you love if you don't love
And I can't bring you time if you ain't got time
And I can't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And I can't bring you kindness if you ain't kind
And I can't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

Phil Cunningham,"I am a man of constant sorrow, 
I've seen trouble all my day. 
I bid farewell to old Kentucky, 
The place where I was born and raised. 
(The place where he was born and raised )

For six long years I've been in trouble, 
No pleasures here on earth I found. 
For in this world I'm bound to ramble, 
I have no friends to help me now. 
(He has no friends to help him now.)

It's fare thee well my old lover. 
I never expect to see you again. 
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad, 
Perhaps I'll die upon this train.
(Perhaps he'll die upon this train.)

You can bury me in some deep valley, 
For many years where I may lay. 
Then you may learn to love another, 
While I am sleeping in my grave.
(While he is sleeping in his grave.)

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger 
My face, you'll never see no more. 
But there is one promise that is given 
I'll meet you on God's golden shore. 
(He'll meet you on God's golden shore.)",Man of Constant Sorrow,2015

Yes, you're now rockin with the best 

[Defari] One two, Defari's in the house 

[J-Ro] Defari in the house, you're now rockin with the best 

Verse One: J-Ro 

Everytime I rhyme I swing mine like wind chimes 

It's crack a brew, tie your shoe, do a backspin time 

I quit sellin weed but I stuff dimes in my sack 

TJ Rolls, Crackerjacks, Mad Lib, Loot Pack 

I make you move and change your number like ? to wear you out 

like slacks, like when the button on your back pocket cracks 

I used to roll with moms, shotgun in the Datsun 

Rest in peace shouts out to Donnie LaToya Watson 

A real mother for ya, the Ro will never bore ya 

I clock mail like Mel be spittin game like a lawyer 

I rolled it up, spark it, then I blow like 

Branford got one more Son than Sanford's tryin to send him to Stanford 

... and ohh yo like Quasimoto 

my name rings bells, it's time for Tha Likwit photo 

Yes... ladies and gentlemen... 

You are now rockin with the best

Yes, you are now rockin, you are now rockin 

You are now rockin with the best 

(repeat 2X) 

Verse Two: Phil Da Agony 

You're now rockin with the best, maximum capacity 

for MC's that ain't for the Schlitz Malt Liquor Bull 

Pullin words like tug of war from my memory banks 

core secure, sweat pours through the forces I give em more 

Who want to see a Likwit MC 

without the glass ya laugh, feel the wrath of the blast 

of the liquor in the flask, so don't ask, or form the question 

Verbal harassment, to your environment 

Music element, to your conscious, the beat ready rocker 

Sippin the vodka straight smokin the sess that niggaz hate 

I got the the grammer for Panorama City, with bills in my socks 

so they won't break in my pocket on the block 

Fool I'm bout to go purchase me some Old Gold beer 

My niggaz gettin wasted on my stairs and under the stairs 

Liks can cock while I'm twistin my beers 

You gotta be able to twist at least three, to Phil Da Agony, really 

My currency stretch, for the stress 

while I book my matches, askin niggaz who want to match this 

Yes, you are now rockin, you are now rockin 

You are now rockin with the best 

Chorus 

Verse Three: Tash, E-Swift 

Niggaz think I'm off my rocker, but big Tash is lifted off that vodka 

So rappers know it's curtains from the second that I spot ya 

Cause the top notcher goes the extra length to bring it liver 

Get me drunk enough and Tash'll crash a party skydivin 

Cause to danger I'm no stranger, my mic has insurance 

But just to keep it safe I called E-40 for endurance 

So it's a everyday occurrence for the Alkie fam to slam 

the Likwid hits that make y'all niggaz say, ""Yes god damn!"" 

So get off your ass and JAYAM, to the sounds of Rum and Coke 

while I blow my smoke and show you how deep my Likwid soak 

into your brain, I still got the style they can't explain 

But my homey want to bust so tell these niggaz what's your name! 

I'm E-Swift, my beats are known to leave speakers blown 

In any fuckin zone, my style is prone to wet the microphone 

The hardcore music conductor, the Likwit MC slash 

beat constructor, rockin this motherfucker 

That's some stuff niggaz I'm finished, if lyrics 

need to be replenished I'm sendin bitin MC's to the dentist 

to get they grill fixed cause they got too addicted 

Now they feelin the pain that Tha Liks have inflicted 

I make clubs swing like Tiger Woods on the green 

I go the whole eighteen, avoiding anything in between 

Niggaz tune into these flows like Friday night mix shows 

on the radio, my crew is unfadeable

Yo, everybody grab a seat, welcome to Smoke Fest '99

Tash be partied down as fuck swingin' off the chandelier
Tash be here, Tash be there
Tash be everywhere it's poppin'
I'm here to let you know fuckin' wit me's not an option
'cause Tash is my name, Tash'll start it wit a bang
Tash'll end it wit a, that's not the same thing
Tash'll split your frame, Tash swings like gold chains
I be rollin' wit King T, and we all in the same game
But enough about CaTash, let's talk about some skrill
You know it's bout to pop if Likwit Crew is on the bill
You can ask my nigga Phil how real this is, the weed

Yeah yeah yeah
I was lookin' to get my skull blowed up like Kid Dynamtie
The time is right
Be ridin' the track so fiercely that it seems I'm already high tonight
But I'm not though I'm just on them Black & Mild's
And people thinkin' I'm the wild one 'cause I be flipping
And rippin' the track and verbally attacking on yo' style for fun
Higher soul but to please myself I gotta be composing that fly shit
And you notifying Alkaholiks daily
So punk mufucker you better dub bitch
What do you need boy, rap and some my boys are still in the trap
I mean the dope spot, but the slanging got my snapping like the rope hot
I can be the player you want to bust wit 
Or nigga you don't even want to go fuck wit
Or nup with, you suck dick, so why y'all up on my nuts quick
I hold the microphone and that's wit a vice grip
Really tightly, and I'm keepin' the words crystal clear
So you gon' correct when you try to bite thee
Very nicely, Aquemini my nigga, not a Pisces
But I likely, gon' fetch a sack of that green stuff
While I write G, yeah yeah right

Yeah, check this out yeah
Hard life, now picture this
A nigga in jail, rapping while his folk in the next cell
Tapping wit some spoons, we do rank the boom boom
Fresh off a planet wit sand dunes and maroon moons
Soaking wet wounds, titty tangling tunes
Musty under arms, soul shlong charm
Bump off in the drums, rhythm on the one
Stankonious under smelling where I'm coming from son
The day you bone is when you start to die
The time in between us will mean the most, I toast my high
See shit gets so bad, I know it make you want to cry
But suck it up, buck it up, go ahead and do your thing
For I'm already high

Yo yo yo
Whenever I'm writing, you can call me Philly Titan
Reciting to you an interview like Phil Donahue
Me and my crew, translate Los Angeles
Scandalous, like Watergate
Phil on the break, Phil on the break
Fill in the blank, it feels bad like getting shanked
File up your taxes, I'm writing exact on my axis
From my head down to my Air Max's
Phil waxes and relaxs
Phil also fills up mental food up in your deadly baskets
My name is Jason when I fill out my application
To the nation, niggas is gonna get in filled what they facin'
Feel the ration, feel the adrenaline
I penetrate like penicillin, niggas be like ""Phil is illin!""
Phil is willin and ready
Phil is raw like Eddie
Phil be cuttin up like machetes and confetti
Deadly, feel the pain when I walk through the rain

Hey hey hey
Peace rap world, I'd like to make a special announcement right about now
We have a special guest that just stepped in the house
You know this man, he the smokiest cat in rap music
He goes by the name of the Doctor Greenthumb, smoke 'em out

Now I be, rolling and smoking
And holding the golden sack
When my lungs be getting swollen, hitting the bong folding
For chronic ironic, growing the hydroponic
We got it, robotic hits you on melodic tricks of sonic

Buddah bless best, for you to step back 'cause your lyrics are like cess weed
Yes indeed, the session you need to retrieve it
It's ten niggas in a circle smoking a spliff, believe it
Retrieve it, over the counter, can you conceive it
I give you Doctor Greenthumb digits, but don't repeat it
The Brew Crew and the Buddah Masters together
Getting you higher and fucking you up that much faster
Six sacks, blunt leafs, pipes and bong-bowls
All be getting smoked at the Buddah head shows
Excuse me if it seems too complicated
The herb I hold is platinum while yours is nickel plated
Let me mash out, I'm breakin' the stash out, the hash out
I'm rollin' to the studio to smoke my nigga Tash out

Motherfuckers they wanna test me
Pull out the blunt nigga I'll wreck your shit
I'm out that window with my 44, another fucking hit
Don't know who to trust with my shit
I'm in this click, you in my hood you better know who you fucking with
Who you stepping with, Skandalous fucking dangerous
Bitches brains I bust, feel the lust in God we trust
Nigga I'm at your door, don't pray to God cause you done lost your grace
Been in this game for too long you bout to lose your face
I got the mind of a psycho ass ??
As I take another hit on this shit nigga you dead
Never ask forgiveness told the Lord to give me grace
You talked some shit front your boys and as result you lost your face
Blood all over the place I'm counting the fucking bodies dropping
I know my destiny cause I can hear the devil knocking
I done sent body and soul to my eternal flames you best believe
I numb them bodies and play my fucking game
I sold my soul at an early age
And now my hearts releasing daemons in a rage
My eyes in a daze
Evertime I close my eyes to go to sleep I see the visions coming
Is juices running when ya done in
Fear only make me curious, I'll never be afraid
But if you slip you pay your life here come the light now nigga they
Dead
Crack scarfs for my fucking glory
Talking shit up in my territory
Another day another world's sad story

Verse 2 (Steph)

Smoking blunt, smoke a nigga selling dope on the block
Pop pop goes the glock I bring more nightmare than Hitchcock
Get ?? when them bodies fall hitting them prisoners hard
Its your final call bitch I'll smoke you like menthol
Fuck all you bitches I'm putting you in them bodybags
Tagging toes, nigga drive slow
Creeping up out they indo scheming for they cheese
Slanging oz's and quarter keys niggas dressed in army fatigues
Freeze your whole coalition
Strapped with ammunition
Infrareds digging ditches for chicken heads
This figure from head to toe
Labeled as a Jane Doe, leaving bullets in your Lexus door
But fuck it I'm through with the fairytales
Cause when some shit jump off, all you murder on tape bitches gone bail
Who gone prevail when I exhale on you small scale
Lyrical laggers, wanna be chrome packers
Spit the facts I'm bout the Lex and the Ac
My verbal combat will eliminate your whole habitat
You hoes ain't fucking with that
Or this, cause I piss on competition
And have all you hoes in submission
Trying to recondition your stilo
Lyrical nino
I sling rhymes like kilos
>From here to Puerto Rico
One other sequel from the infamous unseen
Scheming for the green smoking bitches and niggas like nicotine

Verse 3 (Mia X)

Cause she up to schemes
Tired of chasing apple pie dreams
Mint greens is all I fien for straight shit is all this bitch know
50's this nine millimeter berreta leaving you wetter than April showers
Followe by your second line of flowers
I devour competition, causing complete submissions
Cooks more dope in my kitchen
Tricking ass niggas be my victims when night falls
Ya'll wants to floss but get set-up tied down and tossed
Boss chick you don't want to see her
Your bitch can either run for the heater or meet the dumb hoe beaters
Mia's right and left well known with the clout
To wire your mouth, knock your grill out
That's what this here be bout
So you can doubt what I'm saying and run that lip
Or get your whole click engulfed in gangsta shit
Too much to deal with
I'm still a bitch that' be's designer down stay scheming on the man
And taking flights, torsoe taped full of contrabands
My flow so grand it make the beats say damn
Shit jumps back makes you wanna holler
But I sees nothing but dollars
Feminist power
My lyrics knocking like a KL beat
It be that she-devil that below sea level bitch you can't see her
Niggas and broads be trying to figure at 5'4
How they still need a ladder to face this hoe
For sure, cause I be living for the drama

I took her overseas
She left her hold unlocked
I had to find a dock
I was a toiler on the sea
I was a toiler on the sea

We didn't use cruel words
To navigate cruel seas
The wind was biting hard
At times I had to scream
I was a toiler on the sea
I was a toiler on the sea

And when we reached the land
We went aground on the rocks
Became a wreck in the sand
Became a home for a flock

We ventured overland
Fought with the aliens
The young ones used their hands
Pointed the way to a flock

A flock of seagulls
A flock of seagulls

Then we retraced our steps
Rebuilt the woman ship
I took her back up north
I lost her in the fog

And in early fall when brown leaves fall, I'll catch a glimpse of you

Should you go first and I remain, for battles to be fought
Each thing you've touched along the way, will be a hallowed spot
I'll hear your voice I'll see your smile though blindly I may grope
The memory of your helping hand will buoy me on with hope

Beyond the sunset, oh blissful morning
When with our savior, heaven is begun
Earth's toiling ended, oh glory dawning
Beyond the sunset when day is done

Should you go first and I remain, to finish with the scroll
No lessening shadows shall ever creep in to make this life seem droll
We've known so much of happiness, we've had our cup of joy
And memory is one gift of God that death cannot destroy

I want to know each step you take that I may walk the same
For someday down that lonely road, you'll hear me call your name
Should you go first and I remain, one thing I'll have you do
Walk slowly down that long long path, for soon I'll follow you

I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

When you are not around.

Phil Everly,"O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee to-night.

For Christ is born of Mary,
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven.
No ear may hear his coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him, still
The dear Christ enters in.

Where children pure and happy
Pray to the blessed Child,
Where misery cries out to thee,
Son of the mother mild;
Where charity stands watching
And faith holds wide the door,
The dark night wakes, the glory breaks,
And Christmas comes once more.

O holy Child of Bethlehem!
Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin and enter in,
Be born in us to-day.
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell;
O come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel!",O Little Town of Bethlehem,1962

Phil Harris,"The other night I dreamed that I was
Down at the bottom of the sea.
I met a Mermaid fair, Who had a cottage there,
Her name was Minnie and she tumbled for me.
She had the tail of a fish for a train,
But just the same, she could sure entertain.

Oh what a time I had with Minnie the Mermaid,
Down at the bottom of the sea;
I forgot my troubles, There among the bubbles,
Gee but she was awfully good to me.
And every night when the star fish came out,
I'd hug and kiss her so.
Oh what a time I had with Minnie the mermaid,
Down in her seaweed bungalow.",Minnie the Mermaid,1985
Phil Harris,"While I was walkin' down the beach one bright and sunny day
I saw a great big wooden box a-floatin' in the bay
I pulled it in and opened it up and much to my surprise
Oh, I discovered a (Boom-ba-boom), right before my eyes
Oh, I discovered a (Boom-ba-boom), right before my eyes

I picked it up and ran to town as happy as a king
I took it to a guy I knew who'd buy most anything
But this is what he hollered at me as I walked in his shop
""Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), before I call a cop""
""Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), before I call a cop""

I turned around and got right out, a-runnin' for my life
And then I took it home with me to give it to my wife
But this is what she hollered at me as I walked in the door
""Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), and don't come back no more""
""Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), and don't come back no more""

I wandered all around the town until I chanced to meet
A hobo who was lookin' for a handout on the street
He said he'd take most any old thing, he was a desperate man
But when I showed him the (Boom-ba-boom), he turned around and ran
Oh, when I showed him the (Boom-ba-boom), he turned around and ran

I wandered on for many years a victim of my fate
Until one day I came upon St. Peter at the gate
And when I tried to take it inside he told me where to go
Get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), and take it down below
Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), and take it down below

The moral of this story is: if you're out on the beach
And you should see a great big box, and it's within your reach
Don't ever stop and open it up, that's my advice to you
'Cause you'll never get rid of the (Boom-ba-boom), no matter what you do
Oh you'll never get rid of the (Boom-ba-boom), no matter what you do",The Thing,1990

Then he said I'm gonna play 'em tight tonight
He said there'll be no bobtail flushes make me bite

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining

The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Every vine every tree
Yes, it's a blue, blue jungle
Not like it used to be
Because my little buddy
My little Mowgli's far from me
And I got the misery

Oh, they civilized my man cub
Washed his face and combed his hair
(Sticky, gooey stuff yeah)
They civilized my man cub
Gave him way-out clothes to wear
(No where)
They're messin' with my Mowgli
And he would've made one swell bear

Oh, I'm on the road to ruin
Stewin' body night 'n' day
Yes, I'm just a broodin', brewin'
Stewin' while I'm turnin' gray
I've got to have my man cub
Gotta get him back here, right away
Some way

And if anyone tries to stop me
He better bring all the help he can
(Hear me talkin' to ya)
I said if anybody tries to stop me
He gonna get a one way ticket
To the promise land
(I'm preachin' now)
'Cuz I'm gonna cave in his casaba
I'm gonna pull it off
And then lay it in his hands

Phil Harris,"During the North African campaign, a bunch of soldier boys had
Been on a long hike and they arrived in a little town called Casino. The
Next morning being Sunday, several of the boys went to Church. A sergeant
Commanded the boys in Church and after the Chaplain had read the prayer
The text was taken up next. Those of the boys who had a prayer book took
Them out, but this one boy had only a deck of cards, and so he spread
Them out. The Sergeant saw the cards and said, ""Soldier, put away those
Cards."" After the services was over, the soldier was taken prisoner and
Brought before the Provost Marshall

The Marshall said, ""Sergeant, why have you brought this man
Here?"" ""For playing cards in church, Sir."" ""And what have you to say for
Yourself, son?"" ""Much, Sir,"" replied the soldier. The Marshall said, ""I
Hope so, for if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever
Punished."" The soldier said, ""Sir, I have been on the march for about six
Days. I have neither a Bible nor a prayer book, but I hope to satisfy
You, Sir, with the purity of my intentions."" And with that, the boy
Started his story:

""You see Sir, when I look at the Ace, it reminds me that there
Is but one God. And the Deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into
Two parts, the Old and the New Testaments. When I see the Trey, I think
Of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And when I see the Four, I
Think of the four Evangelists who preached the Gospel; there was Matthew

Mark, Luke and John. And when I see the Five, it reminds me of the five
Wise virgins who trimmed their lamps; there were ten of them: five were
Wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out. When I see the
Six, it reminds me that in six days, God made this great heaven and
Earth. When I see the Seven, it reminds me that on the seventh day, God
Rested from His great work. And when I see the Eight, I think of the
Eight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this earth; there was
Noah, his wife, their sons and their wives. And when I see the Nine, I
Think of the lepers our Savior cleansed, and nine out of the ten didn't
Even thank Him. When I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments God
Handed down to Moses on a table of stone. When I see the King, it
Reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I
See the Queen, I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is Queen of
Heaven. And the Jack or Knave is the Devil. When I count the number
Of spots on a deck of cards, I find 365, the number of days in a year
There are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year. There are 4 suits, the
Number of weeks in a month. There are 12 picture cards, the number of
Months in a year. There are 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter
So you see, Sir, my pack of cards serves me as a Bible, an Almanac and a
Prayer Book.""

Phil Harris,"While I was walkin' down the beach one bright and sunny day
I saw a great big wooden box a-floatin' in the bay
I pulled it in and opened it up and much to my surprise
Oh, I discovered a (Boom-ba-boom), right before my eyes
Oh, I discovered a (Boom-ba-boom), right before my eyes

I picked it up and ran to town as happy as a king
I took it to a guy I knew who'd buy most anything
But this is what he hollered at me as I walked in his shop
""Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), before I call a cop""
""Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), before I call a cop""

I turned around and got right out, a-runnin' for my life
And then I took it home with me to give it to my wife
But this is what she hollered at me as I walked in the door
""Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), and don't come back no more""
""Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), and don't come back no more""

I wandered all around the town until I chanced to meet
A hobo who was lookin' for a handout on the street
He said he'd take most any old thing, he was a desperate man
But when I showed him the (Boom-ba-boom), he turned around and ran
Oh, when I showed him the (Boom-ba-boom), he turned around and ran

I wandered on for many years a victim of my fate
Until one day I came upon St. Peter at the gate

A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long

I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""
And whispered in the sounds of silence",The Bare Necessities,1994

35 new shows to fill a few holes in their programming lineup.

Instead they turned out three Simpson's spin-off's.

I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
She was coming around the hill
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye

I said, that I come from Dixie land
Suzanne, don't you break down and cry
I said, oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me
Cause I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee","Oh, Susannah",2000

Fresh from the nuns that made you
Don't know why but I'm going to try
To re-in-celibate you

Momma's little jewel, you got the rules
But I'll be the one to educate you
Take what's mine, take a little time
And don't bite the hand that makes you

True when I hold you near, well I'm
Caught, even when I'm on the road
And I'm wearing my scorpio faces, when I
Come in the midnight sun

What you want I can't buy
So why don't you try it my way?
What you look for ain't in the book
I'm going to show you someday

Laugh in the evening, when I
Catch you with my watering gun now
Wearing my scorpio faces, when I
Come in the midnight sun

You won't rise, you won't shine
You won't even try boys
You've got brains, if you love changes
You'll have to play with my toys

Momma's little jewel is such a little fool
Thinks she can learn all the answers
She don't want to feel, she just want to steal
Don't want to take any chances

True when I hold you near, well I'm
Caught even when I'm on the road
And I'm wearing my scorpio faces, when I

Wanna laugh like a loon

Phil Hilborne,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

I know that my fear will be gone

Phil Keaggy,"A great sunny day, jump in the pick-up
And we'll go to the park, don't delay.
I know just the place, under the willow tree
The kids they all run and they play for so long,
They get you singing their song,
It's a bright and joyful melody,
Just kick off your blues, join in, be carefree.

Don't you know that everything is gonna be alright,
And haven't you heard the Father never lets you
Out of His sight, no no no no.

A great sunny day, love to be living
And I know there's just no better way to be in the race, 
Than giving up everything I know
That hindered my pace for so long,
You got me singing your song,
There's a bright and joyful melody,
Just put on my shoes, join in, be carefree.

Don't you know that everything is gonna be alright,

Way beyond mountain peaks a sun is ever showing.
Standing trees, evergreen, appear and stately planted,
We may not pass this way again, so take nothing for granted.

Sitting here to my right, a friend closer than brother,
Native of the land I see, loyal as no other.
Friendship is as one gives, the other one receptive,
We may not pass this way again, though we may be reflective.

Cherish the moment, perish the thought 
I can do as I intend.
We may have never been this way before,
We may never pass this way again.

That I'm glad I've come this way.

You took my hand and led me 
Out of darkness, oh yes.

Full circle, I have come,
You can ask me where I come from
And when I tell you that it's no lie
I've come full circle in my life.

I could hear your records play 
Around the world and in the States.
And those days were like a dream,
At times you're up then down it seems.
Will this last, what will be 
My life tomorrow, oh no.

Full circle, I have come,
You can ask me where I come from
And when I tell you that it's no lie
I've come full circle in my life.

With one touch of His hand 
I was made a newborn man.
What I had gained I left behind
It's drifting further back in time, bye bye.

I hang by a thread that will not break.
God loves the wayward child

In Adam we had our start,
And through him we drift apart,

There is a light that shines in darkness,
There is a lamp that lights the way,
May you find comfort in its glow,
May you know all there is to know,
May you find warmth within its rays.

Prisoners of human pride,

Our human need is crying out 
As greed eats to the marrow.
Do we ignore a suffering world just
To keep to the straight and narrow.

We turn aside to please ourselves,
And won't give the time of day,
To the victims of injustice in a world
When we turn and look and walk the other way.

And justifying ourselves we ask, is this my neighbor?

Don't pass me by, the night's so long,
Don't ask me why it all went wrong.

Phil Kelly,"My Museum

Romantic dreams of youth,
all the color and the light dazzled my eyes.
Love looked so promising from far away.
A world of hopes and possibilities of what life could be,
and every night and day I'd dream
of all I'd have in my museum.

Through landscapes blue and gold,
in the shadows and sunlight I searched for truth,
but my elusive muse seemed lost at sea.
And all I found were statues made of stone, lifelike, but so cold.
Their jaded hearts and marble souls
left empty halls in my museum. 

But still I wished for one work of art
I could treasure and hold.
Monet in spring, in twilight's dim
I'd dance for my Degas, could be Caravaggio,
or my Picasso. 

At last it's come to light. 
Now this rare and priceless gem defines my life,
and every corridor leads to this room.
A perfect place where light is never lost and time can't exist,
a single painting hangs just so,
my masterpiece in my museum;
a portrait of you.",My Museum,2006

Beware my foolish heart

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so

Phil Klein,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

It's no good unless he loves you, all the way

In his arms she fell as her hair came down among the fields of gold
 
Will you stay with me, will you be my love among the fields of barley?
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky as we lie in fields of gold
See the west wind move like a lover so upon the fields of barley.
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth among the fields of gold

But I swear in the days still left we'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold

Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down.

Up and down your carpeted halls

Somehow, babe, it got as hot as it gets
With her black leather and gold spike suspenders
And your chain, your black whip and pets.

Of the infamous Catherine the Great
And we know how you love the ovation
And the scene that it seems to create.

You laugh when I stumble and fall
There may come a say when I'll dance on your grave
Unable to dance I'll still crawl across it
Unable to dance I'll still crawl
Unable to dance I'll still crawl
Unable to dance I'll crawl.

It just might be your kind of zoo
I can't think of a place that's more perfect
For a person as perfect as you.

Come in the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn""

To a time so long ago
When the sweet Magnolia blossomed
Cotton fields as white as snow

Catfish John was a river hobo
Who lived and died by the river's bed
Looking back, I still remember
I was proud to be his friend

Traded for a chestnut mare

Though his load was hard to bear

Your fingers are neat and small
And your cheeks too red and rosy

To see ten thousand fall

And among the dead and dying
Her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found

She picked him up all in her arms
And carried him to the town
And sent for a physician who
Quickly healed his wounds

String barbed wire at your feet, that will not let you pass.

Phil Lesh,"Picture a bright blue ball
Just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky
Brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me
A peaceful place or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace, is the human face
But afraid, we may lay our home to waste

There's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Now watch as the ball revolves and the nighttime falls
And again the hunt begins and again the blood wind calls
By and by again, the morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes from some men's eyes

It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Staking turf, dividing up meat
Nightmare spook, piece of heat
It's you and me, you and me

Click, flash blade in ghetto night
Rudie's looking for a fight
Rat cat alley roll them bones
Need that cash to feed that jones
And the politician's throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Commissars and pin-striped bosses role the dice
Any way they fall guess who gets to pay the price
Money green or proletarian gray
Selling guns instead of food today

So the kids they dance, and shake their bones
And the politician's throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes all fall down

Heartless powers try to tell us what to think
If the spirit's sleeping, then the flesh is ink, yeah
History's page, it is thusly carved in stone
The future's here, we are it, we are on our own
On our own. On our own. On our own.

If the game is lost then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame
We will leave this place an empty stone
Or that shinning ball of blue we can call our home

So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
And the politicians, throwing stones
Singing ashes to ashes all fall down
Ashes to ashes, all fall down

Shipping powders back and forth
Singing ""black goes south and white comes north""
And the whole world full of petty wars
Singing ""I got mine and you got yours""
And the current fashions set the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
And the radical he rant and rage
Singing ""someone got to turn the page""
And the rich man in his summer home,
Singing ""Just leave well enough alone""
But his pants are down, his cover's blown

And the politicians throwing stones
So the kids they dance they shake their bones
Cause its all too clear we're on our own
Sing ashes to ashes, all fall down
Ashes to ashes, all fall down

Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
It's dizzying, the possibilities

If I had my way

Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks - God knows and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, she looked so fine

Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
Said tell me where your strength lies, if you please
Then she spoke so kind, she talked so fair
That Samson said, Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, cleanse my hand
My strength comes as natural as any other man

You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever had lived on earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand were dead

Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson he walked up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paw
Samson got hands up round the lion's jaw
He ripped that beast, killed it dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head","Samson and Delilah [Live at Providence Civic Center, Providence, RI 5/1",2015
Phil Lesh & Friends,"I never knew you
But then who really did?
If you were at all like me
You managed to keep yourself hid
A patchwork quilt of a life
Memories embroidered
On your soul

So please forgive me
For putting you in my song
But the spirit she moves me
In fact she pushes me along
It's a patchwork quilt of a life
Can't stop the river
Just let it roll

We were at Jones Beach
When we got the word
Saddest sound that I ever heard
The bluest note that nobody could play
Ravens sang with us that night on the stage
Tears of sadness, tears of rage
But nobody spoke, we all felt old
And in the way

So walk beside me
Or above me, I don't know
These days it sure seems
I'm lost where ever I go

God, how could you, I heard someone say
And what do we do with our lives now anyway?
Now that our North Star can no longer be found

But there's a banjo moon in a tie-dyed sky
Hippies dance and babies cry
Church bells ring as a silver-haired angel look down
And the blood of his music runs through the veins of our guitars
Bright lights, Dark Star

You managed to keep yourself hid",Patchwork Quilt,2002
Phil Lesh & Friends,"He wore a song around his neck
Like some medal of honor
He carried his wisdom like a knife
An empty pocket was a temporary chain
Knowing you've got it coming
Ain't no crime

Every blue note that rolled off his tongue
You could feel his soul twisting right in two
Nobody knew where he came from
Ah but everybody knew, everybody knew

He was the real thing
No doubt about it
The kind that you remember when they're gone
The real thing
Put here for a reason
We knew someday the whole world
Was going to know his name
He was the real thing

She whispered in his ear, and he heard the thunder
Singing 'bout a world he never knew
Head spinning round, he began to wonder
Was he made to love her, or born to sing the blues

He searched inside him for an answer
But all he found was a troubled mind
He left her somewhere on the blue highway
Oh it wasn't just another love that he left behind

It was the real thing
No doubt about it
The kind that you remember when it's gone
The real thing
Not like passion's fire
But a burning, smoldering, eternal flame
It was the real thing

And sometimes at night he longs for her whisper
But he hides from the dawn, 'cause he always wakes to find her gone

In some broken down dressing room in some major city
The thunder plays an old familiar tune
He spies a face of a distant angel
Outside, beneath the halo moon

Finger on the trigger, needle in the vein
One more bullet, it might be your last ride
This is ain't no no-show, this ain't no nervous breakdown
And it sure as hell ain't the time to let the fool decide

This is the real thing
No doubt about it
Who cares if they love you and you're gone
This is the real thing
So you were put here for a reason
But what gives you the right to quit when you're tired

The day that the earth quaked
I've seen buildings a-blazing
Throwing up in flames

Crying out to their God for mercy
But their God didn't listen

By the name of Nostradamus
Who prophesied that in the late twentieth century

A holocaust the likes of which
This planet had never seen
Now, I ask you
Do you believe this to be true

I was standing by the bedside
The night that my father died
He was crying out in pain
To his God he said, have mercy, mercy

Unknown to man so he expected no cure
But before he died that night
He was lost, insane

And the nights we spent together, riding on the range.
Looking back, it doesn't seem so strange.

But Lord all these southern girls, they seem the same.
But down below the border, in a town in Mexico,
I got my job busting broncs for the rodeo.

Roll me over, and I'll turn around.
And I'll move my fingers up and down.

God damn, it's so exciting
It hits you like a hammer

My girl walked in holding another guys hand
He stood six foot six he looked two miles wide
I was taking it easy till he took her outside

I was madder than hell fit to burn
This guy would break a leg before but now he's got to run
Standing in the corner giving him a thrill
You can keep your lover honey, but he's got to pay the bill

Well the place started rocking it was Saturday night
I was dressed to kill I was feeling alright
Alright in the middle of the night
I wasn't ready for a rumble but the mood was right

When he got up to leave
I stood in his way
I said love that's the price you have to pay
In the doorway up against the wall
When they play a heavy record then I'm gonna have a ball

We started to rumble and stumble
It is we were rocking and rolling and rolling and tumbling
I fumbled and started to win
When the greater than wicked then I hit him again

Fantastic, look at the dune field

Hey, wait. I'm getting a no go signal
Now I'm losing on of the craft
Hey, Bermuda, you getting it?

No, I lost contact
There's a lot of dust blowing up there
Now I've lost the second craft
We got problems
All contact lost, Pasadena
Maybe the antenna's

Kind of a green mist behind it
It's getting closer, you see it, Bermuda?

Tracking station 63, can you hear me, Madrid?

","The Red Weed, Pt. 2",1981
Phil Lynott,"I suddenly noticed the body of a parson lying on the ground in a ruined churchyard
I felt unable to leave him to the mercy of the red weed, and decided to bury him, decently

Nathaniel! Nathaniel!

The parson's eyes flickered open
He was alive!

Nathaniel, I saw the church burst into flame, are you all right?

Don't touch me!

But it's me, Beth! Your wife!

No! You're one of them - a devil!

He's delirious!

Lies! I saw the devil's sign!

What are you saying?

The green flash in the sky
His demons were here all along, in our hearts and souls
Just waiting for a sign from Him
And now they're destroying our world!

But they're not devils, they're Martians

We must leave here!

Look, a house still standing, come Nathaniel, quickly

We took shelter in a cottage, and black smoke spread, hemming us in
Then a fighting machine came across the field
Spraying jets of steam that turned the smoke into thick, black dust

Ulla!

Dear God, help us!

The voice of the Devil is heard in our land!

Listen, do you hear them drawing near
In their search for the sinners?
Feeding on the power of our fear
And the evil within us?
Incarnation of Satan's creation of all that we dread
When the demons arrive those alive would be better off dead!

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for!
And if one man can stand tall
There must be hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Once there was a time when I believed
Without hesitation
That the power of love and truth could conquer all
In the name of salvation
Tell me what kind of weapon is love when it comes to the fight?
And just how much protection is truth against all Satan's might?

There must be something worth living for
There must be something worth trying for
Even some things worth dying for
And if one man can stand tall
There must be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

People loved you, and trusted you, came to you for help

Didn't I warn them this would happen?
Be on your guard, I said, for the Evil One never rests
I said exorcise the devil!
But no, they wouldn't listen, the demons inside them grew and grew
Until Satan gave his signal and destroyed the world we knew!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Now darkness has descended on our land
And all your prayers cannot save us
Like fools we've let the devil take command
Of the souls that God gave us
To the altar of evil like lambs to the slaughter were led
When the demons arrive the survivors will envy the dead!

There must be something worth living for
(No, there is nothing!)
There must be something worth trying for
(I don't believe it's so!)
Even some things worth dying for
If just one man could stand tall
There would be some hope for us all
Somewhere, somewhere in the spirit of man

Forget about goodness and mercy, they're gone!

Didn't I warn them? Pray, I said! Destroy the devil, I said!
They wouldn't listen! I could have saved the world!
But now it's too late, too late!

No Nathaniel, oh no, Nathaniel
No Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the love we used to know
(No) Nathaniel, no, there must be more to life
There has to be a way that we can
Restore to life the light that we have lost

Dear God!
A cylinder's landed on the house
And we are underneath it, in the pit!

The Martians spent the night making a new machine
It was a squat, metallic spider with huge, articulated claws
But it, too, had a hood in which a Martian sat
I watched it pursuing some people across a field
It caught them nimbly and tossed them into a great metal basket upon its back

Beth! She's dead! Buried under the rubble Why?
Satan! Why did you take one of your own?

There is a curse on Mankind
We may as well be resigned
To let the devil, the devil take the spirit of man

As time passed in our dark and dusty prison
The Parson wrestled endlessly with his doubts
His outcries invited death for us both - and yet, I pitied him",The Spirit of Man,1981

And everyone that used her
Would let her take the blame
And if she dare refused

And if she dare resist
All suggestions that she made were quickly dismissed
'Til in the end in despair

She'd slit her wrists
Crying nobody cares
Believing that by dying she would not be missed
They found her on the stairs

If you take no names

Her daddy knows that somethings wrong
But decideds to leave the questions utill later on

From the corner of his mouth
He's late, he's missed that train again

All his fears deliverd with one blow

Or some preminition like we were told 
It was no figment of the imagination 
To prove that we could be bought or sold 
The doctor of the diamond run 
Could be revealed to the intellegent 
But this is what I resent Who cares for the ignorant, the 
intellegent The 
cynics approach was mean 
Who cares for anything in this whole wide world except me 
And this opinion must not confuse the issue 
My appearence, my condition, Or state of delivery 
I am stating the obvious 
This is a protest 
There must me a collusion 
This is no Shakespearean speach 
This is a statement 
Made by one who can not practice what he preaches 
The statue of liberty 
Has engraved on it's wall 
Give me your poor, give me your needy Give me them all 
We need something like this 
For this world to coexist 
It would be so easy To act so pretensious 
To act as if it was hypocracy 
To act condisending 
When in fact it's the world we're mending 
And that's why I can't relax 
Cause inside my coat it's a pistol that I pack 
We must beware of a suprise nuclear attack 
We must be ready to strike back 
I'm not pretending 
Our defense needs clearly mending 
We must leave those standing 
Forget the third world is ending 
Is starving, 
Is crying 
Is desolate, 
Is oh so late 
I would dearly love to return 
Through a mirror in twenty years 
And learn 
what the future has in store for us 
And if I learned that we lost 
And there was no hope 
For those that fight 
I would turn to drink 
And drink is drugs 
And drugs would help me sink 
And like of boat, I float 
I sail out to the sky 
To the universe and back 
Maybe to give it another try

Just to learn, just to heal us ",Ode to Liberty - Protest Song,1982

Phil Madeira,"So many preachers 
So many churches and denominations 
Got their opinions and their documents 
And statements and beliefs and sometimes 
There's a miscommunication

And we complicate the truth 
And convolute the story 
But as far as I recall I do believe it all

[Chorus]
Comes down to a man dying on a cross 
Saving the world Rising from the dead 
Doing what He said He would do 
Loving everyone He saw
When it's said and done it all
Comes down to a man dying on a cross 
Saving the world

It isn't a secret  And maybe I'm being simple minded 
But it's about Jesus and a way, a truth, a life 
That can change a heart and a soul forever 
And we need to be reminded

It's the power of the blood 
That brings us to redemption 
We can rise above the fall 
And the reason for it all

[Chorus]

All the people beneath the steeple 
Are just reaching 
For the truth that can save a helpless soul 
We wrestle with the mystery in the teaching 
But the news is all good I think that we should 
Remember one thing.",Saving the World,1999
Phil Manzanera,"Baby's on fire
Better throw her in the water
Look at her laughing
Like a heifer to the slaughter

Baby's on fire
And all the laughing boys are bitching
Waiting for photos
Oh the plot is so bewitching

Rescuers row row
Do your best to change the subject
Blow the wind blow blow
Lend some assistance to the object

Photographers snip snap
Take your time she's only burning
This kind of experience
Is necessary for her learning

If you'll be my flotsam
I could be half the man I used to
They said you were hot stuff
And that's what baby's been reduced to

Juanita and Juan
Very clever with maracas
Making their fortunes
Selling secondhand tobaccoes

Juan dances at Chico's
And when the clients are evicted
He empties the ashtrays
And pockets all that he's collected

But baby's on fire
And all the instruments agree that
Her temperature's rising
But any idiot would know that
",Baby's on Fire,1976
Phil Manzanera,"Along the wing you see the searchlight beam
Down below, traced freeway stream
A field of precious stones illuminates the night
Heading for touchdown, looking for runway light

From in the sky the city's at its best
Down the hills to its ocean's rest
And as you watch the lightscape sit back, relax and dream
This is the future, this is tomorrow's scheme

We're coming in, the runway flashes past
This is it, now we're here at last
We've tried to make this crossing so many times before
See that people walking through heaven's door

We're finally here, it looks just fine
Let's stroll the streets, sidewalk sign
Stand and wait and watch the cars
As they smoke on, go by so fast
They look just fine, we'll cross at last
The headlights flicker in our faces

Try to eat some fetid meat
Yours tastes just fine, same as mine
If you can pay, it happens here
Do what you say, will be tonight's career
While guarantee hot company
The red light flickers in their faces

Roll up your sleeve, pass it round
It's what you seek, dope in town
Feels just fine to be with you
Your place or mine, I'll show you what to do
And in the nights, you'll come on through
Walking through heaven's door

Walking through heaven's door

Phil Manzanera,"From that open mouth
Through those burning teeth
By that lashing tongue
You have the power of speech

Vibrating air
From lungs that are pumping
Sets those vocal discords
That sets your heart jumping

Got a bright green light
Flashing in my face
Instead of someone's eyes
I get a visual display

Used to be flesh and blood
Right in front of me
Now a picture comes up
On a video screen

Whoa, where do we take it from here?
Don't you know it's not right
To remain in this silence

I want you to talk to me
I'm getting no reaction
Won't you talk to me?
Talk to me
I'm getting interaction
Won't you talk to me?

You're an ATM from BCCI
An automate on, drive a GTI
Keep your shield intact, down reality
You're in another world, you don't listen to me

You're a rhythm machine
You've got perfect time
Recline your seat
And you'll turn on a dime

Robotic voice, aluminum frame
I'm so glad that you asked
Yes, I'm glad that I came

Whoa, where do we take it from here?
Don't you know it's not right
To remain in this silence

I want you to talk to me
Giving you my number
Won't you talk to me?
Talk to me
Getting into trouble
Won't you talk to me?

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Phil Manzanera,"All the peasants in the squares
At their tables and their chairs
Set to salvage certain numbers
From the wonder of the Tundra
And the muses in the gloom
Counting needles in their rooms
On the carpet in the corner
In a kind of secret slumber
While the in formation rain
Slashed the dirty windowpane to the square

Smoky broads and smoky windows in the square
Come come charmer come on over for the day
Disappearing cocoa forests flash and die
Fortunes crumble all demolished in the bay

Over forty pointed people
In the perfect pointed steeple
Looked to see the lucky number
Yes the wonder of the Tundra
Had come up to fame and fortune
Singing his tune, my tune, your tune
Wooing daughters of the gifted
On the carpets of the courtrooms
While the tickets were expensive
The show was quite relentless in the square

Lurking about in no-man's land

And You'll never have to say.

Non è mai stata cosa mia, ti amo ma vorrei di più
Ti scappo ma non me ne vado, ti parlo e invece ti urlerei
Perché anche quando stai vicino mi manchi che neanche sai
Perché sto distrutto che però sto bene, ora sto male che però fa bene
E non so se ti diverti o se ti manco, a me tanto
Ora non so se è il caso di toccare il fondo
La pioggia cade sempre in basso, io però ti voglio adesso
E non so, se è caldo, freddo oppure niente
So che ti voglio ad occhi chiusi in mezzo a tante
Fortuna che non era niente, e allora spiegami perché
Sto qui insieme un po' di gente fischiettando una che non c'è",Fortuna Che Non Era Niente,2000
Phil Minton,"Se fosse un'avventura vorrei poter guidare per poi lasciarla andare
Se fosse un'autostrada ci guiderei da solo per poi prendere il volo
Se il giorno fosse buio la notte avesse il sole
Ma restano parole
E se la mia chitarra suonasse anche da sola
Peccato che non vola
Se la vita corre la lascerò girare
Farò del mio meglio per non farla rallentare
Se la fantasia mi porterà lontano mi farà vedere le cose più da vicino
Scavalcherò montagne e campi di bambù
Traverserò l'oceano con una nave che non c'è più
E mentre il mare aumenta
Aumenta l'emozione e quando me ne accorgo è nata una canzone
Che parlerò d'amore, ma solo se costretto
Andrò insieme al mio gatto a miagolarti sopra il tetto
Così guarderò il cielo che forse è un'illusione
Vorrei poter pregare ma non so quale religione
Se la vita corre la lascerò girare
Farò del mio meglio per non farla rallentare
Se fosse un'avventura da raccontare a tutti
C'era una volta un uomo che sognava a denti stretti
E che prendeva il volo anche senza ali
Girava tutto il mondo inseguendo ideali
Cercava un'altra strada che porti alla saggezza
Qualcosa che riesca a cancellare l'amarezza
D tanti giorni inutili vissuti d nascosto
Costretto a stare fermo e non lasciare mai il suo posto
Davanti l'arcobaleno ancora in bianco e nero
Seduto ad aspettare il giorno che diventi vero
Se la vita corre la lascerò girare
Farò del mio meglio per non farla rallentare
Se la vita corre allora corro anch'io
Fino a che mi fermerà un giorno qualche dio
Se fosse un'avventura avrebbe mille colori
E se non è così allora sono fuori",Fuori,2000
Phil Minton,"Appuntamento a mezzogiorno in piazza
La macchina l'ho controllata già
Quest'anno sarà proprio grande vacanza
È un anno che l'aspetto e tra un'ora si va

In quattro amici destinazione mare
Maschera e pinne non ci servono
Camicie giuste per andare a ballare
Che tanto il vero mare non si vede più

Ma quei locali visti sulle riviste
Leggende metropolitane o no?
Si era parlato di seimila cubiste
E questo è tutto quello che per ora so

Ma quell'amico un po' più grande aveva detto
State in campana che non è proprio così
Io ci sono già stato e allora vi consiglio
Se fossi in voi ci andrei organizzato così

Io con la ragazza mia, tu con la ragazza tua
Lei con il ragazzo suo e a te con chi ti pare a te
Io con la ragazza mia, tu con la ragazza tua
Lei con il ragazzo suo e a te con chi ti pare a te

La prima sera subito in discoteca
Madonna qui che atmosfera c'è
Non sono mai stato meglio neanche a una partita
Mi sembra proprio questo il posto giusto per me

Mentre ballavo si avvicina una tipa
Mi guarda e penso già che è pazza di me
Mi sento grande in questo mondo formica
Ci parlo due minuti e tutto viene da sé

Ma quell'amico grande mi tornava in mente
Diceva è inutile che andate fino lì
Vi divertite ma non conquistate niente
Secondo me è meglio organizzati così

Io con la ragazza mia, tu con la ragazza tua
Lei con il ragazzo suo e a te con chi ti pare a te
Io con la ragazza mia, tu con la ragazza tua
Lei con il ragazzo suo e a te con chi ti pare a te
Io con la ragazza mia, tu con la ragazza tua
Lei con il ragazzo suo e a te con chi ti pare a te
Io con la ragazza mia, tu con la ragazza tua
Lei con il ragazzo suo e a te con chi ti pare a te

Arriva il punto di restare da soli
Le dico prendi le tue cose e via
Andiamo fuori mia regina di cuori
Continuiamo a bere nella stanza mia

Prendo le chiavi e avverto gli amici
Mezzo minuto poi mi giro e non c'è
Mi guardo intorno e dopo un attimo vedo
Che parla con un altro grosso il doppio di me

Vi giuro che non ho potuto fare niente
M'ha rovinato le vacanze quello lì
Che con la scusa dell'amico intelligente
Mi ha portato sfiga e adesso canto così

Io con la ragazza mia, tu con la ragazza tua
Lei con il ragazzo suo e a te con chi ti pare a te
Io con la ragazza mia, tu con la ragazza tua
Lei con il ragazzo suo e a te con chi ti pare a te

Phil Minton,"Una lucciola si fa luce da sola
Vivrà poco ma questo lei già lo sa
Vive solo di notte però non importa
Perché è solo così che sa vivere
Ogni notte su e giù in due metri di strada
Ogni tanto una macchina passerà
Fino a che la notte finirà e speriamo intanto
Mio figlio crescerà
Questa notte fa freddo
Fortuna c'è il fuoco
A me sembra tanto
Per tutti gli altri è poco
Ogni vicolo piange
Ogni vicolo è cieco
Vede quello che vuole
Tutto il resto no
C'è una notte con le stelle nel cielo
Fanno specchio a 1000 fuochi in una città
Ma una lucciola che si fa luce da sola
Vede solo il mondo vero, bello o no
Non c'è uomo che sprechi per lei un pensiero
Non c'è uomo abbastanza uomo da amarla un po'
Troppo facile parlare così,
Giudicare, se non sai perché e per come lo fa
Fino a che un giorno capirai
Che è la vita a scegliere il ruolo che farai
Troppo facile parlare così, giudicare
Se non sai perché e per come lo fa
E quando poi la vita finirà
Speriamo che qualcuno piangerà
Una lucciola si fa luce da sola,
Vivrà poco ma questo lei già lo sa
Un uomo guida piano e si ferma
Un altro ha già finito, saluta e se ne va",Lucciola,2000
Phil Minton,"Hey, papà, stammi a sentire
ti ricordi quella volta che siamo andati a pedalare
con le biciclette stanche, con le mani sporche e vuote
eravamo come fratelli, uguali come 2 ruote
ti ricordi la domenica mi portavi con te allo stadio
quella volta che m'hai preso in braccio con la curva sotto assedio
la gente che scappava, sembrava una guerriglia
io sembravo un'ostrichetta e tu la mia grande conchiglia

Hey, papà, la sera in televisione
si guardava di tutto e niente col tuo zapping da campione
e mamma che sbuffava, e noi litigavamo
eravamo così uguali eppure non ci capivamo
noi, confusi dalla vita e dal lavoro
da una vita che non si è scelta ma che ci sembrava d'oro
bianco & nero come un film degli anni '30
anche se me ne hai fatte tante, la mia fiamma non si è spenta
e sto qui a cantare col tuo sangue nelle vene
me ne hai fatte tante ma ti voglio bene

Hey, mamma, guardami adesso
sempre lo stesso figlio anche se non parliamo spesso
come quando da bambino che sembravi mia sorella
ti vedevo in mezzo agli altri ed eri sempre la più bella
mi ricordo che stavamo praticamente sempre insieme
tua unica missione era farmi stare bene
anche quando invece non era tutto a posto
mi guardavi sorridendo e soffrivi di nascosto
e quando arrivava l'estate andavamo sempre al mare
con la macchina senza radio pensavamo noi a cantare
le canzoni di Bennato, Battisti e De Gregori
eravamo sull'asfalto ma sembrava in mezzo ai fiori
e poi la sera non volevo mai dormire
e tu anche se eri stanca mi venivi a coccolare
e ancora adesso che non stiamo tanto insieme
penso a quei momenti d'oro se ho bisogno di star bene
passa il tempo siamo grandi in un istante
ma sei ancora la mia voce più importante

Quante volte vi ho pensati nei momenti più importanti
quando solo sopra a un palco affrontavo i miei giganti
quando in macchina di notte con l'Europa da scoprire
fare finta di star bene per non farvi preoccupare
quante volte ho detto basta ma chi me lo fa fare
però poi pensando a voi non riuscivo mai a mollare
questa vita di speranze ma piena d'emozioni
questa vita che racconto spesso nelle mie canzoni
qualcosa che va oltre la realtà
e che non finirà mai",Mamma & Papà,2000
Phil Minton,"In un giorno come tanti, con il traffico nel centro
Con 2 suore che camminano vicine in una piazza
Con un grande monumento
Con l'america nei bar
Con la moda sempre in festa
Con la gente che lavora sempre troppo
E una strana atmosfera di conquista
Con I taxi sempre un po' incazzati
E I turisti anche loro un po' di fretta
Con sempre quella strana
Voglia di andar via perchè altrove
Forse, c'è qualcuno che ci aspetta
È milano, con I suoi 1.000 dialetti
Con le settimane lunghe e con gli uffici
Con le abbronzature a 100.000 watt
E con la vita appesa a 1.000 sacrifici
In un albergo verso il centro ci sto io
E una finestra che s'affaccia sul cemento
Mentre festeggio un anno di malinconia
Con la chitarra per dividere il momento
Anche qui può arrivare l'odore del mare a prendermi
E se domenica non ho niente da fare
Farò I miei soliti due passi tra i palazzi
E faccio finta d star bene almeno un po'
Anche se dentro invece cado a pezzi
E se avrò bisogno di dimenticare
Prenderò per mano l'ansia e anche la rabbia
Le accompagnerò per un aperitivo al bar
E al punto giusto le abbandono tra la nebbia
In un albergo verso il centro c'è una donna,
Vive nel lusso ma con gli occhi tristi
Anche stasera toglierò la gonna
Per regalarla ai soliti professionisti
Anche qui può arrivare l'odore del mare a prendermi",Milano,2000
Phil Minton,"Perché c'è un chiodo che vorrei proprio staccare
Per far cadere un vecchio quadro di valore
Restare in piedi davanti il muro
Per guardare l'attimo in cui cade a terra e fa rumore
Vorrei quel quadro fosse fatto d persone
Così cadendo cambia l'organizzazione
Perché la terra sta finendo e va salvata
E allora serve che quel quadro cada giù in picchiata
Stanco di mangiare verdura ritoccata
Frutta di plastica e carne ossigenata
Pesce ricostruito in un laboratorio
Che nasce vive e nuota solo in un grande acquario
Chi organizza e decide tutto questo
Viene protetto e scusatemi se insisto
La colpa delle cose che vi ho raccontato
È tutta di quel quadro e per questo va spaccato
Buttalo buttalo giù, spaccalo a terra
A me quel quadro fa schifo e faccio la guerra
Sembra che quando era tutto in bianco e nero
Le cose avessero più sapore
Ma poi il quadro si è evoluto e avanti tutta
Giochiamo col DNA della pastasciutta
Noi respiriamo solamente aria nera
Vorrei non crederci però la cosa è seria
Col calcio e le canzoni la testa è in aria
E intanto ci organizzano la mafia sanitaria
Prendono in giro coi discorsi sull'ambiente
Parlano tanto però non succede niente
Il quadro intanto con i suoi discordi chiari
Ci parlerà di quei banali errori nucleari
Mette le donne in televisione
Ci fa guardare solo tette al silicone
Ci prende in giro, non ci da un domani
Se prendo io quel quadro lo spacco con le mie mani
Buttalo buttalo giù, spaccalo a terra
A me quel quadro fa schifo e faccio la guerra
Io con quel quadro ci vorrei proprio parlare
Vorrei sapere come fanno a non capire
Che se continuano coi loro esperimenti
Diventeremo tutti meno divertenti
Diventeremo dei cartoni animati
Perché è così che loro ci hanno programmati
Sogni d gloria e grazie ricevute
Saranno solo un misero bug del computer
Adesso basta non si può più andare avanti
A costo di lasciarci tutti i miei denti
Prendo quel quadro e ci faccio il fuoco
Perché la mia unica vita non è un gioco
Buttalo buttalo giù, spaccalo a terra
A me quel quadro fa schifo e faccio la guerra",Il Quadro,2000
Phil Minton,"Voglio restare tutto il giorno nella vasca
Con l'acqua calda che mi coccola la testa
Un piede fuori che s'infreddolisce appena
Uscire solo quando è pronta già la cena
Mangiare e bere sempre e solo a dismisura
Senza dover cambiare buco alla cintura
E poi domani non andrò neanche al lavoro
Neanche avvertirò perché il silenzio è d'oro
Tornerò con gli amici davanti scuola
Ma senza entrare, solo fuori a far la ola
Non ci saranno ripetenti punto e basta
Staremo tutti insieme nella stessa vasca
Così grande che ormai è una piscina
Staremo a mollo dalla sera alla mattina
Così che adesso è troppo piena e non si può più stare
È meglio trasferirci tutti quanti al mare
Quando fa buio accenderemo un grande fuoco
Attaccheremo un maxi schermo e un grande gioco
E dopo inseguimenti vari e varie lotte
Faremo tutti un grande bagno a mezzanotte

Mi bagno, mi tuffo, mi giro e mi rilasso
Mi bagno, m'asciugo e inizia qui lo spasso
E mi ribagno, mi rituffo, mi rigiro e mi rilasso
Mi ribagno mi riasciugo e ricomincia qui lo spasso

Saremo più di cento, quasi centoventi
Amici conoscenti e anche i parenti
Con il cocomero e la Coca Cola fresca
Con le chitarre a dirci che non è Francesca
Aspetteremo le prime luci del mattino
Festeggeremo con cornetti e cappuccino
E quando stanchi dormiremo sulla sabbia
Le nostre camere scolpite nella nebbia
Ma dormiremo poche ore quanto basta
Per poi svegliarci e rituffarci nella vasca

Mi bagno, mi tuffo, mi giro e mi rilasso
Mi bagno, m'asciugo e inizia qui lo spasso
E mi ribagno, mi rituffo, mi rigiro e mi rilasso
Mi ribagno mi riasciugo e ricomincia qui lo spasso
Voglio restare tutto il giorno in una vasca
Con le mie cose più tranquille nella testa
Un piede fuori come fosse una bandiera
Uscire solo quando fuori è primavera
Ma spero solo questa mia fantasia
Non sia soltanto un altro attacco di utopia
Perché per questo non c'è ancora medicina
Che mi trasformi la mia vasca in piscina
E tantomeno trasformare tutto in mare
Però qualcuno lo dovrebbe inventare

Mi bagno, mi tuffo, mi giro e mi rilasso
Mi bagno, m'asciugo e inizia qui lo spasso
E mi ribagno, mi rituffo, mi rigiro e mi rilasso
Mi ribagno mi riasciugo e ricomincia qui lo spasso",La Vasca,2000

Where have I been all these years?

There were chills up my spine 
And some thrills I can't define
