George Freeman,"Good morning heartache, you old gloomy sight
Good morning heartache, thought we said goodbye last night
I turned and tossed until it seemed you had gone
But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down",Good Morning Heartache,1972
George Freeman,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Once you have found her, never let her go,
Once you have found her, never let her go.",Some Enchanted Evening,1972
George Freeman,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1974
George Freeman,"I wish I knew someone like you could love me
I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance?
I wish I knew, but only you can answer.

If you don't care, why let me hop[e and pray so
Don't lead me on, if I'm a fool just say so,
Should I keep dreaming on, or just forget you?
What shall I do, I wish I knew",I Wish I Knew,1995
George Freeman,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while",Once in a While,1999
George Freeman,"Love walked right in and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you",Love Walked In,2009
George French,"No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
Bye, bye, blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye, bye

Bye, bye, blackbird
Where somebody waits for me

Blackbird, bye, bye",Bye Bye Blackbird,1996
George French,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".",Mood Indigo,1996
George Furlow,"And if you'll see Andmoreagain
Then you will know Andmoreagain
For you can see you in her eyes
Then you feel your heart beating
Thrum-pum-pum-pum

And when you've given all you had
And everything still turns out
Bad, and all your secrets are your own
Then you feel your heart beating
Thrum-pum-pum-pum

And I'm
Wrapped in my armor
But my things are material
And I'm
Lost in confusions
'Cause my things are material

And you don't know how much
I love you
Oh, oh, oh...

And if you'll see Andmoreagain
Then you might be Andmoreagain
For you just wish and you are here
Then you feel your heart beating
Thrum-pum-pum-pum",Faithful,2001
George Gaffney,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,2000
George Gaffney,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Love Is Here to Stay,2000

George Gao,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,2007

George Garzone,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1999

George Gaynes,"It's love, it's love
Well, who would've thought it?
If this is love then why have I fought it
What a way to feel I could touch the sky
What a way to feel I have found my guy

It's love at last I have someone to cheer for
It's love at last I've learned what I'm here for
I've heard it said, ""You know it when you see it""
Well, I see it and I know it, it's love

It's love, it's love
Well, who would've thought it?
If this is love then why have I fought it
What a way to feel I could touch the sky
What a way to feel I have found my guy

When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do

Here's the thing to know,

I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !

And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day.

Every new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.

Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;

There lived an Alpine miss
And oh, what a sweet little miss was this
We mean this little Swiss miss

While down in the valley below (Ho-ho)
Lived a boy who loved her so (Ho-ho)
He loved her with all his might
He loved her day and night

He used to risk his scalp

He used to stand around and try to make a hit with her
And he would yodel, ""O-lay-eee-tee""

And oh, what a yodeling fool was he
He shook a wicked yodel

And one night as he stood there
The lights were very dim
While leaning out too far across her balcony
She fell for him
He sat with his arms around her
Until the night was gone
And here's the way they carried on

He said, ""Dear I think you're just as sweet as you can be
You're like a cake of sweet Swiss chocolate to me""
She said, ""Oh, my loving one, your talk I can't resist
I hope you're as steady as the Swiss watch ticking on your wrist""

The magic of Aladdin couldn't do as much
She's a wizard, she's a champ
And she doesn't need a lamp

A woman's touch can weave a spell
The kind of hocus pocus that she does so well
With the magic of a broom
She can mesmerize a room

With a whisk whisk here and a whisk whisk there
And a dustpan for the cinders
With a rub rub here and a rub rub there
She can polish up the winders

Then presto chango 
Suddenly, the sun comes shining through
And what does Mr Sunshine say to you?
How d'you do?

It makes you blink, to stop and think
A woman and a whisk-broom 
Can accomplish so darn much
So never under-estimate a woman's touch

A woman's touch can quickly fill
The empty flower boxes on a window sill
One smile from her and zoom
Little buds begin to bloom  

A touch of paint, a magic nail
Can turn a kitchen chair into a Chippendale
Even make the lamp appear
Like a crystal chandelier

With a tack tack here and a tack tack there
And a hand around a hammer
With a mop mop here and a mop mop there
You can give a cabin glamour

Then gosh, almighty, all at once
The cabin that we knew
Becomes a shining castle built for two
Me and you

The pies and cakes a woman bakes
Can make a fella tell her 
That he loves her very much

When it'll drive me insane.

Why I'm always shaking

But now you're doing wrong; 
When you start to patter 

I'm so unhappy.

Somewhere far away off  

And make it snappy!

Along comes a girl, zip goes a dream!

I feel the future will be blue and stormy

Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !

Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.

Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.

You're sure to win out.

Which beats the latest thing from France.

Nearly reach the sky
Then like my dreams they fade and die
Fortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere

Pretty bubbles in the air

When shadows creep, when I'm asleep
To lands of hope I stray
Then at daybreak, when I awake
My bluebird flutters away

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Quite the best looking doctor in the state,
He looked after my physical condition
And his bedside manner was great!

When I'd gaze up and see him there above me,
Looking less like a doctor than a Turk,
I was tempted to whisper, ""Do you love me,
Or do you merely love your work?""

He said my bronchial tubes were entrancing,
My epiglottis filled him with glee,
He simply loved my larynx
And went wild about my pharynx,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my epidermis was darling
And found my blood as blue as can be,
He went through wild ecstatics
About my lymphatics,
But he never said he loved me.

And though, no doubt, it was not very smart of me,
I get on a-wracking of my soul,
to figure out why he loved every part of me,
And yet not me as a whole.

By my esophagus he was ravished,
Enthusiastic to a degree,
He said 'twas just enormous,
My appendix vermiformis,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my cerebellum was brilliant,
And my cererum far from N G,
I know he thought a lotta
My medulla oblogota,
But he never said he loved me.

He said my maxillaries were marvels,
And found my sternum stunning to see,
He did a double hurdle
When I shook my pelvic girdle,
But he never said he loved me.

He seemed amused,
When he first made a test of me
To further his medical art;
Yet he refused,
When he's fixed up the rest of me,
To cure that ache in my heart.

And for my spleen was keen as can be,

I know it's so, but dearie, oh!
You'll never know the blues that go right through me
I've got the you-don't-know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues

If you should marry Tom, Dick, or harry,
Life would be the bunk, I'd become a monk

To Bill and Ben I'd pay attention now and then
But really men would bore me
When I'd begun to think I'd run and be a nun
I met the one man for me
And now just when the sun is starting to beam
Along comes a girl, zip goes a dream!
What will I do away from you?
I feel the future will be blue and stormy
I've got the you-don't-know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues
It may be my heart isn't broken, but there's a bruise.
Through you I've known some days that were lonesome
Though you say that i'm flirting all the time
I've got the you-don-t know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues!

I've got the you-don't-know-the-half-of-it-dearie blues

George Gruntz,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2000
George Gruntz Concert Jazz Band,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2006
George Guest,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light

And just walk around just wander around
Where amber lights gleam and blue shadows fall
Just dreaming a dream of my China doll

Well he caught him a train up in Frisco headin' back to Tennessee
Thinking of a mom and daddy that used to rock him on their knees
No more fishing in the creek with daddy no huntin' when the leaves turn brown
Every turn of the wheel seemed to tell him son you gone and let us down
Won't you come on home boy

He walked up to the cabin as it was gettin' dark
So blue by the doorstep wondered why he didn't bark
He called but nobody answered he looked around and then he cried

I've kept it locked inside my heart and smiled though all my tears

Each night within my lonely world I cried dear over you
And prayed to God the things will turn out right
But when the dawn of day appears I brush away my tears

I'll just go on pretending that my life is oh so gay
And happy dear without you by my side
When all the time my heart keeps longing just to have you near

And wander in my words and dream about the pictures that I play of changes

Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall to brown and to yellow they fade
And then they have to die trapped within the circle time parade of changes

Moments of magic will glow in the night all fears of the forest are gone
For when the morning breaks they're swept away by golden drops of dawn of changes

Passions will part to a warm melody as fires will sometimes turn cold
Like petals in the wind we're puppets to the silver strings of souls of changes

Your tears will be trembling now we're somewhere else one last cup of wine we will pour
I'll kiss you one more time and leave you on the rolling river shore of changes",Changes,1966

And talk about the hometown a million miles away
Is the ice still in the river are the old folks still the same
And by the way did she mention my name
And by the way did she mention my name just in passing
And when the morning came do you remember if she dropped a name or two
Is the homesteam still on fire do they still win all their games
And by the way did she mention my name
[ harmonica ]
Is the landlord still a loser do his signs hang on the wall
Are the young girls still as pretty in the city in the fall
Does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame
And by the way did she mention my name
Did she mention my name just in passing
And when the talk ran high did the look in her eyes seem far away
Is the old roof still leaking when the lakes all turn to rain
And by the way did she mention my name

Did she mention my name...
And by the way did she mention my name

George Hamilton IV,"I know your leaving's too long overdue
For far too long I've had nothing new to show you
Goodbye dry eyes I've watched your plain feet off west to the moon
It felt so strange to walk away alone
No regrets no tears goodbye don't want you back we'd only cry again
Say goodbye again

The hours that were yours echo like empty rooms
The thoughts we used to share I now keep alone
I woke last night and spoke to you not thinking you were gone
It felt so strange to lie awake alone
No regrets no tears goodbye

Our friends have tried to turn my nights to day

Just beyond the darkest hour just behind the dawn
Still feels so strange to leave my life alone

George Hamilton IV,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by you can stay the night beside her
And you know she's half crazy but that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
Just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wave length and she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover
And you want to travel with her and you want to travel blind
And you know she will trust you
'Cause you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time searching from his lonely wooden tower
And just when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
He said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them
But he himself was broken long before the sky would open
Forsaken almost human he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him and you want to travel blind
And you think may be you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river
She's weaving rags and feathers from salvation army counters
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbour
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed there are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror
And you want to travel with her and you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind",Suzanne,1969

Moments gone forever I've relived them there it seem

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me

George Hamilton IV,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound

We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Now I prove again that I can make life move again.

George Harrison,"Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand here in the rain
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls

She takes just like a woman
She makes love just like a woman
And then she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamines, and her pearls

She takes just like a woman
She makes love just like a woman
And then she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

It was raining from the first, and I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear

That I just can't fit
I believe it's time for us to quit
But when we met again, are introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry, and it was your world

You take just like a woman
You make love just like a woman
And then you ache just like a woman
But you break just like a little girl",Just like a Woman,1971
George Harrison,"My love, she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn't have to say she's faithful
Yet she's true like ice, like fire
People carry roses
And make promises by the hour
My love she laughs like the flowers
Valentines can't buy her

In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books, repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall
Some speak of the future
My love, she speaks softly
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all

The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even the pawn must hold a grudge
Statues made of matchsticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge

The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers' nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring
The wind howls like a hammer
The night wind blows cold n' rainy
My love, she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing",Love Minus Zero/No Limit,1971

Living in the material world

can't say what I'm doing here

After living in the material world

I got born into the material world
Getting worn out in the material world
Use my body like a car,
Taking me both near and far
Met my friends all in the material world

Met them all there in the material world
John and Paul here in the material world
Though we started out quite poor
We got 'Richie' on a tour
Got caught up in the material world

From the Spiritual Sky,
Such sweet memories have I
To the Spiritual Sky
How I pray
Yes I pray
That I won't get lost
Or go astray

As I'm fated for the material world
Get frustrated in the material world
Senses never gratified
Only swelling like a tide
That could drown me in the
Material world

From the Spiritual Sky,
Such sweet memories have I
To the Spiritual Sky
How I pray
Yes I pray
That I won't get lost
Or go astray

Got a lot of work to do
Try to get a message through
And get back out of this material world

Who will stand,
And who will fall?

I've been run down
I can see quite clearly now
Through those past years,
When I played towing the line.
I only ask, that what I feel,
Should not be denied me now,
As it's been earned, and
I have seen my life belongs to me
My love belongs to who can see it

I've been out there,

That I've changed
That I'm not what I was
How it really is a shame
The thoughts in their heads,
Manifest on their brow
Like bad scars from ill feelings
They themselves arouse
So hateful of anyone that is happy
Or 'free'
They live all their lives,
Without looking to see
The light that has lighted the world

It's funny how people, just won't
Accept change
As if nature itself - they'd prefer
Re-arranged
So hard to move on
When you're down in a hole
Where there's so little chance,
To experience soul

I'm grateful to anyone,
That is happy or 'free'
For giving me hope
While I'm looking to see

The light that has lighted the world

You may think about a lady
Cause yourself a minor war
And your life won't be so easy anymore

No sooner had I sown it
When I began to reap
I was torn from shallow water
And plunged into the deep
And as I started drowning
I clung onto a straw
That somehow kept me floating
While my madness craved for more

The rest is simply shady
It's all been done and more
But it doesn't make life easy
That's for sure

A pebble in the ocean
Must cause some kind of stir
And witnessed by the silence
Will reach from here to there
The action that I've started
Sometime I'll have to face
My influence in motion
Rebounding back through space

The rest is simply shady

In his heart at arm's length

Held within its great strength
To ward off such a great despair
But he feels so alone
With no love of his own

Take the dawn of the day
And give it away
To someone who can fill the part
Of the dream we once held

So he worked 'til the pieces fit

He is faster than everyone
Quicker than the blinking of an eye
Like a flash you could miss him going by
No one knows quite how he does it
But it's true, they say
""He's the master of going faster""

Now he moved into the space
That the special people share
Right on the edge of do or die
Where there is nothing left to spare

Still the crowds came pouring in
Some had hoped to see him fail
Filling their hearts with jealousies
Crazy people with love so frail

George Harrison,"You can worry your life away with
Not knowing what each new day may bring to you
Or take each day as it goes on
Wake up to the love that flows on, around you.

If you believe if you believe in you
Everything you thought is possible, if you believe,
If you believe in me,
All your love's reflected back to you
When you believe.

Too many troubles you can't control
To get you falling into the holes they dig for you
Get up - you have all your needs; pray
Give up - and it all recedes away from you.

Everything you thought is possible, if you believe 
If you believe in me
All your love's reflected back to you

Like a snowflake falling

As a warm sun rises
Into joy, I'm sailing

Fixed by their charm, take my control
Love so sweet as the ocean is wide
Caught by your waves and drawn to your side

As a cool wind blows me

George Harrison,"I ate it and at once my eyes could see you
No sooner had I ooped it down
I felt so far off from the ground I stood on

My legs seemed to me like high-rise buildings
My head was high up in the sky
My skin the sun began to fry like bacon

And then somebody old appeared and asked had I come far
And hadn't they just seen me up on Haleakala
I kept on body surfing to pretend I hadn't heard
There was someone there beside me, swimming like Richard III
And I'm still smiling

Seven naked native girls swam seven sacred pools
Lone-ranger smoking doobies said you're breaking all the rules
Better get your clothes on or else there'll be a row
If it wasn't for my sunstroke I would take you on right now
And I'm still smiling

I fell in love with my soft-hearted Hana
She entered right in through my heart
And now although we're miles apart
I still feel her

She lives beneath the crater in the meadow
She moves among the fruit and grain
You can meet her after heavy rain has fallen

Right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short-haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long

Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Oh, baby I'm in love with you
So glad you came here
It won't be the same now I'm telling you

You know you picked me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown

Got me escaping from the zoo
Oh, baby I'm in love with you
So glad you came here
It won't be the same now I'm telling you

If I'll grow up I'll be a singer
Wear rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
Live and love and maybe someday
Who knows baby you may comfort me, yeah

I may appear to be imperfect
But my love is something you can't reject
Changing faster than the weather
You and me should get together
Who knows baby you may comfort me

I want the love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late

For your sweet tough lip I'm in the queue
Oh, baby I'm in love with you
So glad you came here

Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt
To play around in

Have you see the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts
To play around in

In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a darn good whacking

Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives
To eat their bacon

My heart's beatin' rhythm and my soul is a-singing the blues
Roll over beethoven and tell tchaikowsky the news

I got a rockin' pneumonia, I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I think I got it off the writer sittin' down at the rhythm review
Roll over beethoven, we're rockin' by two by two

Well, if you feel you like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up just
A little bit further and reel and rock it, roll it over
Roll over beethoven, and dig these rhythm and blues

Early in the morning I'm a-givin' you the warnin'
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey little little gonna play my fiddle, ain't got nothin' to lose
Roll over beethoven and tell tchaikowsky the news

You know she winks like a glow worm and dance like a spinnin' top
She's got a crazy partner, oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she's got a dime, the music will never stop

Flung down by corpse evangelists, unthought of, though somehow

Spouted out that liberty is just equality in school

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

They brainwashed my great uncle 
Brainwashed my cousin Bob 
They even got my grandma when she was working for the mob 
Brainwash you while you're sleeping 
While in your traffic jam 
Brainwash you while you're weeping 
While still a baby in your pram 
Brainwashed by the military 
Brainwashed under duress 
Brainwashed by the media 
You're brainwashed by the press 
Brainwashed by computers 
Brainwashed by mobile phones 
Brainwashed by the satellites 
Brainwashed to the bone

George Harrison,"Oh Lord, won't you listen in to me now
Oh Love, I got to get me back to you somehow
I never knew that life was loaded 
I'd only hung around birds and bees
I never knew that things exploded
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life, looking for my life

Oh boy, you've no idea what I've been through
Oh Lord, I feel so stuck that I can't get to you
Had no idea that I was heading
Toward a state of emergency
I had no fear where I was treading
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life

Caught up on me with intensity
Had no idea where I was heading
I only found it out when I was down upon my knees
Looking for my life, looking for my life

Oh boys you've no idea what I've been through
Oh Lord, I got to get back somehow to you

I never knew that life was loaded
I only hung around birds and bees
I never knew that things exploded
I only found it out when I was down upon my kees

George Harrison,"I know I'll never get over you
So deep this feeling that I have for you
Your eyes pierce through my heart
Your smile tears me apart
I knew it, it's so true
I'll never get over you

You touch me making my heart race
So much was written on your face
I knew when you arrived 
That no words could describe
What your love made me do
I'll never get over you

Girl, you're so much heart and soul
Girl, was a moonlit night you came into my life
And now this feeling has grown
And if you leave me alone I know 
I'll never get over you

So hide the moments when I feel blue
You warm the coldest feet
Can cool me in the heart
And all though love was new
I'll never get over you
My understanding grew
But I'll never get over, never get over you",Never Get Over You,2002
George Harrison,"Gazed at the ceiling from below
A splendid Michelangelo
Filled my heart with delight
Last Saturday night

Arrived believing from home
Climbed every step inside St. Peter's Dome
Claustrophobic and ex-Catholic
Last Saturday night

Now how come nobody really noticed
Puff of white smoke knocked me out
The truth is hiding, lurking, banking
Things they do at night

It's quite suspicious to say the least
Even mentioned it to my local priest
One Our Father, three Hail Marys
Each Saturday Night

I wish somebody would tell me
That it's only a show
I'll confess, own up, let's face it
In my concrete tuxedo

It's quite suspicious to say the least
While mentioning it to my priest

George Harrison,"Rowers gliding on the river
Canadian geese crap along the bank
Back wheel of my bike begins to quiver
The chain is wrapped around the crank

Old ladies, who must be doggie training
Walking, throwing balls, chasing all the sheep
While the farmer stands around, and he's complaining
His mad cows are being put to sleep and I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul

Smoke signals from the brewery
Like someone in there found the latest Pope
In a vat of beer that keeps pumping out with fury
While the churchbell ringer's tangled in his rope

There's a temple on an island
I think of all the Gods and what they feel
You can only find them in the deepest silence 
I got to get off of this big wheel

And I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul
I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul

And I'll be swimming until I can find those waters
That one unbounded ocean of bliss 
That's flowing through your parents, sons and daughters
But still an easy thing for us to miss

Blades go skimming through the water
I hear the coxon shouting his instructions about
With this crew oh it could be a tall order
Have we time to sort all of these things out

Some times my life it seems like fiction
Some of the days it's really quite serene
I'm living proof of all life's contradictions
One half's going where the other half's just been
And I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul",Pisces Fish,2002
George Harrison,"On the street of villains taken for a ride
You can have the devil as a guide
Crippled by the boundaries, programmed into guilt
'Til your nervous system starts to tilt

In a room of mirrors you can see for miles
But everything that's there is in disguise
Every word you've uttered and every thought you've had
Is all inside your file the good and the bad

But in the rising sun you can feel your life begin
Universe at play inside your DNA
You're a billion years old today
Oh the rising sun and the place it's coming from
Is inside of you and now your payment's overdue
Oh the rising sun, Oh the rising sun

Oh the avenue of sinners, I have been employed
Working there 'til I was near destroyed
I was almost a statistic inside a doctor's case
When I heard the messenger from inner space
He was sending me a signal that for so long I had ignored
But he held on to my umbilical cord
Until the ghost of memory trapped in my body mind
Came out of hiding to become alive

And in the rising sun you can hear your life begin
And it's hear and there nowhere and everywhere
Though it's atmosphere is rare
Oh the rising sun and the place that it's coming from
Is inside of me and now I feel it constantly 
Oh the rising sun, Oh the rising sun

Never smoked so much
Lost my concentration I could even lose my touch
Talking to myself

I lost my will to eat

I ought to cross you off my list,

Oh no, oh no, oh no

A friend of mine in so much misery
Some people sail through life, he is struggling

First he turned on me, then turned off his nervous system

You can take a horse to the water but you can't make him drink
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You can have it all laid out in front of you but still won't make it think

Someone I love has got a problem
Some people thirst for truth, he would like a drink

Could be that he knows him, he acts like he's possessed

I don't want to say goodbye.

To go back in the yard and play
If I could only have another day.

I don't want to make you cry.

To go back
On the hill beside the track
And try to concentrate.

George Harrison,"Chose a life in circuses
Jumped into the deepest end
Pushing himself to all extremes
Made it, people became his friend

Now they stood and noticed him
Wanted to be a part of it
Pulled out some poor machinery
So he worked 'til the pieces fit

The people were intrigued
His wife held back her fears
The headlines gave acclaim
He'd realized their dreams

Faster than a bullet from a gun
He is faster than everyone
Quicker than the blinking of an eye
Like a flash you could miss him going by
No one knows quite how he does it
But it's true, they say
""He's the master of going faster""

Now he moved into the space
That the special people share
Right on the edge of do or die
Where there is nothing left to spare

Still the crowds came pouring in
Some had hoped to see him fail
Filling their hearts with jealousies
Crazy people with love so frail

On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.

Homeward bound,
Home where my thought's escaping,
Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.

Of cigarettes and magazines.
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,

Home where my music's playing,
Home where my love lies waiting

I guess you keep getting sidetracked
I been faxin' you love notes all day long 
But you don't ever fax me back
I know you got your schedule and you're keepin' it tight
You got somethin' goin' mornin', noon, and night
But I somethin' I know you're gonna like
Honey, can you squeeze me in

Whoever said it's a man's world don't know
What he's talkin' about
You got me workin' around the clock

Than how much you can spend
You got to make a little time for the good times 
So honey can you squeeze me in",Squeeze Me In,2001
George Hawkins Jr.,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

I never think about all the funny things you said
I feel like it's dead
Where is it leading me now

I turn around in the still of the room
Knowing this is when I'm gonna make my move
Can't wait any longer
And I'm feeling stronger but oh

Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pullin' me back
Back to love you

I know I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark

He holds me close like a thief of the heart
He plays a melody
Born to tear me all apart
The silence is broken
And no words are spoken but oh

Just as I walk through the door
I can feel your emotion
It's pullin' me back
Back to love you

When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark",Piano in the Dark,1989
George Howard,"I only wanted to play
I thought what he didn't know wouldn't hurt him anyway
But he found out and someone else gave him her hand to hold
And suddenly I find myself out in the cold

He trusted me all the time
I thought I could see another man and he would still be mine
Well yesterday I had a good thing worth more than gold
Today he's got a truer love and I'm out in the cold

I had a love warmer than fire
But I listened to my desire
Now yesterday's dreams are tomorrow's heart aches
I'm payin' for my mistakes
Now girl, take a tip from one who knows
If you open up a new door, you may find the old one's closed

So be true to your good man 
Take a lesson from the story I have told
Or you just might get-a left now out in the cold

George Howard,"Love songs, sweet love songs
Love songs, sweet, sweet, sweet love

Hasn't every way to write a love song been written
And hasn't every way to tell the story been told
Hasn't everyone been moved and soothed by the melodies
Aren't there other tales to be told, other stories to unfold

Haven't we anything else to say
Or are we merely trapped to find another way
To say the same things
Don't we have other thoughts, other dreams

Girl it seems every time I search that quiet place
I find myself with you face to face
In my mind there's nothing left to say except, ""I love you""

Love songs, sweet love songs
(I love you)

Hasn't every way to sing a love song been sung
And hasn't every way to phrase the message been done
Haven't all the great ones sung the melodies that've wooed you
And aren't there other songs to be sung with messages untold

Seems that we've lost our will to challenge the mind
And be a unique kind of art it's been for me
Oh a teacher or prophet by pen
Girl but wait, don't get me wrong, I love a good good love song
One that gets me real good, when I close my eyes
I only seem to find the words ""I love you""

""I love you"", girl I can't help myself
(Love songs, sweet love songs)
And as long as you keep needin' them
I'll keep servin' 'em till my last breath
(Love songs, sweet, sweet, sweet love)
No, I'm not alone, there're others like you and me
'Cause there's always someone who wants
To tell their story of need

It's a simple story, one as old as time
(Love songs, sweet love songs)
And we all know that sometimes
Love don't have no reason or rhyme
(Love songs, sweet, sweet, sweet love)

Oh love, oh love, oh love

Only love can understand Only love can bring us together again

And it seems since time began that people just been fighting 
And it ain't just black or white and it ain't just wrong or right 
And I get overwhelmed so disconnected 'till you reach out to me
You know just what i need 

As long as i can hold you near its gonna be alright 
Wont have no fear

[CHORUS]

I pray for peace to shine on me and you 
I pray for strength hope and faith
For love to lead the way

We'll be one on one and we'll rise above 
Only love, love, love
And we'll fight, fight, fight
For the light, light, light
And we wont stop NO
'Till we get it right

George Huff,"It's late at night can't get no sleep
Wondering what's gonna be next for me
Your spirit calls but I've got my dreams and the world out there
Seems like a mastery 

And when I fear what lies ahead that's when 
A voice inside me says 

See what God can do
When you give yourself completely 
Change you point of view 
You will never be the same
See what God can do

It's the miracles in the everyday
In the kind word you take time to say
It's an open hand
To a broken heart
It's hanging on
When you don't know where to start
In every situation I'm going through 
I'm going to keep my eyes open to

See what God can do
When you give yourself completely 
Change you point of view 
You will never be the same
See what God can do
It will give your life new meaning
If you want to see him move
Get on your knees and pray
See what God can do

When it feels impossible
For you to make it through
When all hope is gone And there's nothing you can do
Don't give up now 
Your just about to see what God can do
See what God can do
When you give yourself completely 
Change you point of view

You know me I'm a window you see through
When all the world is not at home your waiting for me at the door
And you let me in

So when I make you cry it makes me never want to fall again
But the smaller I am the larger your love

You know me everything I do
You know me I'm a window you see through
The most foolish thing I could ever do
Is think that I could lie to you
And put up walls you'd see through them

'Cause you know me you know me you know the secrets and the scars
That's how into me you are 'cause you know me

In a street full of noise it's amazing how you can still hear my voice
And when I pull away you care enough to patiently wait
'Till I come back around like I am now 
It's beyond beautiful

'Cause you know me you know me you know the secrets and the scars
That's how into me you are 'cause you know me

George Huntley,"Hi, it's me sorry, it's so late
The trip was hard that made you wait
You can yell and scream and not be heard

Low, on promises that were made
A love song rarely played
Is ""Goodbye"" your only word?

And she said, ""Oh dear, God
Give me one good reason
Why I should stay here
One more season with him?
This guy is full of holes
And when he rains, he pours""

Now you, you say that you are here for me
But where we are is far from home
Have the children gone to sleep?

Now I can't afford to waste my time
Fearing that I've left my prime
Can't be wrong so I must be right

And she said, ""Oh dear, God
Give me one good reason
Why I should stay here
One more season with him?
This guy is full of holes
And when he rains, he pours""

Oh, and she said, ""Oh dear, God

MULTIPLY THE HEARTACHES
(Kathy Dee)
Â« Â© '63 Glad Music Â»
WITH MELBA MONTGOMERY

Once I thought two happy hearts would someday be as one
But then a third heart came along and now our love is gone
I count the many times I said I love no one but you
But don't be fooled by counting dreams that never will come true
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
Divide the tears by everytime a heart breaks
The answer only tells that it's too late
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches...
Subtract one love and multiply the heartaches



",Multiply the Heartaches,2003
George Jones & Tammy Wynette,"Do you take this man to be your husband?

I'll take this man, and by him I'll stand
I promise that we'll never part.
To him I'll be true, there'll be no one new
From now, till death do us part.

Do you take this woman to be your wife?

Yes, I'll take this woman.  She'll be mine forever.
And I'll love her with all of my heart.
To have and to hold, our love won't grow cold.
I promise.  Till death do us part.

We'll take each other, from this day forward, 
Together in sickness or health.
United with love, we'll face life together,
If we're poor or if we have wealth.

For better or worse, you'll always come first 
And no one can keep us apart.
Yes, we'll take each other, forsaking all others.
Together, till death do us part.

Together, till death do us part.

I now pronounce you man and wife.

George Jones & Tammy Wynette,"I guess we've walked a million miles together hand in hand
We'd climb steep Rocky Mountains a happy woman a happy man
We'd thought our love would go on forever side by side
But here we stand like strangers at the great divide
We've loved our way to the top of life the rest was all down hill
The rough times seem behind us and our dreams were all fulfilled
But we found out sometimes love grows old and I think our love just died
But here we stand like strangers at the great divide
Now you'll take a high road I will take the low
But who'll take the baby cause we both love her so

And I know someday I'll tell this place goodbye
But till then it's sure a lovely place to cry
You don't need lonely things around you when you have no love left in you

There's no trouble to be found strong enough to turn our world around
Cause we know how it feels to live on love

I could tell by the sunshine on your face
I know he bought you pretty things
I know he made your world a happy place

And I remember when she loved you
And in those days you had someone to care
And through your long and lonely nights
When you needed someone, she was there

Ah, but lately you're not smiling
And I don't see that sunshine like before
I know you've tried to make it work
But I don't think he loves you any more

And I know she must have hurt you
'Cause I've seen the tears, you try so hard to hide
But if we had each other
It might just stop this hurt we have inside

Change to me and keep the change

You left a year ago this Christmas and we're wondering if you miss us.
Don't know why you up and left and went away.
The kids are lonely here without you, even wrote old Santa about you.
Please don't leave them all alone this Christmas day.
Don't you miss their arms around you? Do their memories surround you?
Don't you know it's not their fault things are this way?
Why not show consideration to the ones whose heart you're breaking?
Give them your gift of love this Christmas day.
If you could see their little faces, as round the tree they take their places,
They're looking for the biggest gift of all.

George Jones & The Jones Boys,"She thinks I still care
Just because I asked a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today

She thinks I still care
Just because I haunt the same old places
Where the memories of her lingers everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be

She thinks I still care
But if she's happy thinking I still need her
Then let that silly notion bring her cheer
But how could she ever be so foolish
Oh were would she get such an ideal

Just because I asked a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I saw her then went all to pieces

George Jones & The Jones Boys,"SHE'S LONESOME AGAIN
(George Jones - George Riddle)
Â« Â© '63 Glad Music Â»

Look out heart I can tell you have weaken
For I feel those heartaches began
She's come back and I don't know what has brought her
She don't love me she's just lonesome again
For a while I know that I'll be happy
And that's all that matters within
Though I love her I know I can't hold her
But she'll come back when she's lonesome again
Just like always I'm waiting here for her
Yes it's true I always have been
Yes I love her but I know I'll be sorry
She don't love me she's lonesome again
Yes I love her but I know I'll be sorry
She don't love me she's lonesome again



",She's Lonesome Again,2018
George Jones & The Jones Boys,"We said our goodbyes long ago
Never thinking we'd miss each other so
All the memories we can't leave behind
Oh, we must have been out of our minds

[Chorus]
I thought I loved another, not you
How foolish, I thought the same, too
They both turned out to be the wrong kind
Oh, we must have been out of our minds

Let's forgive and forget the past we've known
And reap together the wild seeds we've sown
Surely they can forgive us in time
That, we must have been out of our minds

Yes, we must have been out of our minds",We Must Have Been Out of Our Minds,2018

It comes from a heart that's been broken apart

Where does the broken heart come from where does the broken heart come from
It comes when you find that you love the roving kind
That's where the broken heart comes from
Where does the roving kind come from where does the roving kind come from
From the wild and restless river that wanders on forever

Goin' all over town

George Kahn,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And the bag of tricks it takes
To get me through my working day
He's a one trick pony

He's a one trick pony 
He either fails or he succeeds
He gives his testimony 
Then he relaxes in the week
He's got one trick to last a lifetime. 
That's all a pony needs

One trick pony 
One trick pony
One trick pony

He would gather a crowd down beside the sea
And they'd play his gay Hawaiian chant

And the hula hula maidens started swingin' it
Like a tropical storm that's the way it hit

George Lake Big Band,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
My sometime is now

Everybody finds somebody someplace
There's no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying
My someplace is here

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charm
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I've found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you

And try to speak in such a way that you won't be afraid of listening
Too many words been spoke without no understanding
And I'd hate to add another wound to the times we had good loving.

But oh when I think of the tall pine trees growing
The silver mists of snow all around me blowing.
I'll miss the gentle times and the fireplace a'warming
Perhaps I'll turn my head away to hide the tears a'falling.

Some say I have dishonored you through foolishness and folly
The question not in where that lies but if you're standing by me.
I do not need to hear the words to know your truthful answer
Your eyes that once were home to me now tell me I'm a stranger.

But oh when I think of the tall pine trees growing
The silver mists of snow all around me blowing.
I'll miss the gentle times and the fireplace a'warming
Perhaps I'll turn my head away to hide the tears a'falling.

I'm bound to be a wanderer, I'll never take another
I'll catch a merchant ship tonight and sail to foreign waters
I'll judge no man for what he's done and no man will I bother
And I hope to find some peace again and cleanse my soul of anger

But oh when I think of the tall pine trees growing
The silver mists of snow all around me blowing.

Perhaps I'll turn my head away to hide the tears a'falling.",Wo Yao Zou Tian Ai,2010

Where does that leave us 
Where does that leave love

Holding back the fears 
That you would really go

George Lamond,"There's no one who could ever love me like you loved me 
I remember how it used to be 
There was no stronger love 
And now I can't believe I was only too blind to see 
That your love is inside of me 
And now I don't have anything at all 
Every night I think as time just passes by 
Why I left your love and how it made me cry 
Now that I found out, don't know what to do 
My life feels so empty, so empty alone without you 

[Chorus:]
Without you, without you 
I don't know what I'll do without you girl 
Without you my love is in your hands 
There's nothing left to live for 
There's nothing left to do without you 

Every night I sleep, I sleep with a fantasy 
That your here, its just you and me 
Just like it always was 
But then I'm left to see that it was only a memory 
And what's left is for me to be alone without your love 
Every night I think as time just passes by 
Why I left your love and how it made me cry 
Now that I found out, don't know what to do 
My life feels so empty, so empty alone without you

Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

From Florida to the North Pole.

Sunshine and joy always nigh;
We live and learn for tomorrow,
But sometimes the learning comes high:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.

A blessing and a curse
Unconsciousness or ecstasy

I don't need a cure, until they bury me

Up a concrete stream
Stillborn the image flashing
On the computer screen
Marred by creation
Oblivious to pain
But with no exception
You lost reception
You're unable to sustain

Brought you back to earth
Strapped and wasted mainline dose

In a word concealed

A broken spell
Amid the ecstacy intense
Unleash a frozen scream

Hurrah! Hurrah! For ev'ry Yankee tar
And old G.A.R.
Ev'ry stripe, ev'ry star
Red, white and blue
Hats off to you
Honest, you're a grand old flag

You're a grand old flag
You're a high-flying flag
And forever in peace may you wave
You're the emblem of
The land I love
The home of the free and the brave
Ev'ry heart beats true
Under red, white and blue
Where there's never a boast or brag
But should old acquaintance be forgot
Keep your eye on the grand old flag",You're a Grand Old Flag,1991
George M. Cohan,"Did you ever see two Yankees part 
Upon a foreign shore
When the good ship's just about to start
For old New York once more?
With tear-dimmed eye they say goodbye
They're friends without a doubt
When the man on the pier 
Shouts, ""Let them clear""
As the ship strikes out

Give my regards to Broadway 
Remember me to Herald Square
Tell all the gang at Forty-Second Street
That I will soon be there
Whisper of how I'm yearning
To mingle with the old time throng
Give my regards to old Broadway
And say that I'll be there e'er long

Say hello to dear old Coney Isle
If there you chance to be
When you're at the Waldorf have a smile
And charge it up to me
Mention my name ev'ry place you go
As 'round the town you roam
Wish you'd call on my gal
Now remember, old pal
When you get back home

Give my regards to Broadway 
Remember me to Herald Square
Tell all the gang at Forty-Second Street
That I will soon be there
Whisper of how I'm yearning
To mingle with the old time throng
Give my regards to old Broadway
And say that I'll be there e'er long",Give My Regards to Broadway (from Little Johnny Jones),2008
George Maharis,"Did you say (that) I've got a lot to learn
Well don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Teach me tonight

Starting with the ABC of it
Getting right down to the XYZ of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a blackboard high above you
And if a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write ""I love you""
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear my love
Teachers shouldn't stand so near my love
Graduation's almost here my love
You'd better teach me tonight

I've played loves scenes in a flick or two
And I've also met a chick or two
But I still can learn a trick or two
Hey teach me tonight

I who thought I knew the score of it
Kind of think I should know much more of it
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it
Hey teach me tonight

The midnight hours come slowly creeping
When there's no one there but you
There must be more to life than sleeping
Single in a bed for two

What I need most is post graduate
What I feel is hard to articulate
If you want me to matriculate
You'd better teach me tonight

What do you get for lessons
Teach me - come on and teach me - teach me tonight",Teach Me Tonight,
George Maharis,"It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone
You know I feel OK

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight

It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright, ow

George Maharis,"""Romance is a game for fools""
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!",Fools Rush In,2000
George Maharis,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,2000
George Maharis,"Hurt to think that you lied to me
Hurt way down deep inside of me
You said your love was true and we'd never part
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart
I'm hurt much more than you'll ever know
Hurt because I still love you so
But even though you've hurt me like no one else could do
I would never, never hurt you
 
Hurt to think that you lied to me
Hurt way down deep inside of me
You said your love was true and we'd never part
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart
I'm hurt much more than you'll ever know
Hurt because I still love you so
But even though you've hurt me like no one else could do
I would never, never hurt you",Hurt,2000
