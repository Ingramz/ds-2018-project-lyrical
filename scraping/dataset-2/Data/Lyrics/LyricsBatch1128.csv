Big Time Rush,"Want you to cry
'Cause you're laughing so hard tonight
Playing air guitar alright
We're being who we are even if they hate that

Want you to shout
At the top of your lungs about
All our favorite songs so loud
We'll be singing along even if they hate that

Turn up the radio
So what if we lose control
Get a little bit rock and roll, oh whoa oh

So throw your hands in the air
Come on and make this count
It's only you and me, never mind this crowd
Do the way you do it
Do it like nobody's around, whoa
So put your hands in the air
Come on and waste no time
It doesn't really matter if it's wrong or right
Do the way you do it
Do it like nobody's around
We can do it like nobody's around

Don't hesitate, be as dumb as you like, you may
Miss the time of our lives so stay
Your dancing under the lights, even if they hate that

Turn up the radio
So what if we lose control
Get a little bit rock and roll, oh oh oh

So throw your hands in the air
Come on and make this count
It's only you and me, never mind this crowd
Do the way you do it
Do it like nobody's around, whoa
So put your hands in the air
Come on and waste no time
It doesn't really matter if it's wrong or right
Do the way you do it
Do it like nobody's around
We can do it like nobody's around

Someday when you're alone and feeling whatever
You gotta remember the times
When we were dancing alone and holding fake microphones
I hope those memories can make you feel alright

Turn up the radio
So what if we lose control
Get a little bit rock and roll, oh oh oh

So throw your hands in the air
Come on and make this count
It's only you and me, never mind this crowd
Do the way you do it
Do it like nobody's around, whoa
So put your hands in the air
Come on and waste no time
It doesn't really matter if it's wrong or right
Do the way you do it
Do it like nobody's around
We can do it like nobody's around

Whoa oh oh oh, we can do it like nobody's around

Big Time Rush,"Picture this, first kiss in the moonlight
Slow dance, cover band playing all night
Meant to be, cool breeze feeling so right
Picture this, picture this
Picture this, holding hands on the boardwalk
Perfect date, out late, making small talk
Arcade, playing games you can win it all
Picture this, picture this

When you look into your future
Who's there standing
With you when you close your eyes

Do you see what I see
You and me, it's like a movie scene
That's the way you know it should be
The two of us together, girl can you picture this
Girl can you picture this
The two of us together
Girl can you picture this
Girl can you picture this

Top down, ride around all day long
Watching you rockin' out to your favorite song
Fall asleep on the beach with our shades on
Picture this, picture this

When you look into your future
Who's there standing
With you when you close your eyes

Do you see what I see
You and me, it's like a movie scene
That's the way you know it should be

Big Time Rush,"Run wild and never look back

Break out, get a little loud
Shout it from the rooftops now

Yeah we gonna run this town
Don't wait, time is running out
Can you hear it ticking, let the music kick in
Break out, get a little loud
Shout it from the rooftops now

People say, play it safe
But I don't wanna live that way
Take a chance, change the game
Let's show 'em that we're not afraid

Stand up and don't shut up
The world is for the taking, taking
Run wild and never look back, never look back
No hesitating
Stand up and don't shut up

Earthquake, gotta shake it up
Gonna make the whole world jump

Right now, breaking down the doors
Can you hear me knockin', get this party rockin'

Big Time Rush,"Waking up from another day
I'm feeling so insane
'Cause ever since I saw your face
I got it tattooed on my brain

Did you know that you came and you got me like this?
'Cause I know you're the one that I wanna be with
You gotta know I'd do anything
To get you to notice me

What I gotta do to get you into my life?
I could be your bad boy or baby I could be nice
I would give you all the stars
If you give me the night
Come on, eh, eh, eh

There's a million pretty girls all over
But they got nothing on you
Been all around the world
And no one gets me like the way you do
Baby I thought that you should know
None of the rest are even close
There's a million pretty girls all over
But you know this song's for you
This song's for you

Now I got your attention babe
There's some things I need to say
Like you're the one that I dream about
It's on my mind like every day (every day)

Did you know that you came and you got me like this?
'Cause I know you're the one that I wanna be with
You gotta know I'd do anything
To get you to notice me
So tell me

What I gotta do to get you into my life?
I could be your bad boy or baby I could be nice
I would give you all the stars
If you give me the night
Come on, eh, eh, eh

Got my head in the clouds
And I'm walking on it
Want you all to myself
And I don't want to share
Where you wanna go?
'Cause I'm taking you there
Come on, eh, eh, eh

There's a million pretty girls all over
But they got nothing on you
Been all around the world
And no one gets me like the way you do
Baby I thought that you should know
None of the rest are even close
There's a million pretty girls all over
But you know this song's for you
This song's for you

Yo, one in a million
So baby what are the odds?
A million miles away
But I know this is my song
You know you got the right girl
With the right muscle
Keep you reeled in but won't knock the hustle
I don't want you to want me
No I don't wanna be wondering
If you wanna be with me
When the skies get to thundering
I still want my heart fluttering
Every day without a shadow of a doubt
Baby all you gotta say

There's a million pretty girls all over
But they got nothing on you (nothing on you)
Been all around the world
And no one gets me like the way you do
Baby I thought that you should know
None of the rest are even close
There's a million pretty girls all over

Big Time Rush,"Thinking, we don't want to get caught up in over thinking
We only got tonight
Moments, we gotta keep on living for these moments,
'Cause this is our time

Life’s too short to sit and wait
For love to come our way
Light it up like fireworks
I wanna hear you say

We are we are

We are alive, and we have the light shining down
We are we are, we are the reckless
You can hear us drowning of the sound
We are we are, young and dumb
Always chasing something
We are we are, hearts like drums
You can hear us coming
We are we are

Chances, you know there's nothing wrong with taking chances
We put it on the line
Oh, someday I know we’re gonna be somebody someday
Only gotta try

Life’s too short to sit and wait
For love to come our way
Light it up like fireworks
I wanna hear you say

We are alive, and we have the light shining down
We are we are, we are the reckless
You can hear us drowning of the sound

Big Time Rush,"Right now, it feels like it's the encore
Like we just lived through one more
We just set foot in the door

I know, you think you've seen the whole show
But this is just the intro
It's not goodbye, it's hello, here we go

The night is young

We're just getting started
And the best is yet to come
And we're just getting started now
Whoa, whoa, oh oh whoa
And we're just getting started now
Whoa, whoa, oh oh whoa
And we're just getting started now

It feels like it's the last page
But we're just warming up the stage

I know, it's feeling like the sunrise
But it isn't even midnight

Tell me baby, do you feel it too?

And the taste of your lips got me feeling high

'Cause I'm lost in love, lost in love
And I don't wanna be found

I can't stop feeling what I'm feeling for you

Give a star line talking bout Ringo

Chump, I'm making hits
No time for the crack rock and shit

Smooth as Teeddy Pendegrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass

Words as potent as the blunt smoking Bed-Stuy bandit

I remember when niggas slang heroin up in balloons
I paid attention to everything, from killings to cartoons
Got a picture of Malcolm X on the wall in my room, bitch
Want some old nigga? Fuck with me, I'ma do 'em, shit
Nigga give me dope, I accept it, but don't respect him
Put my foot in their rectum right after I dome checked 'em
I be popping D, smoking weed, and full of that Hennesey
Fresh off the streets on my way to the penitentiary
Everybody whisper in ears when they gonna mention me
I been out doing it for years, since elementary
Real good relationship with guns and drugs
Because my whole neighborhood consists of crook and thugs
Everything is my own shit 'cause I don't fuck with scrubs
I don't need you harassing me when I'm up in the club
Trying to hustle a nigga, asking me for a dub
Quarter, ki's, and halfs is what I sling, 'cause that's what I love

I know you bitches know that I ain't to be played with
Don't have no picks and chooses who get they head split
They die quick, fucking with Turk, wodie get whacked
Spend a bin with Kevin and Randy leave ya flat on you back
And trust that, ain't 'bout to let no nigga steal me
Fuck that, I bust back with a .223
Big and full of that raw with no cut and be ready to creep
Innocent people move cause somebody fixing to get split

Na, na, it's iceberg shorty, Lordy have mercy
Come from under my shirts and flip 'em and reverse 'em

Ma più mi guardo in giro e vedo che
See'è un mondo che va avanti anche se
Se tu non ci sei più, se tu non ci sei più

E dimmi perché
In questo girotondo d' anime
Non see'è un posto
Per scrollarsi via di dosso

Quello che ci è stato detto
E quello che ormai si sa
E allora sai che see'è

see'è che see'è, see'è che prendo un treno
Che va a paradiso città
E vi saluto a tutti e salto su
Prendo il treno e non ci penso più

Un viaggio a senso solo senza ritorno
Se non in volo
Senza fermate nè confini
Solo orizzonti neanche troppo lontani

Io mi prenderò il mio posto
E tu seduta lì al mio fianco
Mi dirai destinazione paradiso

Big Tiny Little,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a well remembered dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind

That rapture so supreme

Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme",Third Man Theme,1991

Big Tiny Little,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1992
Big Tiny Little,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1992
Big Tiny Little,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Big Tiny Little,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets, 
You know, my little coquette, I love you.

Big Tray Deee,"Well I decided to call this one droppin' bombz 
According to the procedure and the mic in my palm 
But stay calm the bombs that I drop are kept 
Til I step up the steps where they quest for reps 
Upon a stage the sage shall engage the act 
And every flow I bestow shall remain in tact 
In exact and in fact the impact I make colossal 
Creating and novating like the great Pablo Picasso 
Design every line in my rhyme's the climb, up the ladder 
So I know my doe will grow fatter 
Untouchable, because I'm cuttin' those corners 
Just grip into the script like classified orders 
Taking over stages like major invasions 
Over throw my oldest foe, show I got the dopest flow 
No it's no mistake don't massage your eyes 
It's why I should I bring the bomb disguise 
I drop bombs 

Ain't no mistaking, Sentrelle and Tray D droppin' the bombs 
('Cause it don't stop, Cause it don't quit) 
('Cause it don't stop, Cause it don't quit) 

Ain't no mistaking, Sentrelle and Tray D droppin' the bombs 
('Cause it don't stop, Cause it don't quit) 
('Cause it don't stop, Cause it don't quit) 

Alright, hold up just wait up a mother fuckin' minute 
Hoes recognize, checkin' the Guinness 
Book of world records, microphone checker 
Crazy bitch step up, it's like your heffa 
Oh yes a, droppin' mad skills on your disk it 
Beats so hot, I have you rising like a biscuit 
To the shiznit, that I can bitches get drop kicked 
Give your ass a slang like the cavi in my pocket 
I'm going to rock it (Rock it to the break of dawn) 
Tick tock it (It's about three in the morn) 
But I'm not finished yet (Give me that joint again) 
Where my homiez (Swiggin' on coke and hen) 
As I begin, begun, did you hear me come 
Take a look around the corner, did you see me I'm the one 
Through the cut I kick butt as I rip shit up 
Take another swig of the hen in my cup 
And now I'm feenin' 
Hell of a chronic smoke is what I'm needin' 
Now I'm in the corner, screaming like a demon 
Yeah I hear you try to bind me nigga 
You couldn't find me nigga 
I'm right behind you nigga 
I drop the bomb 

Ain't no mistaking, Sentrelle and Tray D droppin' the bombs 
('Cause it don't stop, Cause it don't quit) 
('Cause it don't stop, Cause it don't quit) 

Ain't no mistaking, Sentrelle and Tray D droppin' the bombs 
('Cause it don't stop, Cause it don't quit) 
('Cause it don't stop, Cause it don't quit) 

And so, when you hear the boom, make room 
Nigga watch out, Cause I got my glock out 
Plus a proper knock out 
Either one could be the one, if you got feedback 
So you better ease back cause I don't need that 
Either give me my props when I drop this 
Or I peel a cap and I'll leave ya topless 
Then you will just be another statistic 
If you come dumb cause they none simplistic 

I hits hard like a nigga, but I'm smooth like satin 
When I move through nigga make room for the madam 
Seductive as I bust this, nigga trust this 
I could give a damn about your cadi and your cutlass 
Now I'm committing straight murder 
(So if one time comes around nigga say I haven't heard of her) 
Because I'd rather be a thug nigga 
Then to sleep six feet in the mother fuckin' mud nigga 

Droppin' bombs, long beach style with that gangsta twist 
('Cause it don't quit) 
Now just ride with this 
('Cause it don't quit)

Out on the scout I'm about my papers
Cause ain't nobody doing Deee no favors
I'm trying ta get major with minor risk
Maximizing the minimum of time is spent
on the heist, nice and easy believe me
I take mine and make mine extra cheesy
Keeping niggas in a headlock
Undress em, press em down in a full nelson
I hit jacks off six packs of the crooked one
They slip and I'm booking em
Fuck fingerprints, gimme from their fingertips
Chips to the neckline 'cause I got a Tek9
Check mine like a pimp-main ho
So hope you only see me when my grip ain't low
I go up in ya like a skeleton
So S-N-double O-Please let em know the crew I'm bailing with

And every hustler in my clique got to get his grip
and in my world a girl is considered a bitch
Is money all that makes you move?
You ain't doing what'cha supposed to so you gots ta prove
something to the ones you love but you needs ta know
If you ain't doing it for yourself it don't matter
It was a wake up, wake up, wake up,
Just to wake up, wake up, wake up,

If they dare, you stare when they next to me
I'ma threat to whoever sweat my style
Hard gangsta aim to represent til death
Reality, you battle me you be in the dirt quick
I'm clever with whatever type of weapon I work with
The bare hand man sleeper
I even banked up and shank motherfuckers in the ""penta""
I sanked a gang of tough fools in my time
so try me you're liable to lose on my line
The 44'll be what cracks ya head

Criminal with style and boy you love that
Sit back relax and let me drop another rap
but this one's for the sisters and not the hoes
The ones who be grooving it on the step shows
Let a nigga in, I ain't diss ya friend
and like The Staples I make sure we do it again
But don't blow a nigga up or show a nigga up
and don't think a nigga sprung 'cause you know a nigga fuck

Yeah
Vision 88 kilos of cocaine smack-dead in your face
The street value of that is what you dream to make
Run an illegal business, racketeering
Smuggling, doing things from handing a gun,is what they fearing
Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit
Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick
Different locations,spots where it takes place
If you show them my money, your ass is getting f-laid
There's four major games that run the city of G's
The violators, the Gambinos and the Corleones and me
The violators and Gambinos they run uptown
Me and my cousin Corleone we run downtown
Murder's an everyday thing in the city
Where you gotta plot chips,jag robberies and do in its
Tanadian Nay,the charge of the weapons
Hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected
So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot
Buck em till they all drop,circle round the block
Let em have it as soon as they come out
Unload on their ass,commence to taking them out!

[Daz]
Throughout the streets of Long Beach
The streets was infected with drugs,dope pealers and addicts
Gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young
youth behavior is outrageous with crime
They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements
have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs
from coming into our country, but they can't
The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount
of which they make is more than 700 million dollars
Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion

[Tray Dee]
I had no choice or remorse for time for putting it down
Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town
I been around since the Jumpstreet making it pop
Young crook keeping hook, nigga, shaking the spot
Had to be a standout not to get ran out
Look for help,you help yourself 'cause there's no handout
Since the city Long Beach is only G's and hos
You hold on ya heat but them fiendish foes
Trust, bust, be aware and I ain't ya curse
Cause the niggas that I dared to ""agank"" the first
Think I might be deceased 'fore I reach my calling
As long as I'm hauling my heat I'm stalling
I bring it to ya hard from the streets of life
Where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes
Don't speak on the creep,mo' fools is listening
And war story glory ain't worth the risking
Real niggas still get a mob like respect
If you represent ya set, till ya bite the deck
Who I be?I'm the Dee, nigga check the file
Under G you will see not to sweat my style
I'm taking em out!

I come through blasting, me as a Downtown Assassin
Mashing, may they rest in peace in they caskets
Shoot em down in front of Hassans
Should've known from the gate,who's the baddest?
In my zone, Don Corleone wanted
For the murder of forty men
Ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again
From the you-S-see, I shift ki's,a 120 plane rides
Multiplied by G's, 87.3 million in a matter o'months
Big business and big dollars is all that I want
I blaze up to celebrate,new empire to make
Toast till we all die, till we burst and break
From knives to guns, from the rich to the slums   
We ran outta dope, I don't think so son
While I be gunned by a mark from the enemy park
From daylight to reach dark and all the clucks a'spark
From when I pick em off like darts
Stab em in they hearts
Make an example, what I said,ya end up dead
Spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost Doggs
Never reach until I see the blue sky till I die
All I ever want is to be left alone

What's the secrets of war I can't take no more
Within minutes we get in it comin for you and yours
With these automatic toys throughout the world make noise
Dippin in low-lows, and jumpin out of fo'-do's

Catchin, many and any with the fo'-fo'
Blastin and mashin I cash in many for Death Row
Rest in peace to my homeboys who ain't alive
Now the mission is for us to conquer and ride

The worst California we droppin somethin on ya
Ain't no one to sound, like ta-pow, you a goner
For the simple fact we get Gang Related
We have the papers and you suckers hate it

What you gon do when we get loose and act a fool
Break the rules on you and dust you off with the tools

Only with the swoll rolls and the paper

Three times dope similar to my nickname
A big Caine, ain't nuttin changed now I'm solo

My gangsta ass track with the Gang is my logo
Ridin with the top down, off lockdown
Time for me to knock down fool's whole compound
Like the World Trade Center
 
The world made thinner when I'm pullin on my girl gray trigger
Figure when I enter I intend to rule this
This industry fin to see I'm nuttin to fool wit
Like Jack Nicholson, I smack fickle men

And pack somethin in my penalty
Will well then they see the toppest servin a putdown
And I'm on this notice my opponents get took down
A crook down from my ground of clout

Representin Death Row when I was down and out

I came in the game with the aim to maim
The gangbang murder main slang is strange
My first idea when I stare up in the mirror

Is how Daz Dillinger gon creep up on the scrilla
And if I don't plot then I'll probably not
Get my issue, so I gotta figure how to twist you
Hit you hard like a gauge shot

Watchin fools laid out when the bloodshot sprayed out
I shoot my way out these punks for rent
So duck when the slugs hit your trunks, you're finished
I'm comin out runnin that's to shake the scene

Break the green I'll scream out the gangsta theme
Do or die! Ain't no lie, that's the way I eat
Watch me scope out and choke out the prayout beat
GIve me six in the chamber fuck twelve in the box

Let the gravedigger be the one shovelin rocks, it don't stop

My nigga Noid say 23 birds comin' our way 

And they landin' at the docks at 9 o'clock 

Let's go see D-Mack at the neighborhood glock shop 



Repeat 1 



In the evening, we in the Benzo 

Listenin' to 2Pac, blowin' up some indo 

And my cellular is getting crossed up 

I call Kellie, tell her not to wait up (wait up) 

Nine o'clock on the dot, we at the dock 

I got my eyes on the nigga wit the dredlocks 

He the first one I'm gonna pop when the loot come out 

I'm tapping Bennie so he know which on I'm talkin' about 

Now shit's about to change - Nigga put ya hand up 

Before you get stuck 

And it's turnin' out to be a beautiful day 

We got the money & the yay 

Dippin' on the freeway 



Next day, the Narc's raid about 6 in the morning 

You know, break of fuckin' dawn 

Now Kellie in the courtroom cryin' when I stand up 

I guess it's one prayer the Lord didn't answer, no no no no 



Damn

You know motherfuckers be doing way way too motherfucking much
You know? That's real
Just like baby right here, she doing too much

Now if that nigga next to you got a rented car
And he acting like it's his but you know it's not
Say he doing too much, yeah nigga you doing too much
And if that stuck-up bitch got the bar posted-up
She acting like that hair's hers but you know what's up
Say she doing too much, yeah baby you doing too much

I gave my kinfolk the keys to my Suburb
I told em ""Hit the side and slide and get the herb""
But guess who's calling, Pipedream Patty
Made that nigga park my who ride beside the alley
Forget about that nigga though (fuck that nigga)
Fuck that nigga yo 
But I can't forget about him cause he taught me everything I know
Oh no Joe, walking down the wrong lane
Tooting on that cocaine, fucking wit that wrong thing
Niggas like that (what), get things like they want it (damn)
Then fake the funk, doggonnit
Now loc, look at this predicament
You smoked out and can't be trusted, I can't kick it wit 
Niggas like you, used to be in my crew
Goddamn, they don't make niggas like they used to
I remember Marley Marl and the Juice Crew
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce-deuce

Now if you're doing for your family and you can't stand it
Cause you know these motherfuckers trying take advantage
Say they doing too much, yeah nigga you doing too much
And if your kinfolk broke and he smoke dope
And he need to catch a motherfucking different stroke
Say he doing too much, yeah Joey you doing too much

We parlay, parlay everyday DPG style
We might throw a pool party every once in a while
Now in fact we gon' do one this weekend
Let's see how many hoes me and my nigga Rose can weed in
I believe in, sharing the cock
Also, I believe in comparing the cock
Look, don't knock a nigga like me (why?)
Cause she love the way I just beat up the pussy
Not just knee deep, she was totally deep
When she went down on me
She blew a nigga socks off, got a nigga rocks off
Oh wee, baby you's a freak
Put my homey up on game like a gangsta
But my homey fell in love and he banked her
Ain't that a trip? Now we in a twist
Back in the county wit the red ribbon on his wrist

Now when a nigga hit his girl and she don't hit back
And he get his third strike wit no get back
Say he doing too much, yeah homey you doing too much
And when the homey in the pen, doing a sin
And his girlfriend fucking wit his best friend
Say she doing too much, hell yeah she doing too much

I'm living up in the hills, wine sipping wit mills
I'm having major type of paper, I ain't tripping off bills (still)
Show me some respect and accept my coolness
And don't mistake my kindness to mean I'm foolish
Use this as a warning, cause I'm starting
To figure it's some niggas think I'm soft as Charmin
Pardon me, cause I ain't mad when you get bent
But I hate when fools mistake me for U.S. spray
Friends and family, getting after me like repo
Eat, smoke, choke then want me to throw em a c-note
You doing too much when you clutching on my touch-tone
Calling strays over nigga leading months gone
Conversate for fo' hours, wasting mo' power
And only get to hit a cold shower
You faking like you're making more moves than Simpson
But fronting, pushing buttons, doing nothing but sin

And when a nigga on yo' phone, running up yo' bill
Trying to tell some hoodrat bitch how he feel
You know he doing too much, yeah nigga you doing too much
And when your baby momma crying bout she need some milk
And you heard some other nigga did been at her tilt
You know she doing too much, yeah baby you doing too much

Guess what? OG, in the game of rap
And everytime that i see 'em, I get a nigga dept
what's up, to my partners Tray Deee and Goldie Loc
Quick motherfuckin' niggas, always gon' smoke
In the concrete jungle, man you know where it's at
It's the place, where you want to leave, don't want to be at
Believe that, you can check in, but you can't check out
Like Rae, everybody doin' their own shit to get paid
You might die, but it all, goes along with the job
Even ride, do whatever it takes to survive
You a bitch! If you snitch on your friends
But you a true motherfucker, you don't fuck with the pigs

And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

I'm a do some'ing bad to ya, cause you's a motherfucking hoe
I see you at a club, in the middle of the flo'

I'm a tussle with ya, hope you got your niggas with you

Motherfucker better clear the path I feel the wrath, cause Tuck-N-Roll gon burn your scalp
Hoe niggas try to give me dap, but the see the flames like a witch's craft
It's about that time respect my mind, I'm one of a kind
Put that iron down buck em down, these jabs flying voodoo of mind
We gon keep it crunk, pull out a pump knock out his fronts
Nigga my whole team drunk, waiting for the rest your click throwing up
I'm gon drop a bitch, security ain't stopping this
Real niggas get pop-a-liss, right and drop a rhynoserous
See we all about pain you niggas is lame, we ahead of the game
Out of my tool is a train, we searching for change you hating on fame

Now, some of these ugly ass girls in herr
Think they too fly, to say what's up to a nigga
I want you to look at that and hoe and say

Fuck you (fuck you), fuck you (fuck you)
Fuck you (fuck you), fuck you (fuck you)
Now drop that trick, (drop that trick)

Hold up purple one, let O-Tum invade the cut
And lean on a nigga, like (the drank up in my cup)
Everybody make room, I'm bout to cave his chest in
And make his eyes swell up, to where his edge up begin
Tum a shit starter, Tum always to blame
I ain't never played sports, therefor I don't play games
Better ask these dudes, I will rock a nigga ass
And if your click pop off, I'ma slap they monkey ass
Gangsta-gangstafied, that's how we do it in the Dirty
Hit a weenie nigga, with a combination flury
Left-right-right-left, overhand with a quitter
Make room in this bitch, when DSR enter
Headed straight to the bar, to get about a bub
After that hit VIP, and fire up some drugs
Tell judge they didn't pay the deposit, I ain't going up
Rapping is tailored for us, so the game I'm sewing up
Tum Tum and San T, Southside and the 3
Putting it down from Tayhouse, all the way to Mississippi
All the gangstas in the place, all the hustlers in the place
All the thugs in the place, put your hood in his face
I ain't scared of no nigga, I ain't scared of no bitch
I don't bar no squad, and I ain't afraid of no click
It's the million dollar man, I get it popping in this bitch
Better watch what you say, 'fore shit start dropping round this bitch

[Chorus: x2]

I'm a do something bad to ya, disrespect your set talk trash to ya
And if you get out of line, I'ma bring it quick fast to ya
Smash your head, in the concrete
And H-Town Stomp, your bitch ass to the beat
Till they see the white meat, for playing games with my gang
My Hoggs off the chain, they'll dance on your brain
In the middle of the club, like fuck it
The laws see me, and act like they ain't seen nothing
You niggas bluffing, talking hard acting like you want beef
But when I see you on the streets, you hollin' bout you want peace
One or one hundred deep, I'm crush you and them busters
Straight smash on you suckas, you punks don't wanna tussle
My nigga Tuck, say we ready to ride
The whole Southside Dallas, waiting on the Southside
H-Town to the D, we connect in the Tex'
D-S-R and Boss Hogg, don't bar no plex we'll tussle with ya

Flying wherever, buying whatever, whenever

I'm skating on fools, you should see up under my roof

I'm the money go-getter, diamonds got the chains all lit up
When that G4 get up, land make the whole city shake up
Big Tuck's up in here, get buck up in here
Let me tell you something real, every stone VVS clear

Don't have time for them fakers, I been grinding for paper
I'm shining on haters, ten acres up in Jamaica
I'm a fool pimping, a animal for the dough
Professional with it, player, I already know

Let me tell you what's happening, ain't no faking or capping
When the music is slacking, I'm going back to that trapping

I'm all gorilla, keep fifth flawless glitter
The freeway splitter, inside all chinchilla
In the life of a winner, eat steak and lobster for dinner
Pulling up on some spinners, I make one hell of a contender

I'm so-so focused, no clowning on vocals
Look good on my posters, the yacht is the dopest
Getting money is sent to, better check my credentials

Big Twan,"Yo
My crew is in the house
Terra, Herb McGruff, Buddah Bless
Big Twan, Killa Cam, Trooper J, and Mike Boogie
And I'mma set it like this

Aiyo, folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast, when my Smith-Wes' blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smirk, cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley
I'm hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous'

Well, I'm flav, and I was down with the crime wave
Now it's time saved, yo, cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In '87 I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated, rappers you know who made it
Tell the Terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas got and popped and swallow nuts

For those that don't know, yo, I'm Herb McGruff
I'm on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise, break bones
Then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?) Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I'm the fuck up outta here

Aiyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood I'm serving brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
Cause I'm no maricon, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin melon got niggas jealin
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon

Yo, I bust chumps like a Glock 10, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill the show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail
Been no frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail
Yeah, ain't I nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that sawed-off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rugged out
For dissin, you come up missing like a cub scout

Rappers be funny like Flex, cause they section's 80 slaughter, son
Talk about nines and tecs, and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin at least
20 police deceased, it's the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took

I'm havin nail-sharp pains in my brain like a hellraiser
I'm blazin trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up, and keep my head straight

I should never rhyme cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones and sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're come to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I dont' need a gun for you, none of you
Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their muthafuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a Mac-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, ayo, 8 is enough

True, true
And before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
What's up to Rock-N-Will from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Mase Murder and the B.B.O. Crew
The Best Out Crew, the M&M Crew
And all the other crews that's representin in Harlem
You know what I'm sayin?
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew
My crew

Carry it home and cook it for supper

Biggest diamonds off in my mouth princess cuts all in my chain
Wood grain all in my range dripping stains when I switch lanes
Switched the name It's still the same Swisha House or Swisha Blast

Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress

Crushed out stoned, plushed out homes, cellular phones

Sport tailor made outfits with matchin alligators

(What's happing little B.G. bring it to these niggas)

When I got that iron in my hand I'm goin' to slang it
When I got that drama on my mind I'm goin' to bring it
I ain't backin' down from no nigga that's nathan'
If the nigga say I ain't bout my business look here he hatin'

Coming uptown playboy we gonna slang it
If I catch down nigga bad we gonna leave ya stankin'
Fucking wit my H.B's nigga I'm gonna bring it
Rollin' uptown stay strap and keep thinkin'

Cause a nigga get stolen
Better yet get takin'
Paper is burn
They come fast, ya can't shake it
Picture this my brother Cash Money done went nation
That come's from seven hard years of dedication

Fuckin' with B.G. nigga
I'm puttin' on your face and I'm a kill me a nigga
That's believin' worth six figures we call hard hitters
We uptown riders and we real with this nigga, nigga

Police can investigate but they ain't gonna find shit
But a hundred bullet shells without a fucking fingerprint
This Hot Boy click laid back and spy on niggas
We see them workin' on somethin' look here we riders
Ain't like workin' niggas
Any block with a flussy
That goes for the boss too
We ain't got no picks to choose it
We get cha if we gotta
Wig split cha if we gotta
I know you ain't got word that B.G.'s a rider
So keep it on the D.L
If you got keys don't serve nobody but off V.L
Cause they play for keeps
A one way ticket to hizell
Six feet deep
It's a filthy dirty rizell
On the U.P.T
I was raised in the streets
But I put it on my mind
By the time I was nine
Look here nigga I was slangin' that nine

Now them them don't want us
They know me and Turk don't fuss in the corners
They already know that we brothers, Blood
Or whatever you wanna call it
Click up wit my dog we get crazy like alcoholics
Plus we ballers
So whatever we spin the Lex or Benz
Its gonna be on twenny, twen, twens

Get off the block when we come nigga (nigga)
To the lane
Shots that close shop when the bullets start spraying
Run your mouth too much, better watch what cha sayin'
Like a nigga on the sideline, nigga we ain't playin'

Na, Na, Na, Na
Now why O why Lord
The nigga wanna try and die Lord

Niggas wanna learn hard way
Give it to 'em like that
Make 'em suffer
Put that bitch wit a bag

I guess you probably standin' there sayin, ""Who's the muthafucka?""
Nigga Juv's the muthafucka, that'll bruise a muthafucka
Either there's been a lot of cross-firin' in the bricks
And I'm gonna kill me a nigga
If they put me in that shit
Look I'm gonna tell ya like I tell my folks
Play with me if you want but Cash Money goin' broke
Even if it means creepin' up slow
Bustin' out shots out my black Volvo
Fo sho, cause ain't nobody gonna run me
I don't want nobody going to tell my mama when somebody done me
She ain't bring me in the world for that
She ain't raise no ho's
She could have had a girl for that
I been realized, I'm all in
Surrounded by the camouflage, in ballin'
Make a nigga recognize, I'm starvin'
Go in and do a homicide, you fallin', stop callin'
Cause ain't no peace treaties whodie
You better not leave that forty-five at your house cause you gonna need it whodie
I told you boy, I'm a soljah boy

(Got the kees for 11-5)
Come to the B.G. I might do it for a even 5
Nigga I ball and people don't know it, 'cause I don't show it
The only way to find out is if you come and score it
'cause I don't stop with no hoe or no show
I wear my polo, and get a bucket and keep it on the downlow

Third Verse [Manny]:
Never out her, money and the powder
Nigga move the shit from Uptown to Crowder
Who got the sprinkle to make yo ass wrinkle?
Dope fiends and O.G's bout to take a tango
Chickens in a bucket supreme, young hoes dream
Cash rules everything in town, know what I mean?
Snowin' like Alaska, wanted in Nebraska
Bitch tryed to testify I straight blast her
K's and the ammo, modern-day Rambo
Got a glock some woks and a gram hoe
Got a Mazerati bumpin' like Jon Gotti

Wha wha wha nigga nigga
I put piss stains on private planes cause its my jet nigga
Money ain't shit cause my rottweilers drink moet
Diamond baugette bracelets for my lovers
Player, I use Cristal to lubricate rubbers
Who got shit on his wrist that cost 3 nickel
Who got the project on lock when that nigga slanging pickle
Who got Benz, a prowler, playboy, and a Vette
Tell the truth--who fucked ya on the same night when we met?
Now, who got baby mamas from the noila to new york
Who got every bitch attention in this motherfucker when he talk
Now who the fuck we talking bout, look, y'all don't know?
I'll give you a hint, see that bitch you with?
He fucked that hoe
Now look here, y'all ain't seen my watch, its like Harlem world video

Bitch riding Benz on 20 inch chrome
Gimme the key, the car hoe, and the alarm
For my prowler, my jag, my Benz and my home
Bitch you'll never ride 20 inch chrome
I love to shine, that's why the choppa is mine
Hit my block in my Benz hoe with stretch tires
Bought a new car that I couldn't drive
Ordered the tunes before a nigga could drive
When I put the Bose system right behind my eyes
With the vc's and tv's so a nigga could shine
With my ice bling bling like a 9 to 5
And tell all my hoes they don't need no job

[Chorus 2x]

I ride the best from a Benz to a jag to a beamer to a lex
Might fly first class on delta, helicopter or a jet
I'm a stunter, I'm a reppa
Geezy like to shine
Drink Don, Moet, and Cris
See that's the finest wine
20 inches is the only thing I sit my shit on
Don't bring ya bitch around me
Cause my dick she'll wanna sit on
And I ain't gonna tell her nothing different
That's ya issue
But after she come back
Your best out is not to kiss her
Hoes sick saying damn, look at Fresh pinky ring
Look at BG watch
That bitch blingalingaling
I'm a ice wearer, trust me, you will never
See me sporting nothing that ain't 20 g's or better

Juve and Baby take the right

Vroom! sorry we lost 'em
I'm back
I pull up smelling like dime sacks and cognac
I leave in the hummer,
Hour later I'm flying back
Whoosh, private jets about to land
The women fall out when I let em touch my hand
I get out the plane into a Mercedes Benz van
TVs all over with chrome 20 inch fans, damn
Got damn

I tell ya, shorty million dollar, nigga
Don't test, cause lil' shorty is a rider, nigga
Got my click behind me, every step of tha way
Hit your wards, with the pump, with your chest and your face
I'm a bloodhound, I ain't lyin', I'm thugged out!
I'm from uptown, and that ain't no Beverly Hills
You wan' know what that be like? Well, curiosity kills
Send chills up my trigga finger, blast the dummy
'Specially if it's a drought, I got ta have the money
Take tha hit, even if it's below the average money
Got to make it through the week, and feed my family uppy
I'm just a lil' thug, what
Belt-buckle fall down to my cuffs, what
And police don't even matter, they can suck what
The price right if I catch ya slippin', nigga, what what, what

What, what
What, you think I'm scared, cause of the threats that you sendin' me?
Lil' boy, I got so much money, I know who killed Kennedy
I hear you tellin' people 'bout the people you done
But look, every time I brought me to ya, you all about fun
What made you bring a knife to a gun fight, now that's not right!
Why your bitch-ass even showed up tonight?
Nigga, we use ta kick it like Tai Bo
I don't know, what made you go sideshow, turn jive whore
Kickin', trifling, dirty, and low
We use ta split chicken, ride ta Texas and back
I drive the rental car while you drive tha Cadillac
Shakin' like a pair of hot dice
Doin' 55, duckin' feds, law enforcement, and police
Niggas turn like fake gold, sell they soul
Treat'cha like Chicago in the winter, ice cold!
9-karat 44's, and Calicos
Keep a clean nose
And tight Teflon bullet-proof clothes

Fuckin' with my B.G., off top I'm goin' broke

And have niggas' brains coverin' tha ground

But on the other hand, I'ma keep running man
I got about a hundred coming up with three Hummers man
We stuntas man
I might stumble across a grand and give it to you wifey
And watch how she... on my pipey like a Icee

I might be in a Lex watching the game tonight
I got a hundred on Kobe, hope he playing it right
But if I lose, its cool, that's some change lil' shite

Soon as I left the scene, the women vanished
I got it like that
Got Rolex, blue shit hard to say watches
Plus I bought all of my niggas Cartier watches
Weezy and his clique leave with forty b-e-atches
Million dolla man baby tear da beasy
Catch me sipping on some Hen, maybe Covoursier
Sammy, Mario, tody Taz, that's my posse

You might see me dippin low in a Benz truck
Tell yo girl hello

Keep playing with me, I'll put a slug in yo do

Now looky here, young blood
Pull yo pants up on yo ass and put that piece of metal up in yo shirt
Don't make me get up out this wheel chair and kick yo ass
Now keep doing what you doing
Go head

Play with me boy I give you cancer like menthol
Cough cough cough up

Get in they head, they be like, ?Quit Wayne!?
Half hour later, I'm in they split man

Let me get real
I'll kill on the battlefield
Steal for the scrill
I will never leave my clique nigga, I'm to trill
I'm a little peep squeal
But I'm a ape in that jungle
And if you get it twisted,

Just bought two mansions: one in Florida, one in Dallas
I'm a boss nigga
Buy whatever, don't give a fuck 'bout the cost, nigga
I like to floss, nigga
It ain't no secret: I'm the number-one stuntman

Common sense should tell 'em it gotta be a H.B.
'Cause don't nobody stunt like them niggas from CMB
Baby had me reppin' since I was in the sixth grade
'Cause niggas wonder how I'm eighteen and already made
I done been through it - from bustin' heads to doin' time
Now I'm on that level to where I got the right to shine
Me and my clique hit the scene - Ree's, jeans, and T's
Wrist, neck, and ears just shoutin' *bling*bling*
We be thuggin' to the fullest - stay handlin' hoes
'Cause all of 'em the same: straight scandalous hoes
I ain't trippin' - they can ride in the whip with a nigga
But put your head down and donate your lips to a nigga
Tossin' bitches is a hobby 'cause me and my niggas share
Gotta respect that's the life for this Cash Money Millionaire

I like 'em on their head in the bed against the wall

           And make sure that chic was the baddest broad in the club

[Fresh]    Tell a broad, ""Everything for free.
           You can shop 'til you drop, shorty, all on me.""
[children] Nine!
[Fresh]    Number ten ain't nothin' but a lie
           Don't buy the broad nothin', and I'm 'bout to tell you why
[children] Eight!
[Fresh]    Sell the skank a dream bigger than life
           And she gon' stick around for the shoppin' spree, alright

           And you like what I like, and you gon' be alright tonight

[children] Three!
[Fresh]    At this point, if you love me, 
           you'll make my fantasies come true
           And if she say, ""What it is?"" - 
           To sleep with your sister and you
[children] Two!
[Fresh]    Don't love these (?) - love yourself
           And if you pay attention to this you'll have plenty of wealth
[children] One!
[Fresh]    I'm done, and I ain't got nothin' else to say

I mean, we gotta get together - marry yourself, man
'cause ain't nobody gon' care 'bout yourself but yourself

You gon' be with yourself, but you can't cheat on yourself

you'd better catch the sideline
Catch the sideline

N****, the block look the same - it's just crack and cocaine
N****s losin' but we still maintainin'
Livin' life like a penitentiary with a ki in my hand
Knockin' project bricks
Flippin' chickens, and movin' out quick
Hard-hustlin' 'cause we love slingin' this white s***
S.S., Monte Carlo's, hard-tops - we love that s***
'Bout two-hundred thugs with this clique
We multiply everyday for the bulls***
For the hood s***
Burned down buildings ain't no good, slick
N****s pullin' auctions on they own cars to get money quick
Then we dippin' and dabbin'
Goin' back to the labbin'

Hit the block in twin-SL's, and spit at gals
You get that, pal?
Once it's war, n****, skip town
'Cause if I don't do it, be swimmin' with fish, clown
Now, crack a whole chick down, sell it in quarters
If the drama happen to hit town, I'm 'nappin' your daughter
If the broad try to flip out, I'm cuttin' her water
If your boys try to help out, I'm killin' they fathers
When and wherever
What and however - you bring it good
I'll have your mom singin' ""Hmmm hmm hmmm""
Cause nowadays lot of n****s got coward ways
So I ride with K's to knock off the side of heads
But I'm tryin' to stay man, I'm tryin' to stay focused
What I'm tryin' to say we gon' bust it wide open!

I've been blessed
I thank the Lord everyday
for gettin' me from 'round these devils in these dark hallways
How the f*** you gonna help me when I don't care?
N****s see me front it all - they just look and stare
And talk about how it should be and how it could be
Bentley in my basement - ain't nobody understood me
Take care of your people like you take care of your kids
'Cause money ain't s*** when you don't know how to live
And n****s gon' pretend to be your friend when they ain't
You expect 'em to be there until the end, but they can't
Now, how many of you can say you're a real n****?
Play the Prowler, but scared to go in the field with ya
You gon' know your n**** - he gon' be there, still with ya
Whether if it's talkin' or slingin' the steal with ya
Don't answer nobody questions

Don't pop up in the house, you might find your bitch
On my video tape man, rewind that shit

Took a flight to Chicago to holler at my clique

I got to be here for my son and my daughter
Now, five a ki, if you're transportin'

But sometimes these hoes will make punch um in they nose
Squirt um on they shirt cause she wouldn't swallow what I

Some of these hoes need to be kicked in they ass
Some of these hoes been gettin they old man stash

Jumpin' out a 500-S cla** on brodders
So you only had a nickel like me hustlin' hard
'Fore I knew I was workin' four ounces and two quarters
Not a taker I'm scarred from
Swore he was gon' front just bringin' his s***
Now I got a quarter ki - broke it down to six and two quarters
It's cooked already - I got these n****s runnin' like water
Slowly, I'm comin' up - scorin' a ounce since fronted nine

Realisting feams like stitches with the hooker in they chow
Fuck the law, man - I`m known for cooking it row
Til the cops just chill - I got something for y`all
I got a Bentley and the Hummer and they sittin on `em daters
I got a hot power lawyer with the million retater
Douth-South, Westside - man, I own my city
Got judges on my pay roll like they own the nigga
It`s a professional with my game, I ball with the best
Birdman, Down-South - Mack 10 out West
Fuck with my money, put to put the mack to yo` chest
Want war? I take it there - or rather tattooed to there
See them Cash Money niggas - how can I iced like `em
Cooking coke from the pill-up, it`s got a prices like `em
You know a nigga Whoopise - I got a wife like him
You heard a Micheal Jordan right! - I got a life like him
I`ma mothafuckin hustla - y`all know the game
Chi-Town Mikkey Flow - y`all know my name
Game is risky but a nigga rather died the fame
and live life - broken hungry out here, cracking for bread

[Chorus: x 2]
It`s a King Pin`s Dream - coke and feminines
Belley`s on triple beams, got scuffles with triple feams
So, busting out the scene - guns, scopes and beems
But the thing about it dream - it ain`t all watta seem

[Mack 10]
(Yo, yo, yo)
When it comes to drugs - these reppers ain`t get none but fo`
Ohhh square ass nigga and full of brains are sold
I Know `em Feds is on heat but I don`t give a fuck

From crack, more then likey is a suggestion of sell
I gives a fuck - who ya breaking and disso skell
I live life like a King Pin weed but raw

I`m the richest gang living them niggas ever saw

Pirates po`s full of peppers and crack folders
I`ma dope dealer - and I got coke scrilla

My whole crew can sit to at x-cons and killas
and my bitches is falls who bomb, head and coochie
Rockin props, the fades - the letto pump boochie
First statis, rock rolo - when I came to the door?

and now it`s Bentleys, Mansions and meats to the floor
Kickin gears on Parley`s, while the straight pipe screen
and I had a block on lock - since I was fifteen
Mack Sapranos - the most of unforgiven
and fuck a job, cause dope money is how I`m living

[Chorus: x 2] 
It`s a King Pin`s Dream - coke and feminines

When drop it, drop it, drop it - that ain't the tip
When you twerk it, twerk it, twerk it- that ain't the lick
When you pop it, pop it, pop it - that ain't the shit

[Mannie Fresh]
See the story take place in the back of the club
About this shorty that I know and we gone call her ""Young Love""
See lil one like pa, he was the neighbor hood baller
Gucci and Lucci drove a candy and prowler
One more thing I forgot to tell
Young one sixteen bro and she burning like hell
Yo my fault, Pa was 26
Now back to the story bout' the little lost chick
Your man got lil one in the V.I.P.
With his hands in her pants going ""You're so sexy""
Your not dumb but your young, you'll believe what your hearing
You gone sex off the X and your homies cheering
What's even sadder you don't even know what you're doing
Hey young world your whole life's ruined
But what you don't know gonna hurt you tonight
You didn't use a rubber and Pa ain't right

[Chorus]

[Baby]
Man chill in Miami lil head in the projects
On the passenger side with Tammy in the drop Lexus
Me and Fresh at the light in S500 on dub deuces
Bumping some old Cash Money
Got 10 round my neck, 20 on my wrist
Million dollar nut, million dollar kiss
Pull up in the Lexus, sipping on Don P
Hold on Fresh let me get back to this story
Her Sheila freak dealers that only drive Benz
Her mamma said ""My daughters gonna end up in the pen""
But wodie she'll fuck for ends and clothing
She thought she made more money from tricking and hoing
But when her nigga scored the dope she held the stacks
And when that nigga hit the club they be full of that yak
She a hard headed, with a diamond in her tongue
And a tattoo on her ass saying ""come get some""

[Chorus]

[Baby]
Now Stone told me ""Stunna, Kisha wasn't right,
After the Hot Boys had her I fucked the same night""
Now Kisha from Miami ran with Lisa and Candy
Met her at Coco's on the hot strip dancing
Now Trick Daddy told me bout' mom's new clique
But my lil partner Damian wanted to raw-dog the bitch
I'm a three stunna blinder, pop X with the chick
I'm full of the white trying to down this bitch

[Mannie Fresh]
Slow it down, hold it up, get back to your class
Act your age lil mamma stop shaking your ass
Big wheels, X pills, whatcha know bout' that?
Got the old nigga name tattooed on your back
Bet your mamma don't know that you're fucking and shit
And ever since yay high you've been getting a dick
But it's your life and it's your biz
Four different baby-daddies, get how you live

[Chorus]",Lil Mama,2002
Big Tymers,"[Chorus: TQ]
All I ever wanted to do was be da man
Get out the ghetto and feed my whole fam
But the dirty streets in the city won't let me go (let me go, let me go)
All I ever wanted to do was be da man
Get out the ghetto and feed my whole fam
But quarter ki's make G's that's all I know (all I know, all I know)

[Trick Daddy]
A hit of crack frock could get ya fucked up
A ki of coke could get you rich
But too much of this shit can get you stuck up
That's why it's best to deal wit a nigga that you know and chill wit

Case he flip the script, you know where he live at
Plus, the game don' came a long way
Yeah we don' lost a lot of niggas that was speedin down the wrong way
See these days these niggas squeeze triggas quicker than yo boys

'Cause they got guns bigger than yours
Plus ain't not more coppin out
You either ridin or tellin, if you ride then you ride forever
Born the son of a straight killa

Raised by a strong woman, I'll ride for my homies
So, can a nigga get a boooonnnd
Or do another nigga have to come along and raise my daughter......son
Your Honor, answer this question and be honest
If you lock me up for the summer will you support my momma?

[Chorus]

[Baby]
Ay ay, move on over (wooooo)
I sit and took over
2 clips, the AK holder
Brick taped to my bitch

Strapped on her shoulder
Raw grams in the trunk of a jag
Hard ounces stashed in my cadillac dash
It's drought season daddy, we huntin for riches

We fly like birds go divin for fishes
A known deep boy, the number one Stunna
Got a hundred brick stash in the back of the Hummer
But on my block, a old tymer got shot

I didn't want to do it but he was holdin my spot
I'm shittin on niggas, grandma got grams
She gave me a revolver, automatics get jammed
I'm *Hood Rich* nigga one feet in the sand
I'm one of a few niggas that beat the man

[Chorus]

[Mannie Fresh]
See, check it out, the dope game is a mother fucker, young man
I bet you yo lil ass ain't even got a gun man
You in the game now you know what you don' done man?
""Yeah, bruh but I gotta feed my son man""

A cutlass supreme, still a young nigga's dream
A solid lil bitch with a whole lot of cream
Well lil one looky here, who you scorin from?
Look, this some shit that'll leave a nigga body numb

Take that, the comeback is incredible
Get caught, then nigga it's federal
By the way, don't say no mother fuckin names
You listenin to me? Don't play no mother fuckin games

You know the rules of this shit
Fuck around and be one dead bitch
It's money and the power
Every second every hour

From sco' to the flo'
Bakin soda to the flour

If niggas get together then we all can ball
Live as one in the project and bump the sound
And eat chicken til the motherfuckin sun come down
We be lickin to the motherfuckin sun go down
Keep stickin to the motherfuckin sun go down
Get dough, and never go down
Never go down, never go down

[Baby] (First line overlaps hook)
Look look look
I say niggas stroke crosses to knock these bosses
We can ball together make money take loses
You know the game you gotta pay these cost-es
You win some lose some nigga regardless
Hang on the corner sell crack with straps
Or we can go to the club like pimps and macks
Or we can unite for stripes or just say fuck it
You get down bad bust raps for life
It don't matter to me daddy, you do what you do
I'd 'ave took pennitentary ?transit? to get this fool
See I'm'a flip this money take it to the mall
And open up something and get more money
Like the beauty shop, keeps macs when I'm thuggin
Hanging on the block watching for undercovers
Clean a little money, then clean a little money
The rap game ain't for everybody but try something

My people need to get it right
We can either get together or we can straight up fight
We can shake hands or we can go to the gun
Divided we fall or we can live as one
You can fuck wit' it or you can leave it alone
And if you don't want piece bring ya jive ass home
And I heard the fake shit that you said in ya song
And I still love the nigga eventhough he was wrong
See, XXL will let you have the cover
If you say some fake shit about ya brother

You don't know what's going on snake-ass niggas

Love 'um, leave 'um, go back and retrieve 'um
If their hair is bad, then I will weave 'um

Kick back in the Phantom, two clips and a hammer
Cruisin' through the hood on them Deion Sanders
Nothin' but red whips and all them candy
Two chicks, two chickens that flew from Atlanta, aye
Laid back in a Maebach, countin' stacks
Got work, go to work, nigga count that
Summer shine, summer time, and we on the grind
Birdman got them chickens and they ain't flyin'

Here baby doll, up against the wall
And through the sound, he broke it down
Only one more Hypnotic, and that's when he shot it
I'm not lookin' for love, up in the club
But I want to go home with you, girl

[Verse 2]
(Manny Fresh)
I'm cool, I'm hip, I'm fresh, I'm good
I'm diamonds up against the wood, richest nigga from the hood
Four amplifiers, four 24 tires
Fuck professional liars, fo' show enter our fire
In a big black Chevy, starch real heavy
Peanut butter reclinin', with the Steve Harvey line in
Look at me!

(Baby)
Let me slide and ride and get inside
And take you to my hood where it's do or die
Where the whips is clean, we hustle for nickels and dimes
Chips, green, the liquior was hard as a crime
Custom machine and 'dro be on my mind
Lace my team with life and bricks for dimes
Ghetto soldier and you can't stop my shine
Fresh, Stunna, bitch respect my mind

[Chorus: Manny Fresh]
Here baby doll, up against the wall
And through the sound, he broke it down
Only one more Hypnotic, and that's when he shot it
I'm not lookin' for love, up in the club

Sean Paul on the wall, break it down, do it girl
Lift it up, let it flow, shake it fast, there it go
Make it wobble, make it jiggle, put the pickle in the middle
Push it back, make it clap, in and out, that's a wrap
Good bye, so long, I got to go, I'm goin' home
But you my favorite friend, let's bump and grind next weekend

(Baby)
See you fuckin' with your boy, remember who gunna ride?
When trouble hit the hood nigga, who gunna die?
When shit get ugly nigga, who gunna fly?
But when shit get bubbly everybody want to ride me
Benz, Lexus, the coupe, the jets
Nigga holla at the boy, baby pimpin' the flesh
Like in Stalled Evoy, third world is the set
I'm a worldwide shiner bitch, I drove the best

[Chorus: Manny Fresh (2X)]
Here baby doll, up against the wall

Only one more Hypnotic, and that's when he shot it

Hit tha hoe from the back and she sang homie

See this story takes place on a late night
I was on the lakefront trying to get some act right
Hoe was acting funny so I had to kick game
I said you be my queen, I be your king, and things will never change
Now I'm just sitting there, lookin at the beaver
Its Hairy like Barry and its bigger than Geneva
Something said stick my finger in it so I did
Then came the 2, the 3, the 4, the thumb and aww shit
I just don't believe it, how could she concieve it
My fist, my wrist bitch, you need to summer's eve it
Douche ya bush black, you smell like stepback
What the fuck is that (whoo!) tunacat
Put her out my Jag fast, tell that bitch you get no cash
Get your shit together shorty, clean your lil funky ass

Where the city don't love and they don't care

Tell the sister like blood, little brother a thug
And how to survive the cracks in the middle of the mud
I'm the OG gangsta VL in the truth
Every nigga, in my city know how to tussle and shoot

My lil' homey got killed over a key and a pound
So when I pump, pump blood I'm a hold it down

Just to let you know this nigga, still got yo' back
Ain't too much change still doin' my shows
Stayin' away from fake niggas, and busta ass hoes

And no weed to smoke no Gs in sight
And no cris to bust no wheels on bikes
And no pussy to fuck nobody to like

But can you see life roomin' with no money and goods
Big money heavy weights with nobody to cook
Nobody to book nobody to look
Tryin' to get back what motherfuckers they took

All you see is that platinum shit
A ghetto nigga, on stage grabbin' his dick
But you don't know what I have seen
From the bitches to the riches, to the triple beams

The project bricks the old school kicks
The early mornin' capers and the late night flicks
But since I moved on things ain't the same
I chose rap you chose the game

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

See your mom still strugglin' you up in the pen
But mom just wonderin when the end gon end
When the guns gon stop from spinnin' the bin
Or when the hood gon block the dope in the pen

Or when the light shot out you up in the park
The white trunk out your homey got marked
Or every nigga, that talk or rat in his heart
Or every nigga, that talk should die in the dark

I never forgot you and what we did
And how we came up and where we lived
I'm seven forever turn coke to never
Hard head 'til I'm dead until I'm 'bout my cheddar

Gotta get my ends wanna push a Benz
Eat steak live great and raise my twins
I can't believe I'm talkin' to ya' now that ya' gone

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

Now how can one get up off the spot
God damn raise a family get up off the block
Where the city don't love and they don't care
But I will take you there

[Mannie Fresh Rapping..]
I'm a D-O-G, you know me,
Coming through this mother fucker in an 83'
Slant back with kits, spittin shit to your bitch,
She'll do anything for me cause I'm filthy rich,
Hoe open your eyes, I'll feed you popeyes,
Then take you to the crib then I open ya thighs,
Bitch say what you want, do what you feel,
I'll slam dunk a bitch like Shaquille O'Neil,
No I don't play ball but I'm a baller,
Drop ya ass off then I'll call ya,
Arebadurchi bitch, step to the side,
Got 20 more hoes trying to get in my ride,
(?) then I'll flee, go and get a tree, 
Shut the fuck up bitch and listen to me,
Don't worry what I'm doing, and who the fuck I'm screwing,
My money run long like J.R Yewin,
I'm a mack like roni, pretty like Tony, puff like daddy, and the bitches come early,
Give me head can you beat it give ya boy some action,
Spin around and grab my dick like Michael Jackson,
Nigga pimpin ain't dead, you heard what I said,
I got a high priced hoe, layin bitches she red,
The chick want I, 'cause I'm superfly,
The bitch don't believe that I tell her a lie,
I'm an interstate pimp, walk with a limp,
Hoe better have my wine with my lobster and shrimp,
Because I'm rich, chicks they notice me,
Forever my lady ?, bitch I ain't Jodeci,
If fucking you is wrong, I don't want to be right,
Your mouthing feel good and your pussy is tight,
But you gotta understand I could never be your man,
Put ya ring back on bitch, you ain't stan,
You wanna know the real, I tell you how I feel,
I don't give a fuck about a bitch I'm trying to make a bill,
I'm a dog bitch, I don't care,
Fuck what you talking bout, life ain't fair,
Hoes don't help, they just spend your wealth,
Then they gone in the wind when you lone and help,
Other things and your children, smelling like urine,
Gone from home, like you been out tourin,
Think who you with, bitch get off my dick,
I ain't giving up nuthing, I ain't paying your rent,
Bitch get on your hustle, let me see your muscle,
Think you gettin money, then we gon' have to tussle,
Scooby Do, but I don't, Tiger Woods, but I won't, treat you like a woman,
Bitch bring me something, sucker punch ya ass and leave ya ribcage thumpin',

Seven dyked broads and they all look rough
Eight niggaz hollerin', ""don't fuck wit us""

Ten bitches trying to hear what they talkin' about
Eleven cute shorties in the whole damn club

She the one he love, so I hit 'em with a dub

Hypnotiq and a rated X, got her singin the greatest sex
Now on dubs, rollin up, into the club, raisin 'em up
Now we in the back, blazin 'em up (*inhale*), dice in hand, shakin 'em up

I need a chick like that to come and share my gangsta world (woo)
And if you in the club with hands up, you be gangsta girl

[Baby - talking behind Chorus]
Oh yeah

Oh yeah

[Verse 2 - Baby]
Ok, mami your so gangsta cause she f*** with nothin but gangsta (gangsta)
Type a n**** that a stank a gangsta
Drink Hypnotiq and she roll big body
And she got a body, that is gangsta hottie

And she f*** with nothin but gangstas that is old O.G.'s (O.G.)
24's on that brand new jeep
At a gangsta party, she'll be drinkin Bacardi
And she pops her body, don't you hurt nobody

Got my killers in here, they'll squirt somebody
But that Benz so fast, it'll jerk your body
And we smokin that Cali dro, totin that calico
Bird man and Kelly mami, let your body roll

No one will never know, what happen behind the door
I like it fast or slow, a freaky b**** fo sho
Street life is all I know, hustlin and stackin dough
I file to keep it gangsta, until my casket closed

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Mannie Fresh]
Once upon a time in this place called hood
Where the gangsta girls shake it and they all smell good
Lived this legendary pimp (pimp) by the name of Fresh
Fix hair, fix nails, fix toes, fix breast

But one chick super sick, make every n**** grab his dick
Heart pound up and down, when she goin round and round
Do the +Snake+, stop and shake, a** like an earthquake
I can't wait to meet her uh, undress her, beat her up

Now we leavin from the club, and she let me cop a rub
Can't believe she choose me, +Feelin On Her Booty+
I'm about to cut like knives, strokin mami with some ice
Takin me to paradise, I nut once, she nut twice

Sex in cities, rubbin titties, that's how I get it
One more 'gain, with her friend, playa that's how I hit it
Now we grippin, grabbin, pullin, stabbin (what is your name?)
It's Hypnotiq how I got it, but I'ma glad that you came

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Give me a big fine bitch in a dress
One put them lips in effect
Suck the dick 'til the shit in her chest
You can piss on her breast
I like that shit
Project hoes like that dick, don't bite that dick
Give me a spanish sweet hoe
Black from Puerto Rico
Freak ho, specialize in givin' me deep throat
Really don't care how short how plump, short or thick
Give me head, don't care, swallow cum don't spit
Aww shit, I like them Jamaicans and them Haitians
Niggas can't take it when they shake an make me rape 'em
White girl's I video tape 'em and they enjoy it
They love it when everybody saw it
Its off the chain
High yellow Mexican bitches they all for brain
But watch them hoes who want the change
Its not a game
Or short Cuban hoe, with a fat ass though
An I'll keep the bitch just like Fidel Castro

[Chorus: Unplugged]
Tell me what you like
Let me tell you what I like
You goin' on an breakin' me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me

Ain't tryin' to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off

[Verse 2: Lil wanye]
Weezy the hottest
Drinkin' barcadi
I stream through the scene on a lincon on robbers
Lookin' for the finest dime, to wine and dine

Hold up lil mama, slow ya ass down
Pick it up, throw ya ass down
Now throw ya ass around
An scream me name 
I can't hear you say it louder what (wayne, wayne)
A damn shame
Better watch that boy he nasty
I strap on a plastic
Break ya off like elastic
Put the dick in the middle, make it wiggle for ya'll
Might be small, but that dick ain't little at all
I like a short thick broad, fat ass an shit
Like taso flip like Trina the baddest bitch
Matter of fact when I see her, pull her over like a cop
Juve could of backed it up an I would of dropped it like its hot

Now you can bounce, slide, drop, giddy up, giddy up
Now you can ride til you feel it hit a nut, hit a nut
Bounce for ya hood, shake for ya baby daddy
Twerk for that nigga who got you pregnant in the caddy
Slide with the ky, hold up ?
My bitch got thong, you bitch got drawls
My chick like to swallow, yo chick like to spit
If yo chick was my chick I'd still love that bitch
Hold up, chill out, wait a minute stop
My ginseng, Viagra, and a strawberry pop
See I'm feelin' kinda bold, why don't ya bring a friend
From vagina to the asshole do it again
I want a yucky down misses bout whatever
Yo mama loved a tymer, now you welcome
You OK lil mama and I love that chick

Took away his magic.

He's a man without direction.

From a curious infection.
He found out the hard way.
He's only skin and bone.

I'll cry with you.
And if there's something you want me to try,
I'll try for you.

We got benz's rovers' and jag's, hummer's and deville's
Got a green s class, ain't broke the door seal
Shit ain't been the same since i signed fo' reel
This shit got ill, when i hit 4 mill
Five and countin', dirty six at will
Did seven on the slide, 8 worldwide
I'll be on my third bentley by the time i'm at 9
I hear 'em cryin, ""you gon' sell out"" ya damn right
I done sold out before and re-comped the same night
Straight hopped the next flight, too *icey* for sunlight
Dunkin without sprite, yea you heard me dirty
I'm from the show-me state, show me seven i'll show you eight
Karats in one bling, heavily starched jeans
Representin st. louis everytime i breathe
In the city i touch down and i bob and weave, ay

[Chorus]

I sport my beeper on my boots, that's why i be a buzz when i kick
Maybe it's on my lips, it's chaos when i spit
Quarter man, quarter schoolboy, half lunatic
Quarter rubber, quarter dick, other half in yo' shit
Keep a quarter of some sheeeiit, i'm the pooky of the backyard
All colors and all types like a junkyard
Hot young boy with hot young ways
Cause i connect three blunts and be high for three days
You can tell by the way i walk i ain't from 'round hurr (here)
Probably couldn't tell 'cause i ain't walkin nowhurr (nowhere)
I got a old-school cutlass, with a hole in the urr (air)
Tv's urrwhurr (everywhere) wood grain to sturr (stare)
I don't curr (care), hell naw i ain't cuttin my hurr (hair)
To the half in them airforce 1's, give me two purr (pair) ugh
I'm from the lou' and what i do is a lou' thang
One rapper, two rings and three chains

Nothing but some ole country boys that ride v-12 horses
Saddle up and put spurs on my airforce's
Back porches made for hide and go seek
We got space out hurr, we can ride and chief
Ain't gotta worry 'bout nobody approachin' us
By the time they catchin' up, we smoked it up
And my eyes be red, my lips a lil' dark
The lou is more than the rams, cards and lil' arch
My dirty's love to spark, and love to sparkle
Love homies *vokal* coats with matchin' car do's (doors)
We racin down skinker, see how fast our car go
Granny be like ""ay-yi-yi"" like ricky ricardo
I know you want to know why we do what we do
You cats ain't got a clue why the cutlass blue
Brand new twenty-two's on new up's
With one, two, three, four, five tv's

[Chorus]

I'm sittin' on the front porch, writin a hood rhyme
Waitin on my connect to deliver that good line
Wish i would find, one seed in my weed
Sticks and shit, if i do somebody bleed
Pull right here, eight pounds of chinamen
Two stay hittin some blunts and heineken
Hidin in the back with the po' po'
Kicked in my do'do', man they some ho' hooo's
They put the gun to my earr, you know the lord don't fear
Nann nigga, nann hoe, let's keep that bullshit clearr
They had me face down in the skreet
Errbody watchin, thinkin i'ma pull the heat
And leave the d-tects with a leak in the skreet
And that - pussy ass nigga that set me up my peeps
Gon' give it to this nigga like nypd

At the close of day

While we sleep, sleep, sleep

Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep

Just waving their wand

I'm running wild like a river
Where I'm going je ne sais pas
So come with me and come find one
You see me, all around the world like wars and crime
Hustling from the grind to go get what's mine
I'm travelling on the people breathe a lot of sun
On the I will see you next time

Tengo ojos en la espalda vigilandome
Cascara de huevo protegiéndome
La oscuridad me sigue pa' donde quiera que emigro
Pero mis bendiciones corren mas rápido que el peligro
Aceite de cocina vino tinto con canela
Plato blanco sopero agua de coco y siete velas
Tengo un santo que me vela pa' que no me fatigue
Se como moverme porque se quien me persigue
Ningún punto cardinal me atrapa
Este tipo hasta de la brújula se escapa
Ni con brujería, magia negra, magia roja
Aunque me hagan trampa mi velocidad no afloja
Me persiguen porque yo no soy igual
Pero nadie nace con la misma huella digital no no
Mis movimientos no los pueden calcular
Ni con una bola de cristal me pueden descifrar

I'm running wild like a river
I'm running wild like a river
Where I'm going je ne sais pas

I'm running wild like a river yeah
Where i'm going it's just safer
So come with me and come find one

Oye inhala fuerte y bota el aire por la boca
El que respira bien perdura y el que no se sofoca
Las caídas, las heridas, las bajadas, las subidas
No soy suicida pero navego sin salvavidas
Pa' protegerme del me quiere hace daño
Un litro de agua con sal y me doy un baño
Los espíritus me buscan pero no me pueden ver
Ni siquiera los caracoles me pueden leer
A todos nos persiguen en algún momento
Normalmente nos persiguen los que son mas lentos
No me alcanzan aunque salgan de avanzada
Porque corro como los jamaiquinos
En las cabronas olimpiadas
Si no me alcanzas no tienes que preocuparte
Preocúpate cuando me voltee para enfrentarte
Ya le gane al pasado
Ahora le toca al presente
Nunca miro pa atrás
Corro mirando pal frente

I'm gonna run run run run run away
I'm gonna run away

Bigband Orchestra,"I'm recalling times when I was small, in light and free jubilee days
Old folks praying everybody swaying
Loudly, I chanted my praise
How I sang about the Judgment morn
And of Gabriel tooting on his horn
In that sunny land of milk and honey
I had no complaints
While I thought of Saints
So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away
When cares pursue you, ""Hallelujah!""
Gets you through the darkest day
Satan lies awaiting and creating skies of grey
But ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!""
Helps to shoo the clouds away",Hallelujah!,1995

What a pair o' shoes, I'd like to try 'em for size

Hope he tells me maybe, what a wing it will be
So, I said politely ""Darling may I intrude""
He said ""Don't keep me waiting when I'm in the mood""

First I held him lightly and we started to dance
Then I held him tightly what a dreamy romance
And I said ""Hey, baby, it's a quarter to three
There's a mess of moonlight, won't you share it with me""
""Well"" he answered ""Baby, don't you know that it's rude
To keep my two lips waiting when they're in the mood""

I'd dress her in the finest silk; 
Feed her up on oats and hay, 
And milk her twenty times a day.

And she was nothing but skin and bones
I fed her up as fine as silk, 
She jumped the fence and strained her milk. 

And when I die don't bury me at all, 
Just pickle my bones in alcohol
I'ut a bottle o' booze at my head and feet 
And then I know that I will keep.

Sing a song that I can't capture

On a pole set up Norwegian style
Ready to show them what I can
Little bird came flying by
And as northern flames light up the sky
That bird was singing out of range
And I got lost into a haze
He couldn't pick me up so I took him down
To be the centre of my crown
And I thought he'd make the change
He was singing out of range

Surrender all your thoughts and feelings
I’ll see you on the ground
But wait, my time is coming up
I’m getting ready to jump
Now I‘m falling (ten thousand feet below me)
I’m falling down (my fate is unknown to me)
I’m falling

You see it on my face
There’s no way to hide the disgrace, oh yeah
We’ve been down this road before
But wait, something is wrong
It's taking too long
Now I‘m falling (ten thousand feet below me)
I’m falling down (my fate is now unknown to me)
I’m falling
With no parachute
No parachute
Never thought the sky could be so blue
No parachute
No parachute, here I'm come

Something gotta be wrong

Yo moi c'est Bigflo, hello amigo
J'fais que du lourd pourtant j'fais moins d'cinquante kilos
Oli toujours avec moi j'm'en sers comme d'une amulette
J'fous le feu en concert, j'suis taillé comme une allumette
Laissez-moi croire que je pèse
Laissez-moi croire que j'suis rentré dans l'game
Merde, la concurrence passe son temps à soulever des haltères
Mais facile de jouer les soldats quand il n'y a pas de guerre
Bang bang, je prends le mic' et je kicke
D'un coup je les vois qui deviennent dinguent
Pas de copine, pas de style
Y'a des mois que je porte les mêmes fringues

Même quand j'suis sorti de ma mère elle a crié ""mais c'est qui?""
C'est qui, ouais c'est qui c'est Biggy

Le pote amoureux qu'on voit plus depuis qu'il est en couple
J'les appelle tous, comme d'hab', on sort en ville, besoin d'air libre
Notre soirée repose sur les épaules du pote qu'a le permis
À cinq dans une voiture pourrie, on s'imagine en Ferrari
On klaxonne des touristes, j'me demande où passer la nuit
Comme d'hab', on veut aller au ciné car l'heure défile
Mais on a raté la séance le temps d'se mettre d'accord sur l'film
Toujours les mêmes tubes à la radio mais tout le monde écoute
Une belle bande de bras cassés mais, au moins, on s'sert les coudes
On est bien sur notre banc, rien faire, c'est épuisant
Comme d'hab', ça part en débat ""J'te jure, Michael Jackson est vivant""
Après deux/trois verres, mon pote maigrichon veut s'taper
Il s'pense musclé, comme d'hab', on va devoir l'rattraper
Rentrer en boite? Jamais, pourtant, j'ai mis mes beaux vêtements
Au moins, les morts de rire tirent des gueules d’enterrement
On kiffe notre vie comme ça, promis, on fera notre come back

Aujourd'hui j'ai plus peur
Au bonheur j'ai bien envie d'y croire
Mais c'est qu'un jour de plus
Une date qui changera pas l'histoire
Puisque hier j'ai tout perdu, j'ai insulté le vainqueur
Ce soir je peux gagner au loto, juste après le 20 heures
C'est peut être aujourd'hui que je l'aborde
Même si je devais le faire hier
Ou bien ce soir j'écris le meilleur couplet de toute ma carrière
Je rappelle mes vieux potes, on redevient des gamins
Aujourd'hui je souris à ceux qui ont plus de hier que de demain
J'ai mis de, côté mes coups de blues, la tonne de doutes et de peurs
Aujourd'hui ce qui fera déborder le vase sera un bouquet de fleur
Aujourd'hui j'irai en cours, les yeux fixés sur ma montre
Si j'ai le temps, juste en sortant, j'irai faire le tour du monde
Aujourd'hui je baisse pas la tête, j'efface les cauchemars de la veille
Puis je passerai au cimetière, même sa tombe s'est fait vieille
J'apprendrai la guitare, demain je serai peut-être une star
Si l'amour est à chaque coin de rue, je veux être sur le bon trottoir
Aujourd'hui j'ouvre la fenêtre, j'épargnerai la mouche
Ce soir je remplis un Zénith, les yeux fermés sous la douche
Aujourd'hui j'ai une copine, mon permis et mon bac
Demain j'aurai une fille, une voiture et un taf

Et j'ai tellement de chose à faire avant la nuit
Hier j'étais un gamin, aujourd'hui je le suis encore
Hier j'étais un con, aujourd'hui je ferai des efforts
Aujourd'hui j'arrête de me plaindre sur mes tout petits malheurs
Car y a tellement de gens qui souffrent, mes larmes ont peu de valeurs
Aujourd'hui je parle à ma mère, j'ai trop souvent fait le sourd
Elle s'est occupé de moi hier, demain ça sera mon tour
Demain ça sera notre tour
Avec mes potes on est pas les plus cools
On est pas les plus fous, nous on est pas de ceux qui roulent les épaules
Je parlerai pas d'argent, dans le fond c'est pas ça le problème
La réussite c'est la fierté dans les yeux des gens que l'on aime
Je récupérerai le moral, tout au fond de mes baskets
Le ciel m'est tombé sur la tête, je m'en suis fait une casquette
Je suis seul dans une mer immense sur un petit radeau qui tangue
Qui va de l'avant, et j'ai levé l'ancre
Et souvent j'y pense et tu m'manques
Mais aujourd'hui je laisserai pas de place à la nostalgie
Car aujourd'hui je regrette hier demain je regretterai aujourd'hui
Et bien sur j'irai voir Oli, pour lui je donnerai tout ce que j'ai

Bigflo,"Une fin de journée comme les autres, je compte la caisse et la ferme à clé
Prudent, vingt ans de métier déjà deux fois braqué
Bijoutier de l'or entre les doigts c'est ma routine
J'm'y attendais pas si tard, un scooter se gare devant la vitrine
C'est même pas mon scooter j'ai du l'emprunter à un ami
De toute façon j'ai même pas la thune pour passer mon permis
J'me gare devant la boutique c'est pas ma première fois
Mais c'est la première fois que j'ai un flingue entre les doigts
Donc je stresse
Allo chérie je part bientôt, j'espère que tu as bien mis la table
Un texto à ma copine ce soir je te ramène une bague
Une partie de la silhouette cachée par les volets de la fenêtre
J'suis prêt j'enfile mes gants mon collant sur la tête
Je rentre
Il entre
-""Excusez moi monsieur on est fermé""
J'me bloque, il est armé, je l'vois sortir un glock
-""Au sol, j'vais te canner vide la caisse et tes poches""
Dire que ma mère me croyait en entretien d'embauche
J'ai peur
J'ai peur
Et lui aussi quand j'y pense, il a pas l'habitude pas l'attitude, il a la main qui tremble
-""Prenez ce que vous voulez de l'argent, de l'or, mais s'il vous plait faites vite""
-""Ferme la""
Si il savait que le chargeur est vide
""J'vais te tuer""Est ce que la faim m'a transformé en monstre?
Habitué j'lui montre du doigt l'endroit où sont cachées les montres
C'est l'heure faut pas qu'j'me dégonfle, pas qu'il m'dénonce les flics me rateront pas
Alors j'combats mes démons, j'casse et j'démonte j'peux plus rompre le contrat
J'suis désolé au fond mais bon on a tous nos problèmes
Si c'est pour sauver ma famille j'suis prêt à sacrifier la sienne
Pour me sortir de mes sales draps j'ai pas le choix j'ai besoin d'une grosse somme
Je supporte pas qu'on m'ordonne et au fond y'a pas mort d'homme
Ça fait deux fois qu'on vient me voler
Chaque fois on râle mais on bouge pas
L'avenir de ce qui se lève tôt est gâché par tous ceux qui se couchent tard
Moi je lui veux pas du mal, bien sur tout ça c'est pour la thune
J'en ai eu marre de traîner tard le soir éclairé par la lune
On a tabassé le gars du bar tabac pas plus tard qu'hier
Il veut des sous, qu'il enlève sa cagoule, j'recherche un stagiaire
J'vais pas encore me laisser faire, le laisser filer merci bonsoir
Là j'pète mon fusible pensant au fusil derrière le comptoir
Bientôt la fin de l'histoire, j'remplis le sac, j'remplis ma tête de rêves
A deux doigts du tiroir
-""Arrête de bouger où j'te crève""
Je sors
Alors c'est tout il va s'en sortir comme ça
J'y suis presque
Avec la moitié de ma vie au fond de son sac
C'était si simple, enfin la fin de la faim j'y croyait plus
Je prend mon arme, la charge et je sors dans la rue
Le scooter peine à démarrer, pas grave je m'en payerais un bientôt
La vengeance m'ouvre ses bras à l'instant où il me tourne le dos
Cette fois c'est trop salaud, j'lève le bras et vise
Est-ce qu'il le faut? Pas de cadeau, j'prépare mon doigt j'hésite
J'vais acheter un chien à ma cousine, une voiture à ma femme
J'mettrais bien même ma voisine, et tout le quartier en voyage
De nouveaux paysages, finie la galère, un collier à ma mère un gros chèque à mon frère, des tas de...

Je vous rappelle l’information principale en ce bel après midi
Un bouchon record à lieu en ce moment même sur la
Certaines personne y sont bloquées depuis trois heures
Une grande pensée donc à nos auditeurs à l'intérieur,
Je vous rappelle les consignes de sécurité
Restez bien dans vos voitures, n'ouvrez pas les portières
Armez-vous de patience et surtout n'oubliez

Il coupe sec la radio, il n'a pas dormi de la nuit
À l’arrière on se moque de lui, ça fait pas longtemps qu'il conduit
Mais rentrer de boîte en caisse, c'est toujours mieux que prendre le bus
En matant dans le rétro, il aperçoit une belle voiture de luxe

Il en est fier de sa voiture, personne ne l'a encore rayée
Il en est fou, elle le rassure, mais il ne l'a pas encore payée
Elle séduit les crédules, lui rembourse le crédit
Mais vaut mieux ça, qu'une caisse pourrie comme celle à côté de lui

Y'a celle qui vit dedans, elle est chez elle donc elle a tout son temps
Une grande couette dans le coffre et toute sa vie dans la boîte à gants
Elle a perdu son appart', lui reste juste sa Clio
Sa vie en feux de détresse, mais personne ne remarque ses cligno'

Un jeune homme se sent très mal sur cette route bouchée
Car sa femme l'attend à l’hôpital, elle est en train d'accoucher
Son téléphone sonne, il décroche et son visage s'éclaire
Le jeune homme est devenu père

Sur la route toute l'année, les bouchons il les affronte par millions
À Noël, son sapin jaune décore le camion
De Marseille jusqu'à Lyon, de Toulouse jusqu'à Tours
Sa femme elle est là si ça va mal, comme sa roue de secours

Elle repense à sa vie, en retouchant sa coiffure
Car elle sait bien que l'corbillard n'est qu'à quelques voitures

Aller, avance, la vielle putain, pourquoi ça va pas plus vite?
Comme sa voiture familiale, elle va péter une durite
""Maman on arrive quand ?"" Son fils est surexcité
Le p'tit fait des grimaces en fixant la voiture d'à côté

Il a bien vu l'gamin, mais rien ne l'fera sourire
Une Renault grise comme son teint, accompagnée d'un soupir
Elle est partie pour un autre homme, une autre conquête
Il sent encore son parfum sur le revêtement d'la banquette

Il en a marre d'être coincé ici, des kilomètres de ligne
Il est en bout d'file, sourcils froncés, visage bouffi
Il veut retrouver sa télé et son canapé en cuir
Tout ça à cause d'un connard qui ne sait pas conduire

À la radio, la vieille entend aux infos qu'une petite fille
A été oubliée pendant l'bouchon, dans une station service
Derrière elle, énervée et concentrée
La mère de famille ne se rend pas compte qu'il reste un siège vide à côté de son fils
Le jeune conducteur a encore pris une cuite la veille
Il ne sait pas que le corbillard est plus proche de lui que de la vieille
Le routier fait ses derniers kilomètres, sa dernière semaine
Ensuite il part à la retraite, aux côtés de la femme qu'il aime
Sous le siège troué de celle qui a son auto comme lit
Se cache un ticket de loto gagnant, qui va changer sa vie
Le faux riche qui s'ment et qui la dévisage d'un air sûr
Ne se doute pas qu'dans pas longtemps, ils échangeront leurs voitures
L'amoureux déçu qui lit encore et encore sa dernière lettre
Ne sait pas qu'elle est aussi dans l'bouchon et qu'elle regrette
L'homme qui râle contre le connard qui fait d'son aprem' un enfer
Saura plus tard que c'est son frère qui a percuté une barrière
Son enfant pourrait devenir routier
Mère de famille, sans femme, sans emploi
Avoir des chaînes en or ou dormir dehors, seul sans un toit
Mais il y a une chose dont le jeune père est sûr
Le premier cadeau qu'il lui fera sera une p'tite voiture

Les larmes au yeux si tu trouves un euro par terre
J'dois beaucoup à mes potes : dans les deux sens du terme
Les yaourts sans gout, tomber en panne sur la route
Jouer au basket sans panier avec un ballon de foot
Payer en centimes, rêver des vacances sur un banc
Dans nos dix mètres carrés on voit toujours les choses en grand

J'ai pas grand chose dans les poches à part mes mains, mais
C'est déjà bien j'ai de quoi écrire des refrains
Et pour mes proches, on verra bien demain
Le soleil une paire de pote, ça coûte rien

Pas grand chose dans nos caisses caisses caisses caisses vraie
C'est là que les galères naissent naissent naissent naissent Eh!
Sans cesse ils nous rabaissent-baissent-baissent-baissent mais
Les écoute pas non laisse laisse laisse laisse les

D'ailleurs flo, tu me dois un euro
Haha haha",Ca Coûte Rien,2015
Bigflo,"Alors les petits?
Quoi de neuf depuis la dernière fois?
Vous vous sentez prêts c'est ça?
Vous n'avez plus, le trac?

C'est l'histoire de deux frères, qui écrivent dans leurs chambres
Qui sont tombés dans l'rap par hasard et qui tentent leur chance
Qui sentent les rouages qui s'enclenchent, les anciens rois qui flanchent
Il est grand temps que les temps changent c'est l'moment
Sèche tes larmes et prépare ta lame, viens avec nous
Mets-toi dans l'coup, viens rallumer la flamme
Pour nous c'est plus que du rap, c'est toute notre vie
C'est plus que des fans, c'est toute notre ville
C'est pas une question d'âge, pas une question d'couleur
Pas une question d'race, de poids ou de physique
Mais c'est une question d'âme, c'est une question d'douleur
C'est une question de rage, d'foi et de musique
Et peut-être bien qu'on s'trompe, qu'c'est nous les cons, mais viens on va s'lancer
Et puis si on aura pas changé le monde, on moins nous on aura changé
P't-être qu'on s'prend pour c'qu'on n'est pas, qu'on n'est pas encore prêts
On est devant la grande porte, a-t-on choisi la bonne clé?
Balance le beat que j'rappe, que j'claque, que j'frappe, que j'montre qu'on a la dalle
Qu'on en a marre de ces types qui ne disent rien devant le mic'
Qui nous prennent de haut, qui nous rabaissent, qui s'moquent, qui nous mentent
Qui changent de discours selon le produit qu'ils nous vendent
Ils font du rap comme ils pourraient faire du sport
Moi j'fais jamais de sport, car j'passe mon temps à faire du rap
J'veux l'vivre à en crever, Oli m'a dit d'viser très haut
Alors on a taffé, gratté pour des (yeah yeah yo)
Le vent tourne comme la roue
Je n'tends plus la joue, franchement faut qu'j't'avoue
J'ai peur, souvent les gens m'poussent à bout
J'me sens plus jaloux, y'a rien d'plus tabou qu'le cœur
Traverser le miroir, je rêve de les rejoindre
Aide-nous à leur dire qu'on a faim, qu'on est pleins, qu'ils peuvent nous craindre
Nous on n'a pas une vie de voyous, pas une tête de durs
Donc on fera pas rêver les petits bourges en manque d'aventures
Décidément j'ai du mal à me faire à l'idée que la fin déboule, faut que tu saches
J'entends des voix dans mon lit, seul la nuit qui me disent ""Biggy nan faut pas que tu lâches""
Je donnerai de mon temps, de ma voix et des milliers de lignes, des millions de phrases
Et puis je les entends qui débitent des conneries à longueur de temps, ils ont pas passé l'âge
Ils font semblant d'pas nous entendre, semblant de pas nous voir
Mais les petits ont grandi dans l'noir, on vient prendre le pouvoir
Depuis longtemps, on attend, chaque jour on apprend
On veut rentrer dans la cour des grands

La cour des grands, c'est ça
Mais pour qui vous vous prenez?
Vous n'avez encore rien fait, rien accompli
Et toi Oli, tu as quelques chose à leur dire?

Le soleil va s'lever, ici tout est plus calme
Dans mon cocon familial, loin des paillettes de la capitale
La même chambre d'enfant, sans rideau ni coulisses
Les posters nous observent et reflètent nos fous rires
Venez on rappe la vraie vie, et tout c'qui nous ressemble
J'vais l'crier fort pour ceux qui sont partis qu'ils puissent aussi m'entendre
Fini de faire les cons, prenez ce son comme un attentat
On m'dit ""assure, hein, fais du bon, ça fait trop longtemps qu'on attend ça""
Des heures pour une photo, des lettres qu'ils n'ont pas lues
J'étais comme un visiteur de musée qui parlait aux statues
Fan de rap, devant la glace j'ai chialé trop d'textes
Donc venez débrancher mon micro si un jour j'prends la grosse tête
Et j'y crois, comme un fou qu'attend l'retour d'sa femme
J'ai pas l'choix, on va l'faire au moins pour les deux-trois fans
La chance on va la prendre, tu vas entendre nos voix
Ceux qui n'ont pas donné d'coup d'pouce vont s'en mordre les doigts
Demain c'est nous, la barre est haute qui peut la décrocher?
Sur un tas de projets, on va tous les faucher
Avec ou sans trophée, la vie on va croquer
Ça fait trop longtemps qu'on veut l'faire
Car cet album sera la trace de notre passage sur Terre
Ils seraient capables de nous vendre du silence
Une salle vide face à un grand pianiste, un zénith plein pour un rappeur qui ment
Les graines de stars se plantent, le succès n'est qu'illusoire
Car même en haut d'l'affiche il faut redescendre pour la voir
On a besoin de vous, c'est le départ d'une nouvelle ère, la plupart de nos pas, on les fait entre frères
On peut pas s'planter y'aura jamais de plan B, faut r'monter la pente après, sinon, on va s'planter
Depuis tout petits la musique nous suit, on a faim tiens toi bien on va changer les règles
Monte le son dans ton casque ils entendent que mon rap on veut lire notre rêve sur le bord de tes lèvres
À deux, on est plus forts et avec vous, plus encore
On est parés, on va jeter un pavé dans l'eau qui dort
Depuis longtemps, on attend, chaque jour on apprend
On veut rentrer dans la cour des grands

Mais le chemin sera long
Et il reste encore beaucoup de marches à gravir
Bonne chance
Quant à nous, on se reverra c'est sûr",La  Cour Des Grands,2015

J'ai pas d'crew, j'traîne pas, faut qu'j'bosse mon interro
En soirée, mes potes se la jouent bière et vodka
Hé, Bigflo, sers-moi un grand verre de Coca
Si tu m'files un flingue, j'saurais même pas m'en servir
J'fais quoi d'une Ferrari, j'ai toujours pas mon permis
J'ai déjà pleuré devant un film, Oli mélancolie
Moi, j'suis allé en prison, mais qu'au Monopoly
J'avoue, je bave devant leurs clips, leurs bling-blings et leurs photos
Tout est vrai chez moi, sauf ma montre et mon polo
Pas l'temps pour le sport, moi, c'est le rap d'abord
Et, dans mon clip, tu verras qu'un labrador
Et je gratte dans l'métro, pas la taille d'un héros
Couché tard, levé tôt, en freestyle sous l'préau
Si j'fais dix pompes, je frôle le malaise

Pourtant, mes classiques, j'les connais
Dis-moi, pourquoi t'es étonné?

J'me réveille tranquille, normal, c'est samedi
Le soleil déjà levé, normal, c'est midi
J'me pose devant la télé avec un bol de Miel Pops
À peine fini de boire le lait que j'allume la X-Box
Des heures avec les amis, s'il vous plaît, aidez-moi
Ouais, j'suis un geek, j'crois qu'j'ai raté ma vie à cause de GTA
Moi, j'connais par cœur les casses de Brice de Nice
Voici l'premier rappeur sponsorisé par Leader Price
C'est pas marrant, j'ai souvent du mal à m'y faire
C'est moi le grand mais on m'prend pour le petit frère
J'suis pas un gangsta
Pas de flingue, de ganja, lève ta main si t'aimes ça
Quoi, tu veux que je boive, que je baise, que je fume
Mais ferme ta gueule et passe le Schweppes Agrumes

Pourtant, j'fais bouger les têtes, tu connais mes textes
Connais pas ma technique, mec, mais t'es qui?
Je vise le Bingo, que des faux lingots, éviter les bimbos, matte mon équipe
Ça fout les boules, ouais, ça les dégoûte

Bigflo,"J'attends la vague de la mer de mes larmes
J'attends la vague pour l'instant j'ai le vague à l'âme
Il manigance dans mon dos, prépare des plans en cachette
Un jour tout se paye, rien ne s'achète
Partout je vois de la haine, les relations humaines m’écœurent
J'ai peur des gens que j'aime car je leur ai confié mon cœur
Tout le monde m'entend pourtant personne ne m'écoute
Je rêve de billets verts pourtant ceux qui en ont me dégoûtent
J'ai, le cœur qui pleure, les, yeux qui saignent
Tu m'as fait tellement de mal, ne me dis pas que tu m'aimes
Mon âme sœur, doit être perdue quelque part en Chine
Mais la gloire transformera le vilain petit canard en cygne
Le mic' me console, lui seul me conseille
Qui sont ces personnes qui viennent voir mes concerts
Ces cons voudraient qu'on se taise
Y a plein de choses qui me consternent
Mais y a ma mère qui a le cancer
Donc y a que ça qui me concerne
J'ai peur de l'au-delà, du paranormal
Je prie pour trouver la foi, plutôt paradoxale
Ce soir, la lumière s'éteint sur le cirque
Égoïste, je ne pense qu'à mes disques
Certains disent que, j'ai changé, ils mentent
Je ne suis pas d'ici moi, ma planète me manque
Je repense à toutes ces fois où l'on m'a humilié
Papa ne t'en fait pas ton fils se fait des milliers
Soit un homme Florian, un jour tu seras père
Parfois j'ai honte de traîner avec Peter Pan
Mais j'ai trop peur de le perdre
La vie contre la mort, la religion contre la science
Les étoiles m'ouvrent leurs bras mais puis-je leur faire confiance?
La vie de rappeur entre les phases et le flow
Mes potes me disent qu'ils ont peur, que le Big écrase le Flo
Je suis un inventeur à moi le concourt Lépine
La vie m'a fait une fleur mais j'ai bien trop peur des épines
Et je rappe pour les ringards, je rappe pour mes frères
Pour les regards discrets qui ont déjà vu l'enfer
Pour ce type un peu paumé, qui, rêve au fond de la classe
Pour cette gamine fragile qui n'aime pas se voir dans la glace
Pour ceux qu'aiment pas trop traîner tard dans les boites ou les bars
Pour ceux qui pleurent le soir, tout seul dans le noir
Parce que si ton bateau coule moi je t'apporte une voile
Parce que j'ai promis à mon frère qu'on toucherait les étoiles
Je suis bling-bling, ouai, ça fait partie de mes fautes
Ils ont fait venir mon grand père en bateau
Donc faut que je reparte en yacht
Et je rêve de la une
Je suis marié à ma plume
Je la trompe avec la lune
Et puis je voudrais y croire, en Dieu
Je vais devoir couper la poire, en deux
Comment veux-tu que j'y vois, sans yeux?
Mon frère est le même que moi, en mieux

Bigflo,"Musique à fond dans l’mp3, Marco rentre chez lui
Mais ce qu’il ne sait pas c’est qu’il ne rentre pas aujourd’hui
Il est sorti plus tôt donc il ne veut pas perdre de temps
Regarde ses baskets en marchant, presse le pas au milieu des gens
Il est sept heures et quart, c’est l’heure qu’elle a choisi
Il quitte le trottoir, voit pas le 4x4 derrière lui
Il traverse, la voiture le renverse
Son corps bascule, il n’entend que cette musique qui le berce
Pas vraiment de douleur même si son sang coule
Il voit son corps de dessus au milieu d’la foule
Plus d’poids, il sent qu’il se détache, il voit la ville qui bouge
Dommage de mourir à cause d’un petit homme rouge
Le trajet de c’matin, sa dernière clope, sa première fois
Des paysages, de vagues images, ses meilleurs potes, ses mauvais choix
Petites amies, l’école, l’alcool, les potes, les filles, les billes
Les souvenirs brillent et s’impriment sur ses pupilles
Les sirènes mais le silence, et tous ces gens qui défilent
Avec ses ciseaux, la mort coupe un fil
Marco sent qu’il tombe, mais pourtant il monte
Il tournoie, doucement et s’éloigne de notre monde

Parc’que la mort nous en a trop pris, si c’est un jeu, elle triche
L’histoire que j’vais vous raconter est si triste
C’est dingue, on quittera tous ce monde un jour et on l’sait bien
Un instant, une seconde et d’un coup tout s’éteint

Parc’que la mort nous en a trop pris, si c’est un jeu, elle triche
L’histoire que j’vais vous raconter est si triste
C’est dingue, on quittera tous ce monde un jour et on l’sait bien
Un instant, une seconde et d’un coup tout s’éteint

Là-haut pas de portail, de nuage, ou de lumière aveuglante
Pas de Dieu, pas d’ange, de tunnel blanc, ni d’grand temple
Rien de tout c’qu’il imagine, le temps fuit sans bruit
Juste le sourire de ceux partis avant lui
Un bonjour à son grand-père, parti pour un cancer
Un accueil chaleureux, juste entre eux, en pleins cieux
Loin des tensions, drôle de destination
Marco est ému, lui qui n’a jamais pris l’avion
Loin des bourses en manque, pas de temps pas d’cigarettes ou d’banques
Pas d’agents, non pas d’argent, de clans, de mitraillettes ou d’tanks
Pas d’Sud, pas d’Nord, pas d’nuls, pas d’forts
Une petite leçon de vie, une grande leçon de mort
La fin sonne comme un nouveau début pour Marco
C’est dingue comme nos vies lui semblent petites vues d’là-haut
Un souvenir d'Amérique, près des tués en Harley
En marchant au loin il reconnaît la voix d’Bob Marley
Il est bien dans ce monde il ne sent plus son corps mais garde son âme entière
Sur l’cadran d’sa montre, les aiguilles tournent à l’envers
Une vieille femme en noir, Marco s’approche “Madame s’il vous plaît”
Mais c’est une autre histoire, attends le troisième couplet

Parc’que la mort nous en a trop pris, si c’est un jeu, elle triche
L’histoire que j’vais vous raconter n’est pas si triste
Pourquoi craint-on la mort si on croit au Paradis?
Pourquoi pleure-t-on encore quand un proche est parti?

Parc’que la mort nous en a trop pris, si c’est un jeu, elle triche
L’histoire que j’vais vous raconter n’est pas si triste
Pourquoi craint-on la mort si on croit au Paradis?
Pourquoi pleure-t-on encore quand un proche est parti?

-Eh madame qui êtes-vous?
- Je suis la mort, tu sors d’où?
- Qu’est-c’qui m’arrive, j’comprends pas?
- Tais-toi, Marco c’est ça?
- Ouais c'est moi pourquoi qu’est-c’que j’fais là? J’venais de m’installer
J’ai pas fait d’mal, j’ai pas eu l’choix, j’ai à peine vingt-et-un balais
Et j’peux pas rester là pitié que quelqu’un m’aide
- C’est plus possible
- On m’attend en bas y’a tellement d’gens qui m’aiment
- Ici aussi
- J’ai pas l’temps, pousse-toi, on m’attend j’suis pressée
Dans une ruelle en bas une femme viens d’se faire agresser
- Pourquoi elle, pourquoi aujourd’hui Tout doit s’arrêter?
- C’est pas moi qui choisit, j’ai une liste à respecter
- Et où est-ce marqué notre heure, notre chemin?
- Dans un vieux livre sacré qu’on appelle le destin
Au fait tu te plains mais tu as droit au billet retour
Dis au revoir à ton grand-père nous on s’reverra un jour
- Quoi?
Marco sent alors des chocs dans sa poitrine
Il est tiré vers le bas, son âme s’illumine
Il revoit sa vie, de sa mort jusqu’à sa naissance
Il descend la voie de son corps à contre-sens
''T'es là?'' un ami lui murmure a l'oreille

Bigflo,"Hey yo Flo, ça fait longtemps qu’on a pas fait le point
Moi? Je suis toi à 20 ans tu t’en souviens?
Un plus un égal un, au fond on est les mêmes tous les deux
Quand tu regardes dans un miroir on se regarde dans les yeux
Ça fait bizarre de te parler, on est un peu schizophrènes
As-tu tenu les promesses qu’on s’était faites? Y’en a plus d’une centaine
Eviter l'alcool et la drogue, rester sains
Eviter la pop et la mode, rester simples
As-tu retourné la France? Tes rêves sont-ils partis en cendres?
As-tu la chance d’avoir un fils ou une fille, qui nous ressemble?
Ce son est une porte vers le futur, une avancée sur ma route
Rassure moi, car en ce moment j’t'avoue que j’ai pas mal de doutes
J’parie que t’aimes le café, t’as moins de cheveux plus de barbe
Et si ça se trouve tu trouves les casquettes nazes, t’écoutes même plus de rap
Non j’espère pas, fais pas ça, t’as pas le droit et tu le sais
Pour les fans, j’espère qu’t'as pensé à nous muscler
Arrête de t'moquer d'moi, quand tu tombes sur mes photos
Car si j'pouvais voir les tiennes, j'rigolerais avec mes potos
Va voir nos parents, dis leur que j’suis toujours leur enfant
Que si plein de choses changent, celle-là ne change jamais avec le temps
Viens rendre visite à mon fantôme, dans les rues de ta ville
Flo, as-tu trouvé la femme de ma vie?
Il est toujours à nos côtés passe le bonjour à Oli
Et puis le troisième couplet, mais c’est à toi de l’écrire

Devant le miroir j'nous vois, je vois aussi mes choix
Les étoiles, le soir, ne me répondent pas
Et il me tarde d'être toi, toi tu regrettes le temps où t'étais moi
Un de ces jours on se donnera rendez vous devant le miroir

J'écris hésitant mon futur, ton présent soulevant mes doutes
J'allume une bougie, j'espère qu'tu la verras briller
J'ai caché cette lettre enfouie au fond du sablier
Oli t'es sensible car ces temps-ci j'ai peur
M'en veux pas j'suis sûr que t'as grandi grâce à mes erreurs
J'm'en fou si j'ai des rides, du moment qu't'as le sourire
Par contre si j'ai pris du bide, faut vraiment qu't'ailles courir
Reviens rapidement en arrière, le cimetière, puis le berceau
SI ça se trouve tu veux plus m'entendre, t'as même jeté ce morceau
Alors il y a quoi plus tard, est-ce que notre vie en vaut le coup?
Franchement répond, car si c'est non j'nous fous en l'air, maintenant
Si tu galères courage, promis j'mets d'côté pour ton loyer
T'as pris de l'âge, est ce que pour t'parler je doit me vouvoyer?
T'es resté proche de mon frère, de notre frère, de ton ange gardien
J'te rappelle tu disais être célèbre ça ne changera rien
Pendant qu'tu les pleures et que t'appréhendes demain
Moi j'profite et j'ris avec ceux qui t'ont quitté sur l'chemin
Soit fort Oli, voilà c'que j'voudrais dire si tu pouvais m'entendre
J'avoue j't'envie, tu sais déjà tout c'que j'doit apprendre
Je souris en t’imaginant père de famille
Rappelle-toi de l'époque où tu kiffais le hip-hop à en perdre la vie
Avec qui j'me suis marié? Une blonde, une brune je sais pas
Et puis c'est drôle de m'dire que j'la connais peut-être déjà
J'espère que t'as atteint mon but parce qu’aujourd’hui j'y compte bien
Et de nos potes avec qui on traînait il en reste combien?
Promis je profite de notre vie, on à tant de chose à s'dire encore
Mais attends Oli t'es là? J'espère que t'es pas mort

Mais je laisse rien paraître devant ma fille et sa mère
Bisous, ""Bonjour"", ennui, cafetière
La jolie vaisselle que nous a donnée grand-mère
J'aimerais tout foutre en l'air, ouais, j'y pense, des fois
Les jours se ressemblent comme ma fille et moi
""Allez chérie, dépêche-toi, on va être en retard
Dis ""Bonjour"" aux voisins; au revoir, connard""
Toujours bloqué dans la circulation
Stimulation, agression, allez, avance, pauv' con
""Qu'est-ce qu'il t'arrive, papa, dis-moi pourquoi tu t'énerves""
Je l'entends pas, aujourd'hui, j'suis coincé dans un rêve
""Allez mon ange, sois sage et passe une bonne journée""
Ma propre hypocrisie commence vraiment à me soûler
Youhou ! Maintenant, direction l'taf, l'éclate
Un lapin dans un clapier, huit heures derrière un clavier
Ça fait deux semaines que j'essaye de parler à mon patron
Je l'imagine souvent, le soir, découpé dans des cartons
""Monsieur, pour mon augmentation
On en parlera plus tard""
Dire que ça fait quinze ans qu'j'enfile ce putain d'costard
Après, j'irai chercher ma fille, comme toujours
Je ne vois que l'ennui, où est passée ma vie? Où est passé l'amour?
Ce soir, la même bouffe de supermarché
Haricots verts, steak haché, on fera semblant d'pas s'fâcher
Mais j'ai encore trouvé des textos dans son téléphone
C'est pas la fin du monde, ça fait deux ans qu'elle me trompe
Moi, comme d'hab', je dis rien, non, comme d'hab', je suis aphone
Ce monde est trop pourri pour ma fille, j'ai honte
La routine, le premier jour comme le dernier
Attends, mais y'a pas un fusil dans le grenier?
Le taf, l'angoisse, la ville, l'ennui
Le temps qui passe, routine, l'ennui
L'amour, la mort, les rêves, l'envie
Photo, sourire, encore la ville
Le stress, le noir, les larmes, les cris
Les klaxonnes, les sonneries
Je crois que, ce soir, je vais faire une connerie

Seul dans l'ombre, j'suis qu'un monsieur tout l'monde
J'avance, je tombe, j'suis qu'un monsieur tout l'monde
J'ai jeté l'éponge, comme monsieur tout l'monde
Je plonge dans le plus sombre de mes songes
Seul dans l'ombre, j'suis qu'un monsieur tout l'monde

Qui ferait même pas de mal à une mouche, j'l'entendais chanter sous la douche
Il m'aidait à descendre mes courses
Un gars ordinaire, discret, sans histoire
Y'a ma maison à la télé, tout ça : difficile d'y croire
À la radio, c'est dingue, ils parlent de flingue, de rideaux en sang
Dire qu'on avait passé le dernier nouvel an ensembles
On parlait bricolage autour d'un verre, trinquant à notre santé
Un monsieur tout l'monde, et personne n's'y attendait

Et à propos d'l'incident?
Vous pouvez nous raconter c'que vous avez entendu?
C'que vous avez vu?

Il a tué sa fille et sa femme, 'fin, sa femme en premier
On parle de fusil et d'idées noires dans l'fond d'son grenier
J'entends encore le bruit des cris: c'est pire à chaque seconde
Trois tombes pour un monsieur tout l'monde
Voisin assassin appuyant quatre fois sur la gâchette
Les volets fermés, oui, l'drame s'est passé en cachette
J'ai entendu un ""bam"", on venait de quitter la table
Vingt-deux heures trente-deux, une balle: celle qui a tuée sa femme
Ils s'fâchaient pas mal, j'ai pensé à une dispute banale
S'enchaîne un coup machinal, le calme, puis la balle finale
Un coup d'fil: la police débarque, les chaînes télé défilent
On m'demande des infos sur le barge, un peu comme dans les films
On a retrouvé l'corps de sa fille tout près du sien
Dire qu'j'ai vu c'type pleurer à la mort de son chien
Ma femme ne parle plus depuis qu'elle a su la nouvelle
Elle a croisée son regard, hier soir, en sortant la poubelle
Toujours souriant, un gars sympa qui habitait à deux pas
J'suis sûr qu'les autres voisins disent la même chose de moi
Il me ressemble: la voiture, la femme, la belle-mère, les soirées à table
Le canapé, les films banals, le pain pour l'canard du canal
Le chien, le putain d'nain d'jardin, la terrasse au soleil
Qu'est-ce qui m'empêcherait de faire pareil?

Seul dans l'ombre, j'suis qu'un monsieur tout l'monde
J'avance, je tombe, j'suis qu'un monsieur tout l'monde
J'ai jeté l'éponge, comme monsieur tout l'monde
Je plonge dans le plus sombre de mes songes
Seul dans l'ombre, j'suis qu'un monsieur tout l'monde
J'avance, je tombe, j'suis qu'un monsieur tout l'monde
J'ai jeté l'éponge, comme monsieur tout l'monde
Je plonge dans le plus sombre de mes songes

J'sais pas pourquoi, ce matin, je suis très en colère
Mais je laisse rien paraître devant ma fille et sa mère
Bisous, ""Bonjour"", ennui, cafetière
La jolie vaisselle que nous a donnée grand-mère
J'aimerais tout foutre en l'air",Monsieur Tout Le Monde,2015
Bigflo,"Je les vois dealer devant l'école, filer et faire les cons
Brûler des bagnoles, fumer du chichon
Enfin tout ça, j'l'ai vu à la télé
J'les évite en ville apparemment ces gars sont fêlés
Aucun respect pour les profs, ça s'moque du monde entier
Quand ils ont leur diplôme, ça finit en taule ou sur les chantiers
La main crispée sur le portable, quand je prends le métro
Quand une voiture dérape, c'est toujours eux dans le rétro
Des journées sur des bancs, car ils sont tous au chômage
En écoutant du rap, leur musique de sauvage
Ça traîne et traite les flics, aime puis frappe les filles
Ne freinent jamais devant le défi, en garde-à-vue ces mecs défilent
Basket, survêt' et casquette à l'envers
Ils font tout de travers, leurs revolvers remplissent les faits divers
Ils errent, et c'est les gangsters qu'ils vénèrent
Hier sur mon mur ils ont écrit en clair

Nik ta mère
Ils ont écrit
Nik ta mère
Ouais ils m'ont écrit
Nik ta mère
Mais moi je peux rien dire, non moi je peux rien faire
Pourtant ils ont écrit
Nik ta mère
Ouais ils m'ont écrit

Je te jure ils ont écrit

Mais moi je peux rien dire, comme d'hab' je dois me taire, c'est ça?

Déjà le lieu: une cité où les rêves se brisent plus vite que les vitres
L'ennui fait que l'avenir s’effrite plus vite que le shit
Un triste domicile à une heure du centre ville
Du béton, du béton, du béton, du béton
Maman ne parle pas trop français, ils sont seuls en classe
Trop chers les cours particuliers voilà pourquoi ils se ramassent
Voilà pourquoi ils écoutent moins la prof' que leurs écouteurs
Les punitions attisent la haine, alors ça sort les cutters
Voilà pourquoi pour se calmer ils prennent un peu d'herbe
Un peu d'air, mais l'air est pollué ça sent la mort et la guerre
Dans la rue, les grands frères roulent en BMW
Qui ne se sentirait pas attiré par l'odeur du billet?
Voila pourquoi ils deviennent dealer, que ça commence à foirer
Parce que vos fils cherchent toujours de la beuh pour leurs petites soirées
Ouais à l'école tout est bon, la maman croit le fiston
Mais lui ramasse les biftons, mec, c'est dur sans piston
Malgré tout ça la plupart gardent la tête froide, tiennent le cap
Bosse, décroche le diplôme et cherche du taff
Ce que le patron lit dans les journaux, l'aide à faire le tri
Donc c'est un qui fait une connerie, pour mille qui en payent le prix
Voila pourquoi chômage, voila pourquoi ils abandonnent
Putain c'est trop dommage, on les traite pas en tant qu'hommes
Contrôle musclé à longueur de journée par les mêmes agents
Qui les ont vu grandir, parfois mêmes plus que leurs propres parents
Alors ils en peuvent plus, un crachat, une insulte perdue
Les flics n'attendent que ça, voilà pourquoi garde à vue
Dans la cellule couché, la vie a un goût amer
Il trouve un crayon par-terre, voilà pourquoi, voilà pourquoi

Bigflo,"Le rap est dans un sale état; nous tester: fallait pas
Si t'es pas calmé, gars, j'vais te cramer, t'écraser grave
Dix-huit balais: v'là l'écart; au départ, sur mon âge, tu rageais
Mais c'est bizarre, dès que j'rappe, la plupart ferment leur clapet car
J'ai les mille et un flows, dans ma caverne, j'suis oli baba, gros
Au cro-mi, j'blague pas, pas pour les bâtards, j'kiffais les appâtés
Dans la rue, on t'aborde, toutes les filles t'adorent, c'est fort
T'es disque d'or mais tu sais pas rapper
Ajoute ""wood"" à ""oli"", tu t'retrouves au cinéma
Bigflo me dit: ""calme-toi, frappe pas les faibles""
Les mc sont nazes, oui, le combat est inégal
Donc, si on kick ça à chaque fois, y'aura défaite
On m'raconte qu'en ville ils ne parlent que de gun
Ça boit, ça fume, ça dit: ""wesh ma gueule""
Les gens réclament nos plumes car y'en a aucune valable
Depuis l'époque d'iam ou de michael
Oli, à table! Oui maman
Mais gueule pas trop fort, on va t'entendre sur l'disque
Euh merde, ça enregistre? Ouais tant pis
J'assume ma vie un peu pourrie de pauvre type gentil
On verra dans dix ans si ces faux bandits auront grandit
Quand la vie et le temps tirent sur les rides, c'est flippant
Fini le shit, le frigo vide et le caddie, faut remplir le ventre des p'tits
Oli, calme toi là
Trop tard, j'suis déjà reparti, j'te jure, la vie va trop vite
Alors on s'en fiche de tes clips et de tes bitchs
Qui dansent près de ta ferrari
Pourquoi tu mens, oli? T'es comme tous les ados
Tu rêves de bif et même d'avoir de beaux abdos
J'suis un peu fou, personne n'a idée
Le matin, j'dois réveiller toutes mes personnalités
Entre les intellos et les profs
Les parisiens bobos et les beaufs
J'sais plus trop quoi faire, d'une planète originaire
J'vis à des années lumières, désolé, c'est l'décalage horaire
Ma bouche est un flingue, j'appuie sur la détente
On me dit monte d'un cran, t'as vu le top 50?
Et tous mes potes d'enfance kiffent le hip-hop d'antan
Mais, dans leur pauvre ipod, j'entends que de la pop dansante
Oui, j'ai le rap dans l'sang ; mais ils sont d'où?
C'est marrant, ils vont vite mais on comprend tout
Merci madame, faudra s'y habituer
Même si, en france, les rappeurs ne savent pas articuler
Putain, mais dis quelque chose
Trouve-toi un orthophoniste, un vrai travail ou une cause
Oli, pourquoi tu parles mal des autres? Toi aussi, tu fais des fautes
Oui, j'ai peur du noir et, quand j'suis seul, des fois
J'chante des chansons pourries en faisant la vaisselle
Par contre, derrière le mic, qui peut me teste, dis-moi?
Car depuis des mois j'attends toujours qu'un artiste essaye
Et à propos d'la maille? J'préfère la foule
Trop de types devenus fous au départ étaient millionnaires
Et à propos d'tes fans? On vient du futur
Donc ils sont tous visionnaires

De notre planète on arrive, mais le public n'est pas prêt
Tu chantes?
Depuis l'an 2000, les types ne savent plus rapper
Oli?
Les fans nous réclament, guettent le moindre signe de vie
Ca sonne bien quand même
C'est bigflo & oli, on vient combler le vide

Parler de, parler de nous aussi, on peut l'faire
Montrer les, parler des nous aussi, on peut l'faire
Parler de, parler de nous aussi, on peut l'faire
Mais on préfère quitter la terre, on se casse
Viens avec nous, il reste de la place

Je suis venu pour t'humilier, te ridiculiser
Te mutiler, t'es pas immunisé, petit illuminé
J'vais t'éliminer, les rimes illimitées, t'es pas habilité
Vu ta débilité de gros naze
Tu vois comme c'est facile de rapper vite?
Donc tu peux supprimer quelques mc de ta playlist
Ecouter ces merdes toute la journée, c'est pénible
Dire que, pour la plupart, ils font la tournée des zéniths
Mais, flo, t'as acheté une place. Je sais
Faut qu't'arrêtes, tu parles mal! J'essaie
Mais j'clash ceux dont je suis fan, c'est comme ça
Comme d'hab' dans ma vie, dans ma peau, je suis mal
Car, être humain, c'est humiliant
Sur ma planète j'avais déjà mille ans (mille ans?)
Mille ans, donc comprends que
Je vous trouve tous si lents, silence! Quoi?
Flo, ferme ta gueule! Frère
Non, sérieux, tu parles seul! Merde
Normal qu'on me trouvait bizarre dans la cour de récré
Personne ne rappe plus vite que nous, poto, tu peux chronométrer
Ils veulent des gros flingues, des beaux seins, des gros poings
Des copains, des pots-de-vin, des potins
Mais j'en ai pas, j'te le dis franchement, poto
Tout ça m'dépasse, et les filles veulent des
""T'es la femme de ma life
T'es la flamme de ma vie""
Ça me désole de voir des connes qui quittent l'école
Pour faire les folles, rendre leur vie molle, se piquent, s'envolent
La fuite, la drogue, les flics, la coke, qu'écoutent d'la daube
Échangent de potes, et changent de clopes
Tout ça pour finir enceinte sur un parking
Biggie! Mais, en attendant, tu choppes pas! Je sais
Faut qu't'arrêtes d'être comme ça! J'essaie
On verra bien demain
Chez universal, ça se frotte les mains
J'ai des tas de carcasses de rats dans mon 4x4
Écarte tes gars toi, tu finis à quatre pattes
Fais gaffe man car je te découpe en quatre quarts
Attaque, pare, la balle part et te fracasse
Ah ouais, le mec kick grave
Facile d'être le meilleur dans ce rap de naze
J'en ai encore dans l'sac, ouais, j'ai des tas de phases
Des comme oli et biggie, j'en vois pas des masses
J'suis précoce dans l'rap, c'est la même au lit
Elle est vierge extra, comme l'huile d'olive
Haha, nan désolé oli
Ne pas faire de rimes faciles, on se l'était promis
Bien sûr, ça fout les boules, ça dégoûte, ça les saoule
Mais c'est cool, on déboule de toulouse, et ils sont pas prêts
T'es un mouton, pas un loup, pourquoi tu l'ouvres?
C'est douloureux, c'est du lourd, oups, c'est la fin du couplet

De notre planète, on arrive, mais le public n'est pas prêt
Tu chantes?
Depuis l'an 2000, les types ne savent plus rapper
Tu vois, toi aussi
Les fans nous réclament, guettent le moindre signe de vie
Ca sonne bien quand même
C'est bigflo & oli, on vient combler le vide

Dites-leur de retourner au taf

Ouais?
J'crois que c'est vraiment pas fait pour nous ici
On rentre?",Nous Aussi,2015
Bigflo,"Oli, dans ma voix
Dans ma voix

Dans ma voix, il y a celle de ma voisine
Celle du petit que je vois le matin
Il y a l'accent de ma ville, il y a la voix timide de moi gamin
Le chuchotement de la faucheuse et de ceux qui croisent mon chemin
Sous un saule pleureur, arrosé par un canal de larmes
Comme toi j'ai peur, donc sers toi, voilà un peu d'mon âme
Je rime, mais je ris rarement, je sais qu'j'ai tort
Je sais pas ce qui me lie avec mon frère, mais je sais qu'c'est fort
Rusé, j'ai fait le mort, pour voir qui sont les vautours
Dans la fusée j'ai le spleen d'un astronaute sur le chemin retour
Tous les jours c'est carnaval, je ne vois que des gens, déguisés
C'est marrant quand t'as du blé, t'habites aux champs, Elysées
Je combat la déprime mais c'est un match trafiqué
Elle m'a eu comme ce moustique que t'écrase mais qui t'a déjà piqué
Le fruit du travail, c'est boire du vin devant sa vigne
Mes phrases m'amènent au bout du monde, donc je suis pilote de ligne
L'avenir est un long fleuve tranquille, l'amour une rivière
Je me sens plus en vie, qu'un enfant l'est dans un cimetière
J'accepte mes erreurs, même les génies ça se trompe
Je veux faire de la trompette sur la lune comme Neil et Louis Armstrong
Ma mère m'épaule, je vois le reflet de mon père dans son sourire
Promis, bientôt c'est fini, le patron, le stress, les soupirs
Flashback et souvenir, mes premiers freestyles
L'avenir me rend fou donc je dis que je perds la boule de cristal
Le taf, faut que tu traces, fait gaffe, l'argent t'efface
Indifférent comme un aveugle aux porte de Las Vegas
Je me méfie des hommes, j'ai compris qu'ils partaient en vrille
Depuis qu'ils ont coincé la statue de la liberté sur une île
Fils du 21ème siècle, je crois bien que la bêtise m'a eu
Je suis ce poète seul dans l'cercle regrettant les disparus
Le temps me file entre les doigts, on m'l'a répété 100 fois
Assis à l'arrêt, j'ai compris que le bus démarrerait avec ou sans moi
Sale décor, on est con, on déconne
Sur les cernes de la caissière du Lidl, j'ai lu : ""bosse à l'école""
Mais les tubes dans mon iPod me rappellent qu'un couplet change la donne
Toujours le même, j'attends la belle, d'autres attendent la bonne
Bigflo est un génie, je dois forcément l'être un peu
J'me vois, 6 ans devant la bougie, les gens me criant : ""Fais un vœu!""
Je le réalise, je pensais pas que ça serait si beau
Depuis je livre mon cœur de pierre sur papier ciseau
J'suis bizarre, des types poissard comme moi y en a pas des milliards
Je serai capable d'être tué, percuté par un corbillard
Mais d'ici, je compte emporter plein de souvenirs
J'ai marqué vivre sur la liste des choses à faire avant de mourir
Ouais je vais me bouger et ranger ce bazar, car le hasard fait bien les choses
Mais on ne fait jamais de choses bien par hasard
Des milliers d'années autour de l'épée d'Arthur pour la décrocher
J'ai réfléchi, j'suis reparti avec le rocher
Oli arrive, ouais nos légendes ont morflé
Seul dans mon lit j'fais des bras de fer avec Morphée
Suis-je coupable de dire tout haut ce que je pense tout bas?
Fan de Claude Nougaro, je bouge la tête sur du Booba
On ne fera jamais partie de ces types qui friment et qui vivent la nuit
Parler de biff m'ennuie, j'écris des rimes loin des délires de VIP
Juste besoin d'un bic, du public, d'un beat, d'une batterie qui claque, mon stylo se vide
A chaque fois j'assois les MCs qui passent
Envers et contre tous, à l'envers et à l'écoute
Je battle contre moi-même devant le miroir et je perd à tout les coups
Je suis ces yeux d'enfants, devant une scène d'épouvante
Un jour, j'irai me noyer dans la fontaine de jouvence
Y a pas de paix dans le nom Gandhi, pas de haine dans Hitler
Donc juge pas sur un blase, oui appelle moi juste petit frère
Je suis la jeunesse en personne, ces dinosaures sont avares
Je forme le fond et fonds la forme, je suis le philosophe sans la barbe",Le  Philosophe Sans La Barbe,2015
Bigflo,"Allo, ouais c'est encore moi
j'sais qu'ça fait quatre fois qu'j't'appelle mais, s'te plaît, réponds. (Arrête, mec!)
Tu m'en veux mais on peut pas s'quitter comme ça
s'te plaît, réponds-moi. (Nan, sérieux, raccroche!)
Faut vraiment qu'on arrange tout ça. (Raccroche, putain!)
Tu me manques

Je sais qu'tu l'aimes, je sais qu't'es amoureux
Mais je vois plus de larmes que d'étoiles dans tes yeux
Tu me racontes ton histoire et tu pleures des larmes (chut)
La page est trop mouillée donc tourne-la
Elle, oublie-la, la vérité c'est qu'elle m'a jamais plu
Puis merde, pense à notre pote qui en a jamais eu
C'est pas d'ta faute, moi je m'en moque si tu pleures, tu sais
Et j'suis ton pote donc j'ai la colle pour ton cœur brisé
Il faut qu'on s'calme, qu'on s'cale devant la télé
Il faut qu'on s'parle, qu'on s'marre, j'te vois affolé
Non, commence pas, mon gars, tu veux l'appeler
Il faut qu'on parte, qu'on s'barre, faut pas l'harceler
T'es un type super, elle, elle est super conne
Souviens-toi, la fille de l'Hyper, elle était hyper bonne
Arrête tes conneries, bien sûr que non, tu veux pas mourir
Pour t'consoler, moi j'suis tellement pourri que...

J'aurais pu t'écrire une ballade
Ça t'aurait rendu malade mais t'aurais chialé encore
J'ai préféré te dire ""C'est pas grave""
Te raconter des salades du genre ""Les copains d'abord""

Gêné, comme tes yeux j'ai rougi, puis allume la lumière
Tu vas t'effondrer comme ta bougie
J'vois qu'tu boudes, y'a encore son odeur sur les draps
J'sais jamais trop quoi dire à part sourire et t'ouvrir mes bras
Puis, viens, on trinque déjà au prochain
Moi j'suis ton grand pote, lui c'était juste un petit copain
Il était moche de toute façon, tu ris quand j'le charrie
Et si tu trouves aucun garçon, dans dix ans on se marie
Arrête de râler, y'a plus grave, viens on crame ses affaires
Tu veux l'numéro d'mon cousin? Il est célibataire
Non j'déconne, tais-toi, t'es pas grosse et j'le dis toujours
Pour ouvrir les portes du bonheur faut bien des poignées d'amour
Tu t'plains pour rien, regarde, ce soir, là t'es pas seule
Si j'étais plus musclé, pour toi, j'lui aurais cassé la gueule
J'avoue, c'est plus classe dans les films mais j'fais c'que j'peux
T'étais là quand j'étais mal donc, pour que t'ailles mieux

Ça fait trop longtemps que je suis dans l'ombre
Trop longtemps que l'on me laisse sur le côté
Où sont-ils, ceux dont on parle dans la prophétie?
Ça fait si longtemps que je les attends
Existent-ils vraiment?

L'impression d'être une vache qui regarde passer les trains
L'air inquiet étant donné que j'ai peur de rater le mien
Ils veulent m'arracher la main, j'ai quand même envie de la tendre
Demain, c'est loin, mais j'ai quand même envie d'attendre
Pourquoi tu veux qu'on se tape, poto? Reste ici
Pendant que ces mecs se battent, non, nous, on réfléchit
Les temps sont durs donc faut pas qu'on se ramollisse
J'ai rêvé que Molière écrivait ""Nique la police""
En lisant leurs textes, on s'tape des barres de rire
Hahahaha, le rap game, c'est la garderie
Je suis dans la lune, faut qu'je me concentre
J'suis incompris ou bien trop con pour comprendre
Attends miss, de nos jours, faut être attentif
Le rap est noyé, comme la cité d'Atlantis
Je suis comme le Diable: torturé par ses propres vices
Le hip-hop c'est César: tué par ses propres fils!
Y'a trop de pleurs et d'drames, on déconne
J'ai un peu peur de mes fans #JohnLennon
Ce soir, la plume sera plus lourde que le plomb
Garçon, range ton flingue dans ton caleçon
J'ai croisé un homme, il m'a donné une carte
Il m'a dit: ""Avec ton frère, tu trouveras l'trésor
Tu pourras enfin rencontrer l'esprit du rap
Et tenter de le ramener d'entre les morts"", alors

J'ai ouvert le livre tout en haut de la bibliothèque
J'ai découvert le temple, j'ai mené mon enquête
J'ai enfin trouvé le parchemin de la prophétie
J'ai soufflé dessus, j'ai lu ""Bigflo & Oli""
Laaaaaaaaalalalala Bigflo & Oli
Laaaaaaaaalalalala Bigflo & Oli

Un flow de malade, un enfant dur à soigner
Le temps passe avec ou sans montre autour du poignet
J'trace sans strass, j'reste honnête
J'écris fier mes poèmes incompris comme la pierre de rosette
Derrière le rideau, l'artiste se prépare
On peut être partout et n'aller nulle part
J'ai rallumé la flamme, c'est le début d'un incendie
Ils ont brulé nos livres comme à Alexandrie
Et, si tout le monde m'aime, moi, je déteste personne
Le rap est mort mais s'vend encore #MichaelJackson
Et j'enterre ces gangsters, ces connards de bandits
J'ai le regard qui tue comme les yeux de Gandhi
J'ai vu des combats sur papier échappés des bas fond
J'ai déterré la hache de guerre pour l'enterrer plus profond
Le génie se distille un peu et je médite
L'amour, ça crève les yeux, demande à Œdipe
Dans l'noir, le soir, j'ravale mes doutes
L'Diable m'a appellé pour acheter mon âme, je lui ai dit qu'elle en valait le double
Et, dans cette conquête, je me balade et j'grave mes vers
Le rap? C'est le malade imaginaire
Et il va s'manger le décor, attrapé le virus
J'bats des records, ma plume dévore le papyrus
L'avenir se dessine, j'rime dans un but précis
MC, on m'désigne messie de cette prophétie
Le vynil grésille, ici, j'éclaircis le récit
Net et précis, l'horizon rétrécit
Depuis des années, des fous prédissent tous sa mort
Mais le disque tourne encore

J'ai ouvert le livre tout en haut de la bibliothèque
J'ai découvert le temple, j'ai mené mon enquête
J'ai enfin trouvé le parchemin de la prophétie

- Bigflo & Oli : les deux MC de la prophétie?

- Faut pas nous mentir, on veut prendre le mic car, en ce moment, ça empire
On sera hip-hop, on salira pas le 'cro-mi'
- Hahaha! Ça aussi, ils l'avaient promis mais
Pour quelques grammes, ils vendent leur âme au Diable
Pour quelques clips, pour quelques clics, pour quelques fans
- C'est triste
- Mais je sens le début d'une nouvelle ère
La prophétie avait prédit l'arrivée des deux frères
- On travaillera nos rimes, notre rythme et notre diction
- Je vous donne ma bénédiction",Atlantis,2015
Bigflo,"Délaisser les amis
Passer toute la nuit dans le labo avec Oli
Ramener le Hip-Hop à la vie
On a mis juste les rimes et les accords
Et on a pas changés le monde, non pas encore
J'annule la trêve et puis je pars à l'attaque
Mon pote m'a dit
""Tu vis ton rêve pendant qu'je taff à la fac
Donc j'en ai rien à foutre que tu t'plaignes faut qu't'intègres
Ici on aimerait tous avoir tes problèmes""
Il a raison mais dans l'fond c'est pas si facile
La pression et toutes ces nouvelles choses qui m'arrivent
Avec Oli on s'est dit que jamais on céderait
J'veux que celui qui écoute ce son sache que c'est vrai
Ouais j'veux qu'il sache tout ce que j'ai au fond des trippes
Que j'écris c'que je cri, que je vis c'que je rappe
Que je taffe avec envie même si parfois je titube
Que je gratte toute la nuit pour qu'mon soleil brille plus
Le désert, à marcher des heures et des heures
Et on s'arrêtera pas tant qu'on sera pas les meilleurs
C'est que le début, on continue le tournois
On sera jamais à la mode donc on sera toujours là
Les pros d'mon milieu sont des menteurs, crois pas qu'ils nous ressemblent
Ils oublient qu'la musique ça s'calcul pas, non ça s'ressent
Donc allez vous faire foutre vous et tous vos collègues
Ma vraie victoire c'est qu'on chante mes sons dans mon ancien collège
Merci à tous pour votre soutient d'enfer
A tout les bras mis en l'air, à tout les rappeurs en herbe
On a besoin de vous, les visionnaires qui nous élèvent
Asseyez-vous, vous êtes les réalisateurs de nos rêves
Y'a pas longtemps j'ai changé, j'me suis accepté
J'ai traversé le miroir, j'y ai enlacé mon reflet
Un câlin avec moi-même, ça peut te sembler taré
Mais si tu ressens d'la haine, tu devrais faire pareil
Etre adulte c'est pas boire du café, fumer des clopes
C'est respecter sa famille et prendre soin de ses proches
Et je sais que j'peux faire mieux
J'veux bien en devenir un si j'suis pas obligé de devenir sérieux
J'suis fière quand même, on va pas s'mentir
De toutes ces salles à remplir, de notre début d'empire
J'ai décidé de faire le ménage et je l'ai eu mon Tourbus 2 étages
J'ai mis Pikachu dans une boîte, à la prochaine l'ami
Faut j'grandisse, dur de s'dire, que j'en ai bientôt 24
La suite des choses s'annonce grandiose
Avec l'hermano dans l'cosmos en osmos
Papa tes fils deviennent des hommes malgré leur vies de bohème
Toujours on met la gomme, appliqués dans nos poèmes
Le début d'un royaume, les mains de frères qui se tiennent
Tout ça en un album, imagine le deuxième

Et même si peu d'gens veulent le croire
On a pris rendez-vous, on attend l'heure de gloire
On nous a dit ""c'est dingue, vous avez pas changés
N'oublie pas d'où tu viens, tu pourrais bientôt rentrer""

Et même si peu d'gens veulent le croire
On a pris rendez-vous, on attend l'heure de gloire
On nous a dit ""c'est dingue, vous avez pas changés

Parfois l'avenir chuchote mais j'l'entend pas
Yanis me dit ""la vraie vie, tous nos problèmes c'est quand qu't'en parles?""
Je fais le pitre mais je flippe dans l'fond
T'as vu ce qu'on vient de vivre?
Penses-y pour ta prochaine chanson
De belles rencontres sur mon parcours
Les hypocrites comptent pas
J'pense à mon daron et sa guitare qui a plus d'contrat
En studio, ma vie d'bohème crée des barrages
Peur de dire ""désolé j'ai concert"" le jour d'mon mariage
J'voudrais abandonner quand parfois ce monde me dégoûte
Mais à ce père qui me chuchote ""les gars mes gosses vous écoutent""
Ma grand-mère vient d'Algérie, dur comme ses fins d'mois
J'vais fêter mes 20 piges au Zénith et à l'Olympia
J'ai choisis d'être honnête ouai et d'kicker la vérité
Rien à foutre j'profites, si ça s'arrête c'est que j'l'ai pas mérité
On va chanter et changer le monde dans la foulé
J'écris pour entendre le ""Bravo"" d'Flo quand il écoute mon couplet
Merci les gars pour les coups d'pouces
Pour tout vos mots dans mes coups de blues
Les frangins fêtent ça bien mais 'steuplé parlez plus de Toulouse
La mort laisse-moi une heure que j'rappe une dernière fois
A la poursuite du bonheur qui est pt'être derrière moi
J'voulais le vivre avec mon frère, que tout nos rêves s'étendent
J'm'en fou d'la villa sur la mer si c'est pour être seul dedans
Mes potes me disent ""fais-le pour nous""
Ils m'prennent tous pour un fou
Au concert j'me suis vu gamin la main en l'air dans la foule
Dans l'champs des possible, j'ai jeté une graine hier soir
Malpolis, j'parle la bouche pleine ouais pleine d'espoir
Deux frères, un visionnaire
La vie c'est pas qu'l'argent, le principal c'est d'être heureux, et millionnaire
J'déprime à la conquête d'une fille honnête
On m'dit ""fais gaffe"" l'amour c'est rare et c'est pt'être le pire remède
En attendant j'malmène mon corps et j'met mon cœur en quarantaine
Et j’enchaîne de ville en ville, de pleurs en rire, de scène en scène
Seul, place du Cap', j'repense à mon avenir
Mes ennemis sont derrière moi, mais j'les vois venir
Je passe devant le McDo', j'ai des potes qui y taffent
Eux enchaînent après la fac, moi j'rappe et j'me plain c'est ça l'pire
On m'paie pour m'voir, on fait pleurer des filles
J'me sens con car dans l'fond, j'ai jamais sauvé des vies
Ouai taff en dur, c'est que l'début de l'aventure sois-en sûr
Devant l'mur ils censurent mais je sais qu'les talents durent
Les poings serrés, mon pote a juré sur la Mecque
Comme j'ai pas d'religion moi j'ai juré sur ma mère
On s'est promis d'rien oublier, sur sa tête et sur la mienne
Il m'a tendu la main et j'ai juré d'faire la même
Chers détracteurs, j'serais bientôt le meilleur faut l'admettre
J'préfère enfoncer les portes ouvertes que de m'jeter par la fenêtre
Merci pour vos lettres, dur de tout lire pour être honnête
Quand on s'croise pour la première fois, j'ai l'impression de vous connaître
Pourquoi moi? un p'tit sudiste en manque de confiance
J'croise les doigts, la tête encore dans les rêves de la veille
J'y crois pas mais petit à petit j'en prend conscience
Et puis toi, imagines juste que tu peux faire pareil
C'est la fin des vendus qui face aux micros mentent
Elle dit ""j'suis contente pour Oli mais Olivio m'manque""
Je fixe le vide tout en haut de la tour
Un pied dans la cour des grands maintenant j'veux être le plus grand de la cour

Et même si peu d'gens veulent le croire
On a pris rendez-vous, on attend l'heure de gloire
On nous a dit ""c'est dingue, vous avez pas changés
N'oublie pas d'où tu viens, tu pourrais bientôt rentrer""

Du disque dur au disque d'or gros
Biggy, dis-leur!

Mon pote j'préfère avoir les poches, que le cerveau troué
Si t'avais des couilles t'aurais pas besoin de le prouver
Hier soir encore un râteau, c'est pas la première fois
Parisienne enlève ton chapeau, y'a pas d'soleil chez toi
J'suis disque d'or. ""Quoi? T'es disque d'or?""
Ce soir j'ouvre le Champomy on fait la fête à Gryffondor
Y'a quelqu'un? Allo! Personne? C'est balo
J'crois que leur carrière dans l'rap est bien trop vite tombée à
Je reçois des leçons d'rap par des mecs
Qui parlent de mon flow de mes textes horribles
Mais j'oublie pas que ces pauvres gars
Il y a pas si longtemps, dansaient sur de la tecktonik
(On est pas dans la même catégorie)
Ils veulent imiter les techniques de l'équipe
(Tu le sais j'arrive comme un terroriste)
Mais j'ai mis des rimes, je mets pas des dynamites
Et la jeunesse s'endort elle a plus grand chose à dire ouais
Beaucoup de mes potes roulent des joints avec leur avenir
Et ils fument, et ils fument, toute la journée
Et elle dure, et elle dure, ma putain d'tournée
Et les types me disent ""Biggy t'as changé depuis que tu fais du chiffre
Du fric, du bizz, les filles te fliquent, t'idéalisent""
Elle s'imaginent que je vis sur une île au milieu de bikinis
De teens et de milfs et de milliers de biff'
C'est pas fini, ici c'est la frime qui prime, c'est triste
Les p'tits se vident l'esprit, ils tisent, ils dealent du shit
Pour dilapider leurs centimes dans leur style
Ensuite, il speedent, ils visent la vie de vizir et les limousines
Je sais c'est dur, mon ami, ils ont des certitudes, nous, un avis
Ils ont des grosses putes, nous, une famille
Ils ont des gros muscles, nous, du charisme
Scellez pas trop la victoire, un jour j'pourrais perdre
J'préfère des enfants à mes concerts, que des bourrés d'merde
J'ai un problème de croissance, je sais pas pourquoi
En ce moment, mon compte en banque grandit plus vite que moi, c'est saoulant
A quoi on sert, ils nous prennent pour des serpillières
Je garde les pieds sur terre, la tête dans l'interstellaire
J'ai écouté mon père, qui m'a dit: ""fils persévère""
Mon fric va à ma mère, pas dans une Mercedes
J'suis tellement maigre, on dirait que j'suis malade
J'suis naze avec les femmes, quand je les drague elles me baladent
J'ai une face dégueulasse, crois-moi c'est pas marrant
J'suis disque d'or, mais j'dors encore chez mes parents
J'ai une p'tite tête, pas d'biceps, de grosses caisses, ouais franchement c'est la honte
J'suis un squelette, une tapette, j'peux rien soulever à la fonte
J'suis une merde, à côté de ces mecs qui pèsent des tonnes
Heureusement que je rap comme personne

(J'crois que j'vais avoir des problèmes avec celui-là, Flo)
J'étais seul dans ma chambre, j'avais des rêves, qui m'allaient trop grand
J'le voyais dans les yeux des gens mais au fond, c’était pas méchant
Tu sais pourquoi j'prends mes distances?
Parce que j'suis fier d’être disque d'or à 19 mais j'rêvais d'l'avoir à 18 ans
On m'dit pense à autre chose, mais j'ai qu'ça dans la vie et j'taffe
Car y'a p't'être un futur MC meilleur que moi dans la ville
Tous me dégoûtent, après le rap, j'vais faire une grande pause
Aider les gens, donner du temps, et de l'argent pour tant de causes
En attendant je froisse et j'écrase tout être humain qui gratte
De la plus grande star mondiale, au vieux crevard d'un Open Mic
Les MC, vous êtes où? J'vous clash mais personne répond
Les bandits, vous êtes sourds? Tirez j'ai une cible sur le front
Moi j'arrête pas le combat, surmonter les obstacles, et les temps passés
C'est mon blase sur l'étendard, donc surtout ne pense pas que tu peux me remplacer
Tu vas signer un contrat, croire que c'est bon là et dans les bras de ta mère tu vas t'enlacer
Au final tu ne vends pas, tu perds tes contacts et toutes tes dettes vont s'entasser
J'entends déjà leurs voix amères: ""Tu critiques encore les rappeurs?""
Ouais, parce qu'ils racontent encore d'la merde
J'veux pas la même vie qu'ma mère ou mon père
Donc je me bouge pour qu'un jour mon fils dise le contraire
Et ils me regardent sur scène, ils veulent être tous potes
J'ai réalisé tout mes rêves, va falloir que j'en trouve d'autres
Faire un morceau sans Bigflo? Pas possible
Ma mère en a marre de m'entendre à la radio! Moi aussi
Je n'suis qu'un des sosies de Oli, aidez moi
Ils nous forcent à faire des folies, 17 dates en 1 mois
Lui il bronze sur une île en Floride, j'suis exploité c'est horrible
À moins qu'j'sois le vrai à faire tout ça, mais dans ce cas c'est historique
À l'époque on m'fermait les portes, j'rêvais du disque d'or, j'attendais que quelqu'un m'téléphone
On m'avait dit ""t'es mort"" pourtant l'album est dans les stores, maintenant le score les étonne
Le soutien était rare dans le milieu, on a fait notre bonhomme de chemin comme des fantômes
Mais le public était là et on a fait les bénévoles depuis le départ on lâche pas
Paraît que c't'année c'est la bonne
J'ai vu des MC perdre leur voix, ils paniquent, trop d'peur
J'me présente plus, mais les gens m'connaissent, j'ai l'impression d'être Harry Potter
J'emmerde leurs barrières
Quel MC de 19 ans sur Terre, peut prétendre fêter ses 10 ans de carrière?
Si tu veux m'stopper, accroche-toi, t'es prévenu
Le disque d'or c'est comme le bac, j'ai taffé 2 mois et j'l'ai eu
J'suis le meilleur rappeur français, ça fait chier que j'm'en rende compte
Comme une meuf hyper jolie qui l'sait et qui t'prend pour un con
Avoir du flow c'est simple, suffit de prendre le mic et d'articuler
Là j't'imagine devant ton miroir en train d'dire
""Comment il fait c't'enculé?""
Les salles sont complètes, le disque se vend bien
Flash-back quand ma prof m'avait dit: ""Tu seras jamais musicien""
Leurs remarques, leurs croches-pattes j'm'en rappelle
Et sur scène à chaque fin d'concert, j'pense à elles
Sans la musique j'suis pas bavard, en dehors d'la scène j'ai pas d'bravoure
Le rap j'suis arrivé par hasard, j'y suis resté par amour
J'te jure, y'a qu'des enflures, qui savent, pas c'qu'on endure
Donc j'ai serré la ceinture, en fixant la pendule
Le business, un tas de gamins vendus le froc, descendu
Depuis p'tit j'compte sur les doigts d'la main ceux qui un jour, m'l'ont tendue
Moi j'rappe pour ceux qui vont en cours, pas pour ceux qui les sèchent
J'écris pour ceux qui donnent de l'amour, pas pour les creux qui le prêchent
J'suis en studio pour ceux qui rêvent, ceux qui doutent, ceux qui souffrent
Au fond du gouffre, ceux qui s'taisent pas pour les ploucs qui s'l'ouvrent
On s'bouge, ceux qui ont les boules gloussent ils ont tous le blues à Toulouse

Bigflo,"Je suis
Enfermé, à l'étroit dans ma cellule
Tous les jours le même café mais c'est le temps qui est soluble
Ces bonnes actions que l'on regrette
Ces erreurs que l'on refait
Au parloir je parle autant à mon fils qu'à mon reflet

Je suis
Gelé, j'enchaîne les verres et les hivers
Pour se rassurer les passants doivent tous penser que l'on hiberne
Bercé par le son des pas et le bruit des pièces dans les poches
Entre ce type et mon chien, je me demande de qui j'suis le plus proche

Je suis
Riche, ils veulent me faire croire que c'est une honte
Comme si j'étais responsable de toute la misère du monde
Moi j'dois rien à personne, même si l'argent vient à manquer
Ils veulent tous goûter au fruit de l'arbre que j'ai planté

Je suis
Malade, mais j'préfère dire ""futur soigné""
Mes pupilles fixent l'aiguille de la montre qui brille sur mon poignet
A l'étroit dans mon corps, j'regarde le monde par le trou d'la serrure
Les gens diront que je n'ai fait qu'agrandir celui de la Sécu

Je suis
Croyant, on me reproche souvent de l'être
On me reproche ma barbe pourtant j'ai la même que Jean Jaurès
On me compare à des barbares auxquels je n'ai jamais cru
Les mosquées sont trop petites alors parfois je prie dans la rue

Je suis
Un peu perdu, mes p'tits poumons se remplissent d'air
Nouveau venu sur Terre
Mes premières larmes déclenchent celles de mon père
Une chance, auprès de ma famille je m'sens à ma place
Mais je n'oublie pas que j'aurais pu naître dans la chambre d'en face

Je suis
Seul, au fond d'un couloir, on demande pas mon avis
J'ai pris de l'âge donc voilà j'ai bien plus de rides que d'amis
J'aimerais partager mes erreurs, vous faire part de mes doutes
Parfois j'me parle à moi-même pour être sûr que quelqu'un m'écoute

Je suis
Épuisé, mais plus pour longtemps j'en suis sûr
Les sonneries de téléphone, la pression ont élargi mes blessures
J'me souviens pas d'la date de mon dernier fou rire
Je suis un homme bientôt je serai un souvenir

Je suis
Enfin là, cette terre n'est plus un mirage
Je suis, arrivé par bateau mais surtout par miracle
Une nouvelle vie m'attend ici, bien plus calme et plus stable
Ce matin j'ai écrit ""tout va bien"" au dos de la carte postale

Je suis
Fier, mais comment vous décrire tout ce que j'ressens
Quand je marche en ville, de moins en moins de gens me ressemblent
Dans l'ascenseur, je parle même plus la langue de ma voisine
A force de planter des arbres, y'aura plus d'places pour nos racines

Je suis
Fatigué, mal au dos et mal aux reins
Les rides sur mon visage me rappellent les montagnes de là où j'viens
On m'a menti, et c'est trop tard que je l'ai compris
On dit qu'ce pays n'est pas le mien alors qu'c'est moi qui l'ai construit

Je suis
Assis, et le destin a fait que j'me relèverai jamais
Dans cet océan j'ai l'impression d'avoir toujours ramé
Un casse-tête pour monter dans le bus
Aller au taff, passer leurs portes
Souvent les gens me regardent et me répondent que c'est pas de leur faute

Je suis
Heureux, jeune diplômé
Esprit bétonné, j'ai étonné
Ceux qui rêvaient de me voir abandonner
Ma famille est loin d'ici, j'espère que là-bas ils sont fiers
Je viens de gagner le combat qu'avait commencé ma mère

Je suis
Confiante, j'regarde ma classe un peu trop pleine pour moi
Et j'leur tiendrais la main jusqu'à ce que la réussite leur ouvre les bras
J'ai compris que parfois, les adultes sont paumés
Parce que les plus grandes leçons c'est eux qui me les ont données

Je suis
Énervé, dans mon quartier on s'ennuie loin de la ville
On écrit, on prie, on crie et j'ai des amis qui dealent
Mon grand frère est au chômage, mon pote se fait 5000 par mois
Au collège c'est le bordel, bientôt j'devrai faire un choix

Je suis
Loin, ce qu'il se passe chez moi n'intéresse pas grand monde
Pour les autres on vit un rêve mais pourtant souvent on tourne en rond
Tout est cher, avec le continent y'a comme une latence
La plage, les palmiers, mais moi j'suis pas en vacances

Je suis
Discrète, mon père m'a dit de ne pas faire de vague
Ma religion, un phare guidant mes pas depuis qu'j'ai mis les voiles
C'est drôle qu'il me surveille mais qu'il fasse tout pour
Me donner une leçon en m'empêchant d'aller en cours

Je suis
Inquiet, envers ma foi beaucoup de regards hautains
J'reçois des leçons par des types qui ne font rien pour leur prochain
L'humanité n'a pas plus d'coeur, j'vois le monde qui tourne et qui change
Et je suis triste de voir qu'il y a de moins en moins de gens le dimanche

Je suis
Amoureux, et je vois pas qui ça regarde
A part moi et celui avec qui j'partage mon lit le soir
Je l'aime, on slalome entre les insultes et les blagues
Dire qu'il y a peu de temps je n'avais pas le droit de lui offrir une bague

Je suis
Oublié, mes fins de mois se font sur le fil
C'est devenu rare d'aller au restau ou d'aller voir un film
Je suis qu'un chiffre, qu'un vote, qu'une statistique, un point de plus dans la foule
Moi j'suis juste né ici et j'ai l'impression que tout le monde s'en fout

Je suis
Un rendez-vous, un hasard, un match de foot, un mariage
Une manif', un anniv', une accolade, une bagarre
Une scène de crime, un jugement, un gosse qui rit, une erreur
Une montagne enneigée, je suis la pointe de la plume d'un auteur
Je suis les pleurs d'un départ, je suis la chaleur des bars
Je suis une saveur cinq étoiles ou bien le gras d'un kebab
Les flemmards, les couche-tard, les lève-tôt
Les râleurs, les regards dans l'métro
Un oncle raciste, un concert vide, la crise, la déprime qui ressert l'étau
Je suis l'excellence, l'élégance ou l’espérance d'une naissance
Ces campagnes dans l'silence, ces grandes villes immenses et denses
Je suis, un peu de moi et beaucoup des autres quand j'y pense

La journée, je m'ennuie donc, le soir, je m'enivre
Je raccourcis ma vie pour avoir l'impression de vivre
On rêve des USA, on veut le permis d'port d'arme
J'ai vu des larmes couler pour un portable
Insupportable, on ne t'aime pas si tu suis pas la norme
Pourquoi tu ne bois pas? ""Si tu ne bois pas, t'es pas un homme""
Faire semblant: voilà le nouveau credo
Je change mes neurones contre des bédos
Sur le ring, on veut tous être les kings
Hier, j'ai vu mon reflet déformé par le bling-bling
Rempli de clichés, on veut se cacher
Chercher un monde meilleur avec des cachets, ok
Jeunesse Dolce, Louis, Gucci
Jeunesse gâchée, habituée au gâchis
On fait pas gaffe alors nos copines sont en cloque
Les sourires jaunes, comme nos dents à cause de la clope
Dans les familles, frères et sœurs ne s'entendent plus
Plus d'histoire de cœur, que des histoires de cul
Nos parents se déchirent, avant, ils avaient l'air si sûrs d'eux
Donc on croit en l'amour qu'une semaine sur deux
Les filles sont des femmes, le prince est devenu fêlé
On veut tous être des stars comme on voit à la télé
Vivant dans le ciment, nos sentiments sont emmêlés
Plus d'enfance depuis longtemps, notre innocence est sous scellé
Une corde, un cou, un tabouret qui tombe
Une famille, des amis, des larmes, une tombe
C'est le raccourci de l'âme, des exclus, des cœurs brisés
C'est le corps qui lâche, émotion non maîtrisée
On se moque d'un faible pour se croire fort
Parce qu'il est pas comme nous, parce que, se moquer, c'est à la mode
Mais, un jour, la haine déborde, marre d'être la risée
Alors, on entend des coups de feu dans le lycée
On s'maquille, on s'déguise, on veut faire vieux
On veut faire comme les autres, on pourrait tellement faire mieux
C'est l'effet d'groupe, malheureusement
Ça commence par: ""T'es pas cap'"", ça finit par un enterrement

On cache nos pleures et l'odeur de la clope au déo
Dans les vapes, on étouffe nos peurs, on entasse nos mensonges et nos mégots
Faut être honnête, on parle plus à nos mères mais on partage tout sur internet

Tous déguisés, la débilité bat des records
La mode n'épargne personne, je te l'accorde

Même le marchand de sable ne trouve plus le sommeil
La jeunesse dorée étale son argent et bronze au soleil
On recherche tous l'ivresse, qu'importe le flacon
Roméo est sorti, Juliette fume sa clope au balcon
Seul, le soir, au départ, c'était boire juste des fois
Devant le miroir, tous des pantins à la gueule de bois
Je rentrerai pas à la maison, le sexe a mis l'amour en prison
Leurs jupes courtes en disent long
La princesse boit en haut de sa tour, elle se sent bien seule
Ici, les crapauds ne sont jamais devenus des princes
Les cœurs se ferment, les corps grincent ce modèle de minceur
Si je rêve qu'on m'pince l'avenir coincé dans l'ascenseur
La poudre pour canon s'écoule et refroidit l'ambiance
Avant la fin du match, beaucoup sont sur la touche, derrière la ligne blanche
Dur à assumer, à éviter car c'est trop tentant
La fumée, la vérité sort de la bouche des enfants
C'est plus drôle, on s'force même quand on rigole
On veut mourir jeune pour imiter nos idoles
Extase et extasie, esprit en cellule
Overdose d'une fille le père lui a du mal à avaler la pilule
Apologie du fric dans les clips bling-bling nous fait saliver
On perd le sens de notre langage dans la télé-réalité
Génération McDo, machos, chômage, on est tous rivaux
On vide les poches de nos jeans pour s'en acheter des nouveaux
Pas de mea culpa, nous, l'soir, on s'couche tard
On tire des taffes pour oublier qu'on en trouve pas

Bigflo,"Tous les coups, c'est pareil
Les jours, les semaines
S'écoule et s'enchaîne
Ça m'saoule mais quand même

T'as fait au plus vite, tu seras quand même en retard, c'est sûr
""Pelouse interdite"" : mais on va quand même marcher dessus
Vous avez pas les mêmes parents mais, bon, c'est quand même ta soeur
Ton pote a une calvitie mais il va quand même chez le coiffeur
Tu tiens pas l'alcool mais t'as quand même tisé
Tu crois pas en Dieu mais t'es quand même baptisé
Tu crois pas aux fantômes mais t'es quand même effrayé
Elle t'a mis un stop, t'as quand même essayé
Ton meilleur pote : toujours en retard, souvent un sacré connard
Mais, quand tu broies du noir, le soir, c'est quand même lui qui vient t'voir
C'est juste une égratinure, toi, tu fais quand même le mec mourrant
C'est censé être un secret, on est quand même tous au courant
À ton anniversaire: des cadeaux pourris par centaines
Un livre, un pull en laine: merci quand même
T'aimes pas ton taf, la flemme, c'est grave, les mêmes journées défilent
Mais tu te lèves quand même pour ton fils ou pour ta fille
La voisine te gave mais, toi, tu reste quand même poli
Tu détestes le rap, tu kiffes quand même Bigflo & Oli

Encore une journée de merde mais tu te lèves quand même
T'as pas kiffé le son, tu lèves ta main quand même
Tu sens pas trop le truc mais tu y vas quand même
Quand même, on le fait pour les gens qu'on aime

Tous les coups, c'est pareil
Les jours, les semaines
S'écoule et s'enchaîne
Ça m'saoule mais quand même

Tu rentreras jamais dans cette boite mais tu tentes quand même le coup
On est samedi mais je me suis levé quand même et j'pensais qu'il y avait cours
T'as beau jouer le grand sportif, t'as quand même des courbatures
On est beaucoup trop pour une Clio mais on prend quand même la voiture
Tu vas faire les courses et t'as pas pris la liste
T'as oublié un truc mais tu fermes la valise
Tu la détestes, tu feras quand même la bise
Toujours pas parti, tu diras quand même: ""J'arrive""
""- Ton rap, c'est trop du lourd, toi et ton frère, c'est trop la folie
- Merci
- Allez, à plus, Bigflo
- Non, moi, c'est Oli""
Tu flippes mais tu fais quand même le beau du haut du plongoir
Je dis: ""Bonjour"" mais ce type me répond quand même: ""Bonsoir""
T'as pleuré toute la nuit, t'es mal, tu dis quand même: ""Ça va""
On te demande une rue, tu connais pas, tu réponds quand même: ""Euh, là-bas""
Ça marche jamais, t'y crois pas mais tu fais quand même un vœu
Elle sort avec ce gars, t'es pas jaloux mais, bon, quand même un peu
On l'a écouté cent fois mais on dansera quand même sur l'tube
Y'a plein de chaines à la télé, je regarderai quand même la pub
On l'invite quand même, même si, comme d'hab', il va nous saouler
Au départ, ma feuille était blanche, je l'ai quand même écrit, ce couplet
Avec ma mère, c'est tendu, je lui apporte des tas de problèmes
Malgré ces malentendus, je sais qu'elle m'aime quand même

Encore une journée de merde mais tu te lèves quand même
T'as pas kiffé le son, tu lèves ta main quand même

Tous les coups, c'est pareil
Les jours, les semaines
S'écoule et s'enchaîne
Ça m'saoule mais quand même

C'est pas bon pour la santé, tu prends ta clope quand même
On avait dit ""pas d'invités"", t'amènes dix potes quand même
Cette meuf est pas très bonne mais tu la chopes quand même
On arrête pas d'te dire: ""T'es mince"" mais tu te crois grosse quand même
Quand même, demain, il y a le taf mais tu regardes le match quand même
Ton père fait toujours la même blague mais tu te marres quand même
T'adores l'album mais tu le télécharges quand même
Tu rappes quand même, tu tapes quand même, tu frappes quand même

Bigflo,"N'aie pas pitié des morts, Harry, aie pitié des vivants
Et par-dessus tout de tous ceux qui vivent sans amour

Autour de nous je sens que ça monte, c'est fou quand on part de rien
La mode c'est de faire du mal moi j'ai pas honte de faire le bien
Nos salles se remplissent, je vois que les leurs se vident
Les jolies filles oublient souvent qu'avec le temps les visages se rident
Pas prendre la grosse tête, un jour tout peut lâcher
J'ai vu des ex-superstars taffer au supermarché
Continue, ne lâche pas et un jour tu perceras
J'ai vu des caissiers qui méritaient d'être des superstars
Tu veux te moquer de ma tête et de mon corps dans ton texte
Frère, j'suis plus au collège, j'en ai fini des complexes
Et je sais qu'ça t'embête mais on s'en tape on s'entête
Avant c'était le Rap, envoyez la tempête, Biggie

Et quand je prends le mic, on me dit souvent ""qu'est-ce tu fous là?""
Tu dis qu't'es pas raciste tu différencies black et toubab
Tu trouves que j'suis pas cool ma poule je peux pas t'en vouloir
Car je suis le premier MC diplômé de l'école de Poudlard
Cette année les deux frères vont tout casser, les autres MCs sont dépassés
Leurs albums sont déclassés, ouais c'est chaud
Parait que je suis moche, dégueulasse et pas beau
Mais sache que j’échangerai jamais ta gueule contre mon flow
Bigflo, j'ai plus de flow qu'une jarre, j'ai plus de flow qu'une mare
J'ai plus de flow que ton flow, mais qu'est ce qu'il t'faut, connard?
J'broie du noir j'ai l'impression d'être Batman
Tu peux dire que t'aimes pas mon rap, tu peux pas dire que j'rappe mal
Et on part à l'attaque des bacs, on évite les balles
On débarque, on décale les macs, on éclate les barrages
A l'écart de ce rap, la dalle nous donne du courage à nos mic'
Tout le monde à terre, plus de flow qu'un putain de Canadair
Tu dis: ""ça sert à rien de rapper vite"" parce que tu sais pas le faire
On était rien on partira en légende
J'suis une souris qui envoie les éléphants, la trompe entre les jambes
A trente ans t'insultes mon petit frère j'essaie de pardonner
J'vais leur donner l'amour que leur mère ne leur a pas donné
Certains essaient de nous faire du mal mais bon dans le fond c'est pas terrible
Tu te moques parce que j'suis petit, mais il y a rien de plus dangereux qu'une bactérie
Tu penses qu'y a que Paname, c'est marrant, c'est pathétique
Avec ta weed tu planes mais c'est quand que t'atterris?
Tu veux qu'je fasse de la trap, que j'allonge toutes les fins de mes phrases, pour faire classe
Que je fasse des trucs avec mes doigts
Moi j'ai rien à prouver, tu peux me trouver, à faire des fournées, toute la journée
Ca me dégoute ils veulent des sous, que je fasse de la bouse comme ""Fous ta cagoule!""
Le seul truc que t'attends, c'est de me voir sauter
Mais si la balle est dans ton camp c'est que le flingue est de mon côté
On se croise en concert
Ils nous ont sous-estimés, comme un rhume qui se transforme en cancer
C'est ouf, ouais c'est dingue tout ce qui nous arrive
Toulouse, longtemps qu'personne représentait ma ville
Merci à vous les potos, bien sûr aussi à toutes les filles
On parle jamais assez de vous dans tous nos morceaux
Une chambre, un stylo et la passion de deux frères
Donc si on y arrive, toi aussi tu peux l'faire
Et le hip-hop, je l'ai saigné, au moins on va essayer
Et j'repense à tous les MCs qui nous ont précédés
Nous on va jamais céder et si tu veux nous aider
Au lieu d'acheter une pizza achète mon CD

10 points pour Gryffondor
Oli

Au royaume des aveugles, le roi est un aveugle
Qui dit aux autres aveugles qu'il voit
""Oli, t'y arriveras jamais"", on me l'a dit 500 fois
Par chance mon rappeur préféré a le même sang que moi
Apprenti face aux anciens, j'suis rien qu'un inculte
Dans c'monde où être gentil devient une insulte
Je garde mes proches et mes valeurs sous scellé
Un public en or qui supporte et force la porte sur l'CD
Depuis tout petit on écrit et on bouscule le destin
Et là où tout s'complique, c'est quand tout le monde dit ""reste simple""
Certains rêvent de nous voir fondre au premier rayon
Mais leurs bâtons dans les roues sont devenus nos crayons
Mon album est une essence, ils m'ont pas cru, c'était blessant
J'ai pris mes larmes j'ai pris mes doutes, j'ai pris l'temps d'en faire de l'essence
Putain j'te jure j'ai eu la rage, devant ces sales chiens
Quand j'rappe ce couplet j'crache du sang, et c'est pas l'mien
Pas capable de rapper vite, donc tu dis que ça sert à rien
Ils ont tous refusé l'feat, après l'album on verra bien
De toute façon si je pose avec quelqu'un c'est soit Bigflo soit Michael
A chaque ligne, j'imagine leur vieille mine, leur sale gueule
A leur âge ils insultent nos daronnes
""Le rap c'était mieux avant"", avant que je comprenne leurs paroles
Tu sens qu'c'est lourd et tu peux pas le nier d'un coup
Mon père m'a dit: ""t'inquiète si on t'déteste, c'est qu'on t'a aimé un jour""
Et j'rappe tous les jours
Mais c'est pas tous les jours que j'écris un couplet que j'pourrais rapper tous les jours
Je viens claquer toutes les joues
Et j'prends de la force à tous les coups
Et si j'disparais sous écrous, du MC taré souvenez-vous
Que l'homme est dangereux entre grandeur et folie
Et si on m'bute pour une phrase, #JeSuisOli
Ici, les sales cons font salle comble
Facile de parler d'la rue quand tu la regardes de ton balcon
Marre des MCs alcoolos, loin comme Apollo, j'gratte et j'rappais en solo
Eux s'battaient pour les sales polos Ralph, je tacle pas mollo
Gratte comme un intello qu'on baffait en colo
Revenant plus tard avec une batte que l'on va fanculo gars
Ils nous exploitent, il y pas de taff, juste un tas d'aigreur
Et qui est le plus pris pour un con? Le manche à balai ou le balayeur?
Je les entends tous pester
Sale époque, les uns contre les autres, venez on arrête de s'détester
J'écris avec le cœur et les tripes
Eux font des égotrips en chœur
J'attends qu'un as de cœur me pique
Depuis le départ, on évite les balles des types pas nets
Les pieds sur terre je vends mon album sur une autre planète
Oli",La Tempête,2015
Bigflo,"J'aurais pu être un grand artiste, un prix Nobel ou un bandit
Naître dans tes bras, voir dans tes rides à quel point j'ai grandi
Tes battements d'cœur me font imaginer ton sourire
Je vivrai dans ton monde main dans la main avec tes souvenirs
Laisse-moi t'appeler ""maman"", c'est pas souvent, c'est vrai
Je veux une place au soleil dans ton jardin secret
Pourquoi t'as pas voulu de moi? Tu dois avoir tes raisons
Y'avait sûrement pas assez d'place dans notre petite maison
Sèche tes larmes, j'suis qu'une graine qui n'a pas pris racine
J'me connais pas et, toi, maman, dis-moi comment tu m'imagines
J'étais trop pressé, c'était p't-être trop tôt
À mon souvenir, accroche sur l'mur un cadre sans photo
Décris-moi la vue de ta chambre, chante pour m'réconforter
Parfois, je ris en imaginant le nom que j'aurais porté
La mort, la vie: j'y connais rien, quand j'y pense, je m'y perds
J'le verrai jamais mais, s'te plaît, maman, fais-moi un petit frère
Retiens juste mon amour, profite, va faire un tour
Tu serais peut-être bien plus triste si j'avais vu l'jour
J'aurais p't-être claqué la porte et tout foutu en l'air
Gâcher nos vies en un éclair, d'ailleurs, où est mon père?
La mer, les fleurs, le soleil, les amis, les anniv' ratés
La tristesse, la peur: je ne connaîtrai jamais
Ça fait quoi d'respirer? Parle-moi, j'veux pas te voir en pleurs
Tu ne m'as pas gardé dans ton ventre, mais laisse-moi une place dans ton cœur

Maman, comment c'est, dehors?
L'amour fort que nous nous portons
Je suis ni vivant ni mort
Mais je sens encore le cordon
Mon enfant, tu sais que j't'adore
Et je te demande pardon
Je n'ai ni raison ni tort
Et je sens encore le cordon

D'abord, Maman t'aime, ça, faut qu'tu le saches
Je pense tous les jours à toi en m'regardant dans la glace
Tu me ressemblerais, j'entends ton rire dans mes rêves
Et je ressens un grand vide quand le matin se lève
Mais tu ressemblerais à ton père, ce lâche nous a abandonnés
Faut dire qu'à cette époque, on était tous un peu paumés
Et ça m'a fait d'la peine, son sang coulerait dans tes veines
Et, moi, je l'aimais comme je t'aime
Je suis jeune, j'ai toujours pas une thune
J'ai toujours pas fini mes études, et je suis seule
J'étais pas prête à t’accueillir, j'ai du mal à m'en sortir
Et depuis qu'il n'est plus là, c'est encore pire
Entre les cahiers et les couches, le loyer et les cours
J'me serais noyée dans mes journées, broyée par les coûts
J'ai dû faire un choix, sans toi, au bord de la falaise
J'ai préféré ne pas être mère qu'en être une mauvaise
Je nous vois dans un parc, la boue sur les chaussures les éclaboussures
à avoir peur du temps qui passe
Tu me tiens par la main, tu me parles avec les yeux
Je n'entends plus personne, je ne sens que nous deux
Et j'voulais pas que tu galères, que tu connaisses mes fins de mois
Et puis ton père serait sûrement souvent bien plus absent que toi
On se retrouvera à la prochaine
Je ne t'ai pas donné la vie pour pas tu n'aies pas à vivre la mienne

Maman, comment c'est, dehors?
L'amour fort que nous nous portons
Je suis ni vivant ni mort
Mais je sens encore le cordon
Mon enfant, tu sais que j't'adore
Et je te demande pardon
Je n'ai ni raison ni tort
Et je sens encore le cordon

Pire qu’une drogue à chaque fois ça finit trop mal
J'voudrais qu’il me l’avoue, qu’il m’le dise, c’est tout
Depuis qu’il ment comme il respire, j’m'étouffe!

Allo Docteur! J’me sens mal
J’ai peur! J’crois qu’mon pote est mythomane
Il déconne, j’le soupçonne depuis des mois
Je l'ai surpris entrain de répéter ses phrases avant de rentrer chez moi
Il commande une pizza mais dit que c’est lui qui cuisine
Pour faire croire qu’il est en couple
Il traîne en ville avec sa cousine « mais lâche-moi! »
C’est horrible, ça empire
Comment faire, fils unique il m’a dit « Sur la tête de mon frère! »
Ça devient gênant j’te jure j’ai peur de l’voir
Mais c’est mon pote alors j’fais semblant d'le croire
J’entends oui quand il dit non
J'connais toutes ses mimiques quand il parle
En live de Miami à la piscine municipale
Putain! Ça devient difficile j'perd la raison
Est-ce que c’est bien sa maison est-ce qu’il nous a dit son vrai prénom?
Je fais des tests, j’enquête, j’deviens parano
Quand il se tait, je sais qu’il en prépare un autre
Le pire, c’est que j’vais douter le jour où il va mourir
J’mélange le faux et la vérité dans tous mes souvenirs
Promis, juré, craché avec le sourire
Il m’fait même plus marcher, il m’fait courir!

Il a que des embrouilles, tu m’étonnes, tu m’étonnes
Vu que tous les jours, il mythone, il mythone
Quand on lui demande d'où sortent les infos qu’il nous donne c’est
 « trois w point mytho point com »
Il est fort comme un bœuf
Il fait qu'de grosses teufs
Il sort avec plein de meufs
Au moins vingt-neuf, « Au moins vingt-neuf? »
Aucun mytho n’est trop gros
Et quand on lui demande, il a perdu les photos!
Il a la classe d’un acteur, quand il joue
Il dit qu’il était dans le même club, que Zizou, « Ah ouais, j’le connais bien moi. »
Non mais attends, pourquoi tu mens
Ça fait dix ans que t’es remplaçant, sur le banc!
Il débite les conneries, toute la journée
Avec les potes, il nous pousse à bout
Faut qu’il évite, faut qu’il arrête, faut qu’on l’emmène voir un marabout!
Pas d'éthique, il empire, c’est pathétique
Il pourrait dire que sa mère est morte, pour un paquet de chips!
Parait qu’il est champion toutes catégories
Que c’est le troisième frère, de BigFlo & Oli!
Et quand j’y pense, le pire c’est quoi?
Lui qui mythone ou moi qui y croit?

Pour un pote, j'pourrais quitter la plus belle femme de la Terre
Lui laisser l'choix du nom d'mon futur gosse
Partir six mois, apprendre le Chinois en Écosse
J'pourrais, dire non le jour de mon mariage s'il m'demande
Quitter une femme aimante, et partir d'ici s'il m'emmène
On irait planter une tente dans une montagne au fond d'la France
Déclencher une avalanche mais rire quand même
Gagner au loto lui donner chaque centime
Lui faire un résumé s'il part pisser pendant l'film
Faire semblant de perdre pour lui faire plaisir
Lui dire qu'sa meuf est belle, pour lui faire plaisir
J'pourrais insulter un boxeur, draguer une bonne sœur
Pendant deux bonnes heures et m'faire claquer
Faire la vaisselle de bon cœur, vivre dans un bunker
T'es qu'un imposteur, là j't'ai cassé
Le suivre dans ses délires, lui porter ses valises
Promener son poisson rouge et partir surfer à Nice
J'm'y attache c'est pour pas qu'il m'lâche
J'le suivrai jusqu'au au bout du monde, mais faut pas qu'il l'sache

J'pourrais sortir le katana, pour un pote
Dormir avec des piranhas, pour un pote
Ouvrir un bar dans l'Sahara, pour un pote
Lui dire ça va si ça va pas, pour un pote
Prendre le premier avion pour Rio, pour un pote
Lui garder un rein dans le frigo, pour un pote

J'pourrais aller en prison même si j'ai rien fait
Aller face à mon patron pour lui dire ""T'es qu'un faible""
J'pourrais supporter n'importe quelle pression
Transporter un cadavre la nuit sans poser d'question
J'pourrais voler la sucette à un gosse
Prendre un coup d'crosse, enfiler un bikini et du gloss
J'pourrais chopper la gale, avoir la dalle
Passer le balais et me faire condamner
Lui prêter 10 000 balles et qu'il me les rende jamais
J'pourrais mettre tout le cou sous la guillotine
J'pourrais mettre un coup de boule à ma petite copine
Désolé chérie, je sais, j'fais des trucs bizarres
Mais dis-toi qu'j'lui laisserais même la dernière part de pizza
M'lever à quatre heure du mat' pour aller l'dépanner

Un genre de frère présent à chaque moment
Quand, parfois t'as la nausée, à deux doigts d'exploser
La seule chose sur laquelle tu pourras te reposer
Ouais mais j'ai mon lit pour ça
Non Brice tu comprends pas!
C'qu'on te dit, ton ami, c'est ton seul rempart
Et la famille? Et la famille c'est pour la vie
Mais y'a celle par défaut, et y'a celle que tu choisis
Mais ça m'rapporte quoi?
Rien, à part des rires et des galères
Donc pas de fric et de salaire ? Non, rien!
Et écoute bien, si tu te perds en chemin
Il donnerait tout c'qu'il a pas si t'en as vraiment besoin

Le seul qui pourrait surfer avec moi le jour d'un tsunami
Quand, parfois j'ai la nausée, que mon cœur pèse des tonnes

Bigflo,"Le numéro que vous avez demandé n'est pas attribué ou n'est pas accessible
Votre appel ne peut aboutir
Pfff, putain

Alors alors
Dis-moi qu't'es resté avec elle
Tu m'disais : ""C'est la bonne et bordel, qu'elle est belle""
On refaisait le monde, sur le canap' de l'appart
Maintenant j'voudrais savoir où tu te caches sur la carte
Alors alors
On s'est promis de pas s'lâcher, alors alors, et je crois bien qu'on s'est raté
T'as changé de numéro ou t'avais pas envie de me parler quand je t'ai appelé, hein?
Alors alors
Est-ce que t'as fini tes études? T'avais plein d'rêves, mais juste pas assez d'thune
J'ai une liste de tout c'que j'voudrais dire
Toi qui répondais présent quand on parlait d'avenir
Alors alors
On devait faire le tour de la Terre
Tu sais, moi, ma valise est encore prête
Et si jamais tu nous reviens, est-ce que j'vais te reconnaître?
Faut pas qu'on laisse mourir nos promesses (non)
Alors alors
T'es où? Tu mens
C'est fou! J'y pense
Chaque jour, j'te vois partout!
Ils disent que tu reviendras pas, que t'es malade, que t'es mort
J'aimerais que tu sois là, juste pour leur donner tort

Alors, dis moi qu'est ce qu'tu deviens?
C'est vrai, ça fait longtemps
Alors, dis moi qu'est ce qu'tu deviens?
C'est vrai, ça fait longtemps, qu'tu dis rien
J'ai cherché dans le quartier mais non, non
J'ai fait le tour de la Terre mais non, non
J'ai demandé à ta mère mais non, non
Pas d'nouvelles (pas d'nouvelles)
J'ai attendu tout l'été mais non, non
J'ai espéré tout l'hiver mais non, non
Mais comme dit le proverbe, (ah!)
Bonne nouvelle

Alors alors
T'es parti, chercher ton Eldorado?
Tout le monde t'adore-adore
On s'kiffait à mort, amore
T'es peut-être à Bora-Bora, en maillot ou en tongs
Si c'est une de tes blagues, celle là elle est trop longue
Alors Alors, comment c'est ailleurs?
J'attends un SMS ou un pigeon voyageur
Y'a encore nos tags sur le banc, lisibles et entiers
Faut qu'tu vois comme la ville a changée
Alors alors
Tu sais que je suis un peu râleur
T'as toujours eu du retard, t'étais jamais à l'heure-à l'heure
Allô allô? Y'a comme une latence
C'est plus que du retard là, c'est une absence
Alors alors
Des nouvelles? Même si elle sont mauvaises
J'ai fait tous les hôpitaux, appelé tous les hôtels
Si t'en as marre, dis le moi en face, cash!
Tu sais, j'ai passé l'âge de jouer à cache cache
Alors alors
Faut qu'tu sortes de ta planque
On suffoque dans la pente
On supporte plus l'attente
J'en ai marre, t'as tellement le dénouement
Est-ce que ça t'plait, de savoir que tu nous manques?

Alors, dis moi qu'est-ce tu deviens?
C'est vrai, ça fait longtemps
Alors, dis moi qu'est-ce tu deviens?
C'est vrai, ça fait longtemps, qu'tu dis rien
J'ai cherché dans le quartier mais non, non
J'ai fait le tour de la Terre mais non, non
J'ai demandé à ta mère mais non, non
Pas d'nouvelles (d'nouvelles)
J'ai attendu tout l'été mais non, non
J'ai espéré tout l'hiver mais non, non
Mais comme dit le proverbe (ah!)
Bonne nouvelle

Alors, alors, alors, alors
Alors, alors, alors, alors (tu nous manques frérot)
Alors, alors, alors, alors (Ouais, on a cherché partout!)
Alors, alors, alors, alors (ça fait longtemps)

Alors, dis moi qu'est ce qu'tu deviens?
C'est vrai, ça fait longtemps
Alors, dis moi qu'est ce qu'tu deviens?
C'est vrai, ça fait longtemps, qu'tu dis rien",Alors Alors,2017
Bigflo,"Premiers mots du deuxième album, faut pas que j'me rate
Faut qu'je, putain merde! Merde!

Premiers mots du deuxième album, la page est raturée
L'âme est saturée, j'ai carburé pour m'assurer de
Non, y a trop de gens qui comptent sur nous
(OK)

Premiers mots du deuxième album, toujours avec mon frère
On était venu en paix, et on revient en guerre
On a touché le ciel, cette fois on touche le soleil
On a ouvert nos cœurs, donc ouvre grand tes oreilles
J'ai croisé des démons, avec leurs belles toisons
Ils voulaient prendre mon talent, le transformer en poison
J'ai dit ""non"", alors ils ont reculé
Puis j'ai rappé un texte et la lumière, les a brûlés
L'amour que j'ai pour mon frère est toujours vainqueur
Même la mort ne pourrait le stopper
Car s'il meurt, je l'aurai toujours dans mon cœur
Et il me tardera de partir pour le rejoindre, de l'autre côté
Dans ce milieu j'ai été très déçu, j'te l'dis tout d'suite
Comme la fois où Orelsan nous a refusé l'feat
Pourtant il sait combien on l'aime
Allez, sans rancune, mais un peu quand même
Alors j'ai écrit, jusqu'à en être mort le soir
Pour que mon rappeur préféré un jour s'en morde les doigts
J'ai, enfilé ma blouse pour me protéger d'la bouse
Au fait, j'représente toujours Toulouse
Le rap français est choqué, il pensait pas nous trouver là
On m'écoute en Suisse, en Belgique, à la Réunion, à Nouméa
J'fais le plus bel art, j'rentre dans le nexus
J'tire dans le plexus, j'suis l'nec plus ultra
J'investis à long termes
J'arrache le cœur des adversaires pour les donner comme offrande à mon frère
On s'en cogne des commentaires
J'te jure que par rapport à celui-là, notre premier album c'est d'la merde
Du rap, j'en ai bouffé, j'te jure j'ai tout fait
Quand les chiffres sont sortis j'ai cru qu'ces fils de putes allaient s'étouffer
Non je sais j'vous taquine
J'vois l'reflet de la fierté d'mes proches dans mon disque de platine
Donc, lève ton V en l'air, si t'es visionnaire
Le jour où on sera milliardaire, vous serez tous millionnaires
Toujours là pour nous aider
Génération j'achète l'album mais j'ai même pas de quoi écouter l'CD
Mais y'a encore de l'espoir, c'est ça qu'ils veulent prouver
Mes fans, c'est ma famille, c'est ma force j'veux les couver
Ils nous ont soutenu, quand on était au plus bas
Pourtant je sais qu'un jour, ils seront plus là
Eh oui bandit, les p'tits ont grandi
Maintenant on a d'la barbe on est plus si gentils
On va durer, peu importe les barrières
On a acheté des pelles, pour enterrer vos carrières
Eh les mecs, arrêtez d'vous battre et d'comparer vos muscles
Arrêtez un peu d'être fiers d'être qu'une bande d'incultes
Et les filles, vous êtes pas qu'une paire de seins et un cul
Arrêtez de danser sur des musiques qui vous insultent, et
C'est inévitable
Comment je te kick ça
C'est inimitable
C'est du véritable son, oui, oui, il m'est vital
Jusqu'à la victoire
Ce n'est pas qu'une passion, non
Comme un match amical, soutien médical;
J'suis en méditation
Je navigue dans la nuit, je débite, je dévie; pas d'invitation
Dans ma case j'encaisse et j'entasse des tout petits bouts d'rimes
Pas en face, j'déteste, j'efface toutes leurs filouteries
Toujours pas de chaîne en or autour du cou, pourtant j'pourrais acheter la bijouterie
Petit tu t'écartes, avec tes gars tu vas à l'écart
Ne joue pas au poker avec moi dans ma manche j'ai toutes les cartes
Faut qu'tu t'écales, regarde :
Sous tes pieds j'ai mis du C4
On s'croise un de ces quatre t'es pas cap' de kicker comme je kick ouais t'es insacquable
Bigflo et Oli toujours insécable, pas comme le KitKat
On débite, on évade, on fait le spectacle
On prend du biff, tu prends des baffes; appelle un psychiatre
Mais dire mon flow mes rimes sont trop crédibles, toujours impeccables
C'est pour cette mère qui galère avec son crédit
Pour ce petit qui ne veut pas de l'avenir qu'on lui prédit
Pour ceux qui ont perdu leur taf, qui se sentent écartés
Pour les enfants dans les hôpitaux, qui rêvent de s'échapper
Cet album c'est pour ces ""au-revoir"", ces ""je t'aime"" qu'on a pas dit
Pour toutes les fois où on a pas pu remplir le caddie
Pour nos amis, nos familles, nos amours et nos morts
Mais surtout pour ceux qui y croient encore
Bientôt j'arrête, bientôt j'reviens au pays
J'en ai marre de les voir se vanter, médire
Bientôt je les enlève, bientôt j'retire le treillis
Bientôt j'retourne à la vraie vie

La vraie vie hein?

J'me revois au fond de la salle, la basse qui déforme le torse
Le crépitement des flashs, la foule qui ressent l'effort
On y a mis les tripes, on est presque devenu tarés
J'entends la voix d'mon frère qui m'dit : ""Défonce tout si un jour j'arrête""
Des milliers d'têtes, des salles complètes de Marseille à Verdun
Dans ce tourbillon j'ai pas eu l'temps de pleurer la mort de certains!
Quand je m'amuse, j'culpabilise
Un fou me gueule dans ma tête il m'dit qu'le disque ne se fera pas tout seul
Putain de système scolaire, j'gobe plus leurs histoires
Ils m'ont tellement traité de faible que j'ai failli y croire
Tu t'rends compte ? Moi, le petit joufflu de l'école de la rue du Taur
J'devenais le plus jeune rappeur d'Europe à être disque d'or
Peur de devenir un connard, de faire partie de ces pitres
Tu sais ces stars qui se plaignent pour des photos et nous voient comme des chiffres
J'ai refusé des chèque parce que j'avais la flemme
Dans mes textes, je disais : ""Aime ta mère"" et j'faisais pleurer la mienne
Mais quel con j'étais quand j'y pense
J'pensais qu'à mes belles baskets, j'voulais faire partie de la deuxième France
Pas les sous pour une canette, j'en étais presque fou
Et je m'imaginais que les riches étaient bien plus heureux que nous
J'm'étais trompé, j'ai fait le tour de la France et de la question
J'ai vu des p'tits plein d'rêves et des gamines en manque d'affection
Faut que j'pète le score ouais faire de la thune c'est tentant
J'sais pas si j'aurai un tube, j'arrive pas à faire semblant
Mes proches essaient d'me préparer au pire
Bienveillants ils m'disent : ""Le rap ça dure pas toute une vie, une carrière c'est rapide""
Quand ils sont en studio, ils ont le regard vide
Ils savent tous que si ça marche pas, moi j'me suicide!
Je veux rire à m'en déchirer les abdos
Brûler nos complexes et nos vielles pulsions d'ados
J'te compte masquer nos peurs derrière des insultes sans mentir
Assumer ses pleurs, parait qu'c'est ça grandir
T'imagines la gueule de ma mère si l'album flop?
Imagine le silence et la honte devant tous mes potes
Imagine moi sans l'rap avec mon crâne, mes bras ballants
Imagine si j'vous avais pas, hein? Si j'avais pas d'talent
À 3 ans des tuyaux dans l'nez j'ai dit non au cimetière
La faucheuse m'a dit : ""J'te laisse une chance si tu casses tout avec ton frère""
J'ai signé l'contrat, avant de partir en roue libre
Mais je stress, je sais qu'elle m'attend en coulisse
Mon cher hip-hop, t'es décevant
Ils sortent un album tous les six mois, je sors un classique tous les deux ans
Et j'ai une équipe en or, hardcore
Si tu m'enlèves mon cœur, moi j'respire encore
J'évacue mes fractures et chacune de mes ratures
Mature faut que j'assure, quand mes lacunes saturent
J'vise la lune et j'évacue mes peurs
L'écriture de ma plume comme armure
J'rappe avec le cœur, j'fais pas ça pour m'acheter une voiture
J'ai croisé ceux dans la galère qui m'auraient tout donné
Dîné avec des millionnaires qui m'ont même pas payé l'café
Que mon frère et que la chance m'accompagne
J'vous ferai signe, si on arrive en haut de la montagne
De l'autre côté du miroir, j'voulais devenir quelqu'un
On a cru en notre histoire, on a forcé l'destin
J'ai failli m'perdre dans l'superficiel et l'paraître
Et j'ai pris l'temps d'écouter, d'regarder par la fenêtre
Cet album c'est pour le petit, qui s'ennuie en bas des tours
C'est pour ces vieux en manque d'amour, qui comptent les jours
Pour les passionnés, les p'tits rappeurs de ma ville
Pour mon meilleur pote qui a peur, qui sait pas quoi faire de sa vie
C'est pour les pas sur du tout, bouffés par le doute
Pour les timides, qui font demi-tour avant un rendez-vous
C'est pour les pas musclés, les complexés qui vivent quand même
Ceux qui ont jamais pris l'avion mais veulent la villa sur la mer
J'te promets pas les grands discours qu'on aime entendre
Moi j'ai pas d'mensonges ou de rêves à te vendre
Pas d'retouches, pas de paillettes pour être précis
Moi, j'te rappe juste, la vraie vie",La Vraie vie,2017
Bigflo,"Bigflo et Oli, Busta Rhymes
J'vous préviens, ça va aller vite

On s'en bat les couilles des études tant qu'on est sur Insta
On peut faire de la pub pour des produits sympas
Se faire de la thune avec les doigts et les pieds en éventail
Donc pour dix milles balles, donne un peu de toi
Mais descends ta photo le haut ne m’intéresse pas
Recadre, regarde, ouais voilà comme ça
On s'en fout de ton visage, montrez nous un peu de string
Vous avez compris les filles vous êtes des produits marketing
Et vous les gars faut être costauds, bien habillés faut être gosse-beau
Et si il parle sur ta sœur, sur ta mère
Sur ta femme, faut qu't'envoies ce type à l'hosto
Et si tu veux te taper plein d'filles, faut pousser la fonte
T'es encore puceau à treize piges? Poto c'est la honte!
Faut que t'aimes les ballons, les flingues et les blondes
Les balles et les canons et les, stop!

Ça va trop vite
Ça va trop vite
Ça va trop vite
Les filles, le fric, les flics, ouais ça va trop vite (trop vite)
Ça va trop vite
Ça va trop vite
Ça va trop vite
Donc ralentis, respire, respire
Ralentis, respire, respire
J'ai dit ralentis, respire, respire
Ralentis, respire
Si t'as du mal à suivre, t'es bienvenu dans l'équipe

Pour les p'tits imberbes c'est le cirque Pinder
Qu'on joue depuis un vers et je suis sincère
On crée une génération de petits cons détestables
À peine sept ans ça veut déjà conduire le Vespa
Perdus sur le net ils ont déjà maté du porno
Et le pire c'est qu'ils sont même pas choqué avec leurs potos
Car y a du cul à la télé à la radio dans les journaux
Génération si t'as pas de boules t'as pas de boulot
C'est la merde dès l'plus jeune âge
Ils n'écoutent pas les sages
Et les parents sont contents, ils ne voient pas la pagaille
Ils s'occupent pas de leurs enfants, ils ont beaucoup de travail
Et les défilés filent s'imaginent à Philadelphie
Pour enfiler des filles fines comme des fines fouines
Le profil en wifi quand l'école est finie
Rêvent de la belle villa dans les Fidji comme dans les films
J'ai rien compris

Ça va trop vite
Ça va trop vite
Ça va trop vite
Les filles, le fric, les flics, ouais ça va trop vite (trop vite)
Ça va trop vite
Ça va trop vite
Ça va trop vite
Donc ralentis, respire, respire
Ralentis, respire, respire
J'ai dit ralentis, respire, respire
Ralentis, respire, Oli, t'es prêt? Allez!

Des politiques à la télé qui débattent, des vidéos débats
Des coups de poings, des battes et des patates
Dans la tête, des bavures et des balles qui se perdent dans le bâtiment
C'est devenu banal et des petits qui cannent pour que t'arrêtes
Y a ce type de mots du balcon pendant la bagarre
Pour une histoire de paquets de came et de femmes
Tout le monde pète un câble, on peut te braquer te claquer
Dans une cave et demander de vider le sac pour quelques dollars
Tout le monde veut la baraque et la belle bagnole
Taper des barres aux Baléares avec sa bande de potes
Et dans cette époque t'as pas de milliers de billets
T'es pauvre les poches pliées t'es humilié faut remonter la côte
Quitte à taper les plus petits ou bien braquer la poste casser la porte
Si y a des morts ce n'est pas de ta faute
Et peu importe, t'es prêt à tout pour embarquer la cagnotte non non stop!

Ça va trop vite
Ça va trop vite
Ça va trop vite
Les filles, le fric, les flics, ouais ça va trop vite (trop vite)
Ça va trop vite
Ça va trop vite
Ça va trop vite
Donc ralentis, respire, respire
Ralentis, respire, respire
J'ai dit ralentis, respire, respire

Yo, nobody listen ‘cause ya know we didn’t wanna follow nobody
Don’t wanna discipline because of who is givin’ in
When they really busy giving themselves to telephones
It's the kinda day we livin' in
But I know the kinda wolrd that we fightin'
The kinda fire we lightin' and let me show you what you shoulda do
Show you how to focus and show you the truth about yourself
When you be on the phone, is the phone really using you?
Everybody wanna possess
Citizens they wanna post money and they wanna post
Even the footage of somebody who’s gettin' ready to die
You mothafuckas be doin' the most so you can brag and boast
So try to catch the ghost inside your camera phones and banana homes
I got the answer though, and the antidote
And this time I go to war, hope you planned to go
They say, “I’m glad you’re back!” I tell ‘em “cut the check
Now where your values at, and where your self-respect?”
I got a plan for that, but yo we get up and rap
And we are, we’re givin’ the truth you better watch your step, you better
You better know where you’re going, you better know when to leave
You better know how you’re going in every moment you breathe
You better prove what they’re showin'
Because we never fuck around you know we keepin' it growin' (you gotta)
And I hope you’ve been listenin'
Keep quiet ‘till you hear the birds whistlin’
Wherever you point because the way the common man think
In a common state of mind is a-cripplin'
And I’m here to re-position the conditionin'
Because it’s had a rippling effect and it’s sickenin'
God bless, get it right, everybody
And I hope you appreciate this kinda truth that you’re witnessin'
And envisionin'

Les gars, c'est bon
J'ai retrouvé la vidéo, y a même pas écrit ""Bigflo & Oli, Wawad"" d'accord
Le titre de la vidéo, c'est ""SL740021""
Oui, voilà, non en bas, oui celle-là, celle-là, 84 vues
Écoute Flo, écoute Flo frère
OK
Oh non
Lavé, le rap est cave des cas il fallait
Un peu, merde j'me suis chié, pull up, pull up
Wouah, vidéo malaise, heureusement qu'y a pas de titre",Ça va trop Vite,2017
Bigflo,"Yeah yeah
OK
Seul dans mon lit j'regarde la fissure sur mon plafond
Elle s'étire pour devenir un point d'interrogation
J'fixe la peinture défraîchie
Impossible de dormir j'commence à réfléchir
J'pense à mes amis qui désertent notre ville
Monter à Paris parce que c'est là-bas l'avenir
Par téléphone on s'écrit mais c'est plus la même histoire
J'regrette nos samedis soirs
C'est la vraie vie, la pure réalité
Les copines, les études estompent les amitiés
J'marche seul sur un sentier abrupt
J'suis une armure vide, c'est donc ça la vie d'adulte
C'est dur c'que le temps passe vite
Y'a ceux qui fument pour le ralentir
J'pleure mais j'suis pas si triste
J'suis un boxeur mais j'suis pacifiste
On veut un futur bien à huiler, une voiture stylée
Prêt à tout pour l'obtenir même à dealer
On est un bon ton plein de rêves qui poussent mais très peu d'entre nous traverserons le filet
J'repense à mes colères qu'il faudrait que je gère
Le feu et l'éclair, je veux un peu d'air
J'veux taire les problèmes aux fonds d'mes poches
Pourtant mes colères font du mal à mes proches
J'respire, j'repense à cette fille qui m'a dit
""Hé l'artiste t'as la belle vie espèce de pauv' type""
En la regardant, j'ai vu qu'elle était ivre
En fouillant dans ses yeux, j'ai su qu'elle était triste
Et j'y repense toutes les nuits
Plusieurs musiques mais on danse qu'une seule vie
Et c'est souvent dans le plus grand des silences
Que tout est dit
Au max de moi même, lève les bras, bouge la tête et je t'emmène
On ira pagayer dans la tempête
Ceux qui parlent, ceux qui se plaignent, on les emmerde
Quand j'kick c'est comme si j'racontais des trucs sales devant le psy
Mon p'tit , sache que j'anticipe ce qui s'cache, sois attentif
Prend le temps de vivre une vie sage
T'as compris ""ohlala! Il parle encore de rap celui-là!""
Si c'est des buildings j'arriverais comme Godzilla
J'fous le fire et tu seras pas de taille, mec
Quand Biggie, Biggie, Biggie fait les Mics Checks
J'pense à ceux qui dorment par terre
Le matin qui s'lève sans confiture sur les tartines
Et les filles, qui entre deux verres
Perdent leur innocence dans le coin d'un parking
L'amour, t'es où? Tu nous manques ici bas
Fais-le, pour nous, pour les gens qui se battent
On laissera pas la haine dominer
Ces menteurs veulent nous embobiner
Ils veulent nous faire avaler des couleuvres
Leur oeuvre, c'est d'amplifier nos douleurs
Ils veulent qu'on s'oppose
Névrose,qu'on explose
Moi je viens de la ville rose
Obligé d'aimer les couleurs
On est jamais contents de c'qu'on a
Crois moi, à peine arrivés à un endroit qu'on pense à déménager
Et les sages le savent
Quand les poissons rêvent de voler, les oiseaux rêvent de nager
Toujours dans mon lit, en tee-shirt et caleçon
J'regarde toujours la fissure sur mon plafond
Dans le noir j'me détends, j'essaye encore
Lundi soir, 5h30, Faudrait que j'm'endorme

Faudrait que j'm'endorme, faudrait que j'm'endorme
Y'a l'aiguille qui tourne
Faudrait que j'm'endorme
J'ai tout essayé, j'ai tout essayé, j'ai tout essayé
Faudrait que j'm'endorme
Oli
Faudrait, faudrait

Ils doivent tous dormir, insomnie j'ai l'habitude
Sud-Ouest, ma latitude
Et c'est dans l'écriture, que mes phrases prennent de l'amplitude
Ma mère est fière mais rêve que j'fasse de grandes études
Mais j'serai jamais médecin on est d'accord
Il me reste quoi de l'école? Des blagues et la table de Pythagore
J'ai beau être sur les ondes, plaquer des accords
Je sauverai jamais le monde avec des métaphores
C'est dingue, faut que je dorme mais j'me questionne
Peur d'être dans la norme, j'voulais être un grand homme
Le rap sens pèse des tonnes, des fois j'vois leurs fantômes
J'fixe mon téléphone, j'attends l'appel de personne
Tu sais, moi j'attends mon heure
Et j'ai mis mon cœur sur répondeur
Tu trouveras derrière les lignes de mes phrases
Sinon laisse un message
J'regarde ma vieille peluche pleine de poussière
Sur la table, au milieu d'mes affaires
Et j'la compare à ma peur car j'm'y suis habitué
Mais ça fait longtemps que j'aurais dû m'en défaire
Si j'm'en sépare, j'ferai bien l'deuil
Elle est là, entouré de plein d'feuilles
J'la regarde et je me sens un brin seul
L'impression qu'elle me fait un clin d’œil
Je revois le visage de ce type que j'ai croisé dans la gare
Il avait mon âge, ça fait mal quand j'y pense
Il a dit ""j'm'endors dehors tous les soirs""
Sous la couette, j'ai honte d'avoir répondu ""Bonne chance""
Cette ville, un film d'action
Effractions, agressions, on entend ça d'puis minots
Ma voisine a la même vie qu'Al Pacino
Elle prend des pilules et perd son fric au casino
Tous ces choix qui nous séparent, Il faut se battre quand on s'égare
Ce putain de poids devant le miroir, J'me revois seul à l'écart
J'gratte quand il est tard, je pense qu'au rap depuis le départ
Moi j'ai la poisse, si j'touche du bois c'est pour ramasser les échardes
Une sirène d'ambulance s'est glissée sous ma fenêtre
La main sur le cœur, j'ai trop peur qu'il s'arrête
Enfant du divorce, à force on se dit que l'amour c'est comme le loto
Ça n'arrive qu'aux autres
5h du mat et les secondes resserrent l'étau
Encore une fois j'm'étais promis d'me coucher tôt
Et j'ai des flashs de mon zénith
Ils n'y voient que du feu, j'aperçois le phénix
Au fait poto là-haut c'est comment?
Paraît que dans ce biz, la cocaïne prend les commandes
Paraît qu'tu flippes, paraît qu't'es triste, affolant
Que tu regrette ce que t'as dit, pas étonnant
Une villa sur la mer, pour ma mère
C'est pas la mer à boire, j'veux plus voir ses cernes dans la brume
J'écris tard le soir, dans mon laboratoire
J'veux finir ma vie au soleil, j'demande pas la lune
Vingt ans, j'ai pas vu le temps passer
Y'a ces regrets que j'peux pas remplacer
À chaque fois les souvenirs s'entassent
Le coussin dans les bras, j'm'imagine l'enlacer
Oli, solide, l'autiste, fier
L'ovni, du cro-mi, solitaire
Il est tard je sais, les gens vont bientôt au taf
Mais j'reste là dans les bras d'Morphée
Alors j'respire, j'temporise
J'm'imagine dans les cieux
J'fais comme un perfectionniste face à la Tour de Pise
J'ferme les yeux

Faudrait que j'm'endorme
Faudrait que j'm'endorme
J'attends l'marchand d'sommeil

Bigflo et Oli tu connais, non?

Toujours avec mon frère!",Dans mon Lit,2017
Bigflo,"Yeah
C'est toujours l'philosophe
Hah, Big

Pour commencer, j'm'appelle Olivio, mais tout l'monde m'appelle Oli
T'as vu c'est simple comme nom d'artiste, sans artifices, pas d'folies
J’hésitais avec un truc plus cool mais j'me suis recentré
Le type qu'tu vois sur scène c'est l'même en vrai
J'suis né à Villeneuve-sur-Lot, je sais qu'ça fait pas star
Là où peu de gens ont mis les pieds, le genre de bled pas sur la carte
Le deuxième, une p'tite famille entre Argentine et Algérie
Ma mère me dit que j'suis né sur un éclat de rire
Calme, un peu rond, pourtant le fils d'un mince fêtard
Déjà une grosse tête, p't'être pour ça que je l'ai pas prise plus tard
De retour à l’hôpital, mes poumons sont atteints
Depuis ce jour, j'prend un grand bol d'air chaque matin
Flashs d'engueulades, maman l’allumette, papa l'essence
Derrière la porte, j'entends qu'il a failli s'barrer à ma naissance
Mais envers nous leur amour se porte garant
Et on a eu la chance de grandir avec nos deux parents
Mon grand p'tit frère, comme je l'appelle, m'écarte de l'ennui
Depuis ma naissance j'ai pas le souvenir d'une putain de seconde sans lui
Famille moyenne, on voulait rajouter des zéros
Sacrifice pour une maison tranquille dans l'quartier de Nougaro
La honte quand mes voisins nous filaient leurs vêtements trop p'tits
Depuis j'ai promis à ma mère de rembourser le crédit
J'traînais avec Pierrette, grand-mère d'adoption me donnant des ailes
J'revois cette ambulance devant chez elle
Avec l'écriture on adorait s'évader, comme des jumeaux toujours ensemble
L'histoire de deux frères qui écrivent dans leurs chambres
Pas d'alcool, pas de drogue, une promesse sur une poignée d'main
Le vin on l'connaissait déjà trop bien
J'voulais m'exprimer, quitter la routine et ses barrages
Le destin m'emmènera à trouver une vieille trompette dans l'garage
Au fond d'la classe fallait que je m'évade mec
En cours de math la tête ailleurs, le prof remarque que j'pense déjà qu'à faire des mics checks
En survêt', loin d'la chemise obligatoire
Toutes ces heures dans les couloirs du conservatoire
Refoulé des boites, j'côtoie l’intolérance
Dans les manifs avec Yanis à défendre notre France
Wawad, Wawad au beat box, impro de légende, tous dans sa voiture
Je vis du hip-hop, et j'ai dix-sept ans, le jour de ma signature
Voilà l'parcours j'gratte chaque jour, je lâche ma foudre dans tes oreilles
J'embrasse la foule, capte ma fougue, j'rap l'amour, j'ai pas sommeil, donc
J'écris la nuit, j'étudie la journée
J'ai mon bac et puis s'enchaîne la tournée
Notre mère, une lumière dans la brume
J'ai vu cette guerrière chasser son cancer comme si c'était un rhume
Tout va vite et pour le public, j'veux être exemplaire
Et dans mes rêves, j'ai des flashs de mon grand-père qui fait la guerre
J'te parle du fond de mon cœur, vrai, un peu blessé
Et j'te souhaite que du bonheur, comme si on s'connaissait
J'suis maladroit, le p'tit gars bizarre qui s'invente son monde
Et aime vous l'raconter
Avant, l'amour j'y croyais pas, trop timide pour ça
Jusqu'au jour où je l'ai rencontré
Quelques crasses sur ma route, ouais, bien sûr je doute, mais
J'ai de l'amour dans ma gourde et dans l'sac deux-trois couplets
Insatisfait, tête en l'air, retardataire
J'vise la Lune mais quand j'y serais j'viserais la Terre

Ouais, j'viserais la Terre
Oli, le philosophe

Pour finir je m'appelle Olivio, mais tout l'monde m'appelle Oli
T'as vu c'est simple comme nom d'artiste, sans artifices, pas d'folies
J’hésitais avec un truc plus cool mais j'me suis recentré
Le type qu'tu vois sur scène c'est l'même en vrai, c'est l'même en vrai

Yeah, Samedi 8 Avril, on finit les voix à Toulouse
L'album sort bientôt, j'ai peur mais je rappe
La vraie vie
Celle qu'ils oublient parfois
Pas nous
Vas-y Flo mets-toi au piano
Olivio

Avec tout, tout ce qu'il y a autour de vous, vous arrivez à garder les pieds sur Terre
Ça c'est normal
J'sais pas, t'sais qu'il y en a peut-être plein qui auraient crachés sur tout l'monde
Oh pis t'as pas un truc plus gai? Fais-moi écouter un autre truc chéri, allez
Plus gai euh, nan mais pas maintenant
On laisse ça dans l'album?",Olivio,2017
Bigflo,"¡Vamos hijos
Empezamos ahora!

Yeah Bigflo, Oli
Tu connais non?
Tiens

Désolé maman, ce texte sera pas pour toi
Je suis discret en vrai mais en musique il faut que je parle
Sa voix vibrait dans mon oreille quand j'étais dans ses bras
Les chansons à la guitare, les bisous avec la barbe
Il parle de l'époque du lycée avec mélancolie
Je m'endormais sur le canapé, je me réveillais dans mon lit
Il m'a laissé veiller devant les films que j'aimais bien
Il m'engueule jamais, le pire c'est quand il dit rien
On fait des matchs et je prie pour que ça dure
Il prend de l'âge, je l'ai lu dans ses courbatures
Les jambes tremblent quand on se fâche par moments
Plus ensemble, mais il me demande toujours pour maman
Il m'a transmis son charme et sa poésie
Mais j'ai aussi hérité de sa calvitie
C'est mon idole, avec lui rien est impossible
C'est un peu mon avocat, mon cuistot, mon taxi
Ses histoires et ses blagues quand il picole
Ses vieux pulls et ses chemises à auréoles
Maintenant c'est bon, et bêtement on en rigole
Mais j'étais con et j'avais honte devant l'école
L'odeur du café le matin, la voiture, les souvenirs
Les au revoirs, les câlins, ses blessures, ses soupirs
Ça sera toujours mon père et je reste son gamin
Et quand j'en aurais un je lui parlerais du mien

Celle-là c'est pour nos pères, nos padre
Ceux qui disent ""je t'aime"" sans même parler
Pour ceux qu'on regrette, ceux qui sont pas passés
Mais si t'es papa, tu sais que t'es pas parfait
Celle-là c'est pour nos pères, nos padre
Ceux qui disent ""je t'aime"" sans même parler
Pour ceux qu'on regrette, ceux qui sont pas passés
Mais si t'es papa, tu sais que t'es pas parfait

Y ya sé que soy viejo
Nunca te olvidaré
Cuando miro el espejo
Son mis hijos que veo
Me acuerdo del mío
Y cuando se fue
Aprendí que la vida
No vale más que el Papá, papá
Papá, papá
Papa, papa
Papa, papa

Derrière moi depuis mes tout premiers pas
Tous mes amis le trouvent vraiment très sympa
Ils les invitent à partager les repas
Mon père c'est le meilleur mais ça se compare pas
Il est ridé, la jeunesse l'a quitté
Comme tous les pères il a l'air déprimé
Pensif dans le salon, je le vois à chaque fois
Je crois qu'il regrette l'époque où il était pas papa
Mon père c'est mon boss, mon roi, mon héros
Moi, je suis son gosse, son minot, su hijo
Quoi? Il tourne tous mes problèmes en dérision
Je suis une des raisons pour lesquelles il peut finir en prison
Quoiqu'il arrive il accomplit sa mission
La berceuse du soir et les bisous qui piquent
Devant la télévision, le sport devient une religion
La sueur des joueurs de foot devient de l'eau bénite
Si ton père n'est pas là, tu sais, ne soit pas triste
Tu évites les engueulades pour le bouchon du dentifrice
Et j'appréhende déjà le jour des grands adieux
Y a pas de bons pères, y a que des hommes qui font de leur mieux

Celle-là c'est pour nos pères, nos padre
Ceux qui disent ""je t'aime"" sans même parler
Pour ceux qu'on regrette, ceux qui sont pas passés
Mais si t'es papa, tu sais que t'es pas parfait
Celle-là c'est pour nos pères, nos padre
Ceux qui disent ""je t'aime"" sans même parler
Pour ceux qu'on regrette, ceux qui sont pas passés
Mais si t'es papa, tu sais que t'es pas parfait

Y ya sé que soy viejo
Nunca te olvidaré
Cuando miro el espejo
Son mis hijos que veo
Me acuerdo del mío
Y cuando se fue
Aprendí que la vida
No vale más que el papá, papá
Papá, papá
Papa, papa
Papa, papa

Papa, je t'oublierais pas, pas
Je te promets papa
Je t'en voudrais
Papa, je t'oublierais pas, pas
Je te promets papa
Je t'en voudrais pas
Papa, je t'oublierais pas, pad
Je te promets papa
Je t'en voudrais
Papa, je t'oublierais pas, pas
Je te promets papa
Je t'en voudrais pas
Papa, je t'oublierais pas, pas

Bigflo,"Bonjour les gars, trois ans depuis le festival
Comment vont vos parents? Fier de vous avoir eu dans ma salle
Ça fait longtemps, j'comprend si l'nom vous revient pas
Mais putain, j'étais ému quand j'ai su pour l'Olympia

Yo les gars je sais pas qui lira ce message
Avec des potes on a une belle villa au bord d'la plage
Dans une semaine on fait une fête, je sais que c'est bizarre
Mais si vous venez faire un freestyle, on payera la pizza

Hyper déçu, j'ai croisé Oli en ville l'autre soir
Pas un bonjour, pas un sourire, pas un regard
C'est beau de faire des leçons dans vos textes, nous faire croire qu'on peut être potes
Vous êtes les même vendeurs de rêves, ouais, vous valez pas mieux que les autres

Eh les p'tits! Big up pour l'son et pour l'ambition
J'ai adoré quand vous avez refusé cette émission
J'viens de Marseille, longtemps que j'écoute plus de rap
Mais voilà, vous me faites penser à un bon groupe qui venait de chez moi

Oli ça va? C'est Momo de la colo
Obligé de t'écrire ici, tu réponds plus à mes textos
J'repense aux dortoirs et ces promesses qu'on s'est tenues
On a fait un repas avec les autres, t'es pas venu

C'est le dixième message, mais je retente ma chance
J'ai des photos de vous collées sur tout les murs d'ma chambre
Et ça devient lassant, mais j'abandonnerai pas
Alors encore une fois, s'il vous plait, répondez-moi
C'est le dixième message, mais je retente ma chance
J'ai des photos de vous collées sur tout les murs d'ma chambre
Et ça devient lassant, mais j'abandonnerai pas
Alors encore une fois, s'il vous plait, répondez-moi

Avant c'était qu'des boum-bap, grosse basse à l'ancienne
Maintenant vous faites du gros cash à la chaîne, dommage
J'crois que votre inspi' est tombée en panne
Désolé d'vous dire que vous venez de perdre un fan

À des milliers de kilomètres, mais l'son altère la distance
On vous écoutes à fond dans le cyber' de Abidjan
Bientôt ""La cour des grands"", franchement j'aimerais vous aider
Faut dire qu'ici c'est pas facile de trouver l'CD

Salut Florian, on était ensemble en sixième
Je sais qu'tu penses à nous, même si tu donnes plus trop de nouvelles
Les fous rires à la cantine sur les yaourts tu t'en souviens
Madame Martin nous a quitté, je sais que tu l'aimais bien

Merci, c'est tout ce que j'veux vous dire
Et sans vos chansons, j'pourrais même pas vous l'écrire
C'est vrai, j'voulais partir, me faire une place dans les étoiles
Vos sons m'ont fait du bien, depuis j’arrête d'me faire du mal

Ça fait trois ans qu'on s'est lancés dans l'son
On avait fait votre première partie à Besançon
Et je vous cache pas que vous avez déçu l'équipe
Vous nous aviez promis au moins un avis sur le clip

C'est le centième message, mais je retente ma chance
J'ai des photos de vous collées sur tout les murs d'ma chambre
Et ça devient lassant, mais j'abandonnerai pas
Alors encore une fois, s'il vous plait, répondez-moi

C'est l'anniversaire de ma p'tite soeur en décembre
Je l'aime plus que tout, j'crois qu'Bigflo doit me comprendre
Si vous pouviez passer, c'est p't'être un délire, mais
Juste pour une heure ça ferait super plaisir

J'étais là au concert, 14h déjà devant l'entrée
Vos sons pour patienter, ça m'a fait bizarre d'vous voir en vrai
J'connais tout par cœur, même vos phrases d'impro
J'étais l'mec à la casquette à fleur, à droite de Flo
Merci pour la dédi', Oli t'as kiffé l'cadeau?
Avec le stress rien n'est sorti et j'ai juste dis bravo
Alors pour m'rattraper j'vais écrire un pavé
Fallait que j'vous parle de moi car j'commence à rapper et tard le soir

Bande de fils de pute, ça y est vous faites pitié avec vos têtes de con
Et vos chansons sur l'amitié, vous mériteriez d'crever
Et qu'on vous revoit plus
Je croise les doigts pour qu'un jour vous me croisiez dans la rue

J'habite loin d'chez vous mais j'me sens proche de l'écriture
J'en parle sur toute mon île, le son à fond dans la voiture
On serait fier d'vous faire visiter avec mon père
Est ce que j'dois prendre l'avion pour vous voir en concert?

Bonjour je m'appelle Martine et j'ai quarante-six ans
Malheureusement j'ai perdue ma sœur dans un accident
Travailler entre frères, dites-vous que c'est une chance
Quoiqu'il arrive, promettez moi d'rester ensemble

Eh Oli, bravo pour ta plume, t'écris trop bien
T'as un truc en plus que ton grand frère a en moins
Il est pas nul mais ça m'fatigue son délire de rigolo
Quand est ce que tu nous le sors ton putain d'album solo?

C'est le millième message, mais je retente ma chance
J'ai des photos de vous collées sur tous les murs d'ma chambre
Et ça devient lassant, mais j'abandonnerai pas
Alors encore une fois, s'il vous plait, répondez-moi
C'est le millième message, mais je retente ma chance
J'ai des photos de vous collées sur tous les murs d'ma chambre
Et ça devient lassant, mais j'abandonnerai pas
Alors encore une fois, s'il vous plait, répondez-moi

J'ai une association pour les enfants malades
J'aimerais que vous veniez à notre grande soirée de gala
Ils attendent avec impatience la grande annonce
J'ose pas leurs dire que ça fait trois mois que j'ai pas d'réponse

Tous les soirs avant d'dormir vos sons m'ont bercé
J'vous connais tout les deux depuis l'époque du RC
Moi aussi je fait du rap, et c'que j'voulais dire c'est
C'est quoi le truc? Comment vous avez fait pour percer?

Hello les gars, j'avoue j'sais pas trop comment faire
On était là à Brest, donc j'laisse un petit commentaire
J'suis mère de deux p'tits, eux aussi sont frères
Et tout les soirs dans la chambre ils refont votre concert
On a gardé les tickets, à la maison vous êtes nos stars
On a attendu pour une photo mais vous êtes sortis trop tard
J'ai adoré la trompette, les blagues sur les filles en couple
Depuis que leurs père est parti, ils écoutent le disque en boucle

Répondez-moi, répondez-moi
Répondez-moi, répondez-moi
J'ai des photos de vous collées sur tous les murs d'ma chambre
Mais je retente ma chance, répondez-moi, répondez-moi
Répondez-moi, répondez-moi
J'ai des photos de vous collées sur tous les murs d'ma chambre
Répondez-moi

Yo Oli, on a reçu beaucoup d'messages sur notre page aujourd'hui là, faudrait répondre un p'tit peu
Ouais, j'ai la flemme là, en plus y a Jimmy qui fait une soirée chez lui ce soir là
Faut vraiment qu'on y aille
Ouais j'avoue on l'fera plus tard",Répondez-moi,2017
Bigflo,"Hé Antoine, tu te souviens, la cour nous paraissait si grande
On parsemait de fous rires même les plus longs des silences
Les bogues de marrons sur le sol
On courrait sans savoir où aller, on se foutait de savoir ce qu'était la mode
Un peu primaires, on pouvait se battre pour un paquet d'autocollants
L'époque des POGs, les Pokémon, les goals volants
Maintenant j'fais le tour de la cour en quelque pas
C'était le bon vieux temps mais on l'savait pas, hein
Hé Robin, tu t'souviens le temps des premières soirées
On mettait du rap à fond, les autres nous prenaient pour des tarés
On taclait sur le béton, à s'en racler les genoux
On s'est vite rendu compte que les filles étaient pas pareilles que nous
Les premières erreurs, les premiers collègues, les premiers écarts
Les premières tentatives de drague avec nos têtes de têtards
Par fierté, on étouffait les cris du cœur
On grattait des pièces avec une règle sous le distributeur
Hé Marion, tu t'souviens l'odeur de clopes au bout des doigts
Les chevaliers avec des scooters devenaient des rois
Les cheveux lissés, le parfum, le maquillage
L'époque du stress, des fausses promesses, des premières fois
On construisait l'avenir à coup de ""t'es pas cap""
Tu rêvais d'être journaliste et moi, d'être une star du rap
On s'est promis qu'on s'marierait, si on trouvait pas mieux
Je fais en sorte que nos au revoir ne se transforment pas en adieux, nan

Ni un adulte ni un ado
J'essaye de garder la tête sur les épaules
Sur les épaules, la trace du sac-à-dos
Pourtant ça fait longtemps, qu'j'ai quitté l'école
Ni un adulte ni un ado
J'essaye de garder la tête sur les épaules
Sur les épaules, la trace du sac-à-dos
Pourtant ça fait longtemps, qu'j'ai quitté l'école

Hé Ben, tu te rappelles de nos vacances à parler tous les soirs?
Sur la pointe des pieds quand on passait par l'couloir
Le divorce de tes parents, ton poster de Zidane géant
Notre semaine à La Rochelle j'avais jamais vu l'océan
Je l'avoue aujourd'hui, au foot tu me mettais à l'amende
On noyait tous nos doutes, dans l'fond d'un sirop à la menthe
Les tours à vélo, les kilomètres de sparadrap
Tu bougeais déjà la tête sur mes textes un peu maladroits
Hé Sarah tu t'souviens ta veste rose un peu trop grande
Seule devant le portail, quand on oubliait d'venir te prendre
Ils te chambraient sur tes lunettes, j'crois qu'ils regrettent, franchement
J'm'inquiète quand j'vois comment te parle ton prince charmant
Hé Nassim, j'oublie pas nos heures de colles interminables
Nos blagues, nos techniques de triche et de drague un peu nazes
Perdu d'vue sans s'expliquer, pourtant la vie suit son cours
J'espère que ton p'tit frère t'a dit qu'j't'passais l'bonjour
Hé Jimmy, rappelle toi de nos dimanches, nos blagues au téléphone
Dans l'cinéma, la tête des gens quand on parlait trop fort
Le monde paraissait à notre portée
On imaginait l'prénom des passantes qu'on osait pas aborder
Hé Gass' j'repense à nos fous rires et nos p'tites paniques
La fatigue, des cours de théâtre, de six à huit
Le foot avec ton père le tournoi que tout le monde attendait
On s'croise deux fois par an, pourtant rien n'a changé, nan

Ni un adulte ni un ado
J'essaye de garder la tête sur les épaules
Sur les épaules, la trace du sac-à-dos
Pourtant ça fait longtemps, qu'j'ai quitté l'école
Ni un adulte ni un ado
J'essaye de garder la tête sur les épaules
Sur les épaules, la trace du sac-à-dos
Pourtant ça fait longtemps, qu'j'ai quitté l'école

Ni un adulte ni un ado
J'essaye de garder la tête sur les épaules
Sur les épaules, la trace du sac-à-dos
Pourtant ça fait longtemps, qu'j'ai quitté l'école
Ni un adulte ni un ado
J'essaye de garder la tête sur les épaules
Sur les épaules, la trace du sac-à-dos
Pourtant ça fait longtemps, qu'j'ai quitté l'école

Au début de la musique j'étais sceptique
J'me suis dis qu'est-ce qu'ils vont me sortir encore là ça chante dans tous les sens
Ça fait vraiment genre, limite le son qui fait la démarcation
Entre le Bigflo et Oli d'avant, et ceux de maintenant, tu vois?
Après j'ai peur qu'il y a des gens
J'vais vous dire, j'ai peur qu'il y a des gens
Qui pensent que votre gain de maturité, il est surjoué, tu vois?
Ça fait mature mais je voulais pas que ça fasse trop gamin
Ah non justement, le son est par contre est vraiment très bon par contre
Tu dis ça parce que t'as notre dédicace, conard",Sac à Dos,2017
Bigflo,"Quand la lune apparaît, tu peux la croiser en ville
Elle a deux prénoms, un pour la vie, l'autre pour la nuit
Une croix sur ses études, le temps lui a mené la vie dure
Entre le café et la pharmacie, elle a ses habitudes
L'habitude d'être dans le froid, les jambes à l'air
Toute droite dans l'noir, on la confondrait avec un lampadaire
Un combat contre la montre, elle danse avec son ombre
Bien trop jeune pour faire le plus vieux métier du monde
Son parfum mélangé à l'odeur d'essence qui l'entoure
Elle se donne le droit de croire qu'elle pourra partir un jour
Elle a laissé ses rêves s’abîmer à quelques rues
Certaines le font par choix, elle, ne l'a jamais eu
En rentrant elle ferme les yeux devant l'miroir de l'ascenseur
La nuit tous les chats sont gris et tous ses clients sont seuls
Ils emportent un peu d'elle quand ils referment la porte
Et des traces apparaissent quand les caresses deviennent trop fortes
Elle est intelligente et drôle, mais pour être honnête
Les hommes qui viennent la voir ne sont pas là pour la connaître
Sous la Grande Ourse, elle fait tout pour leur faire envie
Elle doute, et quand son maquillage coule elle dit que c'est la pluie
Bien sûr elle voudrait être ailleurs, partir d'ici
Mais elle est prise en otage par l'café et la pharmacie
Cernée, vue que chaque soir est déjà demain
Elle a des tonnes de regrets coincés dans son p'tit sac à main
Les saisons passent, on s'habitue aux angoisses
Elle s'dit que ça pourrait être pire en regardant le SDF d'en face
Les destins se ressemblent dans l'périmètre
Elle fait les cent pas, en restant là elle a fait de milliers de kilomètres
Souvent, son prince charmant s'évapore comme un mirage
Ils se souviennent pas d'son prénom, elle veut oublier leurs visages
Des sacrifices pour un meilleur avenir
Si la lune pouvait parler, elle en aurait des choses à dire

Elle a un fils, son petit bout d'âme, son moment de calme
L'étoile qui la guide dans la nuit noire
Elle le rejoint aux aurores après l'horreur
Elle se conforte dans son odeur, son cœur et son corps
Il ne sait pas encore pour son bout de trottoir
Il lui donne l'amour qu'on lui donne pas le soir
Elle le regarde dormir, d'un coup elle désespère
Comment lui expliquer où est passé son père?
Un jour elle partira, elle l’amènera au loin
Elle fermera une valise, elle a hâte, un beau matin
Elle s’échappera des griffes du périph' de Paris
Elle aura une maison, un chien, un château, un mari
Elle s'est promis que tout ça ne durerait pas
Une mauvaise passe qui s'en ira, oui, elle croit au miracle
Elle en vient presque à oublier qu'elle doit retourner cette nuit
Entre le café et la pharmacie
Sa mère pense qu'elle est engagée comme danseuse dans un cabaret
Mais sa scène fait deux mètre carrés
C'était la plus belle quand elle était au pays
Elle lui donne des nouvelles, des mensonges bien écrits
Elle fait bonne figure, mais au moment de raccrocher
Ça la brûle de lui dire de venir la chercher
Mais elle sait qu'ils sont là, les loups qui la surveillent
Elle voudrait pas qu'ils s'en prennent à sa seule merveille

Nous, on sortait de boîte, dans une voiture on roulait vite
De la fumée, de la musique, rien qu'entre amis on voulait rire
On avait pas envie de rentrer et certains avaient trop bu
On savait pas trop où aller, quand soudain on l'a vue
D'un coup, on a ralenti, lorsqu'on est passé
Au niveau de la pharmacie, juste à côté du café
Mon dieu ce qu'on peut être con quand on est entres potes
On a baissé la vitre, on a crié ""salope!""",Salope !,2017
Bigflo,"Trop tard
Oli, Bigflo, Jaguar

Elle avait toujours été seule avant d'le rencontrer
Coup d'foudre, elle s'était pas trompée
Elle nous disait ""l'amour est mort"", s'empêchait d'y croire
Elle était jeune, lui avait déjà eu des histoires
Comme un nouveau départ, elle lui donnait d'l'espoir
Elle était fière d'nous raconter sa première fois
C'est vrai qu'il est attachant, de bonne humeur et quand j'y pense
En son absence, y avait beaucoup moins d'ambiance
Elle lui donnait confiance, finie la jolie renfermée
Choquée devant ses danses, elle était transformée
C'était son meilleur pote, son amour, son anti-ennui
Il l'avait changé, elle pouvait plus sortir sans lui
Il était dur avec elle et lui montait à la tête
Et certains soir elle nous mentait pour le retrouver en cachette
Et moi j'le trouvais saoulant j'lui aurait bien dis ""fous l'camp!""
Elle avait foi en lui et elle en parlait tout l'temps
J'aurais du voir qu'ça allait pas, non ça allait pas
Elle l'avait dans l'sang pour lui elle s'mettait dans des sales états
Beau parleur, un bon dragueur, un charmeur un étalon
À force de courir après lui, elle s'est cassé les talons
Elle buvait ses paroles, voyait plus personne
Répondait plus à sa daronne
Nan mais tu t'rends compte? L'amour ça rend con
Dans son regard on lisait l'regret d'leur première rencontre
Pour nous trop dur à avaler on la voyait elle était pâle
Elle s'était fait balader par l'cavalier d'son dernier bal
Elle restait belle mais qu'est-ce qu'elle était mal
Il lui a jamais rendu visite à l'hôpital

Elle nous disait toujours pareil, qu'elle arrêterait d'le voir
Elle nous l'a dit trop de fois
Il lui remplissait les oreilles avec toutes ses histoires
On l'a compris trop tard
Elle nous disait toujours pareil, qu'elle arrêterait d'le voir
Elle nous l'a dit trop de fois
Il lui remplissait les oreilles avec toutes ses histoires
On l'a compris trop tard

Hmhm, trop tard
Hmhm, trop tard
Hmhm, trop tard
Hmhm, trop tard
Trop tard, trop tard
Hmhm, trop tard
Hmhm, trop tard
Hmhm, trop tard
Trop tard
C'était déjà trop tard

Elle nous disait toujours pareil (tout le temps)

C'était l'ex d'un pote, il lui à présenté
Il lui a dit ""fais attention tu pourrais t'laisser tenter""
Mais dès qu'elle est rentré dans la pièce elle est rentré dans son cœur
Elle avait des beaux yeux verts avec un parfum de fleur
Lui qu'avait perdu l'espoir qu'un jour l'amour l'accompagne
Il venait de la ville elle venait de la campagne
Au début d'leur histoire ils étaient beaux à voir
Il l'avait dans la poche dès l'départ
Ensemble ils pouvaient rester des heures couchés dans l'herbe
À regarder le ciel, elle lui disait ""il faut te détendre"", il lui disait ""je t'aime""
Elle était belle au naturel, dès qu'elle était pas là il avait plus d'air
Elle lui disait des mots doux du bout des lèvres, avec tous les potes elle était populaire
Elle lui donnait le tournis
C'était la seule fille qui lui donnait le sourire
Il traînait avec elle tout le temps, tout le temps
Elle lui répétait ""fais doucement, doucement""
Elle le suivait partout, ils allaient jusqu'au bout
Il voulait dormir avec elle au lieu de sortir avec nous
Elle l'avait changé, il avait les yeux cernés
Il passait la journée chez lui avec les volets fermés
Elle lui faisait oublier sa vie d'merde
Lui qui avait connu pas mal de doute
Et un beau jour bercé par la vitesse
Il s'est endormi sur la route

Il nous disait toujours pareil, qu'il arrêterait d'la voir
Il nous l'a dit trop de fois
Elle lui remplissait les oreilles avec toutes ses histoires
On l'a compris trop tard
Il nous disait toujours pareil, qu'il arrêterait d'la voir

Bigflo,"J'aurais pu être un grand DJ à Ibiza
Avoir des chaînes en or, faire des millions, des milliards
Faire partie des gens côtés, de manger que du caviar
Mais pour l'instant j'suis choqué, j'crois qu'j'suis resté bloqué

J'essaye de militer pour gagner l'humilité
Même si je fais des concerts et des télés par milliers
Les gens me disent Biggy n'oublies pas la vérité
Tu sais la vie que t'aimes ne dure pas l'éternité
Pourtant j'ai pas la vie de Palace, j'en ai pas l'aspect
Ouais faut qu'tu le saches
Après mon Zénith j'ai dormi dans mon lit une place
Avec les pieds qui dépassent!
C'est vrai qu'je me ballade d'une vie à l'autre, je passe du caviar au mikado
J'fais des restos chics avec le gratin, et le lendemain, j'suis au McDo
Les gens s'imaginent qu'après mes concerts dans ma chambre y'a des filles coquines
En vérité je suis au téléphone et je m'engueule avec ma petite copine, relance le beat!
Y'a qu'ça qui m'calme, j'ai toujours pas le numéro de Kim K
Mon p'tit, dans la vie mieux vaut être un illustre inconnu, qu'une petite star!
J'traîne avec des mecs qui ont des Oscars
Des beaux gosses qui ont la côte
J'fais des cocktails des soirées mais j'préférais y être avec mes potes
Quand j'suis avec eux, j'me sens bien, rien a changé, c'est toujours pareil
J'me suis déjà fait refouler des boites dans lesquelles j'avais rappé la veille!
Arrête de faire la victime - bon c'est vrai j'ai acheté un appart'
T'as du te faire plein de fric - j'ai plus d'argent qu'j'en rêvais d'avoir, mais
Y'a pas d'VIP aux toilettes à la pompe d'essence ou au supermarché
D'ailleurs y a pas longtemps j'ai croisé, un type du lycée, que j'connaissais
Il m'a dit ""ça cartonne grave j'ai vu"", j'ai dit ""et toi, comment ça va?""
Il s'est arrêté, et m'a répondu ""ah moi tu sais, la vie normale""

J'aurais pu être un grand DJ à Ibiza
Avoir des chaînes en or, faire des millions des milliards
Faire partie des gens côtés, de manger que du caviar
Mais pour l'instant j'suis choqué, j'crois qu'j'suis resté bloqué dans la vie normale

La vie normale
La vie normale
La vie normale
La vie normale
C'est nous! C'est vous! On représente la vie normale
J'te jure c'est nous! C'est vous! On représente la vie normale

J't'assure j'essaye mais j'y arrive pas! Quand tu fais la star tu sais les gens parlent
Loin de ces fêtes infréquentables, car je préfère le sirop de grenadine au champagne
J'ai le cul entre les chaises et les pieds sur la table, j'essaye, de trouver ma place
Jusqu'au jour où ma vie de rêve s'effacera et mettra tous mes textes à la casse
Je les regarde rêver d'enfiler, les vestes en velours, des défilés
J'reste le ringard du fond d'la cour, j'pourrais jamais être un mec stylé
Et j'fais des albums, pour faire des concerts, et j'fais des concerts pour sortir de ma chambre
Et je sors de ma chambre sinon j'rate ma chance et puis j'attends ou je donne de janvier à décembre
Et paraît que la grosse tête s'attrape, quand tu t'éloignes de ta ville et de tes potos
Quand on m'arrête j'suis plus content que le mec qui m'a demandé une photo
Mais tu sais, depuis gamin je rêve de faire des concerts et de la vie d'artiste mais même
Quand je remplis des salles j'ai l'impression de faire une première partie
Vous vous en doutez, j'suis un mec bien! Pas besoin d'en faire trop
Vous le savez, j'suis un gars simple, et j'aime écrire dans l'métro
J'voulais prouver, j'suis un mec sain, à qui tu peux parler comme avant
Mais j'vous laisse y'a mon chauffeur qui attend!

J'voulais parler de ma ville et de ce monde qui va mal

Et ces peuples de l'ombre qu'on rafale et tombe

Qui espère sortir d'sa vie si vide, si triste, si lisse

J'voulais parler de cette pop star, cette idole
Qui le soir dans la chambre s'endort toute seule
Tous ces mômes qui s'échappent d'une vie molle
En cherchant l'amour sur Google
J'voulais parler de ce type qui n'a plus de nerfs
Il a pété un câble, fallait parier
Mais la seule chose qui l'empêche de s'foutre en l'air
C'est qu'il y a déjà plus d'balles dans le barillet

Et les mecs, ils veulent des meufs bonnes, avec des gros boules et du mascara
Et les filles, elles veulent des bonhommes, avec de grosses couilles, pas de blablabla

J'voulais parler de nos peurs et puis de toutes nos chaînes

Qui serait vainqueur du tournoi
Qui dit ""je le fais pour vous""

Tout le monde me dit, ""tu sais pour ton avenir on a peur
On voudrait que tu sois un médecin, toi tu veux être un rappeur""

Ma meuf m'a dit, ""tu m'aimes pas assez, on dirait que tu t'es lassé
Qu'est ce qui s'est passé?
T'as plus le même regard quand t'as fini de m'embrasser""
Je m'endors avec mes coups de blues
Plus personne ne croit au coup d'foudre
La voisine est venue me voir pour me dire qu'elle en avait marre de mes
Engueulades avec ma mère, à chaque fois c'est pareil quand je m'énerve
Je tape dans la porte et je casse mes affaires
Puis je m'endors et quand je me réveille je regrette (ah, ah, ah)
Tout le monde me parle
Tout le monde croit savoir ce que je dois faire de ma vie
Ce qu'il y a dans ma tête

Mais j'n'écoute que moi et je me répète que 

C'est pas grave

Allez sors de ma vie

On croit en l'amour qu'une semaine sur deux
Le temps passe vite, on est des jeunes vieux
Hier un petit m'a appelé Monsieur
Par la fenêtre j'attends un signe
J'pense à mon avenir qui doucement se dessine
En attendant je me remets ce vieux son de Biggie
Celui qui fait, ""it was all a dream""
Un seul sourire, et mille pleurs, on attend la surprise comme les Kinders
Pour éviter de dire, ""les enfants j'ai rencontré maman sur Tinder""
Toutes les questions sans réponses se baladent dans ma tête
La main sur le cœur, des fois j'ai trop peur qu'il s'arrête

If they people want revenge, I never worry or wonder
When my motherfucking beef coming
Nigga this Rap-A-Lot mafia, head-n-chief coming
Everybody claiming they got guerillas in they click, why they be lying
When automatics start bucking, they turn them monkeys on the vine
Trying to get away, from the drama
But my barrel be spinning, like a set of Yokohama
I gotta blame it on my messed up childhood, this how I turned out
Hotter than first degree burns, unable to burn out

And you a fool, if you thinking that I won't jab
I hate the world, is the kind of attitude I got
But I could justify reasons, for any dude I shot
So I never be watching my back, Jehovah do it for me
I'm not a criminal, just trying to keep t-bone in my tummy

Uh

Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Niggas phoney so I only got a couple of homeys
If you a hustler I could, I could fuck wit you homey
You spend a couple of bucks ill stay in touch with you homey

Married to the game, same bride as a new dru

Cause my bills come in too soon, my son gone be two soon
Royalty checks come like once in a blue moon
But I'm getting my doe from doin shows
I made more doe on the grind then goin cold
That's why I stay fly and flying on shows
Car's are so cool, Aston no shoes
Just a rubber band on my wrist no jewels
I ain't gotta prove I'm rich, I'm no fool
I know the rules I ain't got time for it
But a nigga will shine when its time for it
And they will hate you deal with the real cake
And they on the corner
From morning till real late
I deal weight and if you bastards doubt me
I'm a hustler ask about, ask about me

[Chorus]

To git paid you gotta save don't be spendin' the change
In fifth grade I was hustlin' my genesis games
I was dummy young selling chewing gum to my classmates
On the cash chase moving at a fast pace
Never been a dummy never did what the dummies do
So I had a mill to burn before I turned 22
Mo money, mo problems is true cause the more money
I make the more problems for you
Yeah I used dude voice props to the boy Sean
He made it a hot line I made a hot song
So stop drawing man you got to respect it
I'm the best swizz got to perfected don't mess with
C-a-double s-I-d-y cause I became the best when b-I-g died
The kid do it big like p-u-n cause

Now they say you ain't never suppose to envy no man
Can't tell that to a dingy old man
Who see a young nigga getting plently dough man
Icy Audemar, Hendy gold band
With a mean girl like Lindsay Lohan
That's why I keep the 9 in the Bentley door pan
Trust it's gon' bust you roll on us
Know it's gon' blow for my dough
Why would you try with that guy
Scene told you he keep it G
We can bang like the two chains on my neck
The hood is Iraq I'm Hussein in the 'jects
The coupe's up take the new Lame for a sec
12"" up, new cane in the deck nigga
Right now with a squeezer and a coozie
And I'm goin out like Keyshia with the uzi

They making plans, we sit and counting
Our cheddar stack it's just like a mountain
You heard about it 'cause she running her mouth
She want's to ride, and she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as ever, she's too excited
Her man look like, he want to fight
But he ain't doing nothing, but running his mouth

Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
When I get busy throw your hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front, throw the gat to the fool
Necks wanna move but's getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release masterpieces like adhesive
Stuck to your ass, like tissue when your wiping fast
MC's have a hard time believing
I mark with death, hard to kill like Steven
When Jake come I'm leaving, the black man's motto
You got a better chance playing lotto
What you want nigga?

Now watch me dip-dip-di-dive all over the beat
Now watch me drip-drip-dri-di all over the street
The general consensus is you'll be the dominating fleet
Bitch raw, and let me continue to bring the heat
You know who been the kings of the block, the kings of the drops
The kings of the crap music and the kings of the cross
Niggas fire then drop shit like the purest of powder
That's why most of these niggas little song be sounding like ours
Couple years ago, niggas probably thought I was dying
Now same niggas are idolizing put our face in the shrine
Yeah I took a little time to cook and show you what's really hot
How the fuck any of you niggas think you feeling my spot
Why you niggas getting mad at us, we shit on your floors
All in your house nigga, our strategies is different from yours
Listen, you come you can do it while I continue to preach

How she leave dude broke tell them boys on work
I'm in the G5 Jedi, Brooklyn what's your chrome
'Cause that niggas lying home if the tutti with the dead-eye

And no Stranel ain't the same since Homo got touched
Nasty with the pistol, nasty with the clit

But it's paradise for me.

From the cradles to the stiff coffin, legit fortune
I lean for them corner fiends, crip-walking
Wedding-bells I'm out of that shell of slick talking
Honeymoon, deep scuba diving, kissing the dolphins
I lived though, I quit flossing, I forgive though this shit's costing
At the crib with the kids often, coasting
Ski-boating on the beach ocean
Hoping them old closed cases never re-open
Moving, why'all minor leagues, I'm like speed motion
Muscles through my white tee's woken, he's holding
Hypnotic, spit shit you sit and vibe wit, melodic
I mental escape through all the garbage

This is life (echo 4x)

One in a million, I'm strong young and appealing
Was born son a villain, put on in front of my building
Peeping how the street structure decease brothers
Critique, but I was placed here to reach others
Incomplete, stand feet from the deep cover
Eternal sleep, I wonder if the Beast love us
The frail weaken, the stronger be in jail eating
The average male will make it home if the bail's decent
I inhale frequent, it alleviate great, to be a part of the game
Can't be a day late to be a part of the same
Need a g' a day take, five if you live, slide mines on the side

This is life (echo 4x)

Mics, money and music my life's for you to view it
I stand militant, my stripes came from the sewage
Interrogation lights, spend nights up in the cubics
Fistfights, I'm nice like Earl Huvick
Harmonizing, narration is traumatizing
Here since '94, it's still kinda surprising
I touched topics, safe-boxes, unlocked it
Complete zone keep my tone on one octave
Owe nothing, won't ask to hold nothing
Clean behind the scene, but control buttons

You spend a lot of your time dancin to fraudulent rhymes

Alarm that cat, that when we slide through abide to
The rules that's been laid down by (?) true like bibles

And ditch 'em while other ladies whisper, who is he?
Then later leave with eight new ones, me an airtight Willie
Bout to smack you silly with two guns
So hereby I certify don't care if you feel hurt if I

Testify, against your false words or lies
Word to God this is my job I'm workin hard every minute

Been certified for years, can't speak to chumps no more

Bilal,"The revolution will not be televised
The revolution is here
Yeah, it's Common Sense, with DJ Premier
We gonna help y'all see clear
It's real hip-hop music, from the soul, y'all
Yeah, check it, yo

The perseverance of a rebel I drop heavier levels
It's unseen or heard, a king with words
Can't knock the hustle, but I've seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occurred
Some say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep
Through me, Muhammad will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes in ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
With cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear
Under the Fubu is a guru, that's untapped
Want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that

In front of two-inch glass and Arabs I order fries
Inspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes
I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies
Immortalized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music
My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it
Through my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions
More than money saved, I want to save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit

Some days I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th, stopped by this little girl
She recited raps, I forgot where they was from
In 'em, she was saying how she made brothers cum
I start thinking, how many souls hip-hop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge one's perspective?
Though some of that shit y'all pop true it, I ain't relating
If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes, it's like",The 6th Sense,2000
Bilal,"You know, they call me a pimp, and you know what that mean
I'm a Person that's Making Profit. See I pimp internationally
I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted
I pimp with the truth, that's the only method

Seen her on Madison where Vice Lords be Travelin
And Chevy windows be rattlin
And badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts
Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched
Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig
Asked her the name, one way to approach her
See she had game, she needed me to coach her
Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture
The way a righteous pimp is supposed to

As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune
I ain't having it like abortion
Walking with this stick holding his tip
Looked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp
It was cold as shit, I'm waitin on my ride
Act like I didn't see him I tried

Motion denied
I felt the vibe like Roy Ayers
She was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators
Told her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure
That's in tuned with nature, hold Common's hand
I'm a take you to a pimps promise land
Where no man can break ya, break ya, break ya

Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers

Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god

{Hey girl, come on over here, check it out)
Make your next move your best move, choose me

How I look working for a nigga in a kufi
If I was on a track you couldn't produce me
With them shits on your wrist looking goofy

(yea ok)
I pimp without a pause, for the cause, I'm a rebel
You been on the streets I'm trying to take you to another level
You used to the same game, cats saying the same thang
Nigga you gone ho underground or ho mainstream

Nigga you must not know of me
I'm the mack here
Ought to have you ho for me (get real now)
Pimp yo punk ass
Have you write me poetry
I'm from a land called cash
You too slow for me

You know why?
I'm thinking bigger than Bagets
Birds in slick cars
Or have you on the corner trickin in strip bars
If you become mine the world would be ours
Respect the game, and universal laws

What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall
(try it)
Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball
I know pimpin ain't easy but damn you barely surviving
We can't ride together cause you ain't driving

Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god
Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers
Customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god

You and I together is like Ashford and Simpson
Picture us elbow to elbow at the hustler's convention

Think I'm gone risk my ass then give you the cash (yep)
That shit is the past
I got my own stable (where at)
I oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track
Matter of fact I been looking for a ho that's abstract

Girl you getting beside yourself
I'm trying to guide you
Help you see inside yourself
I pimp with vision, I'm a help you see the light
Have you covering your body and have you eating right

(Is that right)
I'm pimp ho's, pimp pens, (Say what)
Pimp rhythms, pimp flows
Pimp men (and pimp what)
Pimp systems
Got stores called big pimpin (Where)
Down South
In Texas I ran the best ho house

(So)
I pimp from Brazil to um, Tokyo
Have Japanese broads sayin Choushi wa dou (Yea right)
Bring'em back to the states to turn dates from Europe
Made the dirtiest of hoes seem purer

(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
(Why you laughin)
I'm laughin cause you funny
I'm make bitch niggas like you have my money
I get six hundred off yo' skinny ass weekly
You'll get all them righteous hoes in that dashiki

Yo, what ever happened to loyalty
Don't you want to become royalty
On the streets selling ass and oils for me
But you on this ho-asis and really I can't reach you
Fuck you then I'm about to be a preacher

Well there you have it ya'll
The story of pimps and hoes ya'll know how it goes

See some people get caught up
And some charges brought up
With some people they shoot up
Hey, there it goes again
Different face to the same old tragic end
Who's to blame if he never saw it coming
Yet he heard the bullet humming
And he never though of running
It's too late for him now laying out on the ground so cold, so cold
Nothing much to live up to, damn

Yes Sir
Yo I reminisce over this chick
Colder than a soda
Princess a soldier
Raised in Islamic culture
Sexy as the girl on the Jamaica poster
Men are over seas where there really don't be no
Sistas
Brought her on stage as Bilal sang ""Soul Sista""
In body parts the blood was thicker
Sweet only tryna make sure it ain't the liquor
She was with a nigga come to find out
She and Sista backstage, conversation kissed her
Made me forget to remember that I pimp the dime
Put the pimpin' aside I see Kenya in her eye
Our connection lies in a life before
For us to meet again was devine law
So I can't describe how deep I dug her
Now only in memory can I hug her
I reminisce why'all

Bilal,"This is a song that makes me spill out all my guts
Sometimes

Sometimes, I wish I wasn't me
Sometimes, I wish I was drug free
Sometimes, wish I saw the exit sign first
Sometimes, wish I knew the truth without search
Sometimes, I wish I could go where I never been
See what I never saw, do what I never did
Or walk before I could crawl

Sometimes, I wish my eyes wasn't so red
Sometimes, I wish I had breakfast in bed
Sometimes, I mean it's worth it 
Since I did all the work last night
Sometimes, you ain't good to me, yes
I am good to you
And you don't see my attention the way that I do 

Sometimes, hey slim, you should be nicer than you are
Sometimes, you take that complaining shit way too far
I mean, I thought it was cute in the beginning but now
I think you only do it 'cause you know I hate it
Sometimes, you got me wishing I didn't have home training
Sometimes, then it wouldn't hurt me so bad
With dreams of knocking you in your head
Then it wouldn't hurt me so bad
With our kitchen knife put up your ass

Sometimes, wish I knew life with no pain, yeah
Wish I held the keys to this game
Sometimes, I pretend 'cause I'm afraid to be, afriad to be
Sometimes, I hope I live to see twenty five
Sometimes, I wish I could be like Moses
Round up my people, move out the ghetto
And live a better life
Sometimes, I wish I didn't try so hard
Sometimes, who knows truth any way
They don't know nothing, who needs that approval

The sun in your hands player
Move at your own pace, listen to your own mind
Do your own thing, yeah yeah
I'm saying it because I love ya
And I want to grow with you, yeah yeah
But you want to run in the other direction
So I got to stay on my path until I win
I win, I win, I win
I want to win, I want to win, I want to win, I want to win

Oh sometimes, sing it with me I wish

The shade of ebony
In the silence of my dreams

Bilal,"Yeah!

Yeah!

Nigga deep in the rhythm, experience speak
Some keepin' the wisdom, the life hustlers seek
I seeking it with em, i'm dope the streets need me to hit em
With some of that (revolutionary rap)
Revolutionary blunted rap
My peoples want hits, I hit it from the back
Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes
My guise pack heat enough to bury June, on my feet
I'm getting married soon, walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune
Fumes of a real nigga seep into your room
Or through fifteens of the your jeep that you boom
Son so many cats, they call me high noon
Offerings to Osun hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman
Time to build, as far as building I'm the doorman, opening doors
My blood I expose on the floors, tell them the game ain't only the score
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
You ain't supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line
In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed
Opposed to shine so me holding the blinds
Mixing golden seal and wine, holding a nine
In the age of Aquarius

The water that arrives (ba-ba ba ba)
To purify the world (du-ba ba ba)
Flying through the night (du ba-ba ba ba)
So watch out here he comes ( do-do ba ba ba)
Aquarius!

Between churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks
With raps, all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous, where the pain is felt
As you build and destroy yo remain yourself
They say I'm slept on, now I'm bucking in dreams
And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme
Or the struggle of fiends, I flow over water that's as troubled as teens
For the love of the team, trying to double the dream
Be grateful like the church psalm my grandmother sings
I'm rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
Thinking rap is the only way out
The black human genius will never play out
I take you way out, where you never been before
Been it since birth, sent to replish the Eatrh
That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse
I deaded your shit before you finished a verse
From niggas to gods from bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse
Holla back, but listen first
We in the age of Aquarius

The water that arrives (ba-ba ba ba)
To purify the world (du-ba ba ba)
Flying through the night (du ba-ba ba ba)
So watch out here he comes ( do-do ba ba ba)

Bilal,"Phone rang, screen said caller ID said blocked
But for some reason I decided to answer it
On the other end was a French accent
He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years, spending these last two days
With his momma and his kids
When he spoke I wasn't trying to hear it ,cause
I knew he was a real good person
And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit
He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he done
He said now its time for him to turn himself in
No longer could he run, from life, from God
Start thinkin', why is doing right is so hard
I got back to him when we was in London discussin' the new testament
And how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it
My voice became destined, so I asked him why you gotta go
He said you know turn to Matthew twenty-four
He said no one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near, don't let anything lead you to stray
As long as God is with you, everything will be okay
So right about then, we decided to pray

Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep into clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep in the clouds
Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray
Deep in the clouds
It's makin' things appear to me so clearly
Deep into clouds

Your time
Is a terrible to waste
For it's
Not one of the possessions that you can bring to space, yeah, it don't matter
Its a challenge
But the chance of seeing, is quite a dream to chase, yes it is
I hope
I remind God of him when he sees my face
He goin' see it

The feeling just keeps on lifting me higher
And its ever flowing it's, ever flowing
When every thing, puts a smile on my face
And I recognize the strong goal
But I keep on going, I keep on going
I keep on going on

Hey mighty love
Watching over me
A smile, brilliant
All over, constantly
Warm, comforting
Perfect, like nothing
No hate, no confusion, no strain
Simply peace, simply
Simply, simply, simply

No fear! Heaven is to me
No fear of destruction
Understanding who he is
His name is Christ
Heaven, heaven is to me
Wisdom, understanding, knowledge

Streets of gold and pearly gates
Halos wings all dressed in white
Angels sing and cymbals glare
No one's rich no one's poor
People dreaming they live free
Making love while they in love
Wonderful dream wake me when you're home

Heaven, heaven is being pops
Heaven is spending the day with your grandchildren
Listenin' to they voices when and they laughing and play
And then at the end of the day we hug we kiss and slowly they walk away
And then suddenly they turn and rush back to me and hug me round the knees
Yeah, that's heaven to me",Heaven Somewhere,2002

Close my eyes Erotica, I'm seein' you

To share my love and ecstasy with you
Are you alone? Is your shorty sleep?
Hold on. That's okay, ignore the beep
For you, my love is immortal deep
You are my queen but I can't ignore the freak
Let's let our bodies talk and our auras speak
Hold on, gotta get the toiletries
As our waters reach distances unheard of

Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth
What he showed me was you
Wherever I go, my soul leads to you

As the candle burns
Where desire's lit
Makin' love knows no distance or environment
When we (ahh), feel the most high in it
I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it
Your love is stuck in me
Our minds are so alive and thick
Picture my hands on your waist
As I stare in your face
Your mouth half open
Your love I can taste
Embracin' you

And when it's made, Erotica, it's made for you

And find a place

This is where

And where they peak

You can hear it in my voice when I ask you if you comfortable

Come through and arouse you every morning like the sun do

Notice I haven't yet got into what I want from you
I want you to come to when I come through 
And make you shine like the sun do
I want you to be the valley for my river to run through

Sweet music will start I want you to be the muse of my art

Nigga deep in the rhythm, experience speak
Some keepin' the wisdom, the life hustlers seek
I seeking it with em, I'm dope the streets need me to hit em
With some of that (revolutionary rap)
Revolutionary blunted rap
My peoples want hits, I hit it from the back
Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes
My guise pack heat enough to bury June, on my feet
I'm getting married soon, walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune
Fumes of a real nigga seep into your room
Or through fifth teens of the your jeep that you boom
Son so many cats, they call me high noon
Offerings to Osun hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman
Time to build, as far as building I'm the doorman, opening doors
My blood I expose on the floors, tell them the game ain't only the score
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
You ain't supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line
In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed
Opposed to shine so me holding the blinds
Mixing golden seal and wine, holding a nine
In the age of Aquarius

[Chorus]
(Singing)
The water that arrives 
To purify the world 
Flying through the night 
So watch out here he comes 
Aquarius! 

[Common]
Between churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks
With raps, all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous, where the pain is felt
As you build and destroy yo remain yourself
They say I'm slept on, now I'm bucking in dreams
And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme
Or the struggle of fiends, I flow over water that's as troubled as teens
For the love of the team, trying to double the dream
Be grateful like the church psalm my grandmother sings
I'm rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
Thinking rap is the only way out
The black human genius will never play out
I take you way out, where you never been before
Been it since birth, sent to replenish the Eatrh
That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse
I deaded your shit before you finished a verse
From niggas to gods from bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse
Holla back, but listen first
We in the age of Aquarius

Doo doo doo, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Doo doo doo, diggy-doo yo

I never knew a luh, luh luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter and finally decide to send it

Signed, sealed, delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault 'em 'cause I probably did it too

Because of you feelings I handle with care
Some niggaz recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work

I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Yo, yo, check it

It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you

Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold star night's moon, you my light

If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call

So I pray everyday more than anything friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side, oh darling
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Yeah, yo, yo, check it

It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin' you fresh
Suggestin' beats I should rhyme to

At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence

The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
It's how I must treat you

As my reflection in light I'm a lead you
And whatever's right, I'm a feed you
Digga da, digga da, digga da, digga digga da da
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace

There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light, that shines
Special for you and me
I'll take my chances before they pass, pass, pass
Pass me by, oh darling
You need to look at the other side

I'm lookin' back but nothing's around me
(What's goin' on?) 
Man I don't know
What am I trippin' on?

There's somethin' in the room
It's lurkin' in the shadows

When you see millions, there are many chameleons
You're not a gunner, forreal you just a runner
Haters, I spot you from afar and I'm the deer hunter
They be thinkin' nice car, nice crib

I be thinkin' how long will these niggas let me live
I understand, 'cause people need things
And they will take it from you
And take you from your seedlings

So even with the mumblest talk
I still walk the most humblest walk
And one day, they may even catch up with me, man
But 'til then, I'm Leonardo, catch me if you can

And I'm so scared
When I'm alone Iâ??m so scared!

When I look nothing's there
I'm out of my mind
I'm runnin' from guilt

There's nowhere to hide

You know the stakes is high like the ace is
Get your squad face down like cards before they get a face lift

You get robbed, better yet jacked for diamonds
Leave you victim less, like Jack in 'Shining'
Blocked your bluff, now your respect is stolen
Took your chips, led my guys in Texas Hold 'Em

Stacey Adams of different flavors, we major

Look at the turmoil our kids left the ghetto in
They bustin' metal and ain't got remorse for the innocent
It's just another nigga in the morgue

My momma was pregnant with a son she should abort
'Cause she ain't knowin' what I'm fin' to be facin'
Is nothin' short of a racially motivated killin' 'cause them boys
See a nigga as only a third of a human [Incomprehensible]

Every time I see a cracker with a badge, I'm in awe
'Cause I'm knowin' how he feel and I'm just bein' real
I don't hate and I don't preach it, ain't no motherfuckin secret
We ain't first class citizens and we ain't second either

Need to get up and get out and cut that bullshit out
Nigga get yo' own, you strugglin' at this bitch house
The lack of makin' money make a motherfucker bend
If you'd rather me than you die in the end again and again

I made it over to dry land but still wound up sinkin' in quicksand
I'm tryin' Lord, I just can't get right
Paid my bills on Monday, even went to church on Sunday
But I, but I, but I just can't get right

I lay in bed lookin' up at the ceiling
As the fan turns in a circle thinkin' 'bout my evil
Seein' end on my TV, bombs in the skies
Over Baghdad they fight but they don't know why

What they said about Hussein was a goddamn lie
Raised a war against a religion for oil, don't lie
I seen kids from the hood livin' like they gon' die
With the mindset of be broke or let's go get high

If the cost of livin' so crazy how we gon' get by
Gasoline five dollars, how the fuck we gon' drive?
Can't afford to fill our prescriptions so we all gon' die
CVS is slangin' dope on every block worldwide

Since, spies up and had the dope game on fine
Then it's only right for one nigga to go get mine
If they injured then how they gon' survive?
If they stuck at the bottom how the fuck they gon' ride?

I made it over to dry land but still wound up sinkin' in quicksand
I'm tryin' Lord, I just can't get right
Paid my bills on Monday, even went to church on Sunday
But I, but I, but I just can't get right

Ain't life a muthafucker, first you think you got it
Then it all falls apart in front your eyes, try to stop it
But it's part of the plan that was written by the man
Got me down on my knees and my hands prayin'

Forgive me Lord, thank the Lord I'm alive
'Cause I'm knowin' deep down I coulda died
I shed so many tears, lost so many peers
In the grave or the penitentiary facin' twenty years

Pourin' beers on the corner 'cause Frankie told me look a killer
Told me I was high, livin' blind to the fact that they sold us out
America the beautiful, there's a funeral on every day of the month
Tryin' to get our knees broken, huh

It's another chance under these circumstances
My people ain't advancin' but if we pray
Maybe we'll get to live our life in the sun
Instead of livin' on the blocks dyin' young, here I come

Ooh, made it, made it, made it
But I just can't get right, oh

Most recent was 50 in Angola, that's what's up,
Any rapper could touched, any bitch could get fucked,
Under the California sun, impalas and big trucks,
They say Suge got knocked out, but don't play that nigga cheap,
Cause you're body might wash up by the courts at Venice Beach,
Ain't shit sweet but my Swisher, ain't shit buzzin' but my liquor,

With more ass then Delicious, that's my flavor of love,

See me, I'm posted like a Cincinnati pitcher in the same hat,
It's like a scene from a movie, when the screen fade black,

If you slippin' in Hollywood, and you get your chain snatched,

And it ain't my night to get buried in the dirt
But it is your day to get buried by a verse,
It'll be another ten years before you see an MC Ren here,
Where he been, I been there, that Lambo, I'm in there,
Hotter then the beginning of my career with 50, Dre and Em there,
Top off the Murcialago like Victoria's Secret swim swear,
So listen, I'm so sincere, bout to work out like gym wear,
Murder MTV's top ten, and tat my face with 10 tears,

Hold on, that's okay, ignore the beep
For you, my love is immortal deep
You are my queen but I can't ignore the freak

Let's let our bodies talk and our auras speak
Hold on, gotta get the toiletries
As our waters reach distances unheard of
I'm in the room nestled sweet and I observe love

Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth

Is your mind and your right hand free now?

Our love reach deep down inside of it
As the candle burns, where desire's lit
Makin' love knows no distance or environment
When we ah, feel the most high in it

I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it
Your love is stuck in me, our minds are so alive and thick
Picture my hands on your waist as I stare in your face
Your mouth half open, your love I can taste

Embracin' you, life, I let go
Gotta switch phones 'cause this one is ghetto
Another level of love we create when we take it to
And when it's made, Erotica, it's made for you

Bilal,"Ayo, you gon’ put in on this one?
Why am I the only one purchasing shit man
Ay, go ahead and kick it on in
Kick it in! Kick it In!

Everything, is gonna be alright, oh yeah

Strong arm robbery
Ponzi scheme, our foreign policy
War in the name of democracy
A lottery, a plot to run up in your private property
Cop a key, break it down, and call it the ricotta
Or the fetti, that’s a lotta cheese
Enough to make the innocent cop a plea
And stabilize economies, shopping spree
Copped a V, we stay driven by a lotta greed
The saddest sight is when the parasites bottom feed
The game of Monopoly, a terrorist bombing spree
Planes falling out the sky, like we was a Lockerbie
Look into the heart of a thief
You might go on vacation, become a patient
Somebody taking your artery
My lyrics merely taking a picture, this is photography
Obviously for some the poverty really hard to see
Honestly, I’ve come to the stage rock properly
I like my pockets fat, not flat
Word

Spending up all my time making ends
For all the money
It’s the only thing on my mind, right now
That matters
Tried to change my mind

Gotta check? Let me underwrite it
Spendin’ money on the flesh, attention undivided
The promise of funds got ‘em strip to their undergarments
For the skrilla, they willin’ to diss your mama
Like the show with Wilmer Valderamma
I grind harder cause I gotta live
My ancestors swung from the ropes
Now my knot is thick
This is Apocalypse Now, rising to prominence
Never go against the family, it’s Godfather shit
My hypothesis, stop your breath like an octopus
Gettin’ hold of your esophagus
Try to rob, I’ll pop you quick
Promise you will not evict
On a reconnaissance mission for where the profit is
No I’m not the office type, quite the opposite
Despite accomplishments, I’m hungry as a starving artist is
The knowledge from this metropolitan perspective
More effective than scholarships to the best colleges

Spending up all my time making ends
(Kick it In! Kick it In!)
For all the money
It’s the only thing on my mind, right now
(Ay man, gimme my money!)
That matters
Tried to change my mind

So basically, the moral of the story is:
Go get it, man
It’s the only thing right now that matters
I heard somebody say, “Money is the root of all evil”
Don’t believe that man
It’s the love of money, the pursuit of money
That’s the root of all kinds of evil, man..
So, Yo, somebody owe you money and they ain’t pay up
Tell ‘em you got five seconds,
You got five seconds, gimme my shit!

It is war that you reap

The scars do not heal
Your system is thoughtless and your vision is weak
Your actions are hurtful
You never find what you seek
You make the sky a storm
You destroy the earth, make possibilities bleak
Your lies are your destruction
Your justice stinks
Your pride is maniacal
You are the bearer of grief
Your win is shallow
Your truth is oblique
Your patriotism is garbage
It rots and it reeks of death in the wind
The foul stench of men basking in their cruelty
Rejoicing in their sin
You give up and give over so easily to the darker side
Because of your pride
You risk all of humanity
You send my children to murder human beings
Families they do not yet know
People they have never seen
You send my children to war
Without exasperating dialogue to get to the meat
An equal understanding, as if there isn't even a possibility for peace
But there is always a possibility for peace

Between a comic and a conscious, that's the challenge
Between the solitary and the conference that I examines
That I imagine was a figure
Would be the start of world peace and the transformation of niggas
Like the transubstantiation of liquor

And we'll be right back where we was
Not a peace-sign, but a fascination with scissors

Myself off from the calculations of empress, empires, and the sinners

Presently en route to the rhymes of the machine time
Magazine times
With coffee more sugar and milk than coffee
Aborted rhymes, rotten beats, and failed hooks
Roads as bumpy as braille books
Fail cools, bad French, and mad push at the door
Gourmet food at the starving soiree
A choice of one easy woman at a time
I'll take three the hard way
Trying to be as abstract as possible
And vulgar, the more shocking the more profitable
A baby fed molten gold
And sat upon a pedestal promote getting called 24 carot souls
How to describe this
Insightful remarks such as the best thing I've ever heard is silence
Some more technically impressive
In a faux Spanish romantic hues of a Marxist dialectic
Please listen to the critics, pointless is the common passerby

And to the oppressors, I leave a war

The light goes
The sacrifice
The glory of the ghost controls the soul

Time to surrender your physical being
So I can hear your touch and smell, and start seeing
Life as a precious gift given from God
So I can enjoy my scene and start healing me scars
Take this knife and push it through your windpipe slowly
Come on Lester Cane, you better show me
You're a man of your work, a criminal conduct
You gotta sacrifice your life or else your time's up
He took the knife, the look on his face got calmer
I watched him take his life like a suicide bomber

It's time to go, I made a promise and I'm a man of my word
I'm a G and my bond will never swerve
I dreamed about this time and this place and I swear I've seen it
Now I'm face-to-face with a death angel
Thinking about the lies that I took with no strife
Standing here holding a knife, now I'm 'bout to take my own life
But it's for a good reason
My spirit needs to be replenished so I walk on my soul and be delinquent

Lifeless, his body left stuck in a chair
It was time to become one, but my mind wasn't there
I wasn't sure if I wanted to walk this corrupt Earth
Smell sweat instead of fear, give up my powers
Be a simple man, but along a ruthless killer
Crime born syndicate, another sinner
Murderer, take lives like mine's was once taken
Or leave my seat in this cold world, my heart's aching

Man up soldier, no need to back it up now
I'm in a large space, beauty queens feeding me grapes
Jewels on, thinking clusty
Me and the father ain't rusty
What's the matter talking about you're not sure anymore
Did you lie to your brother Cane or died I die in vain?
You don't wanna be a sinner but sinning is in your veins
You a general, love the life you find in the city
Pretty women, lots of money, doing anything you want
Think about it, me and you is one force
There's no limit the way they can take it, time is ticking, jump up in my corpse
And be true living king that you are, you need to live again
So you can enjoy the fruits and shine like the stars
Drink the finest wines and dawn on exotic moods
Tell the people who never helped, dropping a little jewels
So you hesitating - I didn't hesitate but you
When it was my time to go, I'm cocked it and show and prove

It was hundreds and it was scars and they just happened to be close
It was hunger getting involved so then it was back to being broke

Sometimes I feel like if my psychology will swallow me
So my apologies, what's my problem yo, it's gotta be the money

Scared to death
By this race I've run
All that's left, is everything I want
And I'm slowly losing my time
Quickly taken back from me
Seems my friends are few
Mama said prepare to pay
Cause happiness comes from money
Happiness comes from money

And it was falling out the sky like if Doug E. Fresh was performing
And we already had too much and so we was brushing it off us
In pictures in front of back drops til like 4 in the morning
In all of this Dapper Dan for all of your dapper adornment
Or its falling on the badge in the murder of pick a name
And my name fill the blank and I'm blanked and I drift away
And you kiss my cold cheeks, chicks crying like I was Cochise, would you stand up
And send me a slow speech?, because money makes us happy and, happiness is
Everything, and everything is now and, now is more than never and, there'll never
Be a moment where happiness doesn't matter so, if you can quote the prices of
Your happy then get at us yo

Money
No surrender no restraints
No complaints
(Lord knows the price will only raise)

Scared to death
By this race I've run
All that's left, is everything I want
And I'm slowly losing my time

Bilal,"What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit
Hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?

If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Who ever thought?
Master take the chains off me

Life can be like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
A dream's only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artists like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened what my grandmama said to me

Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Oh now, slow down

And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said

Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The convicts talk 'bout matchin', money and foreign whips
The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this?
One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it
It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my .44
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well that's me at these awards
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said

Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Oh now, slow down

Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse

Bilal,"I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

If these walls could talk

Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to forget it
Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play
And shes plays only when you tell her no

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket I’m not the guard in Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I’m just a tenant
My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Everytime I come around demolition might crush

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved I’d rather diss them
I’d rather call all you put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gon’ crush

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If your walls could talk they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the bible and god
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night
So when you play this song rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fucking on a famous rapper
Walls could talk

Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression

He stressed harder to make that bed and lock them doors

And I used to love Harold's Chicken and I dance pretty good
And I feel at home in the hood and I get lit in the club

The toughest in Cook County
They count me out 'cause I did a crime
They say it's violent time in human beings

In this big business called prison, I'm the one that's consuming
Illuminati illuminate me, fume and hate me
Mutilate me from my family, society, and loved ones
I wasn't raised to love guns, well maybe toy ones
My pops, y'all built and destroyed him
With prescriptions of poverty, dope, and unemployment
When will we see enjoyment?
I smile when my little boy get to visit for about 30 minutes
But we ain't never spent Christmas together, tryna get it together
What I'mma do when I get out? I don't know what it is to live out
Just reminiscing of the big house, I'm the one justice chose to spit out
My life story is written in a prison sentence
Wonder if this cell got room for forgiveness?
Still I love

Ability to communicate and 
To talk, and to touch chords
A man who has the ability and the audacity
And the of God to stand up, to stand up

Heard the sound of the trumpets, the voice from the throne
Seen the twenty-four elders and I knew I was home
I was told to write songs for the people
Take the original Hebrews on an Exodus of Black Excellence
Tell them to invest in us and make testaments about each other
Or how we sisters and brothers
Cover the land in corners of poems and stone
Go hard with it, let em know you God with it
Even though I authored it, let no one margin it
And make it all about paper or first weeks sales
Though this is from Heaven give 'em verses from Hell
Those that fell off the path, bring them back to the Mass
The staff can be your microphone
Your name is Common
You was born to fight the norm
Take house niggas outta darkness till they lights is on
I'm a put a hyphen on your name
Rapper-actor-activist
You the one that can reach into the black abyss
Stars this asterix, show em what a classic is
Freedom riders need passengers
And your lyrics use scriptures and passages
To make them rise like Lazarus
And resurrected again, they'll put disrespect on your name and respect it again
Every section you in, bless em and keep bussin'
If they don't like it, shake the dust and say 'fuck 'em'

Go into the wilderness like Mussa on a pilgrimage
Streets are villages, speak with diligence
And authority to fake God of pharisees and sadducees
Give them that Gardley free from the Black Odyssey
Yo pardon me, you the God bodily
Functioning on earth as a part of me
That's why I gave you artistry
Go into the hoods with the shooters and the strippers
Forget the New World Order, New Jerusalem is with us
Tell sisters they earths and goddesses
If they got bottom, don't get caught in a bottomless
Pit, there's a lot of us fit for the kingdom is near
You can tell by the wars and how the seasons appear
You'll appear in circles in Hollywood, I birthed you
And Chicago, you know how to parlay good
You'll get Oscars, Emmys, and Grammys
Give those to your family, don't get caught up in the vanity
Or the world's insanity

And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl I'm so in love with you
Girl I'm so in love with you

Yeah, yeah

Baby you were everything I ever wanted
Bottle, wedding ring it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away
So I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college
I was on the phone, we ain't no talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh
I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargin
Mr. Charmin' that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hemp for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said ""all you ever think about is sex""
I'm like oh well
You know me so well
And if this will make you lay I swear I won't tell
And every time I call your phone you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail
Well I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass what Heaven's like
When I'm in that pussy it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
That's my only chance, I better get it right

Cause I'm waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
But yes I'm waitin' right here for you, for you

Ends justify means when you making a meet
When you losing the sleep that you saying you need
But what good is rest when it's family to feed
When it's money to get, when it's dollars to count
Fuck a job, you never raised for larger amounts
Keep the lights on, front door locked
'Cause the villains in the wilderness, lotta George Zimmermans
Damned with some innocence
So that mean he still out on the prowl for a black child
While the judge and jury crack smile, Lord
Keep the lights burning

Oh, I'm coming home
I'm coming home
The road is long
The night is young
The night is young
Somewhere in America
Say, say your prayers, shine your light
For me

For me when I'm out on the creep
Do whatever to get a meal when you barely can eat
I'm determined to fight the power to further the peace
Mama scared the police might make a point out of me
'Cause it's hard to sleep living life in a daze
When kings wanna be niggas, I hope it's a phase
Queens down to be hoes as long as they paid
Chained to our oppressor, unknowing we slaves
Who wants to be saved
When they claim that the prayers that we pray go unheard
In these God-forgotten days, just in case
Keep the lights burning

For me when I barely can smile
And the sun refuse to shine when I'm out in the wild
And the raindrops tap the window pane on my room
Scared I lost faith, pray I find God soon
In a world full of alt-rights I was left field
Black man born poor, I was black steel
Black man born free, this how blessed feel
Because my dreams are dreams, don't make them less real
Nightmares are still the same thing
I've fallen from grace, wishing I had wings
Like a dunk in the Summer but I ain't had Spring
'Cause all that running from trouble'll give you bad knees
Now how can I make a move without a play
I got freedom of speech but with nothing to say
'Cause all that working for something but they barely can pay
What the glimmer of Heaven giving me every day
So I wade in the water
Filled with the sharks, snakes, gators, and piranhas
Till the higher, higher ground of the mountaintop
Away from the shooters that's down for shooting to take a shot
'Cause they believe in everything they ever heard
From the bigots and racists that twisting every word
So, a hotel balcony could be the end
Or a podium speaking to family and friends

So won't you keep that light, light, light
Keep that light, light, light, light burning for me
So won't you keep that light, light, light
Keep that light, light, light, light burning for me

I'm coming home

Justice is never color blind, never gun shy
The one crime, you may never see the sun shine
We know of one times, giving you the finger
Round hearing me, fuck you, it's not the number one sign
I hear they turning downtown to the front line
It's something like the same place but it ain't safe
They took it from the human race to a tank chase
The Devil feeding off hate so he gain weight
There's tainted waters in the well, so we can't taste
People dazed and amazed though it ain't grace
Impossible to co-exist in the same space
Enter the black saint with the war paint face

This generation, we've forsaken all that's real
What emotions do we feel?
Is your poison called a pistol or a pill?
Some people say, ""Let Jesus take the wheel""
Others say, ""Thou shall not kill""
But they don't tell me that you ain't gon' pay my bills
We've come so far yet here we are
Ruthless God, presumed inferior
We ain't scared of y'all

It ain't fair
It's hard when you're looking for love
And it ain't there
Or try to read what tomorrow holds
When it ain't clear
Because the well is running dry
Racial tensions running high
Under 21 is far too young to die
My salvation's under fire
Rising, and rising ride

Arab, Israeli, Native American Mexicans
Invested in wrestling with Willy Lynch's next to kin
The rising of the tide, noose around the necks again
Look at how they try to hide proof of all inexcellence
The only tag you know me as is Holy Swag
Through any glass window, we smash, and bro we back
It's coming fast, I'm unabashed, so we have
An awareness of the only flag that's growing fast
I guess I'm tryna minimize arrests, I identify with death
That don't mean it's not an uninvited guest
I'm just tryna answer all of my requests
And express in 140 characters or less
Why I'm the best educator, re-legislated, premeditated
Dedicated, heavy weight that ever paid it with blood
Not tuition without a cop's permission
I got a pot to piss in despite the opposition, listen

Oh, it ain't fair
It's hard when you're looking for love
But it ain't there
Try to read what tomorrow holds
And it ain't clear
Because the well is running dry
And it ain't fair
No, it ain't there
No, it ain't fair
Looking for justice and it's just us
It ain't fair
There's a riot going on out there
And it ain't fair
When your protector is your predator
It ain't fair
No, it ain't fair
No, it ain't fair
Y'all just gon' turn the other way
No, it ain't fair
Turn a bloody cheek on these bloody streets
It ain't fair
It ain't fair
It ain't fair
No, it ain't fair
No, no
No, no
No, no
No, no",It Ain’t Fair,2017
Bilal,"Peace, Peace
Everything we do is a creation
In complete harmony our creation becomes art
Everything we've ever invented stems from the human imagination
Everything we've ever invented or created that moved an era is recognized as work of genius
Science and the empirical man, philosophy and the thinker
Religion and the shaman, art and the sick who can metabolize
Everything with a trace of decay is human error
Forgivable human error the curse from the radiance to the gift which becomes a shadow
Necessary evil so to speak, or we'd have figured it out by now
Striving for perfection is a result of genius
Find peace, share your genius
See I can't see my own face without a reflection
Whether it be your reaction to my expression, a mirror, or water
I need the outside to know the inside which is where I reside
Through this understanding, I know that all things are one
According to science, everything is a wave of energy
A soundwave reaches my ear and my mind makes something of it
My eyes are receptors for another type of energy which my mind then depicts as images
Same goes for smell and touch
Time and space are tools which help me concretize these waves into information
Now when given full attention to something other than time and space, time and space disappear
I'm simply doing
Yesterday, tomorrow, here, there, Poof!
It is always now
All is energy
Even thoughts are forms of energy waves floating
Technically I'm only a vessel channeling those thoughts
My mind chooses to tune into these frequencies which I either contemplate or share with the outside
I believe we all function with the same foundation: energy, which is everything
Everything is one ocean of energy
Everything is within you
Everything is you
The identity of me is but a series of memories
In which my mind decides to narrate in order to create that feeling
Remember it is always now
The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved
In other words, energy can neither be created or destroyed
Energy only transforms
We are thus forever and death is but a blink
So I ask why hurt? Why kill? Why hate? Why fear? Why war?
Why the feelings of uneasiness if all is but a single form of energy entertaining itself?
Can the state of the world change?
Can the state of the world change?
If energy only seems to transform then why not?
It seems as if darkness has always reigned over
We live on a planet amongst the system in a dark space
A planet amongst other planets rotating around the sun in the same fashion as electrons do
Around the nucleus which form the cells, which form us
Ah, yes, all is one and, my friends, it is beautiful
Let us unify our heart, now feel your power and I thank you
Peace, forever

Snap ya fingers, do ya step
Ayyy, where we at with it?
Where you at?
What era is this?

The era of the musical beautiful mistakes
Delivered hand to hand like we slangin' the mixtapes
You tryin' to describe us you might as well get it straight
We the content creators we greater than clickbait
The passion for the culture the vultures they try to kill it
It's a war for your spirit the lyrics is here to heal us
We looking for a fountain to keep us forever young
While I get my energy from the sun, all things are one
Rollin' the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
Gettin' hung just for speakin' the native tongue
My color is my penalty mentally on the run
Photosynthesizing my energy from the sun
Releasing blockages I ain't stoppin' until they gone
Feeling weighted down like my pockets is full of stone
Until I realize I can change what's going on (Let's go!)
To every single place I go I'm right at home
I'm right at home (Let's go!)
Waiting for that day to come
Looking for fountains to keep us forever young
Get my energy from the sun
Rollin' the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
Gettin' hung just for speakin' the native tongue",Write at Home,2017

You got to be strong 
Just Stop, 'cause I really love You
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart and let love keep us together

Ain't gonna set you free now

Bilal Oliver,"Yo, we obviously need to tone it down a bit
Running round town spending time like it’s counterfeit
Everybody catching hay fever like sinuses
Step in my arena let me show y’all who the highness is
You might say I could be doing something positive
Humble head down low and broke like promises
Soaking and broken in a joke like comics is
Not enough paper to be paying folks compliments
But when that paper got low so did my tolerance
And it ain’t no truth in a dare without the consequence
Listen if it not for these hood inventions
I'd just be another kid from the block with no intentions
On the dock of that bay serving a life sentence
Even if I’m going to hell I’m gonna make an entrance
Yeah let em know I’m getting cheese like omelets is
But I’m the toast of the town like Thomas'

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I
Make it to the other side
Make it to the other side
That’s when we’ll settle up the score

Yo, we did this in remembrance of
Faces from the past we no longer have an image of
Carrying cold blood hearts that never been for love
Brothers keep going for theirs but never get enough
World travelers that seen it all and did enough
Only to return to learn the world wasn’t big enough
Damn, how long has it been? I guess the jig is up
Now all I know is I’m about to wake this nigga up
Yeah that hindsight, 20/20, now niggas dead on the money
Trying to take something from me it’s a wrap like a mummy
Undun I am becoming and when he’s tired of running
Through the layers of the onion
He’ll probably shed a tear cause they’ll be no more fast times
Just his weak mind scrolled out like a bad sign
He never had enough and got confused when they asked why
Life is only a moment in time and it passed by

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I
Make it to the other side
Make it to the other side
That’s when we’ll settle up the score

I’m sitting on top of the world ready to jump off
Thinking of various ways to breaking the law
Thinking that enough is enough but still I want more
Thinking of how I’m playing with fire that burned my young boy
By any means necessary, don’t give a damn
So every night I’m on a flight that never lands
Be an asshole when the shit hits the fan
Or bet your life on a bluff and a bad hand
Can’t win, can’t lose
Get 'em gassed, leave 'em leaking fuel
Either way the market moves
Cash rules kings, queens, prince and princess
Every night I’m crossing a line that ain’t the finish
Every thought is dark as a glass of fucking Guinness
Too far gone to come back to my senses
Now I’m on the edge of my bed making love to my meds
Every moment's like a pistol to my head
When I’m getting mine

We’re all on a journey
Down the hall of memories
Don’t worry bout what you ain’t got
Leave with a little bit of dignity
Never loved what I had
Always felt like I deserved more
But when I
Make it to the other side
Make it to the other side

Then somethin' hit my head and knocked me from my concious mind 

I'm a victim of life's circumstances 
I was raised around barrooms, Friday night dances 
Singin' them old country songs 
Half the time endin' up someplace I don't belong 

I said, Jailor, hey, what y'all got me charged with 
He looked at me and he half-way closed one eye 
He said you mean to say you don't remember 
Cuttin' up some honky with that bone-handled knife

To which I've never been before.
No sad goodbyes will there be spoken
For time won't matter anymore.

Beulah Land, I'm longing for you
And some day on thee I'll stand.
There my home shall be eternal.

He came to love, heal and forgive
He lived and died to buy my pardon
An empty grave is there to prove my savior lives

Because he lives
I can face tomorrow
Because he lives
All fear is gone
Because i know he holds the future
And life is worth the living
Just because he lives

How sweet to hold a newborn baby
And feel the pride and joy he gives
But greater still the calm assurance
This child can face uncertain day because he lives

Because he lives
I can face tomorrow
Because he lives
All fear is gone
Because i know he holds the future
And life is worth the living
Just because he lives

And then one day I'll cross the river
I'll fight life's final war with pain
And then, as death gives way to victory
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know he reigns

And each one sheds his share of tears
And trouble troubles us all
But the hurt can't hurt forever
And the tears are sure to dry

And it won't rain always
The clouds will soon be gone

And He will see you through",It Won't Rain Always,1996
Bill & Gloria Gaither,"I’ve had many tears and sorrows,
I’ve had questions for tomorrow,
there’s been times I didn’t know right from wrong.
But in every situation,
God gave me blessed consolation,
that my trials come to only make me strong.

Through it all,
through it all,
I’ve learned to trust in Jesus,
I’ve learned to trust in God.

Through it all,
through it all,
I’ve learned to depend upon His Word.

I’ve been to lots of places,
I’ve seen a lot of faces,
there’s been times I felt so all alone.
But in my lonely hours,
yes, those precious lonely hours,
Jesus lets me know that I was His own

Through it all,
through it all,
I’ve learned to trust in Jesus,
I’ve learned to trust in God.

Through it all,
through it all,
I’ve learned to depend upon His Word.

I thank God for the mountains,
and I thank Him for the valleys,
I thank Him for the storms He brought me through.

I wouldn’t know God could solve them,
I’d never know what faith in God could do.",Through It All,1996

{Chorus} God is good, yes He is. He's good all the time. God is good, you know He is. He's good all the time. You can search the whole world over, No greater friend you'll find. He's not good just once in awhile; He's good all the time. {Repeat Chorus} Now we've all had friends who've let us down. You know what I'm talking about; At the very first sign of trouble, they're nowhere to be found. Well, Jesus stays when others go; He'll never leave your side, He's your friend in stormy weather 'cause He's good all the time. {Repeat Chorus} Well, He's the one you call in the middle of the night when your body moans with pain. Don't worry about that wayward child, 'cause He heard you call his name. He'll put food in your kitchen when you don't have a dime. He's not good just now and then, He's good all the time. , {Repeat Chorus 2 Times} {Tag} You can search the whole world over, no greater friend you'll find.

If you could go with me
Back to where I started from
Then I know you would see
A miracle of love that took me in its sweet embrace
And made me what I am today
Just an old sinner saved by grace.
I'm just a sinner saved by grace
When I stood condemned to death
He took my place
Now I live and breathe in freedom with each breath of life I take
Loved and forgiven

How could I dare to claim as mine the vict'ries God has won?
Where would I be had God not brought me gently to this place?

Over silent flocks by night
Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light.

Bill & Gloria Gaither,"They didn't own a house, no crib no toys were waiting
Still they had their love for the child they were anticipating
He was born one winter night on a road between two towns
They wrapped him up so warm and tight and said
It looks like heaven's come down

There was a new star shining in the sky up above
By its light that winter night
They found peace and perfect love
If we want to find it, I know we always will
For that new star is shining for us still

He worried how to feed him on the trade that was all he knew
It was hard enough to make ends meet when they were only two
But the cold, the dark and hunger couldn't take away their joy
And she knew that they would find a way
For their precious baby boy

Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
