Brian McKnight,"Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
 
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay

From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together

So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now",Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,1998
Brian McKnight,"[Chorus]
It's Christmas, give love 'till there's peace
'Til there's more then enough
It's Christmas, give love
It's all about love
Yea, yea, yea

Today I saw a man on the street yea, yea
He was cold, he was tired
And there were no shoes on his feet yea, yea
He said can you spare a dime
It won't take you much time
'Til I can get back up on my feet
I look to heaven and pray
Day after day
I'm just trying to get something to eat

[Chorus]

And what about the woman
Who walks the night alone
With no place to sleep yea, yea
And what about the child
With a broken heart
Through teary eyes that can't really see
All they need is a hand
Someone who understands
To listen to the cry that they make
Instead of walking on by
Take a look into their eyes
And help somebody find their way

[Chorus]

Just open your heart
'Cause there's someone out there
Who's needing you now

A little love
Is something that can't be replaced
Put a smile on each face
Some how, right now

On this holiday
I don't care what people say
Put their weight upon my shoulders

[Chorus]

God so loved the world
That he gave his only son
Not just for me
Not just for you
For everyone",It's All About Love,1998
Brian McKnight,"Ah yeah
Boyz II Men, Brian McKnight
Back at ya baby
A little something for ya in '98
Y'all ready fellas
Let's turn it on for them
As a matter of fact, let's make it snow
Ya ready, here we go

[Chorus]
Let it snow, let it snow
But the fire's blazin'
Let it snow, let it snow
But the fire's blazin'
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It's just another Christmas holiday
Just me and you
The weather's stormy, but we're A-OK
And there's nothing that I'd rather do
Than lay you down beside the fireplace
No where to go
You run out of breath, I start to shake
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Chorus]

Come over here
Pretend like I'm the tree, and you are the star
You're all the present that I'll ever need
Just wanna be everywhere that you are
Hear the carolers, the sleigh bells ring
Where's the mistletoe
We feel happiness the season brings
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

[Chorus]

And oh, you are my everything
Won't ya come, won't ya come
God must have sent you down from heaven

[Chorus]",Let It Snow '98,1998
Brian McKnight,"I'm Mrs. Nat King Cole
And what a joy it's been
To be asked by Brian McKnight
To remember some of the christmas' with my husband
We were married 17 years and 15 of those years
We spent every Christmas the same way
It was God, love, and our children

And our closest friends
It was always the same menu
He got up at 5 o'clock in the morning
And with me and my children
We opened gifts

We have really, so much to remember in our family
I hope that some of you do too
I hope you will remember the love first
And then your family
It is just so important
My husband's gone

But you know something, I have his grandchildren
That's gonna be wonderful for me
But there's one line I've got to leave with you
Merry Christmas to kids from 1 to 92",Silent Night (Interlude),1998
Brian McKnight,"Ooh, ooh 
Do you ever think about me? 
Do you ever cry yourself to sleep? 
In the middle of the night when you're awake, 
Are you calling out for me? 
Do you ever reminisce? 
I can't believe I'm acting like this 
I know it's crazy 
How I still can feel your kiss 

[Chorus]
It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours 
Since you went away 
I miss you so much and I don't know what to say 
I should be over you 
I should know better but it's just not the case 
It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours 
Since you went away 

Do you ever ask about me? 
Do your friends still tell you what to do? 
Every time the phone rings, 
Do you wish it was me calling you? 
Do you still feel the same? 
Or has time put out the flame? 
I miss you 
Is everything okay? 

[Chorus]

It's hard enough just passing the time 
When I can't seem to get you off my mind 
And where is the good in goodbye? 
Tell me why, tell me why 

[Chorus]

Sing it for me 
Ooh, ooh","6, 8, 12",1999
Brian McKnight,"It's undeniable
That we should be together
It's unbelievable
How I used to say
That I'd fall never
The basis is need to know
If you don't know
Just how I feel

That I'm for real

Then I'll start back at one

It's so incredible
The way things work themselves out
And all emotional

And undesirable
For us to be apart
I never would have made it very far

Say farewell to the dark of night
I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child
Whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life
Into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the lifeline
Just in the nick of time

Can you read my mind?

Oh when I look at you
I probably should go
Cause I wanna be with you
More than you'll ever know

Brian McKnight,"Thinkin' back in time 
Someone said that love was blind 
But they were wrong 
You just choose not to see me 

When it's right before your eyes 
You'd rather compromise 
Then give your all 
Then it don't turn out 
The way it's supposed to be 

Time and time again you disappoint 
When she believes 
Just do your best 
And give her what she needs 
And 

[Chorus]
Cherish her love 
Show her she's right where she belongs 
Take care of her heart 
Before she's gone 
Cherish her love 

It might be hard to conceive 
You gotta see the forest 
Despite the trees 
Before it all burns down 

Not tellin' ya nothing you don't know 
But she'll let you have your fun 
But when a woman's done when she's done 
And then she'll go 
Just when you're needin' her the most 

Time and time again you disappoint 
When she believes 
Do all you can 
Do give her what she needs 

[Chorus] 

And if you care about the weather 
Keep her safe and warm 
Let nothing in between stand in your way 
They say it's calm inside the eye of the storm 
Together come whatever 
Come what may 
Just

Fa la la la ooh 

Do I know more than we knew then? 
Or do we know less and we just pretend 
Your brought out my heart and walked away 
Your eyes tell me more than words could ever say 

[Chorus]
Should we take a chance 
And dance the last dance? 
Should we spend the night 
One last time 
Caught up in this romance 
Or maybe wait and see, let it be 
The way that it will be 
Should we take a chance 
And dance the last dance 

How can I be wrong? 
When I feel the way I feel 
How can I deny, emotions that's so real 
In the middle of the night 
I call out your name 
Do I ever cross your mind? 
Do you feel the same? 

[Chorus]

Let me go, come to me 
Which way is the way it should be 
This is so bittersweet 
There's no way that we can love enough to show 
If we take the chance 

[Chorus]",Last Dance,1999
Brian McKnight,"Are you lonely for me? 

Sunday night  two weeks past 
The last time  I saw your face 
Our separate ways  we decided to go 
Now I find my self 
Sitting down  thinking 'bout everything 
To this place  we've come to how? 
You used to be down 
Memories of you 
And could you be thinking 'bout me right now? 

Are you lonely for me? 
(Are you lonely for me?) 
You shouldn't try to hide the way you feel inside 
Are you lonely for me? 
(Are you lonely for me?) 
Just let me make it right, and stay with me tonight 
Are you lonely for me? 
(Are you lonely for me?) 
I won't believe we're through 
Tell me what you want to do 
Are you lonely for me? 
(Are you lonely for me?) 
Hey 

There's a good in your eye 
That's a lie, I wish we could back when we first met 
How to forgive and forget 
I wish that I could have you right here next to me 
You're supposed to be in my arms 
Through stormy weather safe from harm 
Can we be down? 
Show me how, I wish I could hear from you right now 

Are you lonely for me? 
(Are you lonely for me?) 
You shouldn't try to hide the way you feel inside 
Are you lonely for me? 
(Are you lonely for me?) 
Just let me make it right, and stay with me tonight 
Are you lonely for me? 
(Are you lonely for me?) 
I won't believe we're through 
Tell me what you want to do 
Are you lonely for me? 
(Are you lonely for me?) 
Hey 

Lay it on the line 
I won't waste your time 
We can make it work 
I know we'll be fine 
Together we can start 
Never be apart again

Hey",Lonely,1999
Brian McKnight,"All you do is tell me lies
Can't you see I'm not surprised
That you think that I'm a fool
Hey
'Cause you think that no one sees
And you think you're playin' me
I just think that your confused
You're playin' you, baby

You didn't think that I would catch you
You didn't know how I knew
You didn't think your girl would tell on you
You played yourself that way

She was your bestfriend in your eyes
But she told me the flip side
Guess she wanted in my life
If you would've seen her plan
Would've known I was the man
That she desired to have
You were too blind to see

You didn't think that I would catch you
You didn't know how I knew
You didn't think your girl would tell on you
You played yourself that way

I waited
Look enough for you to throw your cards
You played it
But playin'didn't get you very far

You didn't think that I would catch you
You didn't know how I knew
You didn't think your girl would tell on you
You played yourself that way
",Played Yourself,1999
Brian McKnight,"I remember the day when 
We first met 
We both got caught in 
The rain 
And we were soaking wet 
I looked in your eyes 
You gave me a smile 
You told me your name 
You told me about 
Your career 
I told you about my hopes  
My dreams  my fears 
We had some laughs 
One month has past 
Tonight can't you stay 

[Chorus]
Now that 
The time is feeling just right 
Candles burnin' turnin' out 
The lights 
Anticipate the feelin' of 
Your skin 
Shall we begin 
Hit repeat and let the 
Music play 
Until the night turns 
Into day 
Open-up your heart and let 
Me in 
Shall we begin 

Over time 
We've gotten closer 
Than close 
You're the one 
I want to be with the most 
Neither one of us was in 
A rush 
Agreeing to wait 
Now I feel my patience 
Running thin 
Anticipating when you tell 
Me when 
The time is now 
Tell me you'll stay 

[Chorus]

We're gonna take our time 
Don't hesitate to 
Come inside 
Relax your mind 
Everything is alright 
The candlelight and you 
Just pour the wine 
We're gonna take it 
Nice and slow

Steady as we go 
Not in a hurry, no 
Till I hear you say 
That you're glad 
You stayed",Shall We Begin,1999
Brian McKnight,"It's been too long 
Since last time I saw your face 
You've been keeping it tight and everything 
Appears to be in its proper place 
We laugh about back in '94 
Reminiscing  I hoping for a little old time sake 
Can you stay? Can you stay? 

Do you want me? 
Anything like I want you 
Your body's calling 
Tell me you can hear it too 
I'm still crazy for you 
What are we gonna do? 
Can you stay? Stay? 

The night is young and 
A familiar mood fills the air 
I bought the wine and 
Run my fingers through your hair

What do you say? 

Do you want me?

I need to talk to you for a minute
I can't keep playing myself like this
There's only one thing I wanna know
Should I stay or should I go?

It's not my fault that you make yourself regret the past
But all I know is, it makes me look bad
When I'm holding your hand and you see your friends you know
And they walk away laughing
Calling me a fool

(But baby I can't) change the things you did before we met
Even though I didn't know you
(It's hard for me to) trust you even more girl, I love you
So tell me what am I to do, yeah

Nothing we do can erase the past

Should I stay or let it go?
Don't know if we're meant to be
And if we should be committed faithfully
But can you tell me, I don't know
Should I stay or let it go?

I think of the night that I made reservations just for two
But you gave your attention to someone across the room
I should have known right then that things weren't right
But I couldn't see it cause love had me so blind

(Tell me how can) I be so secure in loving you
When everybody's calling me a fool
(I can't keep holding) on to broken promises from you
And I can't take no more from you, yeah

I try to overlook the pain
And I think of losing all we had together
Girl if it takes me losing you
For happiness in me
I think that I might just have to let you go, oh

Why you playing those games huh?
I don't see how you'll do it when I walk out the door

Don't know if we will last
Nothing we do can erase the past

Baby close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on
Come and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just met me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes

So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear

There I go talking out of my head again so baby won't you
Come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby
Won't you please let me love you and get a release from this awful misery
What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Don't you understand me, oh baby please
Pull yourself together, got to do it very soon

I'll be what you make me, my darling

When my song was incomplete, you filled the empty space

[Chorus]

So now that I have seen
An angel spread its wings
Go on, lay me down
I can die now
Ever since you came around
There's a new love in town
I'm not alone
Someone's at home
Yeah

The world has yet to see

So many miles away
Heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night
I plan, sometimes I dance
Through the day

Distant lover (lover, lover, lover)
You should think about me
And say a prayer for me
Please, please baby
Think about me sometimes
Think about me here
Here in misery
Misery

As I reminisce, oh baby, through our joyful summer together
The promises we made
All the daily letters
Then, all of the sudden
Everything seemed to explode
Now, I gaze out my window
Sugar, down a lonesome road 

Distant lover (lover, lover, lover)
Sugar, how can you treat my heart
So mean and cruel
Sugar, sugar
Treat every moment that I spent with you
I treasure every like it was a precious jewel
Please, Lord have mercy

Please, come back, baby
Somethin' I wanna say
When you left
You took all of me with you
Do you wanna hear me scream
Come back and hold me, girl",Distant Lover,1999

Hold me, love me, give me all that you got
Tell me, truly, can I get in the right spot

For so long, I've waited, for you to come and love me
Don't waste my time, 'cause I need you
To let me know if you want me too
Do the things to you , that no other can do
(I want you too) I want you bad and I won't lie
And I can't deny that I want you tonight

[Chorus]

I wonder what is it that turns me on
When I'm next to you
Can't figure out why I want you 
Is it lust or love, either one will do
'Cause I want you for myself, and nobody else
(Take the place of you) of you right now
'Cause it is on, so unplug the phone
'Cause I want you to hold me

Till you 

Hold me

Sometimes I feel so all alone 
See  I gotta find me way back home 
So why don't you 
Shape me 
Make me 
Wash me whiter than the snow 
I gotta find my way 
Back home 

Master upon my knees i pray 
I just want to be the clay 
Put your arms around me 
Place my life in your hands

I know you understand 
This time I'm not letting go 
Till you 

Anoint me 
Appoint me 
Sometimes I feel so alone 
See, I gotta find my way back home 
So why don't you 
Chastise me 
Baptize me 
Wash me whiter than the snow 
I gotta find my way 

Cause I'm lost and alone 
I've been wandering 
Long enough to know 
Humbly I search for you 
And I'm not gonna rest 
Till you 

Choose me 
Use me

I can weather the storm
Never say die

I'll never lay down, mm

I'll never give up
Never give in
Never let a ray of doubt slip in
And if I fall
I'll never fail
I'll just get up and try again

Never lose faith

Upon myself I must depend
I'm not looking for place or show
I'm gonna win

Today is your wedding day and that's a beautiful thing
No use in me going into the way things used to be
How I cared for you, you cared for me and that wasn't that long ago
But I can't help but smile as you walk down the aisle
'Cause there's one thing I know, hey-hey

Every time you close your eyes at night
You know inside your heart that something ain't right
And things are not the way that you wish they could be
Even though you're with him, I know you're thinkin' 'bout me
I know you're thinkin' 'bout me, yeah

I know you think it's easier to lie to yourself
Even got yourself believing you're better off with somebody else
So you sacrifice for security
'Cause your impatient self didn't run away from me
And you settle for the first thing through the door
When you know what you want is me

Every time you close your eyes at night
You know inside your heart that something ain't right
And things are not the way that you wish they could be
Even though you're with him, I know you're thinkin' 'bout me
I know you're thinkin' 'bout me, yeah

I know he thinks you're crying 'cause it's the happiest you've ever known
But girl you'd just be lying 'cause what he doesn't know
You're strong for me, you belong to me
And here's the one last chance for you to go

'Cause every time you close your eyes at night
You know inside your heart that something ain't right
And things are not the way that you wish they could be
Even though you're with him, I know you're thinkin' 'bout me

It may not be tomorrow but there will come a day
But when you realize, I hope it's not too late
'Cause things won't be the way that you wish they could be
Even though you're with him, I know you're thinkin' 'bout me

Said I wanna get it on, do, do, do
Girl, you lookin' so fly, do, do, do
Said, I wanna get it on

Now you could search the whole globe but couldn't replace me
You skurred to face me, you don't wanna race me
Fendi fur, Cartier glasses for the blur
I'm a do it for me and let you do it for her

I got a real bad habit when I wanna grab it
So many karats in the ring I'm half man, half rabbit
Bitches be like, ""Ahh man"" when they see me with Cardin
Puffin on the green, discussin' a war plan

I used to have rock, now it's stocked with a laptop
Fat pot, a six-four with the ass dropped
With a dime daughter, dabbed in Estee Lauder
I want the new Tims so from the crib I made an order

So fuck your bitch nigga, what I wanna take
Plus she been on my nuts since thumps and pencil breaks
'Cause I'm a nigga with the hoe, a nigga with the flow
Fo' Reel nigga, pissy drunk in the Rov'

Fellas, we can get it on
Maybe even party 'til the break of dawn
'Cause the ladies are groovin' tonight
To the ladies lookin' fly
If you wanna ride them hold on tight
'Cause the fellas are groovin' tonight

Baby girl, you hear me callin' you?
Now I ain't hawkin' you, just wanna walk with you
Talk with you for a second, spit a little somethin' in that err
Whatever it takes to make you come nerr

I'm tryna' sound sincerr, ay
Baby talkin' to me but I'm starin' at her rear and I'm like ""Oh dear""
I ain't never seen nathen like you before
And you the type to make a nigga wanna open your door

And to the house up on the hill and the jag is yours
As long as you can prove that you wit' a nigga for sure
You know I'm young and a thug, so I got issues
I did them St. Louis blues, I done paid them dues, ay

But nevermind that, how 'bout we hop the next cruise
We can cash it or plastic, you choose
Get pissed out with the Cristal or the Boones
Get ya Xed out, leave ya stretched out in the room, my doom

Maybe even party 'til the break of dawn

Yo, baby girl you lookin' fly in yo' Donna K
Hopin' I could give you some love in the right way
But I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I keep it mellow, sayin' hello, you still thinkin' I'm a thug fellow

So I let you know from the get-go you thorough
You a cutie with thighs and you live for dinero
But, me and my team drop, shit overseas
Then bounce wit' the ounce that's thick and Japanese

I'm a goodfella, you know, I'm a made man
Got 'em winin' like spoiled babies in play pens
Put that ass up baby and I hit it from here
Now lick your tongue out lady and I put it in here

Let me whip that, lick that, and I don't stop
Then hit the block with my niggaz in, my new drop
Convertable, tens and dubs, no matter the weather
One-sixty on the dash, chinky eyes and leather, c'mon

Heading out to security

Now I know what they meant
When they said it's good to be the shit

All the shorty's are here tonight
Just left the shop and my wig is tight
I might not dance but baby I might
Everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus]

I don't know, where, don't know where to start
I don't know, where, don't know where to start

Tonight I broke my way in
I ain't getting here late
Look at all these fine ladies
I'm about to go blind
Look at all that dirt she's packin'
I'm about to blow a gasket
And I'm glad I brought some plastic
I can love her, I can love her
I can regain my composure
I don't want to look like Rover
OK my eye contact is over
I might contact you this time

Cause tonight, I'm living out my fantasy
My own little nasty world
Cause tonight, I gotta find me a freak
My own little nasty girl

Brian McKnight,"Some ask us how
How can we sing in a strange land
They can't seem to comprehend
They don't understand

Is from the heart
Doesn't matter how near
Doesn't matter how far

If there be one that is touched
By the things that we do
Then we're satisfied
Satisfied
And we did what we came to do

Then we'll rejoice amongst ourselves

The walking definition of a beauty queen
And every man in town wants to take her away

With a cool-aid mustache and a freckled nose
Now she's breaking hearts and taking names
But she hasn't always been this way

She didn't mean anything to me
I brushed her off so easily
She hasn't always been this way

She's outta my life
She's outta my reach
I'm outta her mind

Well her brother Bobby was my best friend
So she followed us around wherever we went
Now she won't give me the time of day

But she hasn't always been this way
When I was 16 she gave me a card
That said ""I love you with all my heart""

When I was younger, I never went too far
Held my feelings, I never even wanted to start
Til when I met you, I didn't know
What you were gonna do with my heart

When you talk. I hang on every word you say
When you move, you're like the breeze on a summer day
When you smile, the sky turns from gray to blue
That's what you do

And you're the kind of girl I think of
And you're the kind of girl I dream about
My heart is telling me I need you in my world
In my world
Cause you're my kind of lady
You're my kind of girl

When I'm not with you, wherever you are
Baby,I'm counting the moments til I'm back in your arms
All I want is to have you here with me every night, every day

When you talk, I hang on every word you say
When you move, you're like the breeze on a summer day
When you smile, the sky turns from gray to blue

And you're the kind of girl I think of
And you're the kind of girl I dream about
My heart is telling me I need you in my world

And If you're there everything will be alright
Cause this is the time for us (This is the time)

Just to save a fight you say what's right
And I know he ain't the cat that will stay in your life
Even though he gave you ice that'll make you his wife
How a man deserve you if he hurt you
How you give a woman 25 a curfew
Between me and you, you ain't heard that from me

So many karats in the ring I'm half man, half rabbit
Bitches be like, ""Ahh man"" when they see me with Cardan
Puffin on the green, discussin' a war plan

I used to have rock, now it's stocked with a laptop
Fat pot, a six-four with the ass dropped
With a dime daughter, dabbed in Estee Lauder
I want the new Tims so from the crib I made an order
So fuck your bitch nigga, what I wanna take

You know I'm young and a thug, so I got issues
I did them St. Louis blues, I done paid them dues, aye
But nevermind that, how 'bout we hop the next cruise
We can cash it or plastic, you choose
Get pissed out with the Cristal or the Boones
Get ya Xed out, leave ya stretched out in the room, my doom

Hopin' I could give you some love in the right way
But I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I keep it mellow, sayin', ""Hello""
You still thinkin' I'm a thug fellow
So I let you know from the get-go you thorough
You a cutie with thighs and you live for Dinero
But, me and my team drop, shit overseas
Then bounce wit' the ounce that's thick and Japanese

Now lick your tongue out lady and I put it in here

Constantly, patiently, taking good care,
I'll be there, you'll know I'll be there.

Made you sick, drove you crazy,

Whose mother and father is across the waters
Fighting the war that they know nothing about

We're running outta time, can't waste it, can't waste it
Have you seen the news today?
War is on the uprise, who said it was to be this way?
Lord, I know that millions won't make it, yes, Lord
This life's all I have to live and I'll gladly give it
To be one of the one's who did, thank You

Ever since creation, we've been counting down the time
From then to now and we will see, nations fighting nations
I hide the world inside my heart then I read about
Man inventing weapons of mass destruction to tear us all apart
But like the rising of the sun
We're waiting for You to come and take us away
Those of us who believe in You, believe me when I say

We're running outta time, can't waste it
Have you seen it, have you seen the news today? Guess what?
War is on the uprise, who said it was to be this way?
Lord, I know that millions won't make it, but I'm so glad Jesus
This life's all I have to live and I'll gladly give it
To be one of the one's who did

I'm gonna hang on to You, Lord
I'm gonna stay strong for You Lord, yeah
I'm gonna keep holding on, gonna keep holding on
To Your unchanging hand, Lord You know the plan
That You have for me, it's not my will
But Your way, and I'm gonna follow that way, Lord

Oh Lordy, with a made-up mind, I'm willing to go on through
I'm not gonna worry about what my friends might say
Or my friends might do, hey
I'm gonna follow You, Lord, I'm gonna follow You, Lord

If I let it all go, if my momma, if my momma don't go
If my sista don't go, if my brotha don't go
I'm going, I'm going through, Lord
If my preacher don't go, said I'm going
Oh Lordy, oh Lordy, oh Lordy
I surrender all with a made-up mind
I'm going through, oh, care

So Father, we pray right now that You hear our cries
For peace, for restoration, give us hope right now
Without You we can't make it, we've tried and we're sorry
But we look to the hills, from it cometh our help
'Cause we know our help comes from You

We're gonna hold on, I said we're gonna hold on to You
We're not gonna let go this time, Father
We're gonna trust and have faith, the size of a mustard seed

In the garden spoke to His Father for the last time (Yeah)
And Satan tried to trick Him
Said He didn't have to die

So it pleased them all to bruise Him
They beat Him in ways you never heard
And they kicked Him and they spit on Him
And He never said a mumblin word
But Lord forgive them,  Lord forgive them
For they know not what they do
And they nailed Him to the cross
And He died for me and you.
 
Verse 2
To the disciples he said whom say ye that I am
Elijah the prophet from on high or am I the Son of man
Surely thou art The Christ 
The Son of God who reigns supreme
he had to die that's why he came he came to set men free

You might as well, stay with him, Lord

Ooh they say the grass, the grass is greener over yonder on the other side
I never told you that I loved you and if I did, baby I lied
You wanna tell that it's over
Well I think you might wanna think again

Maybe you might, might as well stay with him
'Cause you don't know, you don't know
How much he loves you, needs you so

You don't really wanna be, really be with me

You know what the situation is, why you doin that?

This is a love, you're just addicted to what's addictive

Now here we go again
You're scratchin up my car, you're bustin up all my windows
You're callin my house, callin my cell phone
I shouldn'ta never gave you my number anyway
But I thought you was my friend!
I thought me and you was bigger than that, y'knahmsayin?
But you done lost all that
You might as well just lose my number and lose conversation from me, y'knahmsayin?
When you see me in public, don't say nuttin to me no mo'
Cause you tryin to wreck my life
And you know I got a lot goin on in my life right now
I got responsibilities, you understand?

[Chorus]

[Juvenile]
So what you got my name tattooed on yo' body?
I ain't tell you to go do that!
You watchin MTV and BET, that's what you want
You got a lil' piece of that and you don't know how to act
You goin crazy!
You better get your mind together because you know what this is

All the things I could've said, but didn't say to you
Should've begged you to stay,
Heard you moved on... Heard you've been doing okay
Been thinking 'bout you all the time
Do you ever reminisce? Do I be crossing your mind?
All the tears and wasted time
Nothing's been the same since you went away

Girl, I know that I... 
Used to be your man,
Used to have you here in the palm of my hand
I let you slip away, just like grains of sand

I cry myself to sleep at night
Wish I was kissing you instead of just missing you

I'm still wanting to live a lie
But in my heart I know it's just too late
It's just like standing out in the pouring rain
I refuse to believe that I'll never see you again

Its love

You're feelin' like a lucky guy
I was the same way
'Cause she was hard to come by
I was on her so hard
That I almost lost the pussy
Go head, playboy, do your thing
Don't be mad if she calls my name

[Chorus]
Walkin' 'round, sportin' her, holdin' her hand
Doin' it big like you're the man
But she was my girl
She used to be my girl
I must admit that she's a ten
Bet she didn't tell you 'bout way back then
When she was my girl
She used to be my girl

See, I know how you're feelin'
I used to be in your shoes
So calm down with the attitude
You just done met somebody new
You never know how much she's feelin' you
So be happy that you got her
Don't know much about you, dude
Sorry, I gotta break the news

She's still thinkin' 'bout me
And I'll tell you why
She couldn't even hold her head up when y'all walked by
Well
Don't go hatin' on me
It's just a game
You want her, you got her
Take her, you got her
To me it's all the same

[Chorus x 2]

Erotic, exotic, you must admit she's got it
Sexy with talent, built like a stallion
You got her, so flaunt her
Know everybody wants her
'Cause you might not be the only
So never leave her lonely


(She's still thinkin' 'bout me)
She's still thinkin' 'bout me
(And looky here)
And I'll tell you why
She couldn't even hold her head up when y'all walked by

Don't go hatin' on me
It's just a game
You want her, you got her
Take her, you got her

She used to be down with me
She used to be a freak for me
We used to hold hands
She used to understand
She used to get down with me
She used to take trips with me
She used to wiggle her hips for me
She used to lick her lips for me
She used to...
She used to...
She used to...
She used to...
She used to be my girl

Brian McKnight,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me

I'll never lay down, mm
See I promised myself that I'd never let me down

I'll never give up
Never give in
Never let a ray of doubt slip in
And if I fall
I'll never fail
I'll just get up and try again

Never lose faith

Upon myself I must depend

No, they don't lie

But once they get in-between it
They find out that it?s not the way
They hoped and they prayed it would be

The stories are so dramatic
The endings are sad and tragic
Find yourself so far away
A distance that love could not reach

It?s easy to find a someone
A mister or miss for right now
I promise you?ll never leave
Someone you can?t live without

Baby I believe it?s you
I don?t care what other people say or do
It only matters what we have is true
And I believe it?s you
Oh baby I believe

Some people say they have it
Only to find what they have is heaven
Like it came from a dream
And every cliché is true

Is it better to love somebody and lose
Than never to love somebody who
Doesn?t feel like you do
Fairytales don?t always come true

Mm
It?s easy to find a someone
A mister or miss for right now
I promise you?ll never leave
Someone you can?t live without

I don?t care what other people say or do
It only matters what we have is true
And I believe it?s you.
Oh baby I believe


How do you think I?d find love
I wasn?t sure till right now
I wasn?t ready enough till you, till you

Baby I believe it?s you

It only matters what we have is true
And I believe it?s you.

And if you ever saw it,
You would even say it glows.

Join in any reindeer games.

Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee,
""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,
You'll go down in history.""

Make it safe by night and day . . . 

Bless these walls so firm and stout, 
Keeping want and trouble out . . . 

Bless the roof and chimneys tall, 
Let thy peace lie overall . . . 

Bless this door that it may prove, 
Ever open, 
To joy and love . . . 

Bless these windows shining bright, 
Letting in God's Heavenly light, 
Bless the hearth, the painting there, 
With smoke ascending like a prayer! 

Bless the folk who dwell within, 
Keep them pure and free from sin . . .

Eating the miles down this highway

To light up the Christmas tree
Tell you the first thing that I'mma do
Holding and squeezing and kissing you under the mistletoe
Girl I've been missing you so
This is the first holiday we'll spend every night I pray that it never ends
Feels like meant to be when I have you next to me
Cant wait to have you to myself
'Cause I need you and no one else
There's no place in this world I'd rather be
You're the only present that I need
The perfect combination is Christmas you and me
The perfect combination is Christmas you

It's 11 o'clock and I'm almost home
I'm just calling to let you know
Leave on the light for me
Soon we'll make us some brie

I saw Rudolph pulling the sleigh
Donner and Blitzen too
He's got some presents for you

I see children playing in the snow
It's Christmas time and I know well that when I see you I just might melt
If you don't know by now you need to know
That I can't wait to have you to myself

See, I gotta find my way back home
So why don't you
Chastise me
Baptize me
Wash me whiter than the snow
I gotta find my way

I've been wandering
Long enough to know
Humbly I search for you
And I'm not gonna rest
Till you

Choose me
Use me

I'm on my way back home

Direct me

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.

Shit- heh, friends- heh
A friends come and go I done learned that shit
Either through death or money issues
Or you know what I mean just time and space
Family sometimes you the biggest enemies man
Heh shit

I understand, made some bad decisions in my life
I understand, raise my right hand up to God
Right where I stand
I'm a go get strong, return a better man

You better believe it you see me
How we creeped up out of Cleveland get your money baby
If not I'm gonna break even I won't let you play me
Your game ain't even season
It's that thuggish ruggish Bone I hope you know
Little be	 the reason see you creepin baby
But what are you really seekin
Are you weak, don't believe in me, believe in Jesus
I'm a freak, but baby that's for life
And all the weak I'm goin deep, and I can roll deeper than you
Half breed rock the mics to survive
And I might not make it out alive I'm spittin to save my life
Tryin a make it right welcome to the world that we live
And all that I did was crawl up out the stuff for my kids
So rest in peace to Little Eazy
But your paper work was sleazy and the black widow was horny
Baby was gettin greedy my boys is 'posed to be watching my back
Load up the guns and let's attack
But ain't nobody tryin to feel me with stack

Better bring my money baby nobody is gonna stop me
I'll fill 'em up with that hot shit
Bullets all in your body better watch me wicked posse
Yeah, automatic shotguns half of these rappers talkin
Ain't none of 'em ever popped one
Little kid from South View who would've thought that I'd make it
And the people ain't behind me my family's kinda freakish
That thuggish ruggish, nigga from Columbus
And this is the way we play spread your rumors
I just love it do it all day everyday
Ride to the rythme of the nickel put the pen in the pack now
And I know you fear me, I done been there
Done that, run that, fun that covered around
And let me kill 'em with the venom we killin 'em with the sound
Every city, every little bitty town
Everybody want to break me down
Nobody gonna take me down East 99 has been abandoned

Should a listened to my people, still runnin from demons and evil

I'm sick of the drama, sick of havin beef with my momma
And beef with my sisters my brother got murdered
Over marijuana bless the bewilders
Strugglin, hustlin all of my life, watching my back
They already tried to murder me twice
I smoke the herb that I like, I never done coke in my life
We buy but I lie if I did it I'd tell entertainment tonight
Ain't no slackin in my rack it ain't no shame in the game
It ain't no slippin and the pimpin ain't no crack on the brain
You gotta be jealous of me and my fellas
Ain't that what they tell us sell us anything
We helpless give me a little bit faq and help us
We strugglin, jugglin, thugglin, hustlin, thuggin up in the club
No one to talk to, you step on his shoes
You really fucked up, poppa you was a roller
But his pockets are all swollen, you met the dope man
And now we on the block ask who told 'em
Sell 'em  some soap man that's for all the times you played me
Old man this is your son with a blunt and a gun
Check out my slow jam

When we're all that we were
Thanks to him, thanks to her
Coming closer and closer
And closer and...

We'll be dancing again!
We'll be twirling again!

We'll be whirling around with such ease
When we're human again
Only human again
We'll go waltzing those old one-two-threes

We'll be floating again!
We'll be gliding again!
Stepping, striding as fine as you please

I'll be all that I was
On that glorious morn
When we're fin'lly reborn
And we're all of us human again!",Human Again,1991

On the road, no ETA
I'm passing through, no fixed abode
And that is why I need to try to hold on
I've got to hold on, to hold on

Was it planned as a one night stand
Or did she leave in disgrace?
Well, I never, will I ever
See my father's face, see my father's face?

And mail it right away

Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know
Let them not weep; let them know that I'm glad to go
Death is no dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you

 The rains are few beneath the blazing sun

 I lived my life on what you call your land

 Where does it end

Don't want to get drunk just to sleep at night.
My head starts spinning; a triple with wine.
Don't want to get up and go to work each day.
Come back home, on my knees, and pray
On the boulevard of broken dreams.
I wonder where you are;
Are you satisfied
To go through life with a chill in your soul,
And a memory that lives by your side?
Don't want you no more; heard enough one day.
So take me on down where that rock and roll plays.
Don't want you to vow; how could you lie?
With all my life I called you daddy,
On the boulevard of broken dreams.
I wonder where you are;
Are you satisfied
To go through life with a chill in your soul,
And a memory that lives by your side?
Don't want you no more; heard enough one day.
So take me on down where that rock and roll plays.
Don't want to get lost on a road so long.
Your legs get tired, and you fall to the ground
On the boulevard of broken dreams.
On the boulevard of broken dreams.
On the boulevard of broken dreams.",The Boulevard of Broken Dreams,1986
Brian Setzer,"You stepped in, and dark turned to light.
I knew, right there, you were the breath of life.
Just when I'd given up the fight,
I knew, right there, you were the breath of life.
Just when the morning air lost its bitter bite.
You never think your heart will butterfly.
Ballerina, don't you dance your life away.
Those years meant nothing till this cold December day.

You stepped back to say goodnight;
I knew right there you were the breath of life.
We looked up at a blinding light;
I knew right there you were the breath of life.
I never thought that I could say those words again.
I think you know the ones; I'm sure you know the ones.
I've been hiding, alone, in the night.
On and on like a dream that never ends.
So come on out; don't say goodnight.
Out of the shadows to the neon light.
Meet you down where that Dixieland plays.
Leave all your troubles; gonna dance 'em away.

Drop my hands by my side; let the hours slip away.
Don't say nothing; let the music play.
Twenty years on down when the time is right.
I'll turn around and know you were the breath of life.",Breath of Life,1986
Brian Setzer,"It's a late, cool, autumn evening,
And the sunset melts into night.
With a v-twin throbbing beneath me,
And my head's spinning alright.
Ritchie and me - we started as kids
In a rock 'n' roll band on the street where we lived.
It's a long, hard, ride till the morning.
As the trees and wind start to sing,
Chains around your heart that bind
Break away and leave them behind.
Well, once there was a time in this rock 'n' roll dream,
This, here, town would be rip apart at the seams.
Now I'm out of money, and Billy's out of work;
Eddie's pushin' pencils for the county clerk.
Everybody's job is getting pushed out of town;
Life is just knockin' 'em down.
Boyhood dreams are run into the ground.
Long, dark, shadows hang over this town.
Cast away the chains that bleed.
Break away, and I leave you free.
Take my hand, come, leave with me.
As nighttime fades away
We'll ride the hills and desert sand;
Cross the barren land.
All the families have all gone.
Their jobs went before them I'm sure.
They knocked down the corner barber shop,
And put up a super, triple level, parking lot.
There once was a time you could vote for a man
Who wouldn't try and stick a gun in your hands.
So cut out all your talkin',
And make love with me through the night.
Chains around your heart that bind.
Break away, and leave them behind.
Just leave them behind.
Just leave them behind.",Chains Around Your Heart,1986
Brian Setzer,"With that, the cold New England wind
Blowin' through my hair,
As my blood and whisky
Run through me as one.
Didn't anybody hear her silent scream?
Didn't anybody see his twisted grin?

All the neighbours wept and cried
By her shallow grave,
And her mama prayed the lord her soul to take,
And her daddy stood alone - he swore revenge.
And the haunted river flowed with blood again.

Late one night he crossed
The river by himself.
The waters surged to reach for him through the night,
And the storm raged on, and on.
On and on, and on, and on.

Everybody wondered: what ever happened to
The old reverend Brown, who preaches Sunday mass,
And the sea turned calm and blue
By the oceans door.
And the haunted river flowed with blood no more.",Haunted River,1986
Brian Setzer,"The rains never came; I saw my land die.
Maria was sleeping when I kissed her goodbye.
I couldn't stand the sound of my children cryin' no more.
You get hungry; you get mad.
A man without hope is a man that turns bad.
I'll try my luck in Texas; adios Mexico.

[Chorus]
Wipe away your tears, Maria;
There's a better life for us somewhere.
Let me see you smile, Maria;
Close your eyes; we're on our way there.

My country was a great one - once upon a time.
I wish I lived when you didn't need borderlines.
Somebody came and took the heart of my people away.
Now I ain't worried, baby, come hear what I say.
My people gonna rise again, fightin', someday.
I'll be there to see it; I'll be there to welcome them home.

[Chorus]

I saw Texas; she looked so fine.
I met some other people - same story as mine.
Laughin' and drinkin', waitin' for the sun to go down.

Shot six good men without tellin' them why.
How could anybody steal the only thing a man has left?

Waiting for the sandman to put me to sleep.

Nowhere job on a dead end street.
You ain't got a minute when the siren sounds;
Gotta get movin' to the underground.
But I gotta woman, gonna love me through the night,
Slippin' and slidin', and holding me tight.

Well, here it comes again, another Saturday night.
Pour another drink - I hope I make it home alright.
Oh boy, oh boy, gotta keep headin' for the state line.
Makin' time; gotta meet a friend of mine.
My old Ford runs fine I gotta say.
Got a new set of plugs; I wish the rain would go away.
A hundred U.F.O.'s by the Holiday Inn.
I should really go to sleep but, baby, here I go again.

Well, take me the hotel; no one's there, oh well.
Whatever happened to news on the radio?
Every little place in this little town
Looks like a bomb just leveled to the ground.

Brian Setzer,"So you think that you have found a better life then you should live
And you are through giving it all away, wish there was something I could say
By the time you looked into the mirror and saw someone else looking back
I wish I could find the words but there's nothing that even comes close
Cause there ain't nobody ever looked at me without looking right through me
There ain't nobody ever looked at me without looking right by me
And you can't go on when the knife feels like justice
When the sun dies down and the air grows cold
And the moon plays tricks through the night
But I low like a snake out of sight
All you got is no other life
You want to laugh say I'm insane
Don't ever since to come in from the rain
I don't know why I keep myself
To even try
There ain't nobody ever looked at me without looking right through me
There ain't nobody ever looked at me without looking right by me
And you can't go on when the knife feels like justice
Slip away
Slip away
Slip away
So you think that you won me over
By setting me on fire
When the sound of your beating heart
And your burning heart desire
By the time I looked at your reflection and saw someone else lookin back
It's a shame things happened that way cause there's no one that even comes close
And there ain't nobody ever looked at me without looking right through me
There ain't nobody ever looked at me without looking right by me

You can act real wild they don't treat you like a child

All the love that we made must disappear
And who made the rule
That the one who is cruel won't cry the tears
Well we woke up unsatisfied
Got out of bed and said goodbye
But don't leave me here dyeing on the cross of love
Don't leave me here dyeing on the cross of love
I got down on my knees and prayed to the lord above
Don't leave me now don't you realize
You can't make out of love a sacrifice
Don't leave me here dyeing on the cross of love
Who pays the cost
If the love that is lost goes unredeemed
And why should I care
If this cross that I bare is destiny
My heart was pure my love was strong
Forgive me if I've done you wrong
But don't leave me here dyeing on the cross of love

Love like ours must learn to play,play a waiting game,
And live just for the flame;

Bendin' low at the people's feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street

When I asked him while he shined my shoes
How'd he keeps from gettin' the blues
He grinned and he shook his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said

""Get rhythm, get rhythm when you get the blues
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock n' roll, feel it in your bones
Tap on your toes and just get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues""

""[Incomprehensible] get rhythm when you get the blues
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock n' roll feel it in your bones
Tap on your toes and just get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues""

Well, I stopped to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was gonna jump for joy
Slapped on the shoe polish, left and right
He took a shoeshine rag, and he held it tight

He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
""You're a mighty little boy to be a workin' that way""
He said, ""I like it"" with a big wide grin
And he kept on poppin' and he said again

""Get rhythm, get rhythm when you get the blues
[Incomprehensible] get rhythm when you get the blues
Well, a jumpy rhythm make you feel so fine
[Incomprehensible] all the troubles from your worried mind
Get rhythm when you get the blues""

'Cause you make me feel
Yeah, you make me feel
So shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time (Touched for the first time)

Like the one in me
That’s O.K.
Let’s see how you do it
Put up your dukes
Let’s get down to it

Hit me with your best shot
Why don’t you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away

Na na na come on
Na na na na na, come on, come on, come on

'Cause I may be bad but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it

Sex baby,
Let’s talk about you and me
Let’s talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be
Let’s talk about sex (Alright)
Let’s talk about sex (A little bit, a little bit)
Let’s talk about sex, baby

Baby, all through the night, I’ll make love to you,
Like you want me too

(And I) And I guess it’s just the woman in you,
That brings out the man in me
I know I can’t help myself
You’re all in the world to me

It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time
It feels like the first time

It’s going down fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me collab creations bump, like acne
No doubt, I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch, a dog couldn’t catch me, straight up
Tell me who could stop when Dre making moves, attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers (Shorty get down)

Good Lord
Baby got them open up all over town
Strictly biz she don’t play around
Cover much ground got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can’t get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby

(Girl)I like the way you work it,
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby,

I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms
 
First the tide rushes in, plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side like the oncoming tide 
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?
At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace 
I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms",Ebb Tide,1997
Brian Smith,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love",I'm in the Mood for Love,1997
Brian Smith,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1997
Brian Smith,"Unforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more

And forever more, that's how you'll stay
That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Unforgettable,1997
Brian Smith,"It's like a diamond ring
It's a precious thing
And we never want to lose it
It's like a favorite song that we love to sing
Ev'ry time we hear the music

And we're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
We're in this love together
And like berries on the vine
It gets sweeter all the time

It's like a rainy night and candlelight
And ooh, it's so romantic
We got the whole thing working out so right
And it's just the way we planned it

And we're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
We're in this love together
And like berries on the vine
It gets sweeter all the time

Don't you know we're in this love together

And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears 

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 

You must have known that I was lonely

Brian Smith,"Once there was a holy place
Evidence of God's embrace
And I can almost see mercy's face
Pressed against the veil
Looking down with longing eyes
Mercy must have realized
That once His blood was sacrificed
Freedom would prevail
And as the sky grew dark
And the earth began to shake
With justice no longer in the way

[Chorus:]
Mercy came running
Like a prisoner set free
Past all my failures to the point of my need
When the sin that I carried
Was all I could see
And when I could not reach mercy
Mercy came running to me

Once there was a broken heart
Way to human from the start
And all the years left it torn apart
Hopeless and afraid
Walls I never meant to build
Left this prisoner unfulfilled
Freedom called but even still
It seemed so far away
I was bound by the chains
From the wages of my sin
Just when I felt like giving in

Sometimes I still feel so far
So far from where I really should be
He gently calls to my heart
Just to remind me

Brian Spence,"I remember the times when we'd fight
For a slice of cake
And my mother would slap us
For breaking the kitchen plates
And I hated the days

In those little green suits
Man did I feel ashamed
But Momma said remember
Blood's thicker than water

[Chorus]
So brothers don't drift apart
Sons of your mothers
Sons of your fathers' heart
Don't drift apart
Now it don't matter when

I can call them at three am.
And they may curse at first
But I know they're sure gonna listen
I've had some really good friends
But time always breaks the bond
But all my brothers are there
When everyone else has gone

She had a smile that made the devil cry

Today's the day, you can bet on that

Nothing left here that we should fear, I suppose.

A single thread in a tapestry

though its color brightly shines

can never see its purpose

in the pattern of the grand design

and the stone that sits up on the very top

of the mountain's mighty face

does it think that it's more important

than the stones that forms the base

So how can you see what your life is worth

or where your value lies

ohhhh, you can never see through the eyes of man

you must look at your life

look at your life through heaven's eyes

lai-la-lai...through heaven's eyes(2X)

A lake of gold in the desert sand

is less than a cool fresh spring

and to one lost sheep, a shepard boy

is greater than the richest king

should a man lose everything he owns

has he truly lost his worth

or is it the beginning

of a new and brighter birth

So how do you measure the worth of a man

in wealth or strength or size

in how much he gained or how much he gave

the answer will come to ya

to look at his life through heaven's eyes

lai-la-lai...through heaven's eyes(2X)

and that's why we share all we have with you

though there's little to be found

when all you've got is nothing

there's lots to go around

No life can escape being blown about

by the winds of change and chance

and though you never know all the steps

you must learn to join the dance

you must learn to join the dance

lai-la-lai...through heaven's eyes(repeat until fade)

And I shake my head
And it's only the giving 
That makes you what you are",Wond'ring Aloud,2002
Brian Thomas,"When you're falling awake
And you take stock of the new day
And you hear your voice croak
As you choke on what you need to say
Well, don't you fret, don't you fear
I will give you good cheer

Life's a long song
Life's a long song
Life's a long song
If you wait then your plate I will fill

As the verses unfold
And your soul suffers the long day
And the twelve o'clock gloom spins the room
You struggle on your way
Well, don't you sigh, don't you cry
Lick the dust from your eye

Life's a long song
Life's a long song
Life's a long song
We will meet in the sweet light of dawn

As the baker street train spills your pain
All over your new dress
And the symphony sounds underground
Put you under duress
Well, don't you squeal as the heel
Grinds you under the wheels

Life's a long song

How we feel today
Last night sipped the sunset
My hand in her hair

We are our own saviors
As we start
Both our hearts beating life
Into each other

Will the years treat us well
As she floats in the kitchen
I'm tasting the smell

Of toast as the butter runs

Spilling crumbs on the bed

But your beauty is so magnificent
I'm just tempted to touch ya know
Yo babe, just a meks sha a gwaan now?

Would you be offended if I told ya
I like the way you lick your lips?
Would you be offended if I showed ya
How I like to work those hips?

Is it a rude for me to wink
And let you know I like what I see?
Would you be offended if I touched ya?
Imagine how it could be

You're like a jewel baby, this ain't no pick up line
Epitome of a lady, truly one of a kind
Wear a precious diamond with all them polish shine
Can't wait to hold you closer, can you read my mind?

Clear images for which I won't apologize
I hope that you can see the passion in my eyes
Won't over step our boundaries, these words are hard to find
Stated my intentions, hope you my way inclined

Tell me if I'm wrong expressing how I feel
How can I go on if I don't know the deal?

Would you be offended if I told ya
I like the way you lick your lips?
Would you be offended if I showed ya
How I like to work those hips?

Is it rude for me to wink
And let you know I like what I see?
Would you be offended if I touched ya?
Imagine how it could be

No need to be embarrassed, I know you feel the same
You feel my record, can I say this ain't no player's game?
You feel the spark between us, come let's ignite the flame
'Coz if you let it pass we'll only have ourselves to blame

Showing you a world of pleasure, that's my only aim
I wanna take ya to the clouds and let you scream my name
This is your decision, baby, stake your claim
Take a chance 'coz if you don't then it would be a shame

Tell me am I'm wrong expressing how I feel?
Can I go on if I don't know the deal, hey?

Would you be offended if I told ya
I like the way you lick your lips?
Would you be offended if I showed ya
How I like to work those hips?

Is it a rude for me to wink
And let you know I like what I see?
Would you be offended if I touched ya?

Imagine yeah, ya mi gal I know ya unno nah udda
Walk a king stone an keep a singing, I muss suggesting dis?
Show you babe, I'm feeling this is right, that's right
Don't be lonely baby, come with mi tonight
Babe, show me, show me the best time of my life, I love ya

Now would you be offended if I told ya
I like the way you lick your lips?
Would you be offended if I showed ya
How I like to work those hips?

Is it rude for me to wink

That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

Brought such a flame to me

And let it die

It will remind my heart of your goodbye

Will come back to me
In others eyes, its you I see
If I love again
Though its someone new

If I love again
It'll still be you
In someone else's firm embrace
I'll close my eyes but see your face

In the morning and started to laugh

There's a bump in the basement

There's a knocking on the wall

In the pumping of the pistons

I swear I heard your call

There's a bump in the basement

There's a hole in the floor

There's a guard in the garden

Locking up the door



There's a rumble in the floorboards

No shutting out the sound

And the workers are below me

Digging underground

Feel the building all around me

Like a wrap of armoured skin

But the more we are protected

The more we're trapped within



Tell it like it is

Till there's no misunderstanding

When You strip it right back

Man feed machine

Machine feed man


Tell it like it is

Till there's no misunderstanding

Make up what you like

Man feed machine

Machine feed man

Brick by brick

Brick by brick

Brian Turner,"I said, fuck em all, motherfuck 'em all
Y'all done turned a good guy into a Chuckie doll
I would've been your friend till the end bitch
Guess there ain't no friends in this shit bidness
Just a bunch of assholes in the shit bidness
But they won't flush me down the toilet bowl without my tissue
These bitches talk shit out the same mouth they kiss you
These niggas kiss ass with the same mouth that dis you
Ew, you niggas disgust me
And they ain't talkin' bout shit unless they discuss me
Let's talk about how, I'm killin' everything I touches
Or how I walked in this game with no crutches
No Diddy, No Dupri, No Dr. Dre
No Cash Money from Baby and no rocs from Jay
And I'm still here
We still here
What does this break dude?
It's still here
And dude talk, concernin' New York
When I was runnin' the city you was learnin' to walk
So I watched you niggas take they first steps
And I was happy for ya, daddy was clappin' for ya
But, wasn't for me prolly wouldnt've happened for ya
So I rest my case
I'm a rappin' lawyer
That's unless you wanna talk bad bitches
Section full of bridezillas, that's mad bitches
No words, I describe em with letters best
They pretty as can be, curvy as the letter ""S""
They keep it G, they sweet as T
Look good in the passenger seat of V
They ride double R, smell like double C
The Bags are L.V., D, or a double G
Fly as hell, shades wire cell
On E, sippin' P.J., high as hell
And please don't even talk about swag
I'm cool and collective
A Fool with perspective
I'm far from being typical my respect is reciprocal
I already came up
You still on the zipper pull
And I would say my style is 5th Fab meets Brooklyn
I keep the hood watchin', I got the streets lookin'
They watch what I do, so they know what to do
Lil money never told big money what to do
Money talks, if u speak guapanese
A language better known if you gettin cheddar holmes
If not get a loan, use that like Rosetta Stone
And that way you can holla bout a dolla
I hear em cryin' broke, they holla like a toddler
Come holla at yo gualla, don't holla at sovallas
You'll end up down under tryna holla at Koalas
I keep that nine on me, Ala Iguodala
We can get it jumpin like the drolics on Impala
I feel like Neno lettin em rock wallas off the colla
Somebody tell me something, What the fuck happened?
Somebody talk to me, muthafuck rappin
They infiltrated the game, but who let in the pookies?
Kingpins is snitchin' that shit is not lookey
So fuck new friends unless they stay solo
Cause who gon' watch you back after you kill Manolo?
Isn't it ironic Santana's own fella stabbed him
The king of New York die while I yellow cabbed him
No Carlito's way
When I spot a hater drop him like a hot potato
You ahead, got me later

I shook your mood with the game and a bottle of beer.
The day I fell off of the wagon you threw up your hands in disgust.
Once again you just get the best of me.

Remember you loved to be held, how you loved to be touched.
And anxiously laughed at my jokes just a little too much.
When I was so careful of cursing while you were still nursing your beer.

Now it's a shame but I know that there's really no use for a brand new convertible.
A mile to your parents', a mile to the store.
Turn in our bottles for 10 cent deposits I'll drink us two dollars more.

I don't recall anyone placing a gun to our heads,
We traded a trip 'round the world for a family instead.
Our friend's were dispersing while you were still nursing our boy.

And I knew things had changed when the pet names that you once gave me we soon gave to the pets.
But I still come when you call them just to be sure. 

Now there's really no use for a neighborhood cheerleader.

In fact some of your things went out the door.

The only words that make me feel better 
Are saying that it's over.

Slipped on the velvet curtains, the ones that you had custom made.
Then you went away and then you went away.
And there's my new best friend, the one you took in as a stray.
Then you went away and then you went away.

Guess it's not over yet,
'Cause when I'm ready to forget
I remember where I am.

'Cause there's a photograph that you had put up on display. 
Then you went away and then you went away.
And there's a box of letters that had me thinking you would stay.
Then you went away and then you went away.
And there's a coffee table you said would not be in the way.

Where I married you

I wish you weren't the one to leave me stranded

Were left there by the smile that went without a trace

Well I will be there,
We'll get you back to that place

Brian Vander Ark,"Who's the very muse for the first drawings in a cave?
Who inspired the requiem that sent him to his grave?

I bet it was someone, I bet it was someone, someone like you.

The recipient of Vincent's ear that left him traumatized,
Who was wrapped in blue leaving Gershwin rhapsodized?

I bet it was someone, I bet it was someone, someone like you.

When I go to bed at night, pray to God that I
Create a masterpiece that's worthy of your ears and of your
Eyes and immortalize you and I
For someone who inquires about the girl where every inspiration lies.

Lennon wrote Please Please Me well before they came stateside.
McCartney wrote for no one but I'm pretty sure he lied.

He wrote it for someone, he wrote it for someone, someone like you.

And if I should die, God forbid that I 
Pass away with ideas left in limbo in creative purgatory.
And the day that you pass away, 
No one knows that girl happens to be the very girl where every inspiration lay.

Heaven help the world when you're no longer for our eyes.
Heaven rain the colors down to form another prize.

Brings another belly full of butterflies.
I'm just a child of Jesus,
A stage for my confessions.

Have joints they hide among their cigarettes.

Left enough to buy a ticket.

And trade their wars for encores.

Hangs in midair.
There's an answer, 
I know it's out there.

Will anyone be aware
When confetti falls on my empty chair?
Like a one, two punch,
A surprise attack come at dawn.

Will they miss me when I'm gone?

Everyday,
The search seems necessary.
A final play,
A desperate hail mary.

There's so many things that I may have missed.
I hope the answer is as simple as this.
Will my friends be brave 
'Till someone plays my favorite song?

Will they miss me when I'm gone?

Where imitation is just limitation in disguise.
Sell our souls because the rock just rolled over and died.

The monumental ache you had.
A game of conscience, tug of war

In a future five years from now
I'm one hundred and twenty pounds
And I never get hung over
Because I will be the picture of discipline
Never minding what state I'm in
And I will be someone I admire
And it's funny how I imagined
That I would be that person now
But it does not seem to have happened
Maybe I've just forgotten how to see
That I am not exactly the person that I thought I'd be

And in my mind
In the faraway here and now
I've become in control somehow
And I never lose my wallet
Because I will be the picture of of discipline
Never fucking up anything
And I'll be a good defensive driver
And it's funny how I imagined
That I would be that person now
But it does not seem to have happened
Maybe I've just forgotten how to see
That I'll never be the person that I thought I'd be

And in my mind
When I'm old I am beautiful
Planting tulips and vegetables
Which I will mindfully watch over
Not like me now
I'm so busy with everything
That I don't look at anything
But I'm sure I'll look when I am older
And it's funny how I imagined
That I could be that person now
But that's not what I want
But that's what I wanted
And I'd be giving up somehow
How strange to see
That I don't wanna be the person that I want to be

And in my mind
I imagine so many things
Things that aren't really happening
And when they put me in the ground
I'll start pounding the lid
Saying I haven't finished yet
I still have a tattoo to get
That says I'm living in the moment
And it's funny how I imagined
That I could win this, win this fight
But maybe it isn't all that funny
That I've been fighting all my life
But maybe I have to think it's funny
If I wanna live before I die
And maybe it's funniest of all
To think I'll die before I actually see
That I am exactly the person that I want to be

Fuck yes

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star

The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

Brian Willoughby,"The village square stands quiet
The curfew still enforced
The streets are even clear of dogs and whores

Like some evil bird of prey
The scaffold spreads its wings
The people build their fires and bolt their doors

The mayor is giving dinner to the officers’ wives
His eldest son is learning how to fawn
The barrack block is hushed and tense
The soldiers drawing lots
Who will be the hangman in the dawn?

The lot falls on a young man
Who has served for but a year
His home is in the village close nearby

He shivers at the thought of what
He’s forced to do next day
He wonders who it is, who has to die?

And the full moon casts a cold light
On the gloomy prison walls
The papist walks his cell, he cannot sleep

He hears the waiting gallows creaking
Just beyond that door
He prays for he has no more tears to weep

The day begins to break
A muffled drums begins to sound
A crowd begins to gather in the square
The presence of the hangman in his terrifying mask

Weighs heavy on the minds of all those there
The colonel reads the sentence
Which the papist knows by heart

He has failed to show allegiance to the King
His crime is thus with God himself
And in His name he must hang
The papist, head held high, says not a thing

The jailer binds his hands
And puts his blindfold to his eyes
He leads him through the door before the crowd
The hangman sees his victim

And the blood drains from his face
He sees his younger brother standing proud
The hangman tries to protest
But is ordered to proceed

His trembling hands begin to take the strain
His eyes are blind with streaming tears
And he cries for all to hear

Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Oh, please forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name
Forgive me, God, we hang him in Thy name

Brian Willoughby,"The hillside was a patchwork quilt 
Neatly stitched with tidy hedge 
And crumbling grey stone wall 
The trees were bare, but Spring was near 
To conjure up its endless strings 
Of green magic handkerchieves 

Could you only see what I've seen 
You would surely know what I mean 
I think I must have caught a glimpse of heaven. 

A string of diamonds formed a stream 
That tumbled down the daunting cliff 
To sparkle bright on the beach. 

New born lambs that sweetly played 
Speckled eggs all newly laid 
But for you I would have stayed 
I think I must have caught a glimpse of heaven

Take you to the movie show
Watching arm in arm
Used to hope the film would work its charm
Then

You and I we'd saunter home
Far behind the crowd
Linger longer than your ma and pa had allowed
Never in love before

We couldn't wait to be alone
To beat it to the Ocean View Cafe
That was our hideaway
Summer in Monterey

Monterey oh Monterey
Monterey oh Monterey
I would love the crazy world to always stay that way
Ocean breeze

Breaking seas
Out on the rocks around the windy curving bay
Summer in Monterey
Ocean breeze

Breaking seas
Out on the rocks around the windy curving bay
Summer in Monterey",Summer in Monterey,1995
Brian Wilson,"Van Dyke Parks
This town goes down at sunset
When the hills start turning red
The streets roll up at eight o'clock
Everybody goes off to bed
Everybody goes off to bed

There's someone callin' someone names
You can hear a screen door slam
A car goes skatin' down the road
Everybody gets out of bed
Everybody gets out of bed

You took the key to my heart's door
And you set off on your own
I shook it off as a passing phase
Everybody must come back home
Everybody must come back home

This town gets up at daybreak
When the hills start turnin' blue
A whistle blows a rooster crows
Everybody's got things to do
Everybody's got things to do",This Town Goes Down at Sunset,1995
Brian Wilson,"Rain come down for days makes such thunder
This old house can't take that much more
And it just might take you and me under
Makin' such a great commotion
You could hear the clatter
Put the pots and pans on the floor
And just let it pour

In the tintinnabulation
You can hear the rain as it (rains?)
The whole wide world in great jubilation
Underneath the pitter patter
Say it doesn't matter
Somethin' say you feelin' ok
And just fly away

On the wings of a dove
You bring me my love
She's singin' so sadly
Wings lifting my love
She's drifting above
The push and the shove
On wings of a dove

Rain come down to wash away sorrow
This whole town is covered in gray
God let it rain my nights to tomorrow
Someone here in tribulation
Say does it matter
Someone say you feelin' OK
On one rainy day

On the wings of a dove
She's singin' of love
The thing we need badly
Things I wish I had
When she seems sad
I would sing gladly
On wings of a dove

Do do you
Do you
Do do you
Do you

On wings of a dove",Wings of a Dove,1995
Brian Wilson,"Sleep little baby don't you fret 
Mamma's going to say a little prayer 
Then mamma's going to get some masking tape 
To fix the hole in the ozone layer 

Sleep little angel, baby dove 
Sun's gone down, it's getting late 
Mamma's got her chicken soup of love 
For the bad old world is sick with hate 

Wish that I could give you child 
All the beauty I have seen 
Mamma's going to sing you a melody 
That you can hum when you're alone 

Now you're in your cozy bed 
Sleep little angel, drop of mud 
There's a journey in your head 
And desert winds blow in your blood 

Wicked wold and wicked world 
Howling in the moonless sky 
But mamma's here to fend them off 
Hush little baby, don't you cry",Lullaby,1995
