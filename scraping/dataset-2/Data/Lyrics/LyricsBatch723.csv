Michael Moore,"Men of good fortune, often cause empires to fall
While men of poor beginnings, often can't do anything at all
The rich son waits for his father to die
The poor just drink and cry
And me I just don't care at all

Men of good fortune, very often can't do a thing
While men of poor beginnings, often can do anything
At heart they try to act like a man
Handle things the best way they can
They have no rich daddy to fall back on

Men of good fortune, often cause empires to fall
While men of poor beginnings, often can't do anything at all
It takes money to make money they say
Look at the Fords, but didn't they start that way
Anyway, it makes no difference to me

Men of good fortune, often wish that they could die
While men of poor beginnings want what they have
And to get it they'll die
All those great things that live has to give
They want to have money and live
But me, I just don't care at all

Men of good fortune
Men of poor beginnings

Michael Moore,"All your two-bit friends they're shootin' you up with pills
They said that it was good for you, that it would cure your ills

I don't care just where it's at
I'm just like an alley cat

And when you're filled up to here with hate
Don't you know you gotta get it straight
Filled up to here with hate
Beat her black and blue and get it straight

Do, do, do, do, do, do,
When you're lookin' through the eyes of hate

All your two-bit friends they're ask you for your autograph
They put you on the stage, they thought it'd be good for a laugh

But I don't care just where it's at
'Cause honey I'm just like an alley cat

And when you're filled up to here with hate
Don't you know you gotta get it straight
Filled up to here with hate
Beat her black and blue and get it straight

Uh huh

Oh Jim, how could you treat me this way
Hey hey hey
How could you treat me this way?

Oh Jim, how could you treat me this way
Hey hey
How could you treat me this way?

You know you broke my heart
Ever since you went away
Now you said that you love us
But you only make love to one of us
Oh Jim, how could you treat me this way
You know you broke my heart
Ever since you went away
When you're looking through the eyes of hate
Oh, oh, oh, oh
When you're looking through the eyes of hate
Oh, oh, oh, oh ...

Michael Moore,"Staring at my picture book
She looks like Mary, Queen of Scots
She seemed very regal to me
Just goes to show how wrong you can be

I'm gonna stop wastin' my time
Somebody else would have broken both of her arms

Sad song, Sad song, Sad song, Sad song

My castle, kids and home
I thought she was Mary, Queen of Scots
I tried so very hard
Shows just how wrong you can be

I'm gonna stop wasting time
Somebody else would have broken both of her arms

Sad song, Sad song, Sad song, Sad song
",Sad Song,2016
Michael Moore,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
The spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me

Michael Morabito,"Hey I've been watching you
Every little thing you do
Every time I see you pass
In my homeroom class, makes my heart beat fast
I've tried to page you twice
But I see you roll your eyes
Wish I could make it real
But your lips are sealed, that ain't no big deal
Cause I know you really want me
I hear your friends talk about me
So why you tryin' to do without me
When you got me
Where you want me

(Hey Juliet)
I think you're fine
You really blow my mind
Maybe someday, you and me can run away
I just want you to know
I want to be your Romeo
Hey Juliet

Girl you got me on my knees
Beggin' please, baby please
Got my best DJ on the radio waves saying
Hey Juliet, why do you do him this way
Too far to turn around
So I'm gonna stand my ground
Gimme just a little bit of hope
With a smile or a glance, gimme one more chance

Cause I know you really want me
I hear your friends talk about me
So why you tryin' to do without me
When you got me
Where you want me

For us to hang together

Michael Morgan,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2008

Schau nur in die Luft
Und ich hab das Gefühl,
Du gehst grad vorbei
Ich bin so allein,
Will mit Dir zusammen sein

Wenn Du mich mit einem anderen Mann
Spazieren gehen siehst
Und ich lach in an,
Dann ist da nichts dran
Grad ich tu Dir nichts an,
Will mit Dir zusammen sein

Mir wird heiss, wenn ich an Dich denk
Du hast mir von Anfang an Liebe geschenkt
Komm von Dir nicht los,
Sehnsucht ist zu groß,
Will mit Dir zusammen sein

Ich bin einsam - Zeit vergeht nicht mehr
Seit wir auseinander sind - sind Nächte endlos leer
Freunde sind zwar da,
Doch nichts ist wie es war,

Michael Murphey,"She came to me, said she knew me
Said she'd known me a long time
And she spoke of being in love
With every mountain she had climbed

And she talked of trails she'd walked up
Far above the timberline
From that night on I knew I'd write songs
For Carolina in the pines

There's a new moon on the fourteenth
First quarter, the twenty first
And the full moon in the last week
Brings a fullness to this earth

There's no guesswork in the clockwork
On the worlds part or mine
There are nights I only feel right
With Carolina in the pines

When the frost shows on the windows
And the wood stove smokes and glows
As the fire grows, we will warm our souls
Watching rainbows in the cove

And we'll talk of trails we've walked up
Far above the timberline
There are nights I only feel right
With Carolina in the pines

",Carolina in the Pines,1975
Michael Murphey,"She comes down yellow mountain 
On a dark flat land she rides
On a pony she named Wildfire
Whirlwind by her side
On a cold Nebraska night

Oh, they say she died one winter
When there came a killing frost
And the pony she named Wildfire
Busted down his stall
In a blizzard she was lost

She ran calling Wildfire
She ran calling Wildfire
She ran calling Wildfire

By the dark of the moon I planted
But there came an early snow
There's been a hoot owl howlin' by my window now
For six nights in a row
She's coming for me I know
And on Wildfire we're both gonna go

We'll be riding Wildfire
She ran calling Wildfire
She ran calling Wildfire

On Wildfire we're going to ride her
We're gonna leave sod bustin' behind
Get these hard times right on out of our minds
Riding Wildfire",Wildfire,1999
Michael Murphey,"When the train pulled into the station
He slicked back his hair, rosined up his bow
Fiddle upside-down, Orange Blossom Special
If you want to make a living then you've got to put on a good show

When he smelled the smoke and the cinders
Rolled his sleeves up, opened up his case
Played Cherokee Fiddle, played for the whiskey
Good whiskey never let him lose his place

He was always there playing for the miners
Devil's Dream was a tune they all understood
Then he'd go home to Oklahoma
And wait 'till the trains were runnin' and the weather was good

When he smelled the smoke and the cinders
Rolled his sleeves up, opened up his case
Played Cherokee Fiddle, played for the whiskey
Good whiskey never let him lose his place

Now the Indians are dressin' up like cowboys
And the cowboys are puttin' leather and turquoise on
And the music gets sold by the lawyers
And the fools who fiddled in the middle of the stations are gone

Some folks say they'll never miss them
Fiddle screeched like the engine break
Ol' Cherokee Fiddle gone forever
Like the sound that the whistle on an old locomotive make

So when you smell the smoke and the cinders
Slick your hair back, open up your case
Play Cherokee Fiddle, play for the whiskey
Good whiskey never lets you lose your place
No, good whiskey never lets you lose your place",Cherokee Fiddle,2013
Michael Murphey,"They put Geronimo in jail down south
Where he couldn't look a gift horse in the mouth

Sergeant, Sergeant, don't you feel
There's something wrong with your automobile?
Governor, Governor, now aint it strange
They didn't have no cars on the Indian range?
Warden, Warden, listen to me
Be brave and set Geronimo free

Whoa, boys, take me back
I wanna ride in Geronimos Cadillac

Warden, Warden, don't you know
That prisoners have no place to go?
Took Old Geronimo by storm
Ripped off the feathers from his uniform

But life goes on
And this old world will keep on turning

Michael Nesmith,"Know that something very strange
Is happening to my brain.
I'm either feeling very good
Or else I am insane.
The seeds of doubt you planted
Have started to grow wild
But feel that I must yield before
The wisdom of a child

And it's love you bring,
No that I can't deny,
With your wings,
I can learn to fly,
Sweet young thing.

People try to talk to me
Their words are ugly sounds
But I resist all their attempts
To try and bring me down..
Turned on to the sunset,
Like I've never done before.
And I listen for your footsteps
And your know upon the door.

And it's love you bring,
With dreams of bluer skies

When I seem them in your eyes

Michael Nesmith,"I had twenty-one miles of road to go 
And fifty-four miles of dirt
There was a cold steel gleam 
In the night
I was trucking along
Down interstate five
Looking for the turn
When something snapped
And I suddenly changed my mind

I said bye bye bye
Oh, I finally took a stand
Then for the very first time
I felt like a man

So I headed on down to Mexico
I was never going back to work
Yes I had enough cash
To last me there for years
And then I cabled my folks
I said call my boss
And you can tell him
Where I left the truck
And then I went out and stocked up
On enchiladas and beer

I said bye bye bye
Whoah I finally took a stand
Then for the very first time in my life
I felt like a man, like a man man man man

Well now that all happened back in 1961
And I never went back to work
And then in 1964 I started living
Off the land
And the people back home
Still talk about me
Just running off without a word
But me and the beer
And the Mexican sunshine
We don't give a damn

Whoah no no no
I said bye bye bye
Whoah I finally took a stand
Now for the very first time
I feel like a man, a free man

Lingering and still, while quietly they tell their all
Blue is the color of the sun
And nothing stops when everything is done

Now my whole world opens up in different rhymes and tunes
With the highways making up the verse
And then suddenly I see the light of something called the moon
And though my path is planned, it's not rehearsed

So I move along to the next thing on the list
Knowing full well that some of them just don't exist
But I am finally alone

Michael Nesmith,"Tonight when he hands you the keys to the car
And he says you can drive, some, but don't drive too far
Tonight when she tells you you're her only one
Remember the morning brings on the sun

And they're watching you stumble and fall
Until you're lost down below like them all

Today when they give you their words of advice
And tell you you're free, friend, as long as it's nice
Today when their words of sweet wisdom come down
Remember their smiles are hiding their frowns

And they're watching you stumble and fall
Until you're lost down below like them all

If you say you're their friend, I'm afraid you will learn
They want only friends they can have on their terms
But the love that you show them will give you an edge
For authority is more than wearing a badge

And you'll be watching them stumble and fall
Until they're lost down below like them all
Until they're lost down below like them all

I saw precious things come into view
And I pored through the files taken off my mental shelf
And dusted off some memories of you
Then I thought about the time when our affair was green
How the phoenix of our love first flapped its silken wings
All the urgency and passion
Of each new day as it happened
And how it all mellowed as it grew

I remembered the times when our laughter would explode
And how you would turn to hide your smile
And the hours of silence while a perfumed candle glowed
And both our thoughts meandered on for miles
I remembered the times I said I really had to go
And I remembered the tears that filled your eyes
Then I touched your hand and told you
That it really was a lie
And though you never knew it dear 
I cried

Well it's amazing how time can so softly change your ways
And make you look at things that can't be seen
And how the years that roll by can start you listening 
Not just to what they say
But what they mean

So forgive me my dear if I seem preoccupied
And if the razor edge of youth-filled love is gone

But how its shown

Michael Nesmith,"Tell me,
Just one more time the reasons why you must leave,
Tell me once more why you're sure you don't need me,
Tell me again but, don't think that you'll convince me.

Now you've said,
Before falling in love again you'd rather be dead,
'Cause when someone breaks your heart, you cry your eyes red,
But there's nothing so hard about the life that you've led.

As far as I can see,
There's no reason for goodbyes,
You're just running scared,
And that's something I won't buy.

So you lose,
I won't let you go with nothing to show but more blues,
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news,
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you.

So I headed on down to Mexico
I was never going back to work
Yes I had enough cash
To last me there for years
And then I cabled my folks
I said call my boss
And you can tell him
Where I left the truck
And then I went out and stocked up
On enchiladas and beer

I saw precious things come into view
And I pored through the files taken off my mental shelf
And dusted off some memories of you
Then I thought about the time when our affair was green
How the phoenix of our love first flapped its silken wings
All the urgency and passion
Of each new day as it happened
And how it all mellowed as it grew

I remembered the times when our laughter would explode
And how you would turn to hide your smile
And the hours of silence while a perfumed candle glowed
And both our thoughts meandered on for miles
I remembered the times I said I really had to go
And I remembered the tears that filled your eyes
Then I touched your hand and told you
That it really was a lie
And though you never knew it dear 
I cried

Well it's amazing how time can so softly change your ways
And make you look at things that can't be seen
And how the years that roll by can start you listening 
Not just to what they say
But what they mean

So forgive me my dear if I seem preoccupied
And if the razor edge of youth-filled love is gone

Not just in how it's shaped
But how its shown

I heard a voice inside of me
It said, ""You lost the light
And now you're moving through the night
Running from the grand ennui

That was never one second behind
I knew the horse that I was running at the Southern Talladega
Had won for the twenty-second time

And put a jeweled hand on my knee
I knew I'd lost the light
And I was moving through the night
Running from the grand ennui

Well that night passed in a blaze of glory
With the countess and the car both mine
And each day passes with the same old story
But the countess has a brand new line

And distant memory

Michael Newman,"Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

Getting late
I just can't wait
Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink, then I smoke
Start the car, and I try to make the midnight show

Get up
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

Movin' fast, doin' ninety five
Hit top speed but I'm still movin' much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive
I hear my song playin' on the radio
It goes

Get up
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock
There's a truck ahead, lights starin' at my eyes
Oh my God, no time to turn
I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die
Why

Get up
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get up
Everybody's gonna leave their seat",Detroit Rock City,2007

I know it's crazy but it's true

The best that you can do (the best that you can do)
The best that you can do is fall in love

All of his life his master's toys
And deep in his heart
He's just he's just a boy
Livin' his life one day at a time
He's showing himself a really good time

Oh, why don't you take it?
Oh no, no, I couldn't​
Why not?
Are you sure?

I bought this glove a thousand years ago
For some birthday or some Christmas that has come and gone
I thought we might play catch or, I don't know
But he left it in the bag, with the tag still on

You'll have to break it in though, first 
You can't catch anything with it that stiff​

How do you break it in?

Shaving cream?

Oh yeah you rub that in for about five minutes, 
Tie it all up with rubber bands, put it under your mattress, and sleep on it
And you do that for at least a week, every day, consistent​

And though this method isn't easy
Every second that you spend is gonna pay off
It'll pay off in the end

It just takes a little patience
It takes a little time
A little perseverance
And a little uphill climb

You might not think it's worth it
You might begin to doubt
But you can't take any shortcuts
You gotta stick it out

And it's the hard way
But it's the right way
The right way to break in a glove

With something like this, you gotta be ready to put in the work, 
Make the commitment 
So what do you think?

I mean, definitely​

Some people say just use a microwave
Or try that run it through hot water technique
Well, they can gloat about the time they saved

Why should I start to break in pieces?
Why should I go and fall apart for you?

Why should I play the grieving girl and lie

And that my world has gone dark without your light?
I will sing no requiem tonight

Leaving these broken pieces behind you
Everything wasted, nothing to say

No, no one mourns at all

Don't tell me that it wasn't black and white
After all you put me through
Don't say it wasn't true
That you were not the monster
That I knew

Michael Parks,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,
Michael Parks,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams

Michael Parks,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know

Michael Parks,"This glove's really cool, wow
Oh, why don't you take it?
Oh no, no, I couldn't​
Why not?
Are you sure?

I bought this glove a thousand years ago
For some birthday or some Christmas that has come and gone
I thought we might play catch or, I don't know
But he left it in the bag, with the tag still on

You'll have to break it in though, first 
You can't catch anything with it that stiff​

How do you break it in?

Well, it's all a process that is really quite precise
A sort of secret method known to very few
So, if you're in the market for professional advice
Well today could be a lucky day for you

Shaving cream

Shaving cream?

Oh yeah you rub that in for about five minutes, 
Tie it all up with rubber bands, put it under your mattress, and sleep on it
And you do that for at least a week, every day, consistent​

And though this method isn't easy
Every second that you spend is gonna pay off
It'll pay off in the end

It just takes a little patience
It takes a little time
A little perseverance
And a little uphill climb

You might not think it's worth it
You might begin to doubt
But you can't take any shortcuts
You gotta stick it out

And it's the hard way
But it's the right way
The right way to break in a glove

With something like this, you gotta be ready to put in the work, 
Make the commitment 
So what do you think?

I mean, definitely​

Some people say just use a microwave
Or try that run it through hot water technique
Well, they can gloat about the time they saved
'Til they gotta buy another glove next week

It just takes a little patience (it just takes a little patience)
Takes a little time (takes a little time)
A little perseverance (perseverance)

And a little uphill climb
And it's the hard way
But it's the right way
The right way

'Cause there's a right way in everything you do
Keep that grit
Follow through 

Even when everyone around you thinks you're crazy
Even when everyone around you lets things go
And whether you're prepping for some test
Or you're miles from some goal
Or you're just trying to do what's best
For a kid who's lost control

You do the hard thing
'Cause that's the right thing
Yeah, that's the right thing

Connor was really lucky to have a dad that
Uh, a dad who cared so much about
Taking care of stuff

Shaving cream, rubber bands, mattress, repeat
Got it?

But it's the right way

Michael Patrick,"Anything we should know about your change? 
She was a level headed dancer on the road to alcohol
And I was just a soldier on the way to Montreal
Well, she pressed her chest against me
About the time the jukebox broke
She gave me a peck on the back of the neck
And these are the words she spoke

Blow up your T.V., throw away your paper
Move to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try to find Jesus on your own

So I sat there at the table and I acted real naive
'Cause I knew that topless lady
Had something up her sleeve
Well, she danced around the bar room
And she did the hoochy-coo
She sang her song all night long, tellin' me what to do

Blow up your T.V., throw away your paper
Move to the country, build you a home
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches
Try to find Jesus on your own

Well, I was young and hungry and about to leave that place
When just as I was leavin', well she looked me in the face
I said, \""You must have the answer\""
\""She said, \""No but I'll give it a try\""
And to this very day we've been livin' our way
And here is the reason why

We blew up our T.V., threw away our paper
Moved to the country, built us a home
Had a lot of children, fed 'em on peaches
They all found Jesus on their own

Michael Paynter,"I remember the time, when I was searching my mind
Just to find out if I ever define who I am,
Could I ever afford to consider being more,
I was sure that I saw all the world, but I keep wishing for more,
So I keep checking my direction, watching my own reflection,
And I'm still, still in connection with the way I wanna be,
Did I behave, 'cause I've been stuck here for days,
I'm in a daze, had the chance to be your savior but I threw it away

What if I dive off the edge of my life and there's nothing beneath?
What if I live like there's nothing to lose just to die on my knees?
At least I know, I walked the door, I took the scars, I risked it all,
And learned to love the fall.

I could never see how it hurts, to feel the worst,
I'll never make it, even though how it hurts,
That I won't be that type of guy that never tried,
That never took a chance, or took his moment to fly to be free,

You may be of the opinion that I'm making a wrong decision,
That I'm giving up the chance to live my life in your vision,
But I can't give up, no I won't give up,
Until you see that okay is never ever enough

What if I dive off the edge of my life and there's nothing beneath?
What if I live like there's nothing to lose just to die on my knees?

Don't take to drinking boy that road don't lead no where   
And don't you ever let me hear you swear

Something for nothing leaves you hell to pay so don't buy into it

I finally faced the fact that I am hooked on you
There's nothing more that I can do  Ain't no use
Cause every time I see your angel face
My halo disappears without a trace  I swear

But I don't care

So in time, she found a dance floor
And some arms to hold her tight

Ain't it sad, ain't it funny, how a man can be so wrong
He tried to buy her love with money
He could've had her for a song

She wanted him...but what a shame
He didn't realize
Love can never stay the same
It either grows or dies
What made him think his duty was to place her high above
He married her for beauty, she married him for love

A few of my ol' drinking buddies will be droppin' by
They'll come to celebrate my graduation
After eight long years, of higher education

So here's to me
I finally passed the bar
As I drove by that ol' honky tonk
Still tuggin at my heart
I never dreamed that neon night school
Would ever be so hard
I can't believe at last
I finally passed the bar

I've got an awful lot of memories, that I can't recall
But I know from those old stories
I must have had a ball
With the money that I spent on my tuition
(What would you do hoss)
Well I could retire and spend the rest of my life fishin'
(Oh well)

Here's to me
I finally passed the bar
As I drove by that ol' honky tonk
Still tuggin at my heart
I never dreamed that neon night school
Would ever be so hard
I can't believe at last
I finally passed the bar

I was first in my class
To the bottom of a glass
But it was killin' me
I used to get loaded
But now I've been voted
Most likely to succeed

Work week drove me out of my mind
Now it's outta sight
Got till Sunday to do things our way
Here's how it's gonna be
I'll follow you out on that floor, if you'll follow me

We're gonna get lost in the shuffle
It's gonna be an all night, hold tight, feels right now kind of scuffle
An invitation to dance on the double
Let's start a little trouble, baby let's get lost in the shuffle

Gonna take my chance with a little line dance
Baby put your hand in mine
Oh let me sweep you off your feet
Leave your blues behind
Every time you swing me girl you know it brings me
Two steps closer to fun
You just tell me what to do, I'll show you how it's done

Everybody's wavin' good-bye to Joe
His wife called, last call...he's gotta go
Kinda brings a tear, to every single guy
I admire his dedication, he's a family man
Thirteen years had a ring on his hand
Kinda makes me wonder, if I should give it a try

Well I would if I could, but I can't so I won't
They're sayin' I do, I'm sayin' I don't
I won't regret it, one single minute
'Cause love's great when you're not in it

No curtains on the windows, just a couple sheets
TV dinners, my life is complete
Ain't no one more committed...I love the single life
If I want to, I can put on my cleanest dirty shirt
Stay out all night for better or worse
Just look what I'd be missin', if I had a wife

Well I would if I could, but I can't so I won't
They're sayin' I do, I'm sayin' I don't
I won't regret it, one single minute

If you had asked me, I'd have told you
There ain't nothin' I don't know
Like no matter how I hurt her, I just knew she'd never go
Up until the day she left me, I'd have sworn I'd never crawl
Well it's amazing just how much I've learned
Since I thought I knew it all

Figured she'd be much too frightened, to make it on her own
So I was sure that she'd come cryin'
After just one night alone
I kept waitin' by the telephone, so certain she would call
It's amazing just how much I've learned
Since I thought I knew it all

I never knew a broken heart
Could turn you inside out
I didn't know, that I didn't know
What love was all about

If she came walking through the front door
There's a million things I say
Like ""I love you"" and ""I missed you, please don't ever go away.""
And if you would just forgive me
I'll be at your beck and call

Is hitting home a lot more clearly
As our love slowly dies each day
You say this love ain't worth reviving
There's no chance of us surviving

I know you're sayin' that there's no hope

Working late and chasing the wildlife
Living like two hard headed fools
It's really not too big a mystery

The talk all over town says we are through

You were all she ever wanted, that was once upon a time
She was all you ever needed, that's what makes it such a crime
How you took her heart for granted, how you threw her love away
Now you still don't understand it, if you did, you'd never say

What did you expect a girl as good as her to do?
What do you think would make that woman go find somebody new?
She's not too good to be true
She's just too good to be true to you

Just because she never said so, doesn't mean she didn't see
Every time you stole an apple off somebody else's tree
Late last night that lipstick letter she left on the bedroom door
Said ""You don't get it, and you ain't gonna get it anymore!""

This bar has been my home away from her
Used to be, she was missing me
Now she's moving in with her best friend
And I'm the only one who wants what used to be

I'm here because today I lost it all
I didn't want to drink at home alone
I just can't believe all my hopes and dreams are falling
Like a row of dominoes

I thought the man behind the bar
Had heard it all before
My story must have caught him by surprise
'Cause when he handed me my double
There were tears in his eyes
You know you're in trouble
When the bartender cries

He said, ""Last night you swore you'd never drink again""
I said, ""Next time, I'm really gonna try""
So if she ever calls for me
Oh, you can finally tell her, ""He ain't here""
And it won't be a lie

I asked the man behind the bar
What he'd been crying for
He said, ""That bottle used to be a friend of mine
Now I've stopped drinking doubles
But I pour them all of the time
Son, you know you're in trouble
When the bartender cries""

As I saw my own reflection staring back at me, I knew
Every single word he said was true

Well, I told the man behind the bar
I thought I'd seen it all before
Till I saw the sadness in his eyes
That's when I put down my double
And said my last goodbyes

When the bartender cries
Oh, you know you're in trouble

My motivation is from thirty pointers, VVS
The furniture my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But its what smile that's got these onlookers spectating

Where the hustlers move bricks
And the gangsters bang hammers

Impressive reasons fill the caverns of my mind
No celebration for the people that I didn't know
Connected even though there's nothing left to find

There's more than I can see and there's a deeper part of me
Won't you be my inspiration help me end my desperation now

Tell me what it is I'm meant to do
I've fallen to my knees
I've shed away my tears
And lost my destiny
I sit beneath the sun
My hands held to the sky
I cannot ask a question
But still I wonder why

Poetic justice never seems to make the world feel right
Chaotic voices in the darkness call your name
You turn away from me whenever I remind you
Of the day the sun saw through the lies exposing all the pain

Michael Rappaport,"Go right to left, left to right
Middle passage connection
Yeah, about to build
Tell you which way to go

We go right to left, left to right
If you fight to the death, what's left to fight
Yo, here we go

I want to write away
I want to write here
I want to write brave words to fight fear
Write dreams and nightmares
Might scare the folks stuck in the day
But nothing to say
Well I'm way ahead by light years
So beware we keep the lights on
I want to write the songs from right to wrong
Right on
Riding the light so you see in the dark
So deep you gotta be still like your beating heart
My words apply the pressure to make the bleeding stop
See the art, living right, eating smart
I want to right to life, a right to death
Police read your rights from right to left
But I never write to remain silent
I fight through police line
Cops walk the beat that I write to
I teach minds, write rhymes with the right sound
Right now, journalists write up
I write down

Party people put a hand in the sky
Grab a cloud and squeeze til no man is dry
We wet it up, go ask the people if they plannin to die
Can't stay to live, consumers is plannin to buy
Smoke death operators is standing by
They take you order for the slaughter of the family why
Do they make it so hard for a man to provide
You better get wit it, or stand to the side

And the story line goes on
Right to left, who's right who's wrong
Fuck the politics and pride
I just to try to stay alive
To witness where the battle lines are drawn
Speak my mind and sing my song
I'm passin on the moral y'all
This is ain't play
True, you got to know the way
It's hard now
Open eyes
See hopeful lives
Sing it now

Making my way through life
Talking to elders and taking advice
Ignoring their words and paying the price
Living in the world where false preachers got us praying to Christ
Get with the young girls in the choir and laying the pipe
No control of our soul we all wait at the light
So comfortable they we hating to fight to make it right
Late at night I'm controlled by the DJ on the mic
I love hip-hop and every joint he playing is tight
A day in the life is a brick in the foundation of like
A maze in Egypt amazing when I'm creating a sight
For the world to behold and the story to last
So one day ghetto children can visit their glorious past
After Pac and Notorious past what do we have
Niggas worth more when they dead, it's so sad
Started with the slavery we finish the plan
But I broke the cycle, and became a man

Party people put a hand in the sky
Grab a cloud and squeeze til no man is dry
We wet it up, go ask the people if they plannin to die

I could kick up some dust on the road anywhere
But then again I’d just wish I was here

Or that fight song, 4th and long under Friday night lights
Take me back to glory days, any place, any year

On a pin drop quiet drive with a tear in every seat

Drink one for me, and remember why
I'm doin' what I'm doin' when you raise 'em high

Somewhere in the static in a half a world away
There's a tired voice on the phone sayin', ""Everything's okay""

Head on out to Flat Rock point and drop a couple lines
The say I'll get home soon, but 'til I do""

With Alabama license plates
Blarin' old school ""Purple Rain""
A little buzz helped me get her name
She was two rooms down from mine
And we turned room 309
Into a party every single night
Until the week ran out and we said goodbye

Now I wonder what that girl from spring break's doin' now
Is she back in Alabama, two kids and a house?
Or did she move to Cali like she said she was gonna?
Underneath the peer on a beach in Daytona?
I wonder if she smiles when she looks at the tattoo we got that night
'Cause God knows I do every now and then, catch myself thinkin' about
What the girl from spring break's doin' now

And every kiss tasted just as sweet

Michael Ray,"Sometimes that lake got angry, as the lightnin' went and crashed
Sometimes it was so still, it looked like a sheet of glass
But it washed away our beer cans, and it washed away our sins
It talked us out of all our clothes, and begged us to jump in

There was magic in the summer water
Learned to swim in the summer water
All the small town sons and daughters
Were baptized a thousand times
Built fire by it like an altar
Gave it every song we could offer
Memories float on it like a bobber
Out there on the summer water

When a heart was broken, it was better than a church pew sanctuary
A lot of long kiss, rocks skip, sun drenched orange crush bottle caps got buried
It's where you spend your first night with your first love before the mercury starts fallin'
It's where you spend the last with your first love, before somebody goes to college

The prelude to a bright new year
Quite a night, I'm impressed

Well, one does one's best
Here's to us
The toast for the city
What a pity that the Phantom can't be here

Masquerade! Paper faces on parade
Masquerade! Hide your face so the world will never find you
Masquerade! Every face a different shade
Masquerade! Look around, there's another mask behind you

Flash of mauve, splash of puce
Fool and king, ghoul and goose
Green and black, queen and priest
Trace of rouge, face of beast, faces

Take your turn, take a ride
On the merry-go-round in an inhuman race
Eye of gold, true is false
Who is who?

Curl of lip, swirl of gown
Ace of hearts, face of clown, faces
Drink it in, drink it up till you've drowned
In the light, in the sound but who can name the face?

Masquerade! Grinning yellows, spinning reds
Masquerade! Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you
Masquerade! Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade! Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you

Masquerade! Seething shadows breathing lies
Masquerade! You can fool any friend who ever knew you
Masquerade! Leering satyrs, peering eyes
Masquerade! Run and hide, but a face will still pursue you

What a night! What a crowd!
Makes you glad
Makes you proud
All the crème, de la crème

Watching us, watching them
All our fears are in the past
Three months of relief
Of delight, of Elysian peace

And we can breathe at last
No more notes, no more ghost
Here's a health, here's a toast
To a prosperous year

To our friends who are here
And may the splendor never fade
What a blessed release
And what a masquerade

Think of it, a secret engagement
Look, your future bride, just think of it
But, why is it secret? What have we to hide?
You promised me, no, Raoul, please don't, they'll see
Well then let them see, it's an engagement, not a crime

Christine, what are you afraid of?
Let's not argue
(Let's not argue)
Please pretend

When the heart gets weak
And the road get's long

And in the thunder of the midnight sky
Is something stronger than the heart of steel
It's a power you can touch and feel
So when you think that all your hope is gone

Give me signs that I can follow
Set feet upon the road 
And may he who walked on water give me courage where I tread

I bow my heart? I bow my will

Take my Life? Take my will?

And as I think about Your love for me

And exalt Your name

It's no good unless he loves you, all the way

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Was tinged with the sadness

Of a great love for me.

Again, I was wrong.

And only last year, everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore.

Old King Cole was a merry old soul
And a merry old soul was he
So he called for his pipe
And he called for his bowl
And he called for his fiddlers three

But the clock, tick-tock
On the mantlepiece
And I want, and I feel, and I know, and I touch
The walls

She's a lady, she's got time
Brush back your hair and let me get to know your face
She's a lady, she is mine
Oh, brush back your hair and let me get to know your flesh

I've been waiting here for so long 
And all this time that passed me by 
It doesn't seem to matter now 
You stand there with your fixed expression 
Casting doubt on all I have to say
Why don't you touch me, touch me
Why don't you touch me, touch me
Touch me now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now",The Musical Box,2014
Michael Rutherford,"Walking across the sitting-room, I turn the television off
Sitting beside you, I look into your eyes
As the sound of motorcars fades in the night time
I swear I saw your face change, it didn't seem quite right
And it's hello babe, with your guardian eyes so blue 
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true

Coming closer with our eyes, a distance falls around our bodies
Out in the garden, the moon seems very bright
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand
And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?

I've been so far from here
Far from your warm arms
It's good to feel you again
It's been a long long time
Hasn't it? 

I know a farmer who looks after the farm
With water clear, he cares for all his harvest
I know a fireman who looks after the fire

You, can't you see he's fooled you all
Yes, he's here again
Can't you see he's fooled you all?
Share his peace, sign the lease
He's a supersonic scientist
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man
Look, look into my mouth he cries
And all the children lost down many paths
I bet my life you'll walk inside 
Hand in hand
Gland in gland 
With a spoonful of miracle
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary
We will rock you, rock you little snake
We will keep you snug and warm

Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest
We walked across the fields to see the children of the West
But we saw a host of dark skinned warriors standing still below the ground

Waiting for battle

The fight's begun, they've been released
Killing foe for peace, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
And they've given me a wonderful potion
'Cause I cannot contain my emotion
And even though I'm feeling good
Something tells me I'd better activate my prayer capsule

Today's a day to celebrate, the foe have met their fate
The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord

Wandering in the chaos the battle has left
We climb up the mountain of human flesh
To a plateau of green grass, and green trees full of life
A young figure sits still by a pool
He's been stamped ""Human Bacon"" by some butchery tool
He is you

Social Security took care of this lad
We watch in reverence, as Narcissus is turned to a flower
A flower? 

If you go down to Willow Farm
To look for butterflies, flutterbyes, gutterflies
Open your eyes, it's full of surprise
Everyone lies like the fox on the rocks
And the musical box
Oh, there's Mum and Dad, and good and bad
And everyone's happy to be here

There's Winston Churchill dressed in drag
He used to be a British flag, plastic bag, what a drag
The frog was a prince
The prince was a brick, the brick was an egg, the egg was a bird 
(Fly away you sweet little thing, they're hard on your tail) 
Hadn't you heard? (they're going to change you into a human being!) 
Yes, we're happy as fish and gorgeous as geese
And wonderfully clean in the morning

We've got everything, we're growing everything
We've got some in, we've got some out 
We've got some wild things floating about 
Everyone, we're changing everyone
You name them all, we've had them here
And the real stars are still to appear
(All change!) 

Feel your body melt
Mum to mud to mad to dad 
Dad diddley office, Dad diddley office
You're all full of ball
Dad to dam to dumb to mum 
Mum diddley washing, Mum diddley washing
You're all full of ball

Let me hear your lies, we're living this up to the eyes
Ooh, aah, na-na-na 
Momma I want you now

And as you listen to my voice
To look for hidden doors, tidy floors, more applause
You've been here all the time
Like it or not, like what you got
You're under the soil (the soil, the soil)
Yes, deep in the soil (the soil, the soil, the soil!)
So we'll end with a whistle and end with a bang 
And all of us fit in our places

With the guards of Magog, swarming around
The Pied Piper takes his children underground
Dragons coming out of the sea
Shimmering silver head of wisdom looking at me
He brings down the fire from the skies
You can tell he's doing well by the look in human eyes
Better not compromise, it won't be easy

666 is no longer alone
He's getting out the marrow in your backbone
And the seven trumpets blowing sweet rock and roll
Gonna blow right down inside your soul
Pythagoras with the looking glass reflects the full moon
In blood, he's writing the lyrics of a brand-new tune

And it's hey babe, with your guardian eyes so blue
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?
I've been so far from here, far from your loving arms
Now I'm back again
And babe, it's gonna work out fine

Can't you feel our souls ignite?
Shedding ever-changing colours
In the darkness of the fading night
Like the river joins the ocean
As the germ in a seed grows 
We have finally been freed to get back home

There's an angel standing in the sun
And he's crying with a loud voice
""This is the supper of the mighty one""
Lord of Lords, King of Kings
Has returned to lead his children home
To take them to the new Jerusalem",Supper's Ready,2014

Remember the darkness my friend
It's the same as the fool
Remember your will
It's with you till morning
Till the life's reborn

Looking for the fight of her life
In the real time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy

Locking rhythm to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She had danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
if the fight becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard won place of mystery,
Touch it but can't hold it

You work all your life, for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push shove world
But there's always a chance

Michael Sembello,"Just a cow, just a cow, just a cowboy from the good
Just a cowboy from the good side

Drinking whiskey and talking loud
Rough neck riders they were shooting up the town
A tall dark stranger he made a stand
Grabbed his gun and took the law into his hand

Eyes on fire he rose slowly from his chair
Walked outside and weighed the danger in the air
Seven bullets had the names of seven men
When the smoke cleared he's the only one to stand

[Chorus]
Just a cowboy from the good side
On a page that they left out of history
Just a cowboy from good side
And no one knew his name

He was the hero then it all went black
Out of nowhere someone shot him in the back
But on windy nights when the cactus blooms
You'll see his silhouette against the moon

[Chorus x2]

He was a cowboy of yesterday
Torn from the tales of an age

Just a cow, just a cow just a cowboy from the good
Just a cowboy from the good side

Just a cow, just a cow just a cowboy from the good
Just a cowboy from the good side

Well the trees are screaming and the sky explodes
The branches are ripping at my clothes in the jungle

side Screaming for Godzilla
Will this nightmare ever end?
This is real, it's not pretend
You can't run and you can't hide

Well, the buildings are falling and the city is hot Mothra and 'Zilla are

Crushing the cars and smashing the planes in the struggle

Childhood sweethearts
The neighborhood had all agreed
That we would succeed
With infinite passion

We were so innocent then
Everyone's favorites
Never a moment apart
Waiting for the love
To grow between us

Then one day a cold wind blew
The love got so much older
I didn't see the problem in time
And suddenly it was over

It's over
It's over
It's over

Marriage came quick down the line
The families applauded
Three kids and ten years today
Trying to live the way
They all imagined

Now we're like everyone else
Stripped of the magic
The distance that love could not reach
Higher than the night
As sure as daytime

People seem to fall in love
They're sorry when they're sober
I never dreamed it would end like this
So suddenly it was over",It's Over,1983

Looking for the fight of her life
In the real time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy

Locking rhythm to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light

When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife

And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

It's a hard won place of mystery

And falls over stones on its way

The air is tense and black
Is all I see
Through eyes once bright

Now a broken soul
With no way to cope

And watch my bones turn to dust
No sound just silence 
Without a sense that I can trust

I am the damned 
Swimming through the echoes
The abomination within you
I am the wretched 
Suffocating silence
And I will always be a part of you

I can feel the hope 
So sweet so foreign in here
My desperate hands
Finding nothing but air
The moment is fading 
Along with the feeling 
I'm falling now
Yet I know not where 

I am the damned 
Swimming through the echoes

Been tryin' hard to understand

Michael Stewart,"Come follow the band wherever it's at
Let both of your feet beat time to the drum
And let your heart go rat-a-tat-tat

A flag in your hand, a plume in your hat
Battalions of brass pass and catch the light
Is there a sight that's sweeter than that?

See the pretty lady toss that baton high
Ain't she cute as a Daisy?
Watch the fella with the big base drum go by
Ain't you glad that you stayed?

Hear the tuba play that 'Oom Pah Pah'
Oh my, ain't it driving you crazy?
Don't you be so darn lazy
Better hurry and join that big parade

Up outta your seat, down off-a the stand
Step out to the sweet, beat  the bugle plays
A sound that you'll remember all your days
And when you see that leader proudly raise his hand
Just follow the band

Hear the trumpet blast, heat the cornet blare
Hear the boom of the bass and the rattle of the snare
With the sweetest burst of melody I know goes the piccolo

Hear the silver tone of the xylophone
Hear the glide and the bellow of the slide trombone
Then a burst of crystal, listen to it peel, it's the glockenspiel

With the most majestic manner
You'll remember all your life
Comes mellophone, comes saxophone
Comes sousaphone, comes fife

Then the brass sings out the woodwinds sigh
The trumpets shout and the drums reply
With a crash and a bang as the whole she bang goes by

See the pretty lady toss that baton high
Ain't she cute as a daisy?
Watch the fella with the big base drum go by
Ain't you glad that you stayed?

Hear the tuba play that 'Oom Pah Pah'
Oh my, ain't it driving you crazy?
Don't you be so darn lazy
Better hurry and join that big parade

Up outta your seat, down off-a the stand
Step out to the sweet, beat  the bugle plays
A sound that you'll remember all your days
And when you see that leader proudly raise his hand
Just follow the band

Mother says there'll be no work next year
Qualifications once the Golden Rule
Are now just pieces of paper

Doesn't mean I'm lazy
Just because you're going forwards
Doesn't mean I'm going backwards

In last year's trousers and your old school shoes
The truth is son, it's a buyer's market
They can afford to pick and choose

Just because you're better than me
Doesn't mean I'm lazy
Just because I dress like this
Doesn't mean I'm a communist

I don't know what I'm going to do
But I've come to see in the Land of the Free
There's only a future for the chosen few

Just because you're better than me
Doesn't mean I'm lazy
Just because you're going forwards
Doesn't mean I'm going backwards

At twenty one you're on to of the scrapheap
At sixteen you were top of the class
All they taught you at school
Was how to be a good worker
The system has failed you, don't fail yourself

Once there was blue sky with white clouds high above 
Once they were part of an everlasting love 
We were the lovers who strolled through green fields 

Green fields are gone now, parched by the sun 
Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run 
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart 
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart 
Where are the green fields that we used to roam?

I'll never know what made you run away 
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?
I only know there's nothing here for me
Nothing in this wide world left for me to see

It could be me

And the love you want forever, will they be true to you

Michael Stuart,"Soñé que la perdía, es verdad dónde estás chiquitica
Dónde estás fui con la gitana, a preguntarle dónde se ha metido
No, no, no quiero fingir, me siento como morir sálvame,
Búsquela en su bola de cristal, o deme alguna pista sensorial,
O dígame el hechizo para hallarla.

Cuenta gitana por favor, dónde busco a mi corazón
Mis palmas te dicen la razón, o cuentan de mi dolor
Y ya lo sé, por pobre me desprecias no hay razón,
Yo te brindo un gran corazón si puedes escúchame,

Oh! mi amor dame una oportunidad
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, liara
Oh, oh oh, no, no, no, no yo te doy sinceridad,
Yo te doy felicidad, vuelve ya,
Eres una luna impenetrable

Quizá la luna me valga en pedazos quizá la muerte 
Me pise los pasos por pobre estoy sufriendo tus 
Rechazos quizá es una palabra que no pienso más vivir.

Hey, Girl! This can't be true,
How am I supposed to exist without you?

How will I live. How can I go on.

É tentar te entender e não ser entendida
É ficar com você
Procurando fazer parte da tua vida

É tentar desculpar o que não tem desculpa
É fazer dos teus erros
Num motivo qualquer a razão da minha culpa

Minha estranha loucura
É correr pros teus braços quando acaba uma briga
Te dar sempre razão
E assumir o papel de culpada, bandida
Ver você me humilhar
E eu num canto qualquer, dependente total do teu jeito de ser
Minha estranha loucura
É tentar descobrir que o melhor é você

Eu acho que já paguei o preço por te amar demais

All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity

All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see

It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy

So how long had you gone
Before you realized your maps were wrong?
You're turning up in places 
Where you don't belong
And the walls have something to hide

Well, I could be way over there in a minute 
If I had enough strength bear and grin it
If the measure of the match was fair
Then you'd win it 
But, you're bound to lose

[Chorus]
Well, It doesn't take a miracle
Or a natural disaster
To live in the world that you're after
The change is gonna happen to you

[Verse 2]
Well, it hardly seems worth the time you spend complaining 
If you're bitching at a world full of people
And explaining yourself 
And how their life could be so much better
If yous ain't so good
Well, I can leave it all up to the presidents 
Relying on the people
To believe false evidence
You could fight your way into a permanent residence 
In the big house, with free food, but no trees

It doesn't take a miracle
Or a natural disaster
To live in the world that you're after
The change is gonna happen to you

It doesn't take a miracle

[Verse 3]
I could my voice out across a great loud speaker 
And attempt to give strength to the folks feeling weaker
Yeah, you could call yourself 
A genuine truthseeker 
But, watch out because it might be found

It's kinda hard cause things ain't what they seem
But, it sure feels good to row gently down the stream
And it all makes sense
Life is but a dream
So, go merrily
Go merrily, yeah

It doesn't take a miracle
Or a natural disaster
To live in the world that you're after

There's anger far behind the things
That surface on your mind
And bring your spirits down
Because of all that comes before the rise and fall
It's easier to hold your ground
Your steady ground
Discovering that over time
All the could-of-been's
They blow your mind and speak to you
And the voice you hear will stay with you
Beneath the things you say and do

So, let it out
Let it out

And they're waiting
For something to change into something worth waiting for
And they're waiting for something to change into something 
Worth waiting for

There's anger far behind the things
That surface one your mind
And bring your spirits down, down, down, down, down, down
Because of all that comes before the rise and fall
Just hold your ground
And let it out

Somewhere off in the distance, 
On the other side of your resistance
Lies, a peacefull existence
It waits
What a difference it makes
Without boundaries, no limits, no maximum reach
No guidelines to follow
One promise to each his own
Individual
A self-destination
A wide-open journey
On a path to 
Creation

Is happening now

Guess I was wrong but that ain't a new thing to me
I'd rather be right just like anybody else, but I still have to live with myself

Well you know I'd rather be lost in love instead of found
You can see I've followed love all around
There's something in me that can never get enough
It's a funny kind of thing, first I'm down then I'm up
I wish somebody could explain the light of love

The light of love is somewhere waiting
Lose the breath you're saving
Feel like celebrating for love

Raise your head its raining
Some day boy you'll see there's enough

This is some kind of day, I thought it was summer in July
But so much rain, it's like a cold winter sky
I'd love it this way if I wasn't here alone
Have another glass of wine and let her go

I'm alone ooh I'm lonely as I hear the seabirds call
Seven islands sail before me
I guess I'm not alone at all

Comes back around

That kind of love seemed to never stay
Yet it still has a hold on me today

Sometimes I want to lay these troubles down
Turn around and then walk away
But I believe that I know too much now
I can't pretend I'm the same

Some love come to help us feel
Some love, so we'll all begin to heal

I need more than a lover's sweet kiss
Romance will not deliver me
I hear and old and endless song
The words I just keep filling
I keep thinking the love we need
Will live again

There are things when we're young
That we all learn
To gorw up and just never ask
How is it that a world that doesn't work
Has ended up on our backs

Sometimes I'm no more than blind

You can jive

Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music
Getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music
Everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet

Leave 'em burning and then you're gone

Michael Valerio,"Se tu fossi nei miei occhi per un giorno
Vedresti la bellezza che piena d?allegria
Io trovo dentro gli occhi tuoi
E nearo se magia o lealta

Se tu fossi nel mio cuore per un giorno
Potreste avere un?idea
Di cio che sento io
Quando m?abbracci forte a te
E petto a petto, noi
Respiriamo insieme

Protagonista del tuo amor
Non so se sia magia
O lealta

Se tu fossi nella mia anima un giorno
Sapresti cosa sono in me
Che m?innamorai
Da quell?istante insieme a te
E cio che provo e
Solamente amore

Waiting for the manna coming from the west.  
Barren is her bosom, empty as her eyes,  
Death a certain harvest scattered from the skies.  
  
Skin and bones is creeping, doesn't know he's dead.  
Ancient eyes are peeping, from his infant head.  
Politician's argue sharpening their knives.  
Drawing up their Bargains, trading baby lives.  

Ivory Madonna dying in the dust,  
Waiting for the manna coming from the west.  

Hear the bells are ringing, Christmas on it's way.  
Hear the angels singing, what is that they say?  
Eat and drink rejoicing, joy is here to stay.  
Jesus son of Mary is born again today.

Michael Virtue,"It must have broke your poor little heart  
When the boys used to say,  
you looked better in the dark.  
But now they`d give all they learnt in school  
To be somewhere in the dark with you  
  
The teacher would ask the questions  
And you, would always raise your hand  
But somehow you never got your turn  
And my eyes would fill with water, inside I`d burn

Homely girl, you used to be so lonely  
You`re a beautiful woman oh yes you are  
Homely girl you used to be so lonely  
You`re a beautiful woman oh yeah  
  

There was a boy who used to sit beside you  
Who`d like to hold that place his whole life through  
Ooh you were beautiful to me  
You had a heart no one could ever see, oh yes you did  
  
[Chorus]  

I was the only one who offered  
To carry your books  
Took all the stares and laughter  
And the dirty looks  
Cause I saw then what they see now

They don`t know how, they don`t know how

But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

I got you, to wear my ring
