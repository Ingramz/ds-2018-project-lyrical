Wayne King,"High on a windy hill
I feel my heart stand still
All I can hear you calling my name
Into a misty blue
I go in search of you 
There in the shadows calling your name
Why are you just beyond me
When will I see your face
Why do you just elude me
And leave me this lonely space
Oh, into eternity your love will beckon me
I can't forget your voice that calls my name 

Into eternity your love will beckon me
I can't forget your voice that calls my name",High on a Windy Hill,1997
Wayne King,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!",Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!,1998
Wayne King,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2004
Wayne King & His Orchestra,"Little Miss Cecilia Green
Little over sweet sixteen
But the cutest flapper that you've ever seen
When the fellows pass her by
She will always wink her eye
When she talks to them
When she walks with them
This is what they'll cry

Does your mother know you're out Cecilia?
Does she know that I'm about to steal you?
Oh my when I look in your eyes
Something tells me you and I should get together

How bout a little kiss Cecilia
Just a kiss you'll never miss Cecilia
Why do we two keep on wasting time?
Oh Cecilia
Say that you'll be mine

Many funny things occur
While the boys are courting her
I refer to one case in particular
She went with a boy named Joe
Who was always lisping so
When he'd ask this miss
For a little kiss it would sound just like this

Doeth your mother know you're out The-thiel-yuh
Doeth thee know that I'm about to thteal ""yuh""
Oh my when I look in your eyth
I feel very you know tho un-neth-the-tha-ry
How about a little kiss The-thiel-yuh
Jutht a kith you'll never mith The-thiel-yuh
Why do we two keep on wathting time?
Oh The-thiel-yuh
Thay that you'll be mine
Mine How about a little kith, the thiel yuh
Jutht  a kith you'll never mith, the thiel yuh.
Why do we two keep on wathing time 
Oh, the theil yuh",Cecilia,1965
Wayne King & His Orchestra,"Those who dance and romance while they dance
They seem so happy and gay
Though they sing and they swing as they sway
Somehow I can't feel that way

For I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you
Dancing with somebody new
When it's you that my heart's calling to

Trying to smile once in a while
But I find it so hard to do
For I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you

While the throng's in the spell of a song
My thoughts keep drifting to you
While each pair seems to share their affair
They're making me blue

For I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you
Dancing with somebody new
When it's you that my heart's calling to

Trying to smile once in a while
But I find it so hard to do
For I'm dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you",Dancing With Tears in My Eyes,1965
Wayne King & His Orchestra,"Dear heart wish you were here to warm this night
My dear heart, seems like a year since you've been out of my sight
A single room, a table for one
It's a lonesome town all right
But soon I'll kiss you hello at our front door
And dear heart I want you to know
I'll leave your arms never more

(A single room, a table for one)

Wo-o-oo-wo-wo, 
Wo-o-oo-wo-wo, 
Wo-o-oo-wo-wo
When the deep purple falls
Over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to twinkle in the night
In the mist of a memory
You wander all back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh

In the still of the night
Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when light beams
And as long as my heart will beat
Sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams

When the deep purple falls

Wayne King & His Orchestra,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit
",Goofus,1965
Wayne King & His Orchestra,"I saw the harbor lights
They only told me we were parting
The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me
I watched the harbor lights
How could I help if tears were starting
Goodbye to tender nights beside the silvery sea

I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me

I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore

Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart is whispering
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me",Harbor Lights,1965
Wayne King & His Orchestra,"There's just one place for me, near you
It's like heaven to be near you

Times when we're apart
And I can't face my heart
Say you'll never stay
More than just two lips away

If my hours could be spent near you
I'd be more than content, near you

Make my life worth while
By telling me that I'll spend the rest of my days near you
Near you, near you
Make my life worth while
By telling me that I'll spend the rest of my days near you
Spend the rest of my days near you",Near You,1965
Wayne King & His Orchestra,"Sunset glow fades in the west, 
Night o'er the valley is creeping! 
Birds cuddle down in their nest, 
Soon all the world will be sleeping

And now is the hour when we must say goodbye, 
Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea, 
While you're away, o, then remember me, 
When you return, you'll find me waiting here

True lovers often must part, 
Kiss me, then leave me to sorrow! 
Here love, I give you my heart, 
You will return some glad morrow

But now is the hour when we must say goodbye, 
Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea, 
While you're away, o, then remember me, 
When you return, you'll find me waiting here.",Now Is the Hour,1965
Wayne King & His Orchestra,"People,
People who need people,
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children, needing other children
And yet letting a grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children than children
Lovers are very special people

Good night sweetheart, sleep will banish sorrow

Wayne King & His Orchestra,"There never was a gal I could love, like I love my Josephine
She's a flirt, she's a scamp, she's the vampiest vamp I've ever seen
It seems to me she's always flirting with the fellows passing by
But when I say she winks, then she tells me she thinks
There's a cinder in her eye
I believe it would be better if I'd leave her and forget
Everybody says it would be wise
But each time that I go out to dance with somebody else
I find myself dancing with tears in my eyes
For there's nobody quite so nice who can be quite so mean 
As my gal, what a gal, Josephine

Night breezes seem to whisper ""I love you""

Wayne Kramer,"It was a dark day in September,
Dark clouds filled the skies.
And all that I remember
Was the neighbours asking why?
The blacks stepped off the Central,
The whites all stood and stared.
The schoolyard lay in silence...
The sounds of being scared.

We're all the same on the inside,
We're all the same in the end.
We're all the same on the inside,
On the inside we're all the same.

We stood in opposition,
Will never understand
The deeply rooted feelings
We discovered now and again.
The screams don't mean they're playing,
They're scrapping in the halls.
And we're not getting nowhere
When there is no trust at all.

We're all the same on the inside,
We're all the same in the end.
We're all the same on the inside,
On the inside we're all the same.

The neighbours say the neighbourhood is losing.
That the neighbours, they are moving.
It's all down hill from here,
Yes, it's all down hill from here.

We're all the same in our sadness,
We're all the same in our pain.
We're all the same under pressure,
On the inside, we're all the same.
We're all the same in Chicago,
We're all the same in L.A.
We're all the same in Phoenix,
On the inside we're all the same.

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

Floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world's a birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

It's all to much for me to see
A love that's shining all around here

Fast company
A night of thrills
With no jealousy, no poison

And think it's sweet

Wayne Kramer,"I punched and hit it , trying to get it
To do what I wanted to do
I cried and scream when I saw my dream
It was dancing all around the room

Oh baby, I sing my song
I just couldn't wait for you
Energy, energy, played its trick
And I knew what I had to do
Baby baby that's no lie

Baby baby don't ask me why
Take it, bake it, break it up
Build it back together again

Tying it off, 
Then take where it's never been

Sing it lewd, 
Try it in the nude, 
Try it standing on your head
Shake it, Fake it, crash it off
Now bring it on home to bed
Baby baby that's no lie
You sure find friends when your friends find time

Flying, soaring, topping it off
Riding on the crest of a wave
Power abounding as the music surrounds you
Sonically lighting your way

Oh baby, off we go
Heading for a brand new place

Staring you right in the face

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
That God must be one sick motherfucker
So I bust a nut in the sky
Spend another day waiting to die

I came twice this shit as any German sheisse the flick
I'll sperm on your perm, leave cigarette burns on your tits
It's Mickey Avalon all up in your prom
Pissing in the fruit punch with a baby blue tuxedo on

The dopest is rapper this century
I sodomized your father in a federal penitentiary
And on the day I got out
I went to your mother's house and slept on the couch

A street walker selling cock for rock
At the flea market trying to hock my watch
I stay on beat when I work the concrete
Some honeys give me money, and others do my laundry

Mickey Avalon the kosher salami
For twenty you get Chachi for forty he gets you Fonzie
A motherfucker hustler kamikaze
I use to bust tables but now I sell my body

Tragedy subside when honeys rub on it
It's Mickey Avalon, dick thick as a baton
The illest motherfucker from here to Vietnam

I used to work nights at Hot Cock dot com
But then I got fired when my mom logged on
I'm on the run, my dad's a bum
I asked my girl if she loved me and she just said 'ummm'

I bust flows that turn nuns to hos
So wake you from your slumber then shake you out ya clothes
There aren't no other late night lover
All up on the track like Scatman Crothers

I'll bust through the shudders, masked in a rubber
Duct tape your mother and butt-rape your brother
Break down the lumber and shake my cucumber
When you're at home alone you know my phone number

Get off the phone

Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.

So then we tried, ain't feeling this love now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes, and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear ya ass up (tear ya ass up)

I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin' (you know I want ya babe)
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya (you should stop frontin' babe)

Trying to be the best girlfriend you could be
But still you sneak and look at me, and girl I love it
Then you give your other girl a shove
Tell her you gon' palm her ass like it was
And she's gon love it (whoa-oh whoa, yeah yeah)

Wayne Marshall,"Walking down the road this life is on
The narrow path I try to stay
But I must confess I have a tendency to stray
I'd love to call it a mistake
A momentary lapse of faith
But the truth is sometimes I feel like I'm being dragged away

By the other side that people never see
A war is on between the good and bad inside of me

[Chorus]
Why do I do all the things that I do
When I want to do what is right
Change this wicked heart of mine
Let me walk with you in the new life

So what will ever put an end
To my recurring bout with sin
It seems I'm always at a loss for a way to win
When what I really need to do
Is to confront it with the truth
And let Your words of life sink in and make my mind brand new

A transformation that happens over time
Is the product of a renewed mind

Create in me a clean heart
Place Your spirit deep inside
Capture every thought
Til there's no place left to hide

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Wayne Marshall,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Wayne Morris,"Only brokenhearted, life's not over
 I can start again
 While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
 Its a hurting, thing to get over
 Why don't you tell me about it?
 I'm young but I'm wise enough to know
 That you don't fall in love overnight
 that's why I thought if I took my time
 That everything in love would be right
 Oh, oh
 But as soon as I closed my eyes
 I was saying to love ""good-bye""
 Chorus:
 But I guess I'm only... brokenhearted
 Life's not over I can start again
 While I'm lonely brokenhearted
 Its a hurting thing to get over
 No more empty conversations
 Next time I will be totally sure, oh
 don't want the pain of falling in and out of love
 Its more than my poor heart should endure

 So Ill listen to all advice
 And remember each time I cry

Sun was shinin' fine,
The lady love of old Bill Bailey
Was hangin' clothes on the line
In her back yard,
And weepin' hard.
She married a B&O brakeman
That took and throwed her down,
Bellerin' like a prune-fed calf
With a big gang hanging round
And to that crowd,
She hollered loud:

Won't you come home?
She moans the whole day long.

I'll pay the rent,

I threw you out,
With nothing but a fine-tooth comb?

Well, ain't that a shame

In an automobile,

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1964

And wondrous wishing wells
And nowhere else on God's green Earth
There be such lakes and dells

No wonder that the angels love
That shamrock covered shore
It draws my heart home again
And I love it more and more

Have you ever heard the story of
How Ireland got its name
Well, I'll tell you so you'll understand
From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven,1965

we went so high we couldn't stop
we climbed the ladder leading us nowhere

We spun so fast we couldn't tell

How could we know the right would turn-out bad
Everything we wanted, was everything we had

the lovely long ago 
we didn't a dime 
those days of me and you, 
we lost along the way 
how could I be so blind 
not to see the door 
closing on the World 
I now hunger for 
Looking through my tears, 
I miss the Hungry years
We shared our day dreams one by one 
Making plans was so much fun 
We set our goals and reached the highest star 
Things that we were after were much better from afar
Here we stand just me and you 
with everything and nothing too 
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay 
Honey take me home Let's go back to yesterday

After all the loves of my life 
You'll still be the one

From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth goodwill to men from heav'n all gracious King

For lo the days are hast'ning on by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heav'n and earth shall on the Prince of peace 
their king
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurled
And still their heavenly music floats o'er all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Yet with the woes of sin and strife the world has suffered long
Beneath the heavenly strain have rolled two thousand years of 
wrong
And man at war with man hears not the tidings which they bring
O hush the noise ye men of strife and hear the angels sing

O ye, beneath life's crushing load whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When peace shall over all the earth its ancient splendors fling
And the whole world give back the song which now the angels sing",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1995

Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
Who if He really does exist
Why did He desert me?
In my hour of need
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?  What do we do?

Alone again, naturally

Looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears
And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me

Like painted skies, those days and nights

Beneath the bright blue

Will it make it easier on you

It's one love

Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus

Wayne Shorter,"Lonely the roses of Avondaire sing as though somebody still may care.
They live only for the dream of living so come follow where they will take you there.

I once was apprenticed to a man who was living
In the eye if the hurricane to know despair,

He knew all the dreams by heart just like sailing in a boat of
crystal silence seeing visions of the world of life within a life.

In a turning like a burning came turning 
Out of everything stirring and what had begun before

But all wrapped up in one great godly becoming -
Tumbling and fumbling and stumbling
Into bumbling and rumbling along -

Whirling it and swirling it and twirling it and hurling it 
And overturning it and burning it again.

I shared a whirling dervish out on the side of a hill called metaphor vivace
Swinging en route to a nascent solar with the scissored visored blizzard wizard 
Gizzarding planets and secrets within like an avatar.

While meanwhile in turn styling and spinning over him
Spells bespeaking kingdoms in the dark

Calling me to yield knighting me in a field covered with armies
And with princes. All were signing cannons shining pennants flying.

And when he spoke to me he sang and his words really rang -
This child of the knowledge of the beauty of the night -

He sang to me of masters passing on of father after father after father
Climbing up into the lotus bloom upon the tortoise's back

And of grandfathers who danced through their living a longer time ago.
He showed me a palace in time in which all the talismans
From all the zeuses swing upon a pendulum of secrets
In a circle that remembers and when asked a question will surren",Night Dreamer,1964

Wayne Shorter,"Although I speak in tongues
Of men and angels
I'm just sounding brass
And tinkling cymbals without love-

Love suffers long-
Love is kind!-
Enduring all things-
Love has no evil in mind

If I had the gift of prophecy-
And all the knowledge-
And the faith to move the mountains
Even if I understood all of the mysteries-
If I didn't have love
I'd be nothing

Love-never looks for love-
Love's not puffed up-
Or envious-
Or touchy-
Because it rejoices in the truth
Not in iniquity
Love sees like a child sees

As a child I spoke as a child-
I thought and I understood as a child-
But when I became a woman-
I put away childish things
And began to see through a glass darkly

Where, as a child, I saw it face to face
Now, I only know it in part
Fractions in me
Of faith and hope and love
And of these great three
Love's the greatest beauty
Love
Love
Love",Love,1982
Wayne Shorter,"It takes cheerful resignation
Heart and humility
That's all it takes
A cheerful person told me
Nobody's harder on me than me
How could they be
And, nobody's harder on you than you

Betsy's blue
She says ""Tell me something good!""
You know I'd help her out if I only could
Oh, but sometimes the light
Can be so hard to find
At least the moon at the window
The thieves left that behind

People don't know how to love
They taste it and toss it
Turn it off and on
Like a bathtub faucet
Oh sometimes the light
Can be so hard to find
At least the moon at the window
The thieves left that behind

I wish her heart
I know these battles
Deep in the dark
When the spooks of memories rattle
Ghosts of the future
Phantoms of the past
Rattle, rattle, rattle
In the spoon and the glass

Is it possible to learn
How to care and yet not care
Since love has two faces
Hope and despair
And pleasure always turns to fear
I find
At least the moon at the window
The thieves left that behind
At least they left the moon
Behind the blind
Moon at the window",Moon at the Window,1982

Look at me, I am old

Something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not

How can I try to explain?
When I do, it turns away again
And it's always been the same
Same old story
From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way, and I know
That I have to go away
I know, I have to go

It's not time to make a change

And take it slowly

Insecurity is my philosophy
I see other women as the competition

I say that its because their boyfriends all fancy me

Close my eyes and fantisize
Of all men envying me
So much fun to be number one
What good are sisters to me?

I just can't relate to some men
Unless I use my sexuality
Normal conversation always leave me insecure

Men are so much more approachable
Clever, kind and intellectual
And I never feel uncomfortable in their company

Oh! Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as magical mister Mistoffelees

He is quiet he is small he is black
From his ears to the tip of his tail
He can creep through the tiniest crack
He can walk on the narrowest rail

He can pick any card from a pack
He is equally cunning with dice
He is always deceiving you into believing that he's only hunting for mice
He can play any trick with a cork

Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it is merely misplaced
You have seen it one moment and then it is gone
You find it next week lying out on the lawn

You would think there is nobody shyer,
But his voice has been heard on the roof
When he was curled up by the fire

And he's sometimes been heard by the fire
When he was about on the roof
(At least we all heard that somebody purred)
Which is incontestable proof

Of his singular magical powers
And I've known the family to call
Him in from the garden for hours

To those who cherish that memory

Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to eat

Stronger than papa's old brandy

Once in awhile she would break down and cry

Some times she'd be so happy
Just being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds with just a simple song

Wayne Wade,"As I walk this land with broken dreams
I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
Maybe, I'm searching though I don't succeed,
but someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.

Wayne Watson,"I haven't seen it all but I've seen enough
Got some memories--Some I pray, one day, I'll forget
You wipe the vision clear and here it comes again
Try to hide your eyes 'cause you realize...it's sin

Charmers from the left and right
They fight for my attention
""Hey-Hey, mister...look over here""
I've declared my stand...no

I will set no evil thing before my eyes
Only good, only truth--Blind to all the lies
I know I could waiver, Lord
Sometimes I regress
So keep the light of holiness
Before my very eyes
Before my very eyes

On the city street--Writing on the walls
From the TV screen screamin' thoughts obscene
... It's everywhere

But I can rise above and not be overcome
Not by this foolishness
I can win this race I run

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]

My ears are, pretty much, involuntary machines. 
Within a give environment, my control of what goes in is limited

Wayne Watson,"It's good to be lonely every now and again
To be parted from the ones you adore
To sit at a table for two all alone
And take a look at the world around you
At people with no one to go home to
Some with a place to belong
Others consumed by their weakness
And another when weak seems so strong

[Chorus:]
Lord, let me be at peace wherever I am
Satisfied with all I have--a faithful friend
And know I am grateful
""Cause if it makes me love you even more
I know--I'm sure
It's good to be lonely every now and again
It's good to go down to defeat now and then

To fail at some noble pursuit
To fall short of the prize
And find in His eyes
There's nothing your victory can do
To secure higher favor
He cannot love you more than now
Winners and losers
All are the same somehow

[Chorus]

And it's good to know sorrow
To be closely acquainted with grief
To be showered with tears
No reason to cheer
To find in Christ your only relief

[Chorus]

I'm alone a lot. One spring Saturday in a small-town ""Mom and Pop"" restaurant, 
I wasn't just alone, I was lonely. 
I sat and just watched. 
Families together, two elderly ladies out for lunch, a mother with two unhappy babies. 
Next time you go on a pity binge, 
Go off and watch the world go by and count your blessings.",Every Now and Again,1988
Wayne Watson,"There's a fine line
Between contentment and greed
Between the things that I want
And the things that I need

Between ""enough is enough""
And where desires feed
It's a fine line
How do I live with so much

Here with the spoil of the blessed
And not abandon this boat
For the sea of excess
To aspire to great things

Yet be filled with humbleness
It's a fine line--Oh yes, it's a fine line

[Chorus]
So where do I walk, Where is my place
The straight and the narrow
The road of grace
Holdin' fast to You, Walkin' at Your pace
Walkin' on the fine line
Walkin' on the fine line
Walkin' on the fine line
There's a fine line

Between taking bread with a lost man
And being consumed by his way
While reaching out in love
Temptation's right at your door

Guard what you're thinkin' of
It's a fine line
When I hide my eyes
From the darkest of our life's insanity

From the worst of the world's profanity
I've gotta be careful
I don't miss anyone in need of me
It's a fine line--Oh yes, it's a fine line

And can I embrace the world's sorrow
And not be carried away by life's rain
Know the power of the resurrection
And still know the fellowship of His pain

Not talkin' 'bout walkin' fences
Not talkin' 'bout compromise
But living and breathing as pleasing in His eyes
If I've said it once, I've said it a million, no a billion times,

""There's a fine line between so and so."" 

The black and white
Doesn't give so much trouble. At least when I choose black or
White, I KNOW I'VE DONE IT! The faith, on-the-edge walk,
Requires a surer foot that I have...it requires leading.",The Fine Line,1988
Wayne Watson,"I could live without You
I know I could get by
Millions of people do
Why couldn't I

I could live without You
Through the motions once again
Maybe even laugh and smile
Oblivious to sin

But why should I merely survive
Content with just being alive
The best life can offer
The world and its gold
Is nothing to the treasure of Your hold

I could live without You
But what would living be
Not a chance of escaping Hell
A dark eternity

Now I have the strength to say
Lord, I've seen life from both shores
Before I chose You, Jesus, You chose me
Now find me fully Yours",I Could Live Without You,1988
Wayne Watson,"A million dark alleys you can hide in
Dig a tunnel to the center of the earth
Convinced you've got nobody to confide in
Got you questioning the sum of what you're worth
People label you the black sheep of the family
Come collect upon your prodigal reward

[Chorus:]
'Cause you can never outrun
Or go beyond the reaches
Of the long arm of the Lord

I've been ashamed--I've been humbled and forgiven
I've been chastened by my Father's loving hand
But still, at times, I go on with my evil
It seems to constitute the nature of a man
But forgiveness is as close as my confession
And my sin amputated by His sword

[Chorus]

If He gave to me all that I deserve
This could be my final breath
But with compassion in His eyes
He's drawing me home
Into His arms--Into His tender arms of rest
There are pagans at the corners of creation
Making light of the salvation that we know

To the passion of the Godless seed they sow

 Isaiah 29:13/Jeremiah 51:17-18/Exodus 20:3
My temple is built on wood and of stone
Each space is filled with the things that I own
Idols and gods that call me to bow
I try to be free but there's no freedom now...No freedom now
The ones I hold dear--Those most precious to me
Some days I set them afloat on an indifferent sea
And these things in first place--They're worth nothing at all
At night in my dreams graven images call
Chorus
And my gods won't let me sleep
And what a man sows that he will reap
I toss and turn at night
I've got places to go, got battles to fight
And my gods won't let me sleep...tonight
Ambitions once good--Once noble and pure
Now rule with a rod and I cannot endure
Those bonds I have forged with two will hands
They're not easily torn by the strength of a man

No other gods before you--No other holy shrines
Oh, I want to sleep in peace when I lie down
All other voices calling
All of the hands that pull me
Call and demand allegiance to their crown

One day recently past, I spent several hours trying to restore my
Reputation in a fellow man's eye. My anxiety lasted into the
Early hours of the morning. I realized that my reputation

To my surprise and shame
Said a black eye of embarrassment
Been attached to Jesus' name

Some mortal man convicted of some moldy moral sin
And the skeptics wage their tongues and say
""There goes that Jesus again""
The story graced the TV

And the magazines too long
And if my heart ain't broken yet
There must be somethin' wrong
Because but for the grace of God

I know it could be me
And all that's left for me to do
Is to help the world to see

That's not Jesus
He doesn't carry on that way
Just some flesh and blood like you and me
Somehow gone astray
That's not Jesus, no

No matter what ""they"" say
He doesn't need me to defend Him
He just wants me to obey
He just wants me to obey

Have you seen the masterpiece
Of Jesus on the cross
Well, if He's still a-hangin' there
I'm hopeless--I am lost

I believe the tomb is empty
And the stone's been rolled away
And because of all this trouble
I still feel compelled to say

[Chorus]

And if your vision of Him
Has gotten somehow blurred
By a stumbling soldier in the field

When Jesus told the listening
That those who follow Him

Could bear the strike of the serpent
Could drink the poison in
Was His vision some spectacular scene
Some exhibition-Some display

Or a reminder, as I live and breathe
To reach out and not be afraid

I try to be a Godly man
I try to walk in the steps of Jesus
I disregard the Lord's command
When I walk through my journey
Untouched by human hands
Untouched by human hands

I despise your evil way--Have no part in such things
From such obvious violation I keep my hands clean
But inside this heart of mine oh, there dwells little good
Only the flow of calvary--Only the Lord and His blood

God save the dying ones who must live with regret
Out on the street--Out there where no one can see

Knowing He died to free us
From the chains within our soul

Let us give the Lord control
Of all the things that quickly bind us
And walk no longer in darkness

Bought with a price through one sacrifice

Has made us free from the ways of death

We belong to Him

Flesh of His flesh, bone of His bone
Born of His blood, His very own

Who's got four Just one dollar more to bid on this old violin?

Well the air was hot and the people stood around as the sun was setting low,
From the back of the crowd a gray haired man,
Came forward and picked up the bow,
He wiped the dust from the old violin then he tightened up the strings,
Then he played out a melody pure and sweet, sweeter than the Angels sing, 
And then the music stopped and the auctioneer, 
With a voice that was quiet and low he said now what am I bid,
For this old violin and he held it up with a bow.

And then he cried out one give me one thousand,
Who'll make it two only two thousand who'll make it three,
Three thousand twice you know that's a good price,

Which is, which, in what, is what and when do whatever

Wayne Watson,"Who on earth could ever explain the great mysteries of life
Or the mournful and untimely face of death
But as long as we remain, we grow better, even stronger
Though we'll never be the same

'Cause the ones left standing have to cry all the tears
And replay all the memories, the good and bad from the years
And we shoulder the weight of the work left to be done
And the ones left standing carry on

The peace of God will abide in the season of our sorrow
In the valley of a pain we can't describe
In the palm of His hand is a shelter from the madness
We can never really understand

'Cause the ones left standing have to cry all the tears
And replay all the memories, the good and bad from the years
And we shoulder the weight of the work left to be done
And the ones left standing carry on

And in eternity when all the mysteries are gone
It will be clear that it was our God keeping us strong

'Cause the ones left standing have to cry all the tears
And replay all the memories, the good and bad from the years.
And we shoulder the weight of the work left to be done
And the ones left standing carry on

Wayne Watson,"What can you do when your hands feel tied
And your friend is broken-hearted
You try to comfort but there are too many miles in the way
You go back to the place where love began
Back to where love first started
Back to the feet of Jesus
To the throne of Grace

Bring Him all of your worry
All of your despair
All of the tears
Anytime, anywhere, you can

Chorus
Pray, pray, first thing at the top of the morning
On through to the end of the day, you can
Pray, yeah you can pray
Pray with all you've got
'Cause you know that you ought to
Hold them up, never stop, just pray

This is not some last resort
Some act of desperation
A string to pull when your hope has just faded away
I believe the humble righteous prayer
Can heal a broken nation
I believe a faithful God will hear us
And provide a way

Yeah bring Him all of your worry
All your despair
All of your tears
Anytime, anywhere, you can

Repeat Chorus",Pray,2000
Wayne Watson,"I've always heard there is a land
Beyond the mortal dreams of man
Where every tear will be left behind
But it must be in another time

There'll be an everlasting light
Shining a purest holy white
And every fear will be erased
But it must be in another place

So, I'm waiting for another time and another place
Where all my hopes and dreams will be captured
With one look at Jesus' face
Oh, my heart's been burnin'
My soul keeps yearnin'
Sometimes I can't hardly wait
For that sweet, sweet someday
When I'll be swept away
To another time and another place

I've grown so tired of earthly things
They promise peace but furnish pain
All of life's sweetest joys combined
Could never match those in another time
And though I've put my trust in Christ
And felt His Spirit move in my life
I know it's truly just a taste
Of His glory in another place",Another Time...Another Place,2011

I've been around da world
Dated many girls
But none compares to you
And da way she makes me feel
Inside I know it's real
It's like a dejavu

There's no doubt that you are special, baby
So this song is sentimental, really
I don't wanna see you worry over me
Cause there's no ifs, no buts, no maybe 

Chorus: 

Cause baby you're good enough, good enough
You in my life it's so much better
Baby you're good enough, good enough
And to me there ain't no other
Baby you're good enough, good enough
In any type of weather
Baby you're good enough, good enough
So damn good baby 

Verse 1: 

See yah, how you hol me tight
How yu squeeze me right
Mek me forget me life time a fuss and fight
Dorett a say she check fi me but a yu mi like
Not a man of many words but you a mi choice
No other woman ever mek mi feel so nice
Whenever I'm around you nott'n but a good vibes
Di way you full a carisma mi see it ina you eyes
Good enough for me not fi rest a mankind
Feel good about yourself all di time
Clouds part ina di sky fi mek di sun shine
Call out mi same and be there anytime
With you by my side, my life feel divine
What another man lost, let Buju be find
Show mi di mountain I man will climb
Just tell me you'd be mine until di rest of time
And he will never be apart no woman 

Chorus: 

Baby you're good enough, good enough
You in my life it's so much better
Baby you're good enough, good enough
And to me there ain't no other
Baby you're good enough, good enough
In any type of weather
Baby you're good enough, good enough
Good enough baby 

Verse 2: 

Made for each other, that is you and me
Could have been a player pan a galist spree
You comfort I, I satisfy you
Now we are inseperable
Buju Banton pan di ridim and a soso trouble
Woman I waan you fi roll and bubble
Can why, I tink dat you are good enough
Friend definitely serious hot stuff
Talk bout loving Buju caan get enough
Caan hol it down, caan resist to touch

Where did it start?
Tell me when, where
How did you get in my heart?
I feel your love washing over me
In waves of emotion so strong
I want to say while I've got the chance
In the words of this song

You're my one shining moment
You are all my dreams come true
Honey, you're my one shining moment
And if I never have another
I'm glad that I've known you

You fill up for me all the empty spaces
All the pain I ever felt, you've erased it
Is it any wonder? No way
That I'm growing fonder every day
There's a freedom that I never knew
And it's all because of you, honey

You're my one shining moment
You are all my dreams come true
Honey, you're my one shining moment
And if I never have another
I'm glad that I've known you

I wake up with you on my mind
You light up my day
There is nothing better I can find
Oh, my love, I'm so proud
That I can say, hey
All my dreams wrapped
Into one under the sun, honey

Honey, you're my one shining moment
And if I never have another
I'm glad that I've known you

Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power, but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip

Turn our golden the faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune

Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?

It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

So many adventures given up today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue

And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile

And it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking

I ain't missing you

There's a message in the wire
And I'm sending you this signal tonight

And it looks like I'm losing this fight

In your world I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand

Ooh baby, ooh baby, oah

Listen, a lot of time
She waited patiently by the phone and I didn’t call to say
'How are you doing or what is going on?'
She told me deep inside, it's tearing up her heart
And it’s very hard for her to stay in love
When her heart is thrown apart

I’ll never leave you alone again
Baby, let’s start when you
When I touch the road again, girl
I’m taking you, taking control again
Because I don’t wanna loose you
Here's my heart and soul again
I give it up to you, I give it up to you

You're beautiful, so colorful, just like a rose
Girl, you’re even more beautiful to me
When you take of all your clothes
There’s no perfect relationship, they all got flaws
So don’t worry I'll make it up get ready
'Cause I’m taking you out

I’ll never leave you alone again
Baby, let’s start when you
When I touch the road again, girl
I’m taking you, taking control again
Because I don’t wanna loose you
Here's my heart and soul again
I give it up to you, I give it up to you

Girl, you’re the best thing
That could ever happen to my life, my life
So I don’t wanna make things worse
From now on I swear that I will make sacrifices
'Cause I don’t wanna hurt you girl

I’ll never leave you alone again

When I touch the road again, girl

'cause she can't get sick of my love

I want you to myself, I guess I'm so selfish

Drop it to the ground

And you grind on me thighs

Make my blood pressurize

But a lady in the streets

I know a little spot
Where the beach is the bluest

And carpul sayin' Lucas

You know what I'm about
Now show me what you got
I party like a rock star
On the deck of the yacht

We could sail on the seas
Make a stop in belize
If you got Trina what else do you need?

Just because I'm more fun

From she get a push

She pours her emotions
Excessive morn for my love
Deep in her thoughts
She get lost

Thinking about my love
Even if she get puss
Just because I get floss
Still gonna press for my love

Wayne Wright,"Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear

About the way you walk and whisper and look

Then the world discovers as my book ends

Wayne Wright,"When you held your hand to my heart
Dear you did something grand to my heart
And we played the scene to perfection
Though we didn't have the time to rehearse

Since you took control of my life
You have become the whole of my life
When you are away it's awful
And when you are with me it's worse

Lover, when I'm near you
And I hear you speak my name
Softly in my ear and breathe a flame

Lover, when we're dancing
Keep on glancing in my eyes
Till love's only trancing music dies

All of my future is in you
You're every plan I design
Promise you'll always continue
To be mine

Lover, please be tender
When you're tender fears depart
Lover, I surrender to my heart

Well, I say that the devil is in you
And to resist you I try
But if you didn't continue
I would die

Lover, please be tender
When you're tender fears depart
Lover, I surrender to my heart
To my heart, lover

Wayne Wright,"The most beautiful girl in the world picks my ties out
Eats my candy, drinks my brandy
The most beautiful girl in the world

The most beautiful star in the world
Isn't Garbo, isn't Dietrich but the sweet trick
Who can make me believe it's a beautiful world

Social? Not a bit
Natural kind of wit
She'd shine anywhere
And she hasn't got platinum hair

The most beautiful house in the world has a mortgage
What do I care? It's ""Goodbye, care""
When my slippers are next to the ones that belong
To the one and only beautiful girl in the world

I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned

So lock the doors and call me yours

Wayniac,"Hey, nah ya goin miss up on the G-Funk era,
Ya know we said things won for Warren G, and soon turned superstar

11-10-7 D that was my intro
But now in 94, I'm rollin a 64
'Cause things get shady where the grass is greener
Niggaz throwin up sets in hoods like they neva seen a
Young mack daddy do his thing 'cause I pack right
I got 44 ways to make you act right
And its a shame how the game must be played
It was told never fold by the niggaz you can't fade
So raise up off this young hog
'Cause I heard you punkin some but you can't punk me y'all
I got my own thang 'cause I let my nuts hang
If you want to bring it, bring it on no pain no gain
So as I creep can you peep what I speak
Techniques unique, so what you sayin is obsolete
So there it is as I go about my days
I can only bring it to you like this in so many ways

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey this is Warren G you know
And I was in Baghdad 
Before these lil youngstaz was in they Daddy bag
Ya know, yeah, they in violation Wayniac so hound em

It's all plain and simple
I roll just to serve a lifetime wit my niggaz
Idiotic fools can't figure
The way I display or should I say more than that
Its crucial when I name how many niggaz got my back
Neva lack, the skills when its time to handle mine
You can't front if you want to but you still know the time 
I'm, the nigga that they call Wayniac (what that mean)
I'm the nigga stayin down for the home team
So if you didn't know let me slow ya roll
This pro is on the go with some shit you ain't heard before
So recognize game in your face
A touch of the bass then I'm gone without a trace

[Chorus]

I stay true to the game
But some stay blind to the fact
That if I don't look good, you don't look good
So please rearrange and change the shit you doin'
You fuckin' yourself 'cause you the one gettin' screwed
As I, ease on down the rick road
As I shift from first to second, cruise control
So blaze up the Buddha
'Cause I got drink, and don't think
We don't roll without a full tank
Of that bomb ass shit called the funk
'Cause I am the G and the funk is what you want
Now, lets take a trip to the other side of town
Niggaz flip flop and they neva stay down
Want to be all they can be, but gettin' held back
Tryin' to take what is mine, (what) what type of shit is that?
So, this is for the homies stay down for your pay
I can't only bring it to you like this in so many ways

Wayra,"It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, Do I look all right?
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, Do you feel all right?
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light

They'd relocate, and change their fuckin name
I eradicate movefakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with lifetakers, have sex with rumpshakers
I make moves so I'ma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's alright, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
with the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out

Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, til everybody knows
that I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
for big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
that I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia

You niggaz owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggaz in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is water baby, spread it around
But when you niggaz don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit the buck in the face
of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggaz and how I bust up they nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I be standing over you screamin, ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in they palm
Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect  you get the tech
I turn you fake niggaz on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggaz, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You snap inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggaz who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay what up, what's up?
I got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggaz do best bite
You niggaz can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Prim' brought Bumpy these tracks so I can let you know
Before I slide I'ma leave you this jewel
Even mechanics walk around with they tools

Nineteen-ninety-eight, damn I can't believe it 

Whoever thought, throughout the drama, we'd live to see it 

So many of us done lost lives to the streets 

As we reminisce I'm pourin liquor for the deceased 

Thinkin bout the times that I spent with many of em 

Hopin that the Lord let me see the millennium 

Trapped in this ghetto main, seekin better days 

Fightin for my conscience, tryin to shake these wicked ways 

I know it's wrong but it's hard to change 

All my life, all I ever knew was hustle and game 

Lookin for answers ever since I was a adolescent 

Faced with rejection, early age stressin 

But now ten years later with doodoo respect 

I'm bustin million dollar raps and six digit checks 

Showin love to my peeps and my love don't change 

Here's a toast to you fakes, huh, here's to better days

Touch a meal ticket, shake a spot for good 

Never, I still got love for the neighborhood 

And even though now it's infested with gunplay 

on most days like Bootsy I can't stay away 

Cause if I shook like y'all shook on me 

Then whose gon' stay and guide the way for the lil homies? 

I can't turn my head on my folks 

so I stay visible in these streets and try to give hope 

Born in the ghetto, raised in the ghetto 

Got love for the ghetto, I can't forget the ghetto 

How come everytime we get some change in our can 

we run away and try to move out as far as we can? 

I know that jealousy's the devil's greed but you worse 

than a devil when you turn your back on these young G's 

Now feel every word that I say, hear my cry 

as I struggle out of thirst and search for better days

Might sound strange, but I just can't run away 

I can't run, run, run away!

I can't run, run, runnnnnn away!

Another day another dollar, it feels good to look around 

and see I'm surrounded by real riders 

Childhood comrades I ran with for years 

Shared the same beer and tears over the same peers 

Player haters swearin that all we all G's 

off each others strength with these, regulates the same cheese 

No jealousy we all family like Sister Sledge 

Lace each other with game, so I can spin beer cans 

Watch our kids grow together, as we get old together 

Loc I mean this, let no one come in between this 

Keep our business among us, behind doors and eyes closed 

on those we consider as foes 

Outsiders never exposed to your hustle 

Plus I'm, never been one likely to trust em 

No negative association, just dedication 

to watch our paper sprout like this bud mutation

Here's a story
About a bitch
About a bitch I once fucked wit
Now I want y'all to listen real close
Shit's a trip
Peep game

Used to have a bitch that was true to life to me
Damn near a wife to me
The bitch was just right for me
Stood by my side
Used to help me wit my hustle
Down to pack straps and a cap if we had a tussle
I used to trust her wit my riches
I be in the kitchen cookin' chickens
While she be washin' dishes
150,000 in the attic
Pager blowin' up all night, my bitch never gave a nigga static
I used to make her mad enough to kill
Lipstick on the front of my draws, man my bitch was real
'Cause she never stole nothin'
Gaffled by the FED's 3 4 times and never told nothin'
But wait
My bitch is gettin' distant on me
No more back rubs and kisses
What's happenin' wit my little misses
Too sleepy for the sex play
Now what's really going on the same shit the next day
Damn I know she wouldn't fuck around
Still I taps all my phones and records every fuckin' sound
Conversations wit her homegirl but nothin' major
I duplicates the cap code to her pager
Now i receives every beat
'Cause I'll be damned if my bitch goin' be playin' me cheap

Call it what you want but I gotta know
If my bitch fucks around then my bitch gots to go 
If my bitch fucks around then my bitch gots to go 

Week and a half flies by and now I 
Can't trust my bitch doin shit
Track her through the mall, the cleaners, and the nail shop
The grocery store, and the health food spot
Dub you trippin I say to myself
'Is she all that?
I'm on my bitch ass like I'm lo jack'
Just hold that
I don't really like when she be callin her best friend
Pull up on the lot in a black Benz
I could smell it homie
It's goin down
These bitches bout to flirt wit some niggas and clown
Followed they ass to the Mo-Mo
Oh no
Damn this shit's for real
Now just imagine how a nigga feal
'cause I been livin wit a hoe
And worse than that a muthafucka didn't know
She got's to go
I hit the chronic 'cause
I'm on a mission
I'm havin visions 
Of two dead bitches missin Christmas
I can't take it no more
I cocks my strap ?takes flight?
And kick the fuckin hinges off the door
I skimmed the room with the infared
And finds my bitch and her best friend naked in the water bed

Call it what you want but I gotta know
If my bitch fucks around then my bitch gots to go 
If my bitch fucks around then my bitch gots to go 

Now I'm confused
I puts my heat down
Mouth open like a muthafucka takes a seat now (?we's now?)
How long you been fuckin her?
I ain't know yo ass was on cock
Got me thinkin bout ? ?
She said I trust her like you trust me 
If you trust we
Then us three could be livin in harmony
I get's to thinkin bout the pussy and the riches
Fuck it I guess I got two down bitches

Call it what you want but I gotta know
If my bitch fucks around then my bitch gots to go 
If my bitch fucks around then my bitch gots to go 

Ha yeah
Tell ya about these little stank ass scrags
Ain't shit

Check all my traps and dodge the fair cold
I'm all about the mix like a fuckin collage
And out the gararge, is the Bentley Onage
With the brains blowed out, so is the suns beeming
I got a jacket drooming and the hoes feeming
Since I'm Westside Connected I got a streets on hype
I got big deals, big squeels, big wheels, big pipes

Twenty-inches row - going get these hoes
Pinky hoes - when I roll with my negros
Be a freak about it and I'm a see about it
Speak about it, not bitch I'ma be about it
Who want some of this, West running this
Mack 10 with the playboy bunny bitch
She's a dummy bitch - with a money pit?
You broke ass niggas can't even stomach this

What that connect nigga like three times selling
Six-double-0-west nigga selling rich roll delling
Throw it up, hold it up, guns bust fo' fingas up
Two twisted in the middle with the thumb cuffed
Chevy Nash and dippin at ass and king of the zaggin
Fo'-fo' macking and coat tacking
Dub the hood and I'm in blue friend at 'em
Front up the club, I'm duolete, do for talk and mack 'em trick

What is it like? Tossing 'em hoes
And rolling on fools on them fo's
Flossing 'em chain, we doing big thangs
And busting on punks at close range
This is the way us gangsta's roll
Sit back and watch it as it unfolds
Bitches on suck us done so cold
Ahhh! this is the life we chose

Dope money and rapping shit I'm all with it
And all I know is streets is how I spit it
Chickenhawk see a bird, I gotta get it
So if ya hood come up sho', then I'd probably get it
If lil momma dick then I gotta hit it
The trojan gotta be a magnum for me to fit it
If you sherm on 'em stick then I'd probably lit it
The red beam is on your wig so I probably split it

To all them bitches that think they bootylicious
I think they new tricious - I think they do dishes
I make 'em three wishes - I take 'em they pictures
And spendin' they riches and fuckin' they bitches
Ego maniac - little homies call me brainiac
Ice Cube's an asshole and it ain't an act
So take a hit at that - and remember that
Where my motherfuckin niggas and my bitches at?

Britches I get I'm Dub-C, the rider with the clique
Like a dragon it's nothin' but fire when I spit
And I can't shake these ghetto ways
A street rich nigga eatin a bag of Lays
And the rubber bands and brains
From the turf for the sirens and Neverlands
Where we keep the pistols smoking just like Afghanistan
It's gangsta the killa - the dope dealer
Back for mo' figgas - so trick bow down and po' the liquor bitch

What is it like? Tossong 'em hoes
And Rolling on fools on them folks
Flossing 'em chain, we doing big thangs

Strolling with the vengeance
And when I make that gun clap
bitch niggaz roll like pigeons
So if you claiming than brang it
And be about the drama
It's WC and I ain't your mama

Vaboom, he's back to putting in work
Vaboom, to make your neck and head jerk
Make'em bang-bang
Make'em all move
Do the damn thing
My niggaz bang loose

Nigga make way for the big bomber
Mr. all night rider
Original bang hand glider
Scuffing up Chucks swiftly
Looking for a spot launch that mini-mat
And that's a hard hat
Do it till I get you
Pistol grip whip you
Nigga your pitiful
Picture me back burner material
Never
Scraped off Serial numbers and brought (??)
Ditching your block when live while you work
Cause it ain't no half repping
Either you riding or not
Cock it or keep stepping
Come on
Feel the breeze
What, why'all ain't know?
I got a squad so cold
We freeze all area codes
They need this - real Gs
Critical thesis
bound to break shit down to quarter pieces
For real
DeVil the boss under the Dub
Swanging
Giving orders to chickens and thugs

It ain't no bitch in this industry that flow like me
Matter fact, it ain't to many niggaz that can see me
For sure, I've been none to loc for way too long
Now the spot lights on me, so believe me its on
Its funny the way I'm hated
Always underrated
But ya'll hoes couldn't come with it if you masturbated
Niggaz want to test me - I wish you would
Lyrics bang more harder than niggaz bang they hood
I come through unexpected like the in Vietnam grenades
Got so much heat I make the Devil run for shade
This ain't no game nigga
So, don't fuck with T
Mess around and be headlining on Unsolved Mysteries
I got warrants for my arrest by the FBDs
For pushing off(??) trying to take these keys
A female fely in Burberry
Picking up money from the commissary
Don't fuck with Terry

Vaboom, he's back to putting in work
Vaboom, to make your neck and head jerk
Make'em bang-bang
Make'em all move
Do the damn thing
My niggaz bang loose

Vaboom, he's back to putting in work
Vaboom, to make your neck and head jerk
Make'em bang-bang

Do the damn thing
My niggaz bang loose

Vaboom, he's back to putting in work
Vaboom, to make your neck and head jerk
Make'em bang-bang

A movement

First you take the rag
Crease it
Place it in your back pocket
And bell

But remember
For all you square ass niggas
Rips to the left
Doggs to the right

No matter the color or size, I can't hate

I even think I'm country for fat monkeys like Beyoncé
Wet lips and as ghetto as Vivica 
Nasty long tongue known for licking ya

When them guns go off, bitches hit the floor
Or then forty four slugs gonna hit you, ho
I don't care what it takes, I pull out a gear
Fuck the snakes, and Kurtis Blow with The Breaks off
Artie Murphy and the Petty Coat Junction
Get two thirty off the head with cold dumplings
Niggaz jump when the AK bark
Crystal grip pump, make the gun niggaz spark
You dig? Niggaz ready for war
Been carryin' the world for so long, it ain't heavy no more
And even when the sirens roar, I taught the violence gore to start firing more
And when we run out of bullets, and you still want static?
I grab the three eighty and pull out the automatic
We better get the money, for shootin' Mossbergs and Beretta's
Niggaz ain't shit funny, when it comes to a brawl
Suckin' Northstar, trippin' in
Guns go off, why'all know why'all strippin'

Look out peon, we might of lost the battle, but we won the war
I grab a bullet, travel, bodies hit the floor
Can't be scared of your shadow, you gotta have heart
Killas on my soil, will turn off the lights and park
Get out the car, unlock, fill out the chopper and let it chop
Walk off like nothing happened, give a fuck bout a cop
Touch you with the Blade, take off your toupee
Put my dirt in your glocks, sometimes I do my dark in the day
My momma didn't raise no sick, she raised a beast
And I can't rest til my enemies rest in peace
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Run up on me, I'ma knock the hell outta why'all
My back against the ball, strappin' and jackin', I'm puttin' hands on 'em
One hitter, quitter, bob & weavin', karate stance on 'em
Dance on 'em, ran on 'em, and land on 'em
Put my brand on 'em, stand on 'em, because I can on 'em

Cause like Abdullah on Car Wash, I'm hip to the game of hookers
Put the, put, put the needle back in time
And I can still remember when niggaz wouldn't let me rhyme
Beat it Cleotus I used to hear it from record labels
No doubt, deep down knowin I take all they artists out
But check me out now nigga, you can't stop the reign

WD,"How many of you people out there
Been hurt in some kind of love affair?
And how many times did you swear
That you'd never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights?
How many lies, how many fights?
And why would you want to
Put yourself through all of that again?
Love is pain I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way of
Paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again
One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day?
Why don't we turn the clock to zero honey
I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero sister
You'll never know how much I missed her
I'm starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero boss
The river's wide we'll swim across
We're starting up a brand new day
It could happen to you,
Just like it happened to me,
There is simply no immunity
There's no guarantee.
I say love is such a force if you should find yourself in it
You need some time for reflection
You say, baby wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Turn the clock to zero honey
I'll sell the stock we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero Mac
I'm begging her to take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero boss
The river's wide we'll swim across
Starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero buddy
Don't wanna be no fuddy duddy
We're starting up a brand new day
I'm the rhythm in your tune
I'm the sun and you're the moon
I'm the bat and you're the cave
You're the beach and I'm the wave
I'm the plough and you're the land
You're the glove and I'm the hand
I'm the train and you're the station
I'm the flagpole to your nation
I'm the present to your future
You're the wound and I'm the suture
You're the magnet to my pole
I'm the devil in your soul
You're the pupil I'm the teacher
You're the church and I'm the preacher
You're the flower I'm the rain
You're the tunnel I'm the train
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world
We're starting up a brand new day
You're the crop to my rotation
You're the sum of my equation
I'm the answer to your question
If you follow my suggestion
We can turn this ship around
And go up instead of down
You're the pan and I'm the handle
You're the flame and I'm the candle
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world

We greeted you with wild applause
But what a great ovation

‘I never cared much for moonlight skies
I never blinked back at fireflies'

So, Paganini don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve?
Come on and spring it
And if you can't spring it, you simply have to

Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.
It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;
Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practice,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go

I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day!
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !

And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day.

Ev'ry new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.
In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;

Only by the grace of God that I survived
I admit I was wrong to let you in
Never come back again
I can see all the possibilities rising up
Now that your not holding me down
This is where I say goodbye
And put the last bullet between your eyes

Less is learned in time
When you fade to the background
Will you take my hand?

We can change the map

Picked up when we fall
Held fast through it all

Now don't look to the past
Leave the thoughts you had
Those words and things you've planned

Change the way you live, live by the words you claim
Words are just words, until they're put to work
And it will be actions, not words, that change this earth.

Your will to fight

And you know
I'll storm
Through your castles doors
Cause you know that I'm good for you

And at the top, we scream
""I really like the view from here""

Racing for a new beginning
Chasing roads that are never ending
Here's our chance to drive new history

Best times yet around the corner
Catching dreams without a border
We are here, and we are finally free

We're dancing into life
Like we broke in
Crashing the night

Push ahead, push ahead
Past the highest ledge
Tonight is ours
With every step
Push ahead, push ahead
Such a beautiful sight
After every hill we climbed
It's never been so clear
And at the top, we scream
""I really like the view from here""

So take my hand, take a chance
Take a bow, take your moment now
'Cause it's a long way down
So take a stand, take a shot
Take a bow, take your moment now
'Cause it's a long way down

Push ahead, push ahead
Past the highest ledge
Tonight is ours
Tonight is ours

Push ahead, push ahead
Past the highest ledge
Tonight is ours
With every step
Push ahead, push ahead
Such a beautiful sight
After every hill we climbed
It's never been so clear
And at the top, we scream
I really like the view from here",The View from Here,2011
We the Kings,"Every single day I wait
I just can't wait to see your face
Are you looking back at me?
And every moment that goes by
I am waiting for a sign
Think of you and I'm all right
Did you think of me tonight?

You and only you
You make my heart feel like you're pulling every string
You and only you
You make me drop down to my knees and give this ring
My everything

Baby, once upon a time
There was a million stars up high
Now you're the only light I see
And I don't care which way we go
Teach me everything you know
Everything a love should be
So baby, just believe

You and only you
You make my heart feel like you're pulling every string
You and only you
You make me drop down to my knees and give this ring
My everything

Don't be long
'Cause when you're far away
It's a house of memories
Say you'll come back home
For me, for good

You and only you
You make my heart feel like you're pulling every string
You and only you
You make me drop down to my knees and give this ring
My everything",You and Only You,2011
We the Kings,"I am wide awake
And I'm standing tall
Up against the world
Up against the wall

Between the love and hate
They can hardly wait
To watch the hero fall

You could give me hell
You could give me death
Right before I bend
I will have revenge

Fire through my veins
I will fan the flames
Until my dying breath

'Cause I will never go down
Any other way (way)
I will never go down
Any other way (way)

Gasoline pumping through my veins
Dancing on top of the flames

I will never go down
Any other way (way)
Any other way

Feel the poison now
Slipping through my skin
I'm not giving up
But I'm giving in

To my darker side
To my every sin
So I can fight again

You could give me hell
You could give me death
Right before I bend
I will have revenge

Fire through my veins
I will fan the flames
Until my dying breath

'Cause I will never go down
Any other way (way)
I will never go down
Any other way (way)

Gasoline pumping through my veins
Dancing on top of the flames

I will never go down
Any other way (way)
Any other way

We the Kings,"I’m all alone
Holding on to memories while you’re moving on
Let me take you back to when we first said goodbye
'Cause I need you

I try because all that I can do is hope that love's enough
To pull you close enough to hold you, I’ll close my eyes
And I see you

Even when the sky falls and I’ve lost it all I know I will find you there
Even when my heart stops I’ll keep looking 'cause I know I will find you there

You know I will find you I'll find you I will find you there
You know I will find you I'll find you I will find you there

So tell me why
Why you want a world between us
Let me try I know you know this time I mean it
Say you still care and you need me

So where’d you go
Something in your voice, it says you're not alone
Do you remember when I said I’d always be there
Believe me

Even when the sky falls and I’ve lost it all I know I will find you there
Even when my heart stops I’ll keep looking 'cause I know I will find you there

You know I will find you I'll find you I will find you there
You know I will find you I'll find you I will find you there

We’re timeless, we're fearless, we're all we've got
We're brilliant, we're broken, we’re burning on

Even when the sky falls and I’ve lost it all I know I will find you there
Even when my heart stops I’ll keep looking 'cause I know I will find you there

You know I will find you I'll find you I will find you there
