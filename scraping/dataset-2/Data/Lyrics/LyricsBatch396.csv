Jackie,"Everybody's doing a brand-new dance, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
My little baby sister can do it with me
It's easier than learning your A-B-C
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me
You gotta swing your hips, now

Come on, baby
Jump up
Jump back
Well, now, I think you've got the knack
Wow, wow

Now that you can do it, let's make a chain, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
A chug-a chug-a motion like a railroad train, now
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it nice and easy, now, don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul

Come on, come on
Do the Loco-motion with me
Ye-ye-ye-yeah

Move around the floor in a Loco-motion
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)
Do it holding hands if you get the notion
(Come on baby, do the Loco-motion)

There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue
So come on, come on, do the Loco-motion with me

(Come one)
You gotta swing your hips, now
(Come one)
That's right (do the Loco-motion)
You're doing fine!
(Come one, do the Loco-motion)
Come on, babe
(Come one, do the Loco-motion)
Hm-hm-hm, jump up
(Come one)
Jump back (do the Loco-motion)
You're looking good

Hm-hm-hm, jump up
(Come one)

Jackie,"Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time.
There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it. (we can't make it)
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

It's too late baby, it's too late now darling
It's too late.",It's Too Late,2003
Jackie,"Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

Wake up in the mornin' fix you somethin' to eat,
'fore I go to work I even brush your teeth
Get home in the evenin' and you're still in bed
Got yourself a rag tied 'round you're head.

Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

I'm tellin' you baby you'd better change your ways
I'm tellin' you baby I mean what I say
Last time tellin you to stop that jive
Gonna find yourself outside

Jackie & Roy,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do 
If I had you
 
I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while

Jackie & Roy,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city

Jackie & Roy,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.

And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

Jackie & Roy,"I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
And stops my mind from wandering 
Where it will go 

I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door 
And kept my mind from wandering 
Where it will go 

And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right 
Where I belong I'm right 
Where I belong. 

See the people standing there who disagree and never win 
And wonder why they don't get in my door 
I'm painting my room in the colourful way 

And when my mind is wandering 
There I will go 
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right 
Where I belong I'm right 
Where I belong. 

Silly people run around they worry me 
And never ask me why they don't get past my door 
I'm taking the time for a number of things 
That weren't important yesterday 
And I still go 

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
And stops my mind from wandering 
Where it will go",Fixing a Hole,1969
Jackie & Roy,"Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who find the money when you pay the rent
Did you think that money was heaven sent

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlegs
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
Pa pa pa pa,
See how they run

Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night you stocking needed mending
See how they run

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet",Lady Madonna,1969
Jackie & Roy,"You're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much and just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words

You're much, you're too much and just too very, very
To ever be, to ever be in Webster's Dictionary

Tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words",Too Marvelous For Words,1992
Jackie & Roy,"The sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversation with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punch drunk

The pulled-out fur of cat and cur
The fine mis-mating of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words ""I love you, till the day I day""
The self-deception that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punch drunk

Believe me, sir, I much prefer
The classic battle of a him and her
I don't like quiet and I wish I were
In love again, in love again, in love again",I Wish I Were in Love Again,1992
Jackie & Roy,"Ollie told me I'm a fool. 
So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee 
And what do you think he said to me?

When you awake you will remember ev'rything
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

Ollie showed me the fork in the road
You can take to the left or go straight to the right
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat

When you awake you will remember ev'rything 
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true
But what am I supposed to do
Read the writing on the wall
I heard it when I was very small

When you awake you will remember ev'rything
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe 
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

Wash my hand in lye water
I got a date with the captains daughter 
You can go and tell your brother
We sure gonna love one another, oh! 
You may be right and ya might be wrong 
I ain't gonna worry all day long

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite
My old car froze up last night 
Ain't no reason to hang your head 
I could wake up in the mornin' dead
Oh! And if I thought it would do any good
I'd stand on the rock where Moses stood",Lazy Afternoon,1992
Jackie & Roy,"One brief feeling, 5 seconds go by. Buzzing of wires. 
Sweater looks a lot like mine. 
Million things to think about, thinking about what I shouldn't think about. 
You've got a million ways to look at things. A bright side. 

A million ways to look at things. A bright side. 
Hello, Auburn, how are you? The state that I'm into, hands like hammers bang. 
There's no love lost. 
Bitter remained like a taste in your mouth and nobody finds the one, and they keep looking. 

Crawling in and out of beds, flesh covers the bone. 
Flesh searches for more, for more than flesh. 
flesh searches for more, for more than flesh. 
Flesh searches for more, for more than flesh. flesh searches for more, for more than flesh.",Mine,1992
Jackie & Roy,"In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine

Jackie & Roy,"Quiet nights 'n quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us
Quiet thoughts 'n quiet dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie away 
from all the earthly cares around us
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it
And all at once the happiness I knew,
Became these quiet nights of loving you!

Jackie & Roy,"We met on the shore of a lemonade lake. 
Weeping willows looked down where we lay. 
Orange blossoms I smell in your hair. 
Butterfly, flutter by, butterfly by. 

Waterfalls send your ripples to us 
here on the shore of the lemonade lake. 
Pond lilies play hide and seek with the fish. 
Rabbit run, run rabbit, rabbit run by. 

Roaring mountain is standing close by, 
covered with snowdrops and glistening with dew. 
I hear the sound of a small hummingbird. 
I took your hand and I waltzed off with you. 

Come to the top of the mountain with me. 
Jump on a cloud and we'll float to and fro. 
Seeing the countryside covered with grass 
and the top of the mountain with candy-floss and snow. 

Butterfly lazily drinking the sun, 
lavishly sprinkled and painted with gold. 
Here in the land of the mist and the lake, 
me and my true love will never grow old",Butterfly,2006
Jackie & the Starlites,"For all we know
We may never meet again
Before we go
Make this moment live again
We won't say goodbye
Until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand
And my heart will be in it

For all we know
This might only be a dream
We come and we go
Like the ripples, like the ripples in the stream

I got the feeling that something ain't right

Jokers to the right, here I am

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours,

And leave me totally dazed
For they do such strange things to me
They nearly make me gloomy
For you dear are so clever
So obviously the top

I wish even more you'd stop

Oh it's bad for me it's bad for me
The knowledge that you're going mad for me
I feel certain my friends would be glad for me
But it's bad for me

To see someone in such a stew for me
And when you say you'll do all you could for me

Completely left on the shelf
But since you started to woo me
I'm just crazy about myself

It's a boon for me a break for me
To hear that your heart's on the make for me
Yet no matter however appealing
I still have a feeling it's bad for me

Jackie Allen,"Before Lord God made the sea and the land
He held all the stars in the palm of his hand
And they ran through his fingers like grains of sand
And one little star fell alone

Then the Lord God hunted through the wide night air 
For the little dark star on the wind down there 
And he stated and promised he'd take special care 
So it wouldn't get lost again

Now a man don't mind if the stars grow dim 
And the clouds blow over and darken him
So long as the Lord God's watching over them
Keeping track of how it all goes on

But I've been walking all the night and the day
Till my eyes get weary and my head turns gray
And sometimes it seems maybe God's gone away
And we're lost out here in the stars

And we're lost out here in the stars

And we're lost out here in the stars",Lost in the Stars,1999

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble

The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

Jackie Allen,"""Romance is a game for fools""
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!!",Fools Rush In,2003
Jackie Allen,"I can hear that old clock ticking, passing time up on the wall
I can hear the faucet drippin' in the kitchen down the hall
I just sit here wishin' there was something I could say
To the one that I keep missing every night and every day

There's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

Now I got used to tenderness, we'd hold each other tight
And I got used to happiness, we'd make love day and night
And I'll get used to mornings, eating breakfast all alone
Sitting in the evenings, when there's no one else at home

But there's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

Without you the sun still rises, without you the rivers run
I thought by now that I'd be realizing, what's done is done

I accept the notion that there's things you can't control
The changing of the seasons or the fact we're growing old
And I know I'm the reason that you had to go away
But I will keep believing that's the price I have to pay

But there's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I'll never get used to living without you

Oh there's things you learn to live with, now that's all I ever do
But I never get used to livin' without you, without you, without you",Living Without You,2006
Jackie Allen,"When the night
Is wrapped around us
And the dawn might come too soon
When the only light
That's found us
Is the solitary moon

Sings a soft and soulful tune
Once again
You share my pillow
Making love to me
Tenderly
Here, as we share
The silent moon

As it slowly sails above us
In it's solitary flight
Seems the moon
Must surely love us
As it bathes us in it's light

Through a sunlit afternoon
Let your kisses say 
You'll stay here
And make love to me
Tenderly

Nearer than the wind is to the willow
Dearer than the rain is to the earth below

Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,

Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?

This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere

Jackie Daly," I was born on the holy ground
A running child in fields of clover
I was living in the grandeur
Of my father's land
mmm...

By the side of the swirling sea
I spent the days of childish wonder
And the rocks I held in my young hands
I never felt them slip away

Well the sun shone bright upon the waves
And the wind blew high as I was leaving
And I sailed so far away
Looking for adventure
mmm...

But I would not stay where the city streets
proclaimed so loudly man's endeavours
Though music is a pretty thing
in fine company
And the wilderness took my breath away
I felt I had to find my way
Where no-one ever goes
mmm...

It was in the south that my new home lay
With a dark eyed boy and wild horses
With humming birds and roses there 
in old Mexico

There the winds of change they blew so far
Of liberty and revolution
And it seemed that each man heard in his breast
the drumming of a nation
mmm...

Night and day
You are the one,
Only you 
Beneath the moon
And under the sun.
Whether near to me or far,
It's no matter, 
Darling, where you are
I think of you

Day and night 
Why is it so,
That this longing for you follows
Where-ever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom,
In the silence of my lonely room,
I think of you,
Night and day.

Night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an

Burning inside of me.
And its torment won't be through

Jackie DeShannon,"I want a Sunday kind of love
A love that will last past Saturday night
And I've got to know it's more than love at first sight

I want a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody, someone to care
And I'm on a lonely road that leads me nowhere

I do all my Sunday dreaming and all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
And I'm hoping to discover a certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

And my arms need someone to enfold, to keep me warm
When those Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
And I need a love for all my life, to have and to hold

Jackie DeShannon,"Your toy balloon has sailed in the sky, love
But now it must fall to the ground
Now your sad eyes reveal just how badly you feel
'Cause there is no easy way down

The view from the cliffs must have been exciting
And up to the peaks you were bound
Now you're stranded alone and the past is unknown
And there is no easy way down

No, it isn't very easy when you're left on your own
No, it isn't very easy when each road you take
Is one more mistake, there's no one to break your fall
And lead you back home, yeah

We all like to climb to the heights of love
Where our fantasy world can be found
But you must know in the end when it's time to descend
That there is no easy way down

You know you're gonna find

Jackie DeShannon,"THINK OF RAIN

	Words and Music by Margo Guryan




If you should think of leaving me
Think of rain
And think of yesterday again

Think of rain
Think of holding hands and running for cover
Laughing all the time
And stopping to kiss
Under the weeping willow tree

If I should break your heart one day
Think of rain
And maybe you will have to smile

Think of rain
Maybe then you will forgive me
I'd want you to forgive me
Think of rain

If one day you should think of leaving me

When I fall in love it will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love

Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a worm on a hook,
Like a knight from some old fashioned book

I hope that you can just let it go by.
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.

And he dropped us up the road

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Let it run all over me

But our throats were getting dry

With the sunshine in his eyes
Well he lived all alone in his own little home
With a great big gallon jar
There were bottles too, one for me and you

Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam

Like music rite of spring

She loved dark tea and coffee pot
She lived with a dog and cat

No one has ever loved the way holly could
She never cared about herself the way she should
No one will ever treat you like holly would

And always spoke of her friend Yasmine

Jackie Dougan,"Last night I started out happy
Last night my heart was so gay
Last night I found myself dancing
In my favorite cabaret
You were completely forgotten
Just an affair of the past
Then suddenly something happened to me
And I found my heart beating, oh, so fast
 
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling, is still in my heart

It is the night of
Our dear Savior's birth!
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining,
Till He appeared
And the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope,
The weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn.

O night divine,
O night when Christ was born!

Serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts
By His cradle we stand.

Sweetly gleaming,

In lowly manger,
In all our trials
Born to be our Friend!
He knows our need,
To our weakness no stranger;
Behold your King!
Before the lowly bend!
Behold your King! your King!
Before Him bend.

Truly He taught us
To love one another;
His law is love and
His gospel is peace.
Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother
And in His name
All oppression shall cease.

Grateful chorus raise we,

I ask the Lord one small request
I know I have all I could need
But this prayer is not for me

Too many people on this day
Don't have a peaceful place to stay
Let all fighting cease that your children may see peace
Wipe their tears of sorrow away

To believe in a day
When hunger and war will pass away
To have the hope amidst despair
That every sparrow's counted
That you hear each cry and listen to each prayer

Let me try always to believe
That we can hear the hearts that grieve
Please help us not ignore
The anguished cries of the poor
Or their pain will never leave

To believe in a day
When hunger and war will pass away
To have the hope amidst despair
That every sparrow's counted
That you hear their cries and listen to each prayer

Father, as you see, I'm just a child
And there's so much to understand
But if Your Grace should surround me
Then I'll do the best I can
I promise, I'll do the very best I can

When hunger and war will pass away
To have the hope amidst despair

I close my eyes
And look deep inside
Let the dreams that I have take flight
I lift up my head and just believe
Knowing I was made to dream

From now on, my life’s my song
And I write the words
My moment will come
And until then, i’ll hold on, i’ll hold on

I close my eyes
And look deep inside
Let the dreams that I have take flight
I lift up my head and just believe
Knowing I was made to dream

Made to dream
To live my goals
To be counted for, to stand
Knowing you’ll take my hand

I’m here, I was made for this, to sing
’til I have no voice at all
’til the dream makes me whole

I close my eyes
And know deep inside
Let the dreams that I have take flight
I lift up my head and just believe
Knowing I was made to dream
Knowing I was made to dream

That I must bow so low?

When we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while

To take your heart back and be free

Spare a thought for me 

We never said our love was evergreen
Or as unchanging as the sea 
But if you can still remember 
Stop and think of me 

Think of all the things 
We've shared and seen 
Don't think about the way things 
Which might have been 

Think of me, think of me waking
Silent and resigned
Imagine me, trying too hard 
To push you from my mind
Recall those days 
Look back on all those times
Think of the things we'll never do 
There will never be a day
When I won't think of you

They have their seasons, so do we 
But please promise me that sometimes 
You will think of me",Think of Me [From The Phantom of the Opera],2014

E tira forte il vento
Su una vecchia terrazza
Davanti al golfo di Surriento
Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce
E ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assaje
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint' 'e 'vvene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Pensò alle notti là in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
Nella bianca scia di un'elica
 Sentì il dolore nella musica
Si alzò dal pianoforte
Ma quando vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembrò più dolce anche la morte
Guardò negli occhi la ragazza
Quelli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso uscì una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assaje
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
È una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint' 'e 'vvene sai

Potenza della lirica
Dove ogni dramma è un falso
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro
Ma due occhi che ti guardano
Così vicini e veri
Ti fan scordare le parole
Confondono I pensieri
Così diventa tutto piccolo
Anche le notti là in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita
Come la scia di un'elica
Ma sì, è la vita che finisce
Ma lui non ci pensò poi tanto
Anzi si sentiva già felice
E ricominciò il suo canto

Te voglio bene assaje,
Ma tanto tanto bene sai

Che scioglie il sangue dint' 'e 'vvene sai",Caruso,2017

Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way,

Misfortune seemed his lot,

And we, we got upsot.

And on my back I fell,
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,

I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle all the way!
What fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

Go it while you're young,
Take the girls tonight

Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Come hear the music play

Come to the cabaret.
Put down the knitting, the book, and the broom.
Time for a holiday.

Come to the cabaret.
Come taste the wine,
Come hear the band,
Come blow your horn,
Start celebrating,

So come to the cabaret!
I used to have this girlfriend known as Elsie,
With whom I shared four sorbid rooms in Chelsea.
She wasn't what you'd call
A blushing flower.

As a matter of fact
She rented by the hour.
The day she died the neighbours came to snicker
""Well, that's what comes from
Too much pills and liquor.""

But when I saw her laid out like a queen,
She was the happiest, corpse,
I'd ever seen

I think of Elsie to this very day
I remember how she'd turned to me and say:
""What good is sitting alone in your room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum,
Come to the cabaret.

And as for me,
As for me
I made my mind up, back in Chelsea,

Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came
They met beneath the cherry blossoms every day
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Poor Butterfly, for she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low

To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

End it all and let her go to some better man;

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,

Jackie Gleason & His Orchestra,"Love, to a man, is just a thing apart
To take or leave according to his whim
Love, to a woman means her very heart
She only wants to live her life for him.

Maybe he's not much,
Just another man doing what he can
But what does she care
When a woman loves a man.
She'll just string along all through thick and thin
Till his ship comes in
It's always that way
When a woman loves a man

She'll be the first one to praise him when he's going strong
The last one to blame him when everything's wrong
It's such a one sided game that they play
But women are funny that way.

Tell her she's a fool,
She'll say yes I know but I love him so

Is there something that you’re trying to say to me?
Cinderella complicated
It ain’t how you thought that it would be

If I die before I wake
It must have been a bad mistake
Depending on the pills you take
Can complicate and devastate

Now estimate, your time on earth
Do you recall your place of birth?
And can you tell what it’s all worth
And are you really satisfied?

Paint me a picture of a baby
I want to see how lonesome I can be
I don’t want no one to save me
I’m not going to leave here silently

What I have and what I’ve lost and
Every coin I’ve fountain tossed
Like every line I thought I crossed
Just cut me when the winter frost

I paid the cost; your rebel dreams
Suitcases and magazines
And I know I ain’t alone

If I make it to the city
Won’t you do your best and honey pray for me?
They say that all the girls are pretty
They say that they don’t dance for free

But forks and knives and rusted spoons
Bottomless in basement rooms
Your worn-out brides and reckless grooms
Are building tombs with pink balloons

Darkness looms an airless night
Just a matchbook and some dynamite
And it won’t matter who’s wrong or right

You know how I'm feeling, so I won't have to feel it no more

And nobody could love you
Like I can
Honey someday you'll wake up and maybe you'll understand

Well I've got a friend of a friend who drives a nice car
And I've got acquaintances down at the neighborhood bar

I got some women, stop by my home
But somehow I end up, waking each morning alone

The train that I ride's got nothing aside
From the phantom conductor with a dog at his side
And the ghost of a weeping, weddingless bride
Who should have been married but never arrived
And I see through the windows like I see through the lies
Like I see through every useless disguise
That everyone wears,
But everyone swears
That they don't

I'm trying so hard, just not to think about you
I try not to care about anything that you do

4 in the morning, I can't sleep
Well the pills ain't working and I can't get no relief

I feel like a hound dog moaning along with the rain
Anyday now the jukebox could drive me insane

There's an old man in the corner
Nobody knows
He says laugh while you can 'cause someday you'll be wearing my clothes

Well I guess I can't tell you what you don't already know
I ain't no prophet my landlord he told me so

My mind is a burning rain 
Of Saturn Flame
I feel things inside that I
I just can't explain

Well I know that you know how to fake and to take 
What you break, what you burn, what you never did learn
And you turn and you say that you made a mistake
As your head starts to spin and your heart starts to ache
But all that you make will be all that you get
When the curtain goes down, so don't you forget
That all your regret is a cheap silhouette and that's all

Oh and don't mind me baby

in the car that you drive or the cut of your hair
honey, you got something that i can't compare

And I don't really care about the weather outside

woman who's nothing like me

love is for fools, yes a fool such as i 
and i can't tell you how and i can't tell you why

well maybe you're wrong and maybe you're right
and maybe we could sit here and argue all night
but maybe you just better turn out the lights
cause honey i've been thinking about you

honey i've been thinking about you for a while
and it's driving me mad, yes it's cramping my style
and i aint asking you to walk down the aisle, but I...

Suitcase to staircase, to candelit room
where i sift throught the silk in the air and perfume
and i'll be loving you baby, i'll be loving you soon
cause honey i've been thinking about you

now i don't really care about your hot-blooded sister
i'm sure theres a man for to love her and miss her
i didn't mean nothing, i just happened to kiss her

your house in the hills or your pink private jet

Walking down the avenue, seems I'm always running into you
You got nothing for me, you got no words to say
But I guess you never did anyway
And I don't care about my baby…

There was a time when you cared for me,
Honey, there was a time you prepared for me
But those days are gone, yes they're down the drain
You got to find someone else to call your name
Cause…
I don't care about my baby…

There was a time when you loved me so,
Honey there was a time you wouldn't let me go
Those days are gone and I'm well aware
Those days are gone but I just don't care
And I don't care about my baby…

Someday soon, and it won't be long
Somebody's gonna hurt you, somebodys gonna do you wrong

Jackie Greene,"Madeline's naked, alone on her bed
She's rotting herself to the core
Nobody knows what goes on in her head
Nobody cares anymore
She used to be young, a child of the sun
Now she's searching the floor
And there's one, two, three ways to love her
But one way to get through her door

Madeline's lonely, she's dying of thirst
She's trying her best to be free
She says that she's sure that her soul has been cursed
Maybe just a little like me
She listens to voices, making her choices
Living a life she believes
And there's one, two, three ways to love her
But one way is all that I see

Madeline's makeup is smeared on her face
She looks like she's been burned in a fire
With her switchblade eyes and gun-metal grace
She walks with her toes to the wire
Well the world keeps turning, her candles keep burning
Their flickering flame of desire
And there's one, two, three ways to love her
But one way to make you a liar

Madeline's breathing her breath in the air
She circles the block once or twice
The cold winter wind has frozen her hair
But she won't take no advice
And she don't mind the pain, she calls it by name
Let go your virtue, your vice
And there's one, two, three ways to love her
But one way to tumble the dice

Madeline's desperate, she's lost in the crowd
She's somebody nobody would know
She walks with a purpose, so tall and so proud
But I know she's got no place to go
She tried like a train, to get out of the rain
But froze in the ice and the snow
And there's one, two, three ways to love her
But one way is all that I know",Miss Madeline (3 Ways to Love Her),2004

he could tell it was Heaven, by the way she moved
but he aint nothing but a spare part
the boy ain't broken, but boy's been bruised

and ain't it funny when you're young you live forever
but forever ain't never enough time
and ain't it just like that old, lonely feeling 
as the train disapears down the line
time after time, i ask myself why that it's always
sad to say goodbye

now i know a man who lives in Texas
makes his living working on cars
he was young and he was restless
did his fishing in out of town bars

but on the weekend, he's the one they look at
all the women know him by name
but it don't matter cause when the moon meets the morning
the feeling is always the same
time after time, i ask myself why that it's always
sad to say goodbye

somewhere a mother is drinking
somewhere a father has lost his good son
somewhere a sister is thinking
thinking about what her brother has done

and nobody's perfect, yet they both blame each other
and neither can hold back the tears
ain't it a shame, to see your boy dressed in numbers?
in numbers for 99 years
time after time, i ask myself why that it's always
sad to say goodbye

Spend the money that I saved
I think I'll build a boat for me

And the morning helps me come around

The booze it likes to chase the blues

I kept your heart out on a chain

Cause the clock don't ever stop for you

She doesn't even know the facts

Born and raised and born again

But everything will happen twice
Sure as fire, sure as ice

So it's broken hearts and dusty roads
And somewhere there my soul explodes
With every piece of every day
And everything I meant to say
And where I'll be, no one can tell
I'm fishing in a wishing well
And I'm doing the very best I can
I just hope you'll understand

Countless colors in my mind
They climb and swim and spark and glow

She?s a dream, she?s a dream 
Getting caught up in the scene 
Like a used car bought off of Mr Vaseline 
She?s a queen, she?s a queen 
Getting? played like a machine 
And all the men pretend that they respect her when they leave 
Hollywood 

There?s a man, there?s a man 
At least I think that he?s a man 
He?s struttin? down the street with a diamond on his hand 
Here?s the band, hear the band 
They?re the hottest in the land 
Just keeping up their contract for whatever?s in demand 
Hollywood 

Socialite, socialite 
Got a fancy appetite 
And a hundred dollar habit that she goes to every night 
But tonight, yes tonight 
Tonight she?ll do it right 
When they find her dead, she won?t be able to deny it 
Hollywood 

Sometimes I get so God Damned sick of these charades 
This town is so opaque, I swear the bums are wearing shades 
But I know that I?d be lying if I said it aint a thrill 
Don?t say I didn?t warn you when the Devil brings the bill 

Movie star, movie star in a tiny little car 
Doing 90 on the 10 coming home from the bar 
Big cigar, big cigar 
And a smoking little car 
He ran right off the road he didn?t make it very far 
Hollywood 

See the Freak, See The Freak 
He?s the flavor of the week 
The ratings all went up when they discovered he could speak 
So let him speak, yes hear him speak 
?his tone is so unique? 
but by the time commercial hits, you know his fame has reached its peak 
Hollywood 

Now it doesn?t really matter what I do or what I say 
There?s a millionaire buying every hour of the day 
If you want to see some change you got to change it from the street 
Change it with your hands, change it with your feet 

Advertise, advertise 
Slick and super size 
Buy the car, find true love, and a dozen other lies 
Surprise, oh surprise 
Its what everybody buys 
A fairytale fantasy, a demon in disguise

Molly would if she could 
But she?s stuck in Nebraska 
I had a truck and so I asked her where she longed to be

Many hours I spend looking for you 
Ever since you've been gone 

So I've been looking for you baby 
Every morning and every evening 
You never said the reasons 
But you said we'd meet again 

And when the storms that you once threw 
Get thrown back at you 
And you just can't stand to stand in your own skin 
I'll let you in 

I'm nailed to the tail of a whale 
At the bottom of an ocean 
Any day here I'll have to 
Come back up for air 

I'll be waiting for you baby 
In the city in the jungle 
Sitting pretty waiting for you 
Knock on my door 

So when the friends that you once knew 
Don't remember you 
And they tell you that you can't be born again 
I'll let you in 

I control the weather 
From a dial in the kitchen 
Lighting fires from the burner 
It's absurd but it works just fine

I've been to and have loved me 
And I've had to been sad to 
Had to leave cuz things got lost

Now all the streets are paved with petals, the parade is coming through 
it kind of feels like royalty cause? everyone?s in blue 
and yellow flowers falling, from a window too 
falling to the feet of such a coward 

The mayor is kissing babies, he?s almost way too kind 
we?re filled to the brim with honest men, they?re just way too hard to find 
so stare into his Public Eyes and watch his clock unwind 
then find him old and drowning in the deep end

i?m doing my best to recover from what time cannot repair 
and i?m sick of all this solitude and pre-rehearsed despair 
my eyes are a hundred miles away from sleeping 

Well I wish you?d write a letter, or telephone to me 
this place is dark and there ain?t a spark of who I used to be 
so the sick hearts of the unloved tell the brave souls of the sea: 
?we?re all closed up, why don?t you come back when we?re open.?

There?s a cracked and pale mirror, hanging on my wall 
the church bell rings and the choir sings and I can hear it from the hall 
Now you might not believe it, but there was no fire at all 
we just danced for seven days wishing for water 

Maria tells the fortunes, they line around the bend 
a dollar for your problems, and five to know the end 
They come from miles around; like a pack of howling men 
I wonder what she does with all that money 

but oh, now 
what else must i be?

Simple sidewalk painter, says his life is such a bore 
spends his time with a jug of wine and a palette on the floor 
he screams: ?Heaven! Take my eyes, cause I can?t paint no more.? 
Honey, sometimes I feel just like his colors 

I?m gonna go down to the ocean, I want to fill my boots with sand 
so the next time that you see me, I?ll be a much more grounded man 
So go and do whatever it is you do and I?ll do what I can 
and when we meet again you can try to know me

You got the bullets that don't ever miss

I want to see you in the light
I'm gonna keep you in my sight till the light comes

They cook me in the fire in the third degree

Jackie Henderson,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He's Funny That Way,2000
Jackie Hill Perry,"Fictitious foolies got me on a sick one
I'm still from Tha Side ready to die for the mission
Or meditate it, then I levitated
Elevated, celebrated
You should celebrate it, this is that embedded greatness
Good, good God
I'm a mad man, mathematics, statics
Stealin' the stars
I'm a bad man, bask into battle
I'm a battered mad hatter with the earth on a platter
Meek and mild 'til I get freakin' wild
It's a misconception messin' with your intellect
I reckon it'll be neck and neck
Before I let the deck eject the message
This is not a warning, this is what you wanted on the table
'Crae, let 'em know the lil' homie willin' and able
It's Givez

Vegas, get active
Flippin' your city like gentrification all in the ghetto upon a dirty mattress
Word to that sister actress
Nevada gets it crackin'
It’s hot and J got a jacket
We'll peddle back if you askin' if love's a long practice
Full metal jacket dually known as a banana clip when rappin'
That's a loaded magazine of ammunition
Plan out snippets so these magazines don't go bananas
Over loaded clips or flows floatin'
Only showin' sinkin' ships ten percent of why he's frozen
Let it go, it's hotter than sprinters in Arizona
Juxtapose 'em to a snowman in Nova Scotia
It's rap's Christopher Nolan
Picture me rollin', pistol emoji, blaow
This a misconception triple threat
Did Givens flex?
Still a Christian, yep
Don't need acknowledgement, just respect the conglomerate
Double tap it and follow it
They shocked to see us like Donald Trump up in a taqueria
Watchin' Evita, cryin' over Argentina
Or Maria dominatin' Serena
I'm tryna find a big homie for Slim Jesus
Thesis of a new hope
More hardcore than Star Wars part four rated R
Or Rosa Parks or feet kicked off the bus exitin' starboard
Light saves like a time change
Hands up and down like a sine wave
Gospel be the humble, don't sleep the beast is a mind frame

They told me that rap was stacked
Is it tracks, is it facts?
Is it trap, is it rats?
When metaphors, you ready for the medics stored inside it
Is it similes or violence?
Is it sympathy or similar
The sinner's lord's inside 'em
The problem ain’t wordplay
I get schizophrenic with sittin', straight jackin' the beat
Blood all on it, hashtag
A dracula scheme, trick or treat
It ain’t magic, I'ma vanish when I pass to the team
Thirty-two half that
Grab a 16 and let us shoot
Betty Boop wit the black top
I’m a mascot for the dreaded truth
Locks all in my head, ain’t no chain that I hang from
But He hang from where I came from, that’s death
Guess what, I ain’t done
I'm rappin'
Beneath it is Jesus reachin' for actors
Living halle', add the 'lujah with the asterisk
Correction, then bury the body under the mattress
Livin' my dream while you sleepin' in different caskets

Look, I was created to make a statement
A sentence sent us to earth on this mission
Tryna make a way for my siblings
Brothers and sisters who drinkin'
Out of them cisterns with cracks in 'em
Listen but lack hearin'
Who lookin' but lack vision
Initially made in the Lord's image, dynamic
Nothing lackin', magic couldn't make it happen
Look at us, you hear us rappin'
That ain't complaining but how can they be mad at all?
King dreamed a dream but we seen scenes that'll make us awe
Change the channel, we channel all of this energy
Pretend to be savages, we ravage our so-called enemies
That look like us
But it look like us ain't gon' make it less we shake it
We can't look back much
Turned around to give a helping hand
I'm like, man, they gon' make it, makin' baking soda boiling inside these pans
Now they're wondering, is it rap or is it Gospel?
Look all you need to know is I was dead, now I'm not though
Real recognizing real, and if they don't love me like Pac
They better respect how I'm movin' and that I'm never gon' stop
I hit my pastor on the cell, I said, I'm catching hell
Well, what you think they did to Jesus?
Only time will tell
Can't believe we rap about the faith and people like the sound
We out here workin' in the streets, you better ask around
Tell them other rappers we don't want it, they can have the crown
They have to lay it down when you hear that trumpet sound
We know who got the keys to the kingdom
When the King come, crown Him, and your king dumb if his kingdom ain't bout Him
Say it with your chest, when the bishop is the king and the knight
The queen get the rest
I'm the only pawn that's on one, back in two thousand and one
I was wishin' labels signed me, but now I own one
That ain't braggin', that's just motivation
Get your education, this industry overrated, Satan-saturated
Folk be lyin' to your face, and sayin' they glad you made it
Turn your back and you can hear 'em hatin' in they conversation
Oh, snake face with the same bait
And the same fate, fate, fate, that get your face ate, zero-eight bass
Nah, base like the base plate

But now I keep myself pepped

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams

There's a lady they call the gypsy
She can look in the future
And drive away all your fears

Everything will come right
If you'll only believe the gypsy
She could tell at a glance
That my heart was so full of tears

She looked at my hand and told me
My lover was always true
And yet in my heart I knew, dear
Somebody else was kissing you

But I'll go there again
'Cause I want to believe the gypsy
That my lover is true
And will come back to me someday

How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1957

Like the seasons, he'll come and he'll go
Just as free as a bird and as good as his word
That's why everybody loves him so

Always leaving his spoon in his coffee
Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

I viewed the morning, with much alarm

I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer but how strange the change from major to minor

Should my feet sometimes stumble on the way, stay with me.

And I go seeking shelter and I cry in the wind,
And though I grope and I blunder and I kneel and I'm wrong,
Though the rose buckles under where I walk, walk along

'Til I find to my wonder every task least to see,
Or that I can do it, pray, stay with me.

That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Jackie Street,"Before the threads of time began
Was pre-ordained a mighty plan
That I should walk with Him alone
The cords of trust unbroken


But fate foresaw my wandering eye
That none could yet restrain
To violate the friendship I
Would cause Him so much pain


Chorus:
And everytime I close my eyes
I see the nails, I hear the cries
He did not keep Himself away
He was no stranger to my pain
He walked a mile in my shoes
He walked a mile


Feet so dusty cracked with heat
But carried on by love's heartbeat
A man of sorrows filled with grief
Forgiveness was His anthem


No feeble blow from tongue or pen
Could ever sway my love for Him
Across the echoed hills He trod
And reached into my world.


Repeat chorus
",He Walked a Mile,1999
Jackie Street,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie

Jackie Thomas,"We had the starry eyes, and everything aligned
Where did the butterflies go, go, go
We were the racing hearts, couldn't be torn apart
When did we turn into stone?
Oh, oh

We fall so fast, but we crash so slow
Oh, oh

But if we keep holding on
I know we'll get back to the surface
Cause it's worth it
If we keep holding on
I know that nobody's perfect
But we'll work it out

We were just ankle deep, water started to creep
There was no keeping it out, out, out
We were riding the waves, surviving all the breaks
We didn't think we could drown, drown, drown
And we tried to get it back but we're sinking down, down, down

But if we keep holding on
I know we'll get back to the surface
Cause it's worth it
If we keep holding on
I know that nobody's perfect

Jackie Trent,"When you're alone, and life is making you lonely
You can always go downtown
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know - downtown
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?

The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown; things'll be great when you're
Downtown; no finer place for sure
Downtown everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows downtown
Maybe you know some little places to go to
Where they never close, downtown
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova
You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over
Happy again

The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares
So go downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown - waiting for you tonight
Downtown - you're gonna be all right now

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along

So maybe I'll see you there
We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares
So go downtown; things'll be great when you're
Downtown; don't wait a minute for
Downtown; everything's waiting for you

When the evening comes there's so much to do
You better put on your best and wear a smile

I know a place where the music is fine
And the lights are always low

Then you go downstairs to some tables and chairs
Soon I'm sure you'll be tappin' your feet
Because the beat is the greatest there

It's a swingin' place, a cellar full of noise
It's got an atmosphere of its own somehow
