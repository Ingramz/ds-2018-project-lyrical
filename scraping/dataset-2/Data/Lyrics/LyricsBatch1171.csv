The Rat Pack,"I'm doing my Christmas dreaming a little early this year,
No sign of snow around;
And yet I go around hearing jingle bells ringing in my ear,

Your promise must be the reason,
The happy season is here;
So I'm doing my Christmas dreaming a little early this year",Christmas Dreaming (A Little Early This Year),2007

Happy golden days of yore

The Rat Pack,"Sue wants a barbecue
Sam wants to boil ham
Grace votes for bouillabaisse stew
Jake wants a wienie bake, steak and a layer cake
He'll get a tummy ache too

We'll rent a tent or tepee
Let the town crier cry
And if it's RSVP
This is what I'll reply

In the cool cool cool of the evening
Tell 'em I'll be there
In the cool cool cool of the evening
You better save a chair
When the party's getting a glow on
Singing fills the air
In the shank of the night when the doings are right
You can tell 'em I'll be there

We, said the bumblebee, let's have a jubilee
When said the prairie hen, soon
Sure said the dinosaur
Where said the grizzly bear
Under the light of the moon
How 'bout your brother jackass
Everyone gave a cry
You coming to the fracas
Over his expected sighs

In the cool cool cool of the evening
Tell 'em I'll be there
In the cool cool cool of the evening
Slickum on my hair
When the party's getting a glow on
Singing fills the air
If I ain't in the clink
And there's something to drink
You can tell 'em I'll be there
If I can find the right sock by eleven o'clock
You can tell 'em I'll be there
If you need a new face or a tenor off base
You can tell 'em I'll be there
If I can climb out of bed, put a hat on my head
You can tell 'em I'll be there",In the Cool Cool Cool of the Evening,2007
The Rat Pack,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2007

Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh,
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob-tail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

The Rat Pack,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stoppin'
And I've brought some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate goin' out in the storm
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dyin'
And, my dear, we're still goodbyin'

Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

He doesn't care if it's ten below
He's just sittin' by the fire's cozy glow
He don't care about the cold and the winds that blow
He just says, ""let it snow, let it snow, let it snow"" (let it snow)
""Ooh wee,"" goes the storm
Why should he worry when he's nice and warm?
His gal by his side and the lights turned low
He just says, ""let it snow, let it snow"" (I don't care)

The Rat Pack,"Moments like this thrill me through and through
Careless moments like this close to you
Nonchalantly we'd dine and we'd dance
Yet my heart seems to melt in your grace
Sweet moments like this with the soft lights aglow
Make me long for your kiss though I know
I'd be just one of all your affairs
But at moments like this, who cares
I'd be just one of all your affairs
But at moments like this, who cares",Moments Like This,2007
The Rat Pack,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The Rat Pack,"Watching the world go by (watching the world go by)
Under a sunny sky (sunny sky)
Strolling 'round the park on a Sunday afternoon (Sunday afternoon)
Oh how the moments fly (oh how the moments fly)
Watching the world go by (the world go by)
When you're with your love
Life is a beautiful tune (life is a beautiful tune)

Even if clouds are there
Way up above
For us the day is always fair 'cause we're in love
Others may have some tears, others may cry
Darling not you and I (not you and I)
We'll spend years and years and years
Watching the world go by

(Watching the world go by) Some day Sunday
(Under a sunny sky) When church is through love
(Strolling round the park on Sunday afternoon) Hand and hand 'neath a crimson sky
We will dream as the world goes by
(Oh how the moments fly) One day one day,
(Watching the world go by ) Dreams will come true love
(When you're with your love ) They'll be beautiful days to see
(Life is a beautiful tune) In the future with me
(Even if clouds are there) Each tomorrow
(Way up above) We'll be fair
(For us the day is always fair 'cause we're in love) Free from sorrow just as long as you care
Others may have some tears (others may have some tears)

The Rat Pack,"She's a fool and don't I know it?
But a fool can have her charms
I'm in love and don't I show it?
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately, I've not slept a wink
Since this silly situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Then love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it?
She is cold, I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I","Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered",2007

The Rat Pack,"Driftin' Dreamin'
In an Azure mood,
Stardust gleamin' 
Thru my solitude:
Here in my seclusion, 
You're a blue illusion 
While I'm in this Azure interlude.
I'm not wanted I'm so all alone;
Always haunted
By the dreams I own;
But, though Im tormented
I must be contented

Right outside of my door
Blackbird, blackbird who do you sit and say

All thru the winter you hung around
Now I begin to feel homeward bound
Blackbird, blackbird gotta be on my way
Where there's sunshine galore

Pack up all my care and woe
Here I go, singing low
Bye bye blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she

Make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight

The Rat Pack,"The night is bitter, the stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder, suddenly you're a lot older
And all because of a gal who got away
No more her eager call, the writing is on the wall
All those dreams you dreamed, they have all gone astray

The gal who won you, she's run off and undone you
That great beginning has seen the final inning
I don't know what happened, its all a crazy game
No more - no more that all time thrill because you have been put though the mill
And never a new love will ever be the same

Good riddance, good-bye
Every trick of hers you are on to
But fools will be fools and where's she gone?
Where has she gone?

The road gets rougher, it's lonelier and it's tougher
With hope ya burn up, tomorrow maybe she'll turn up
There ain't no let up, live-long night, night and day

Ever since, since this world began
There ain't nothin' sadder than

Five feet seven - of bones and skin

But when she calls me: ""baby"" - I feel fine
To think she's frantically, romantically mine
She's slender, but she's tender
She makes my heart surrender
And every night, when I hold her tight
The feeling is nice - my arms can go around twice
My lean baby - she's so slim
A broomstick's wider - but not as trim
And when she starts to kiss me - then I know
I love her so, I'll never, ever, let her go
My lean baby - strange to see
And all that nothing - it belongs to me
And though she may be scrawny - she's OK
Because I wouldn't want her any other way
She's so skinny - she's so drawn
When she stands sideways - you (would) think (that) she's gone

I chased her - and I caught her
Then a diamond ring - I bought her

But here is the twist - she wears it right on her wrist

The Rat Pack,"Verse 
This day and age we're living in 
Gives cause for apprehension, 
With speed and new invention 
And things like fourth dimension. 
Yet we get a trifle weary 
With mr. einstein's theory, 
So we must get down to earth at times: 
Relax, relieve the tension. 
And no matter what the progress 
Or what may yet be proved, 
The simple facts of life are such 
They cannot be removed. 
Refrain 
You must remember this, 
A kiss is still a kiss, 
A sigh is just a sigh; 
The fundamental things apply, 
As time goes by. 

And when two lovers woo, 
They still say, ""I love you,"" 
On that you can rely; 
No matter what the future brings, 
As time goes by. 

Moonlight and love songs never out of date, 
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate; 
Woman needs man and man must have his mate, 
That no one can deny. 

It's still the same old story, 
A fight for love and glory, 
A case of do or die; 
The world will always welcome lovers, 
As time goes by.",As Time Goes By,2007

And here is the best part, you have a head start

I'm kickin' in the door 
As your breathin' gets faster 
Your trail of clues 
Is leadin' to disaster 

Once I looked into your eyes 
I thought they were true 
Innocence can turn to lies 
And now the finger points 
At you, baby

You should've known better 
Than to cheat on me 
Shame Shame Shame 
Now it don't matter 
So let me be 
You've got your own self to blame 
Now it's time to feel the pain 
Of your twisted little game 
It's such a cryin' 
Shame Shame Shame 
Shame Shame Shame 

Did you do your poses 
In the mirror 
Did you tell him 
Baby, baby please 
Did you twist his tongue 
And bend his ear 
Did you have him beggin', beggin' 
On his knees 

Once you looked into my eyes 
And told me you were mine 
Now I see your cheap disguise 
And you're runnin' out of time, baby

And starts a fire there and then I lose control

Damn man, we been walking forever
Well, Thalia's tracking system says we'll be there in just over an hour
Shit, at least we got good walking music
Or is that it?
No man, I'm queueing up the fourth album now, his final one
Nigga, what the hell are you talkin' 'bout? Man, he has like a million albums
I mean the final Young Sinatra, the fourth one
Aww shit man you had me trippin', I was about to say (yeah, yeah)

Shout-out my boy Henry right here in the studio
Ayy
Yeah
Check, check, mic check, one, two
Alright this is classic shit

Yeah, I could've never imagine that this shit here could happen
Went from the basement to thirty million just off of rappin'
Young Sinatra, that boy that brought you so many classics
Ain't never comin' with nothin' less than the illest tactics
Thought the series was over, but we just gettin' started
I won't ever leave this rap shit, no I can’t depart it
From the trap to the boom bap
Young Sinatra, to Tarantino
We know he do that
Bitch I got that flame, who dat
I'm the new Kanye when they was like, ""Who Kanye?""
I got that fire in my soul to make these classics, ayy
I decided to write this letter on a private jet
'Cause in many ways it still feels like I ain't made it yet
For every goal I attain I set like ten more
But I had to take a break to write you that's for sure
Take a moment and celebrate how we all alive
Had to write this letter here over a Nujabes vibe
Fuck that rapper shit, fuck a punchline
This for every single fan that know every single line
So I'm saying thank you for loving me
For setting me free and letting me be me

Thank you, thank you
For lettin' me speak my mind
And puttin' it all on the line
Through the sunshine and the rain
Through the good times and the pain

The Raunchy Young Lepers,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,1998

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

You had it all now you're chasing ugly angels up in Heaven
Your fun is soon over when
Summer ends
Summer ends

And now I hear
A dead man talking
They come and go
Like cats in the night

Who's the most evil
Of them all
Oh mirror mirror

Who's the most cunning
Of them all

Do you think you're on your own
Hey
In this old faded midnight
Hey
Somewhere you go on
Hey

Flashing the future in everybody's face
Were chased off schoolyards and into the streets

And these kids who changed everybody's lives
On forbidden streets with rusty knives
Who got spit upon but knew they'd arrived
To wipe out and rebuild for you and I

In dried out pools of the rich and bored
Breaking through and yet completely ignored
Destroying things that can't be restored
I adore and I'm completely in awe

Drowning all the things that came before
Who broke through like they're at war

Some Swedish rolls or some condiment
It's a natural response, the bells ring and we salivate

And we're dying for a taste
In our corners face to face

It's a physical attraction
Physical attraction, physical attraction

Maybe we shared a revolving door
In a savings bank or a department store
You were taking things back
I was coming for more when the thunder rolled

And maybe we touched on a subway train
Your voice was different but your face was the same
It went on and on in my memory as you swept by, by

And we're dying for a chance

And candle lights on little corner tables

For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Come on and win yourself a pretty kewpie doll

And the man said try your skill
Five shots for a quarter, make a duck hit the water
And give your little baby a thrill

And I felt I was nine feet tall

And knock the milk bottles off the shelf
You should've seen this chick, she was a dead eye dick
Hey I couldn't do better myself

And then my face got red and my chest swelled up
And my eyes bugged outta my head

I know the meaning of contentment
I am happy with the Lord

Just a plain and simple chapel

I searched and I searched but I couldn't find
No way on earth to find peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can

Right to the traffic cop

I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1969

Lookin' for a mysterious dark-haired man
 
In her younger days they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
And promised her he'd take her for his bride
 
Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was ameetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky

The Ray Conniff Singers,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say I love you
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs

Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers

My true love was true
I of course replied
""Something here inside
Cannot be denied""
They said ""Someday you'll find
All who love are blind""
When your heart's on fire
You must realise
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
""When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes""",Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,2008

Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me

If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow

The Raymonde Singers Etcetera,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,

And resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow

And we're changing our ways taking different roads
And love
Love will tear us apart again
And love
Love will tear us apart again
Why is the bedroom so cold
Turn away on your side
Is my timing at fault and respect run so dry

Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through all our lives
And love
Love will tear us apart again
Resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow

And we're changing our ways taking different roads
Do you cry out in your sleep
All my failings exposed?
And there's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold

Yet it's something so pure
I just can't function no more

And love

Assembling the knights and their swords were sharp
But there wasn't a hope in your English hearts
Hear our roar, hear our sound
We're gonna fight until we've won this town

Some are half-alive and some have run away
Hear our triumph, hear our roar

I'm the fox that cold rocks, and I'm comin correct
And what I want is a little respect
Now if I don't get it, I'ma have to take it
And prove to y'all that I can make it
All the way, and not slightly
For those of you who took me lightly
I'ma have to put you all in check
And maybe then you'll show me a little respect

And of course breath-takin
I proceed goin wild, if I'm not mistaken
I am woman, watch me roar
I don't run my rhymes, they pour
And I don't be takin shorts, I wear em
A rapper diss me, huh, I dare him
Cause if he does that, then he'll be makin
A big mistake, cause I start breakin
And you don't want me to break
When the gold around your neck is fake!
A 24-carat persona, but I'm not Madonna
You come out your neck, and I'ma treat you like your mama

To get wicked and kick it, and put em in check
And let em know the Double are's in effect
And since you're really captivated, super sexy, so seducin

I need a scratch, Howie Tee, are you ready?

How can you be hotter than July
I will tell you why, your guy
He wants to be my slave
I put him on a short leash, so he can behave
And you cover your face with a paperbag
Cause I'm the kinda girl your man wish he had
And you remind me of the Bride of Frankenstein
Your hair so short that I can read what's on your mind
And since we're on the topic of hair, let me mention
To all the girls that wear extensions
You gotta be like me, and that's legit
And when I put on my jeans, they fit
Cause I'm not lackin, in the back, and
I don't look like I be crackin
Up, Cause my body ain't flat
But yours kinda looks like that
And a lady like me cannot be dismissed
Leave the radio alone, cause you cannot adjust this
And if my tape ain't in the box, then press eject

A taste of love to
Build my hopes upon

To keep me holding on

The best of me

Take the rest of me

Though you're close to me
We seem so far apart

The Real Tuesday Weld,"Must have left my house at eight, because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame
The day before you came

Must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim

The sting that burns your open wounds.
I'll flood the ground. I swear on your grave, I'll bury this town,
But not for me, no never for me.

We have tested the buoyancy of loyalty.
You left our lungs for canteens.
You left our ankles for anchors.
We thought your arms were tied behind your back,
But elastic bands tied your hands.
You swim with reckless abandon.

Abandon ship! Mayday! Mayday!
Swim toward shore!
Our captain is overboard!
He punctured holes in the floorboards
To flood the bow just in time to bow out.
He's over bored and overboard.

Left in the wake, we man our own driftwood orphanage,
A second-hand sailor's fleet to flee.
But in the wake, we man our own driftwood orphanage.

It wasn't worth his breathe

A small spark lives 'neath all these ashes

You put me on a boat across the sea, in the name of victory
But much to my surprised when I arrived, there was no welcoming committee
Instead there was a man for me to kill, and now I see how this is all too real

Then I saw him standing with a bayonet
And as I ran towards him he hardly broke a sweat
When I took his life he fell to his knees
And as his eyes began to fade he whispered softly

Godspeed this letter, away from here
I've sealed it with my tears, and stamped it with my fists
And godspeed this letter, away from you
My work down here is through
I'm on my way to better days
And so are you

I'm in his pocket that I saw the picture of his children and his family
And I began to realize this person I despised, in actuality
Was not much different from myself
We probably could have taught each other many things
And now I know its much too late although I couldn't hesitate
I checked his gun, and his chamber was empty

Then I saw him standing with a bayonet
And as I ran towards him he hardly broke a sweat
When I took his life he fell to his knees
And as his eyes began to fade he whispered softly

Ah, get away, let's leave today, let's get away!

Not to heed them is a bad reflection
They'll show you the way to what you have been seeking
To ignore them you're only cheating
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
Why don't you get away? Get away
Lay awake at night till the sun comes up in the morning
Never excited; it all seems boring
Make up your mind which way to go about it
Choose your road, just don't doubt it

The Regents,"Do you remember back in old L.A. (Wo-oh-oh)
When everybody drove a Chevrolet (Wo-oh-oh)
Whatever happened to the boy next door,
Suntanned, crewcut, all-American Male?

Remember dancing at the high school hop
The dress I ruined with the soda pop?
I barely recognized the girl next door
With beatup sneakers and a pony tail

CHORUS:
Beach Baby, Beach Baby, give me your hand
Give me something that I can remember
Just like before, we can walk by the shore in the moonlight.

Beach Baby, Beach Baby, there on the sand
From July to the end of September
Surfin' was fun, we'd be out in the sun every day.

Oooh. I never thought that it would end
Oooh. And I was everybody's friend
Long hot days, Blue sea haze
Juke box plays, but now it's fading away.

We could'nt wait for graduation day
We took my car and drove to San Jose
That's where you told me that you'd wear my ring
I guess you don't remember anything!

And this old world will keep on turning

We had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Hold your warm and tender body
Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me

For the good times

I'll get along
You'll find another
And I'll be here
If you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow
Or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness

I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzlin' the room
Then you walked in and my heart went ""Boom""
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, ""This one's mine""

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking, ""What's she gonna do?""

In the living room stressin'
My father's stone-faced
While you're asking for his blessin'

That it might have been ourselves to blame at all

You shudder and beat your chest
But you'll never warm yourself up believe me
Where were you I'd made it through
But only god can judge me now, I hope he's in

Why do hearts break when we are on our own?
Just when you need to pump the life back in yourself
And why do earthquakes happen miles away?
When I only want the open ground to swallow me

Who told you I'd not come through?
Before I could speak to you in my defense
Who made you the righteous one?
When I'd only turned around for half an hour

Why do chalk lines tell an empty tale
Surely its bad enough to end up on the floor
And you can scratch your chin
And think you understand

And how can you know
What's going on inside my head?
Maybe I'm better off alive than in my bed

Don't talk shit cause your best to watch your back
Because umm, why you sleepin we creepin
And um, we got a fat sack of blueberries, its scary
My brother jerry told me one day
He said snoop when you reach the top will you please blaze a J
For me and my homie J d-o-g, who's in the penitentiary but see
Its still cool to me cause Ima swing it on bring it on
Got another fat sack so blaze up the ozone
It on like that we ain't no joke
So motherfuckin back off or jack off for my smoke, smoke, smoke

Why they wanna fuck with my smoke
Somebody tell me Why they wanna fuck with my smoke
They say no to dope, and ugh to drugs
But motherfuck that I'm a motherfuckin thug nigga

In the fence for a week and its perkin niggaz

Blowed outta mind, probably be the high some more

Mystica holders with pistolas and purple morta
Americas finest find me north of tha border
Please, no seeds, break bread cost an awful lot
Chay flag on a borca, slide in croca's
Splitters or the swishers, twisters, hundred sport cars
This for big tony, homey in the yinta

Dear mama
I've never spoke out holdin' on the pride
But I feel it's time to realese this pain inside
It was never a moment I didn't feel you love me
I just didn't want crack to take my mamma from me
I know it was rough, me and you at home
A young single mother with a son at home
With all the constant pressure
I've seen the scenery
But I just try my best to show what you mean to me
It helped me through it all, when my heart was torn
Cause I was in the jail the night to see my daughter born
I've learned a lot mama, turned my life around
I'm on with Dogg got some bomb we like brothers now
Thanks for prayin' for me, blessin' from me and my girl
And a character just like me I want to give you the world
I just want to thank you mama, for times you talked to me
I gave my hands to God and now he walkin' with me

Everyday in my life seems to be gettin' harder and harder

I mean mama had the hard times controllin' us
But that couldn't stop the state from parolin' us, we on the streets
Me and you - they saw me they saw you (together)
My younger brother we was closer then 1 & 2 (that's for real)
That's why I can believe she had ?? to do it
Mama caught us and you died at the trauma unit
It's a cold world and it's gettin' colder
Lookin' over my shoulder
I keep thinkin' you gon' walk through the door everyday now
And it was a bad dream when I saw you puttin' in the ground
But I shake it off
Got to keep it poppin'
I'm makin' beats now got the whole world jockin'
But I trade all the money in the world
Just for you to spend one day playin' with your baby girl

Stupid motherfuckers shoulda stepped when I warned 'em
I'm from the Boondocks of Compton, California
I'm just anxious to whoop some ass
I went to high school, but I flunked every class
So what makes you think I give a fuck about respect?
I'll put your bitch in check, and I'll bet
You won't run up, son of a punk and a bitch, too
I shoulda did a drive by on you and your crew

Man what's up? Yo, yo

Do-Ray-Me. But I don't sing, mothafucker
I kick shit with the King, mothafucker
Ice Cube will clock the cash, rock the mass
And if you run up, I'll sock your ass

Cuz I'm playin' punk niggas like Beethoven
So bust a cap or swing and die
Fuck Yul Brynner, it's still The King and I
Cuz where I'm from the sun don't shine
So One-Time hope I only bust one rhyme
But I bust one more for the suckers

Run with the beat as long as the track moves
Hot as lava, organized like a seminar
Serve you, your crew, him, and them and a
Couple of rap-saps who think they can get butt
You slipped and shit, so nitwit, just get the nuts
Stealin' your high hopes, watchin' you write notes
Better walk a chalk line, not fuckin' a tightrope
Rap slicker, thicker, quicker than others, then I stop swift
Shift from 1st to 5th, while you stop to shoplift
Take the mic stand whenever the duty calls
If I bust a nut for every rhyme I had, I'd get blue balls
Serious as drama, I'm-a watch her say ""Me too.""

Mothafuckin' police pull ya over, slam ya down
Then tell ya that your hood is their town
And I ain't goin' for no shit like that;
Cuff me up, take me to jail, I'll come back
Talkin' much shit, cuz I talk what the fuck I feel

I don't think I'm comin' back this way for more

But you don't care, that I've been run, through the mill

I'm not waiting around-I've about had enough
Maybe you'll never learn, how to show me your love
You can promise the world, but when push comes to shove
Baby you'll never learn, how to show me your love
Show me your love...love

Are your toys enough to keep you company?

I didn't need someone like you around
It makes it even harder to imagine
The life I'd be livin', if I hadn't found

The stars above were bright and new
I pulled them down for you

That I'd should have my chance and lose
Feel like I've been used to help you

Through another night
You spelled in out in black and white
Baby, that's just the way it is Baby
Baby, that's just the way it is Baby

They bring you back again today
Time has washed away my pain
You'll find that things have changed

And disappeared without a trace
You can't get back what you've erased

Bu you can't stop the world-No, from spinning around
You'll never stop the rain from falling down, down, down
Down, down, down
It's colder than I remember, at this time last December
The win was blowin' and, the skies are always grey
You said someday you're gonna leave that man...realize all that we've planned
Start all over again, under the southern sun
But it's a lie-You can't look me in the eye
Knowin' I won't understand you
Yeh I want to believe, oh that things will change
And it worries my heart, yeh to feel this strange
But I can't stop the world-No, from spinning around
You'll never stop the rain from falling down, down, down
I hope that you understand-You're always welcome at my door
And I hope you understand, that I""m not hoping anymore...hoping anymore
Yeh you want to believe, oh that things will change
And it worries your heart, mmm to feel this strange
But you can't stop the world-No, from spinning around
You'll never stop the rain from fallin' down, down, down
Down, down, down



",St. Paul,2001
The Rembrandts,"I kept you out past five-When we talk, we get so deep
The sun comes up too early...and I know you need your sleep
But I can't let you go, with just one kiss...from your tender lips
And I don't wanna wait, to feel the touch...of your fingertips
Is it too late...too late...too late to love you
Is it too late...too late..too late to love you
It's only Sunday morning, and the paper boy's gone by
I see you off to dreamland, and all that that implies
But I can't let you go, with just one kiss...from your tender lips
And I can't live without, the love I know...that I know you give
Is it too late...too late...too late to love you
Is it too late...too late..too late to love you
How'm I gonna get inside?
It seems no matter how I try
It's only ever down to you
Down to you!
Ahhhhhh......ahhhhhhh.....ahhhhhh
Now I can't let you go, with just one kiss...from your tender lips
And I can't live without, the love I know....that I know you give...to me
Is it too late?!...too late....too late to love you
Is it too late...too late...too late to love you
Is it too late...too late...too late to love you
Is it too late...too late...is it too late to love you
Is it too late?



",Too Late,2001
The Rembrandts,"I had to let you know...before I let you go
Something I must say...before you walk away
You are the one-You are the one
You are...you are the one
When all is said and done
For an eternity...I've loved you silently
Hiddin in my soul...and now it's time you know
That you are the one-You are the one
You are...you are the one
When all is said and done
(solo)
You are the one-You are the one
You are...you are the one
When all is said and done



",You Are the One,2001
The Rembrandts,"I don't want you
But I'm inclined to
I think you're the only fool like me

And if you want to
You could hurt me now
And bring me a world of misery

I don't wanna make you
I just wanna take you down
To the cool, clear water
Under the sun filled sky

Well, I need you and you need me
God alone knows why
God alone knows why

And if you want to
Have someone to love you now
Why shouldn't it be a fool like me?

'Cause we're the only ones laughin'
At Shakespeare's Tragedy
And wouldn't you miss my company?

I don't wanna make you
I just wanna take you down
By the cool clear water
Under the sun filled sky

Well, I need you and you need me
God alone knows why
God alone knows why
God alone knows why

I don't want you
Well, I'm inclined to
I think you're the only fool like me

Won't you meet me down
By the cool clear water
Under the sun filled sky?

Well, I need you and you need me
God alone knows why, oh yeah
By the the cool clear water
Under the sun filled sky

Well, I need you and you need me
God alone knows why
God alone knows why
Knows why
God alone knows why

The Remo Four,"Angie, Angie
When will those clouds all disappear?
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?
With no lovin' in our soul and no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie, Angie
You can't say we never tried

Angie, you're beautiful
But I hate that sadness in your eyes
Angie, I still love you baby
Remember all those nights we cried
All the dreams were held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here? Yeah

All the dreams we held so close
Seemed to all go up in smoke
Hate that sadness in your eyes
But Angie, I still love you baby
Everywhere I look I see your eyes
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
Come on baby dry your eyes
But Angie, Angie
Ain't it good to be alive
Angie, Angie, you can't say we never tried",Angie,1992
