Bobby Hackett,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2000
Bobby Hackett,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic,2000
Bobby Hackett,"You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you 'cause you're my thrill
You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
Every time I look at you I can't keep still
Hm
Nothing seems to matter
Hm
Here's my heart on a silver platter
Oh where's my will
Why this strange desire

Flaming higher and higher
Every time I look at you
I can't keep still
You're my thrill",You're My Thrill,2000
Bobby Hackett,"I got a big surprise when I saw you smile
I never dreamed that it could be
But now I realize since I saw you smile
There's only happiness for me
So 
Bye bye blues
Bye bye blues

Bells ring
Birds sing
Sun is shining
No more pining
Just we two
Smiling thru
Don't sigh
Don't cry
Bye bye blues
Blues",Bye Bye Blues,2001
Bobby Hackett,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,2001
Bobby Hackett,"I'll have to see my broker, 
Find out what he can do, 
'Cause I'm in the market for you.

There won't be any joker, 
With margin I'm all through, 
'Cause I want you outright, it's true.

You're going up, up, up in my estimation, 
I want a thousand shares of your caresses, too.

We'll count the hugs and kisses, 
When dividends are due, 
'Cause I'm in the market for you!",I'm in the Market for You,2001
Bobby Hackett,"Evenings are crowded with memories
Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town

You certainly know the right thing to wear
Moonlight becomes you, I'm thrilled at the sight
And I could get so romantic tonight

You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along

Bobby Hackett,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

And then I understand. mm
Her eyes afire with one desire
Then a heavenly kiss
Could I resist?

And then she holds me tight. mm
Her kiss, each fond caress
They lead the way to happiness
She takes me to paradise

Bobby Hackett,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,2001
Bobby Hackett,"Islands of Hawaii
Where skies of blue are calling me
Where balmy air and golden moonlight
Caress the waving palms of Wai KiKi

Valleys with their rainbows
Your mountains green, and deep blue sea
Your fragrant flowers and dreamy music
Unite and sing a aloha-hi to me

Bobby Hackett,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

Love does not stand sharing

Bobby Hackett,"I left my heart in San Francisco.
High on a hill it calls to me
to be where little cable cars 
climb halfway to the stars!
The morning fog may chill the air,
I don't care! 
My love waits there in San Francisco,
above the blue and windy sea.
When I come home to you, San Francisco,
your golden sun will shine for me!

Bobby Hackett,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering

Bobby Hackett,"You said someday you'd turn the tide,
And I'd be laughin' on the other side,
And you was right, baby,
Baby, you was so right!

You said someday the worm would turn,
I had some lessons that I had to learn,
And you was right, baby,
Baby, you was so right!

I gave you a story, you gave me the gate!
I wish you'd come back but you say it's too late.
I look kind of silly,
But I guess I'll hold it until you come back.

You said someday you'd pass me by,
That I'd be tellin' you just one too many lies,
And you was right, baby,
Baby, you was so right!

Bobby Hackett,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",(I Don't Stand) A Ghost of a Chance,2001

Bobby Hackett,"Summer journeys
To Niagara
And to other places
Aggravate all our cares
We'll save our fares

I've a cozy little flat
In what is known as old Manhattan
We'll settle down
Right here in town

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through
The zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Greenwich
Where modern men itch
To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see
With me

We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin

I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica Bay with you
And fair Canarsie's lake
We'll view

The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the wilds
And starve together, dear
In Childs'

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney
On a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

Our future babies
We'll take to ""Abie's Irish Rose""
I hope they'll live to see
It close

The city's clamor can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue
As black as onyx

We'll find the Bronnix Park Express
Our Flatbush flat, I guess
Will be a great success
More or less

A short vacation
On Inspiration Point
We'll spend
And in the station house we'll end

But civic virtue cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy",Manhattan,2001
Bobby Hackett,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new

Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams

Bobby Hackett,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,2002

Afrikaan Beat, We're dancing to the Afrikaan Beat,
I'm burning like the tropical heat
Dancing to the Afrikaan Beat.
 
If you think I hold you too tight, 
Just blame it on the music tonight.
The rhythm soon will make it seem right,
Then your heart and mine will unite.
 
While they play the Afrikaan Beat,
Keep dancing to the AFrikaan Beat,
You're in my arms, the feeling is sweet,
Dancing to the Afrikaan Beat.
 
Let me whisper into your ear
While we are in the right atmosphere,
And no one else would dare interfere,
Why I love to hold you so near.
As they play the Afrikaan Beat.
 
Like a jungle breeze will kiss the trees,
Please let my lips caress your lips as we sway.
Let us dance while the stars all fade away.
Till the break of day here's where we belong,
While the music plays that siren's song.
while we are together, my love,
Let's always stay together my love.
And we can sway forever, my love,
Long as they keep playing my love.

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?

If I could just get away 
With my man

Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

In the sunny South when I was a tot so high
And now that I have grown

And let me dream a dream or two
Sing me to sleep

I'm hearing a song, a song through the trees

Familiar to me, I've heard it before
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, that's Southland

And dream all your troubles away

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by

Bobby Hart,"We were speaking of belief
Beliefs and conditioning
All belief possibly could be said to be the result of some conditioning
Thus the study of history is simply the study of one system of beliefs
Deposing another and so on and so on and so on
A psychologically tested belief of our time is that the central nervous
System, which feeds it's impulses directly to the brain, is unable to
Discern between the real and the vividly imagined experience,
If there is a difference, and most of us believe there is
Am I being clear?
To examine these concepts requires tremendous energy and discipline
To experience the now without preconception or belief
To allow the unknown to occur and to occur requires clarity
For where there is clarity, there is no choice
And where there is choice, there is misery

If I had told her that I loved her
She would have stayed til who knows when,
but I guess she couldn't understand it
when I said I wanna be your friend,
because a friend would never doubt you 
or ever put you uptight, 
and now I wonder what she's doing tonight.
oh yes I wonder what she's doing tonight?
oh I wonder what she's doing to night?
 
We were so close but we should've been closer
and it's making me feel so sad
but I tell myself I didn't lose her
'cause you can't lose a friend you never had
because a friend won't say it's over 
and got out just for spite.
and now I wonder what she's doing tonight,
oh yes I wonder what she's doing tonight?
oh I wonder what she's doing to night?
 
A friend will always be there 
if you're wrong or if your right,

It hurts so bad, cause when I see you, I start crying,
I've tried everything to stop, but there's no denying,
That falling in love with you, girl, is just like dying.

Oh, don't walk away,
How, how can I make you stay?
Don't turn away,
I can still hear you saying those words that never were true,
Just spoken to help nobody but you,
Words with lies inside,
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through.

Girl, don't you know we could work it out with talking?
You won't look around or slow down your walking,
I've given you everything with kiss to seal it,
You had to get your kicks out of trying to steal it.

Now, I'm standing here,
Strange, strange voices in my ears,
I feel the tears,
But, all I can hear are those words that never were true,
Just spoken to help nobody but you,
Words with lies inside,
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through, ahh.

Bobby Hatfield,"When the twilight is gone
And no songbirds are singing
When the twilight is gone
You come into my heart
And here in my heart you will stay while I pray

My prayer is to linger with you
At the end of the day
In a dream, that's divine
My prayer is a rapture in blue
With the world far away
And your lips close to mine

Tonight while our hearts are aglow
Please tell me, tell me the words
That I'm longing to know

May they still be the same for as long as we live
That you'll always be there at the end of my prayer",My Prayer,2006

Now how could you ask for more?
Than ticklin' the ivory
Singin' jive
I repeat what I said before

I like to sing a little tune that's mellah
I like to vocalize
There's nothin' swellah

An airline ticket to romantic places

A fair ground's painted swings

And candle lights on little corner tables

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed""

In the morning and started to laugh

Bobby Jarzombek,"From memories of 68 when the wizard shook the world
Metal came from foundries where the midlands sound unfurled
The bullring was a lonely place of concrete towers and steel
The coal mines and the industries were all I had to fell.

Something inside took hold of me, I really didn't know
But overtime it came to be, I knew which way to go
I drove around in search of what would make this all come true
From jazz and electricity and good old southern blues

Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell

In Henry's and in mother's where I'd go to bang my head
The feeling took a hold of me with every word I said
The voice was born and came alive from all I saw and heard
And now I knew my destiny, I had to spread the word.

I took the scream around the world
From London to L.A.
Unleashed in downtown Tokyo
Blew Godzilla away

Then on the sound and fury went from Sydney to Brazil
It sent the Russians crazy cause they never get their fill.

Of Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell
Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell

The stage and the lights and the amps are ablaze watch them burn
From all this insanity the Metal God's will return.

Shock waves attack relentlessly, intimidating force
So many bands surrounding you with evil from our source
It screams across the universe and slams you to the floor
This blitzkrieg psycho mania is coming on full roar
The world's a stage that's waiting for its bad ass to get kicked
And we're all on the road to hell and that's route 666

Gosh all, git up, how'd they get that size?

Golly gee, when you turn those heaters on
Woe is me, got to put my cheaters on

Bobby Jaspar,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2001
Bobby Jaspar,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart

Bobby Jaspar,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert

Bobby Jaspar,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,2006

Bobby Jaspar,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How about You? [False Start],2008

Bobby Jaspar Quartet,"I look at you and suddenly, something in your eyes I see;
Soon begins bewitching me.
It's that old devil moon that you stole from the skies.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.

You and you glance make this romance too hot to handle.
Stars in the night, blazing their light can't hold a candle;
To your razzle-dazzle.
You've got me flyin' high and wide, on a magic carpet ride;

Full of butterflies inside.
Want to cry, want to croon, want to laugh like a loon.
It's that old devil moon in your eyes.
Just when I think, I'm free as a dove.
Old devil moon, deep in your eyes, blinds me with love.",Old Devil Moon,1954
Bobby Jay,"As I was slowly passing 
An orphan's home one day, 
I stopped for just a little while 
To watch the children play. 
Alone a boy was standing 
And when I asked him why, 
He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child. 

No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven 
Where all blinds can see. 

And just like for the other kids 
It will be a home for me. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child.",Nobody's Child,1998
Bobby Jimmy,"How did roaches get started
Started by dirty people and
They was nasty, sleazy, sloppy
They house they never clean it

Roaches have big families
Your house they think they own
I tried to kill one on the couch
Using my telephone

Roaches think they cute
Girl i'm not impressed
It ticks me off when I find 'em
Wearin' my momma's dress

Look at all these roaches
Around me everyday
Need somethin' strong
To make 'em go away
Look at all these roaches
I can't take it no more
Get up at night, turn on the light
And see the floor show

Did you hear the one about tina
Who's sloppy as a moose
She got some raid, then she sprayed
They drank it like orange juice

Did you hear the one about michael
They say his roaches are gay
I tried to fumigate to make 'em straight
But they just stayed that way

Lots of pesticides
Big money I done spent
None of them be workin'
So I charge my roaches rent

Look at all these roaches
Around me everyday
Need somethin' strong
To make 'em go away
Look at all these roaches
I can't take it no more
Get up at night, turn on the light
And see the floor show

Can't go no place
The drain board they would linger
They see my face, they laugh
They flip me off with the middle finger

They run so fast
They always get away
I bet you there'll be roaches
Runnin' around on judgement day

I think i'll write the mayor
Have him pass a law
That would help me get these nasty roaches
Off my wall

Look at all these roaches
Around me everyday
Need somethin' strong
To make 'em go away

I can't take it no more

(Roach and rapper arguEing)
My house is fine, I ain't got time
For roaches over here
Came home from a hard days work
And found they drank all my beer
My house is fine, I ain't got time
For roaches over here
Came home from a hard days work
And found they drank all my beer

Well I be chillin' in the bathtub
Swimmin' in the pool
Eatin' leftovers
Is the golden rule
Well i'm the hip hop roach
And i'm raisin' hell
When i'm in NY
I'm down with LL
Rats don't like me
But I don't care
'cause i'm down by law
And this I swear
When i'm in L.A.
I'm down with Bobby Jimmy
I like bad
And he's got plenty

The roach
The roach is on the wall

This is a raid
