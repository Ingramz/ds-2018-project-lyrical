Solomon Burke,"I'm so happy to be here tonight
So glad to be here in your wonderful city
And I have a little message for you
And I want to tell every woman and every man tonight
That's ever needed someone to love
That's ever had somebody to love them
That ever had somebody's understanding
That's ever had someone to need your love all the time
Someone that's with them when they're up
Somebody that's with them when they're down
If you had yourself somebody like this you better hold onto 'em
Let me tell you something
Sometimes you get what you want
And you lose what you have
There's a song I sing
And I believe that if everybody would sing this song you can save the whole world
Listen to me

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody wants somebody to love
Honey to hug, yeah
Sugar to kiss
Baby to miss now, yeah
Baby to tease
Sometimes to please, yeah
And I need you you you
And I need you you you
In the morning baby you you you
When the sun goes down you you you
Ain't no nobody around you you you

Whoa listen to me,  sometimes I feel like
I feel a little sad inside
When my baby mistreats me
And I can't get a little little mad
But I need you you you
Just to see me through children
Somebody to hold my hand
When I feel a little lonely, oh but I want to hear you say yeah
Oh baby say yeah, I want to hear you say yeah

I say yeah yeah
Yeah
Somebody
I just want my woman to stand up and say I love you
I want someone to be a witness tonight

I just want somebody to squeeze tonight yeah",When The Saints Go Marching In,2013
Solomon Burke,"I read your letter
Tears filled my eyes
All of your promises failing
Nothing but lies
So I turned your photograph over face to the wall
And when I dim the light in my room tonight
Teardrops will fall

Teardrops will fall tonight
Tears I can't hide
Tears that I tried to keep deep down inside
Tears from the love that's gone beyond recall
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight
Teardrops will fall

I'm going to pray tonight baby
Hoping you will hear
Maybe you'll right the wrong and dry each tear
I'll sit alone tonight hoping you will call
And when I dim the light in my room tonight
Teardrops will fall

Teardrops will fall tonight
Tears I can't hide
Tears that tried to keep deep down inside
Tears from the love that's gone beyond recall
And when I dim the light in my room tonight
Teardrops will fall

Solomon Burke & The Souls Alive Orchestra,"Poor little dreamer
Stand inside the door
You can't find the easy rhymes
Of time you had before

It hurts my heart so bad
Seeing you sigh and shake
Broken down so low - so sad
I can't let you break

Cry to me - cry to me
You better not hide it
Let it come - let it bleed
I ain't laughing - reach in and get it
And set it free
Cry to me - cry to me

The glass is empty and the wine
Is bitter on your tongue
People don't seen wild and fine
Like when you were young

You're lonesome over a stormy ocean
Lost in the rain and wind
We can clear these clouds away
And feel the sun again",Cry to Me,1994
Solomon Burke & The Souls Alive Orchestra,"Down in the valley, the valley so low,
Late in the evenin', hear the train blow.
Hear the train blow, dear, hear the train blow,
Late in the evenin', hear the train blow.

The train won't stay, love, it goes right through.
It will be gone, love, and so will you!
Know I love you, dear, know I love you,
Angels in heaven know I love you!

The train is gone, love, and out of sight;
Goodnight my darlin', darlin' goodnight!

Solomon Burke & The Souls Alive Orchestra,"Got to get you off of my mind
I know it's just a matter of time
You've found somebody new
And our romance is through
Yes it is

Gonna throw your picture away
You didn't want my love, any old way
You've found somebody new
And our romance is through
Yes it is

Some folks love is hard and strong
That's the kind of love that lingers on
Some folks love is swift and fast
That's the kind of love that'll never last

We had a love that was in between
And to me it was like a dream
If we had stayed together till June
Not a problem, bride and groom

Solomon Childs,"Yo, behind those mahogany walls
Indoor pools with steel doors, flipping eggs over in my silk drawers
While I""m charging my cell, sparking the L
Baby mother reading my mail, just that they switched seats
To another jail, and his banger is old fire
He's locked up with them dudes from the fucking Wire
That's when I passed her the bone, started to cough
And flossed all through the house, robe on, rugger out
Homebuyers see the sign, yeah y'all, I'm moving out
In front of the crib, niggas flipped, I had to shoot it out
Thirty G, living room sets, porcelain plates
With big giant wall units, even the front grass
Saw your boy doing it, Tone Stark he'll never fall
I even put work in, under the floor
In the box with the ox, and my skeleton jaw
Tell 'em soldiers I'm in the bush if the President call

[Chorus]
Get 'em, the'll be nothing but smooth sailing
When the heat shot, now your crew's bailing
I refuse to bow down, refuse to lay down
Go five and turn, to let the biz, all I found

Man I thought we told y'all niggas before, Wu-Tang is for the children
P.O.'s violate your dirty urine
These dealers in the lobby of my building, ice grilling
I don't catch cold to catch feelings
I put in that work, then catch millions
If that don't work, back to stealing
Snatch me a purse, and stack real in
Meth, I'm that dealing, millionaire, slash chameleon
I mastered the juks, one of my niggas ""Masta, killing""
Spray shots, clap civilians at the dealing table
Off of the love of crack dealing
Once again the fatal, flying guillotine, the millions
Paper rob me able, my woman is all pre-matul
I got mouths to feed, nigga, and I'm the hand that rocks the cradle
Just like Hova, but I ain't trying to 'roc' the label
I'm a soldier, I stay on job, me, eye a coka
Honey's wanna fuck and the industry fucks 'em over

[Chorus]

I got my Ghostface on, cause, I'm a Killah
I live the Streetlife, why, I'm that nigga
Label me a beast, call me U-Godzilla
When I rumble in the jungle, I go gorilla
Step on the set, Inspectah Deck you
Dead in your face, straight RZArect you
You highly mistaken, I'm hotter than Satan
Catch me in the kitchen with blood on Chef apron
I'm known to, Cap a Don, big gun in my palm
I'm like my arm is gone, plus I Masta the Kill
Give you something, you can really feel
Got many Methods to kill a Man, if it's real, you real
The world's worse like Dirt McGirt
Fuck a bitch raw dog, then dig in her purse
Yeah that boy's a Genius, I stay fresh like I'm straight out the cleaners
I walk hard like a criminal, holding my penis

Solomon Childs,"The storm is

Females better try to trick me now
Cats better try and Out Think Me Now
Stick me now, maybe even kill me now
Let me dominate for two years strong
You motherfuckers'll never stop the storm

What? Yeah
Uh-huh, what? Yeah
You cowards follow, I'ma lead
Millennium speed, Jeopardy, Greed
Golden seed, militant breed
This is all a real thug need
Science of life dunn, black Oriental
Forever bronze to star, day room war
Apocalypse raw
Limit the sky, let me simplic-ify
Mama said, ""God should never cry""
War with The Source, ya girl know me, straight live
Found out swine was in Pop Tarts in '85
You old school cats is talkin' jive
320 E, bumping Tony Starks shit
I don't trust a soul
I don't trust Canal Street gold
I don't trust Timberland's double sole
I don't trust cats on the block who done told
I don't trust Avirex leathers when it be cold
Settin' fire to ya rap books
Frontin' you could get punched in ya mouth
King of New York, this is what a thug about

[Chorus: x2]

Uh, yeah
Apocalypse gifted storm, eyes of Islam
Pain inside Maria eyes
Money low got the Gods in the streets heated
Left the Queens in the world seated
Two kids my baby mom's speeded
Poverty, swears Allah cheated
Keep it strawberry, catchin' cancer
Missin' the World Series
Solomon Childs extraordinaire
Power of the dollar
Body Brighton, Allah body
Thugged out, ready to flip
2000 New York rookie
Hard to hit, who want beef?
Put 'em on the murder cross, imperial laws
Consider me bein top rank
With Pony and Frank
Yo what the deal, Lunar?
No more small cookies
Rather get paid and crush rookies
Me and Mama gettin land with this voice box
Tracks hotter than the Red Sox
Who ever had doubts..
Yo Baby Boy, this is what a thug about

Gucci sweaters for all of my niggaz
Calm braided, chrome rims

What happened to the fist fights, the MC battles, nigga?
Slingin newspapers on the Verrazano Narrow
Gettin off the fifth train on Carol to get wet
Summertime sweat got me rockin short sets
From the loaf tops, no socks, Hawaiian suits
Tied nicely with the wooden spoon for the scoop
Young girls playin double Dutch and hoola-hoops
Cap'n Crunch and Fruit Loops, camels and goose boots
It was the FUBU, the stripped Lee's, the Hoopty's
Five dollar bag of weed's a real bag of weed
A ki was at twenty g's, hurled one at dope fiends
O.D., niggaz throwin bricks at my click
Now Giulianni got the state N.Y. locked like cuff
Black Bad Boys gettin rich like Puff
The Excursion truck need two spots on the parkin lot
A stash box for the top, the lock

Brook-nam, grace and charm, remain calm with chron's of Lebanon
Black man author, green Leprechaun from Lexington
P. Sunn, I crack ya face with the gun
Smack the taste outta ya dunn, ya fam's on the run
Now why'all respect Sunn, shine all type direction
Hype discretion with the right connection, recitin lessons
But my wea-pon reign automatic projection
Blow out ya reception, hose through ya reflection
Old gold complexion, Sunn I'll swoll to perfection
Did a fifteen, me and my team, supreme legends
Twenty-one-two, I get that money with the Wu
Up in the Cayman Islands, bitches sweeter than honey dew

Hmm, I love this game coz this game love me back
I'm pushing a lac, smoking sacs like a mad mac
Bringing me back, banging the 8-track track

Big stars in big cars we pull up at the big clubs and sit at the big bars
Sippin' champaign with a bowl of cavier
Hell yeh you are, yeh you are
Say it say it, coz they all deny it
Player play it, coz you can't deny it
As fly as it get, as fly as I spit you know its the shit
It's so gangsta, gangsta bitch
Switch back to the old school, old fools know
This here thang we do so original
I got to have it, lavish
Is how we establish
On the real love one it feels good to have

Like a rose, flippin down the street
Looking oh so sweet (lookin' oh so sweet)

Solomon Childs,"[Intro: sample (Solomon Childs)]
I need you... in a desperate way
All the girl, I've met, were so full of play (uh)
Your brown eyes, converted me (son, son, you see her right there)
And let me know (aww she's right) That you're the right girl for me
(I'm feelin' her, right there, son)
(Man, I gotta go talk to her, son, hold on for a minute, son)

[Solomon Childs]
Excuse me, what's good, girl? You look familiar
Was you on the Ron G. ski trip in '95
I see you 'round the way, pushin' you mans Q-45
And watch you and your home girls, get excited
From the blunt smoking, in the Escalade, sittin' on 25's
By the way, where you from? (get 'em) and can I come?
You gigglin' baby, at the same time, jigglin' baby
You like, I like in Queens, don't laugh
But my sisters used to call me a tomboy
And I was born in Providence, small neighborhood
Ain't much not, and use to date Pretty Lou from the Lost Boyz
So captivated by the way you walk, so caught up by the way you talk
Just could imagine, how you scream and moan, ass big as Miss Jones

[Interlude: Solomon Childs (sample)
So I'm sayin', you think we can get together?
Spend a little time with each other and maybe you could (be my girl)
I mean, damn ma, look at how we look together (be my girl)
It's like the way you smilin' right now, you got a brother over (be my girl)
I'm tellin' you, we could probably start somethin' new out this (be my girl)
I'm tellin' you, man

[Solomon Childs]
White snow and the alpine, the kid glide
With a gangsta slide, and your beautiful eyes
We could be the next hottest thing (you know)
Since Pebbles and L.A. Reid, NorthFace snow suits
With custom made Menolo ski's
First of all girl, I know you need 24-7 time (it's only right)
But I'm a hustler, man, I play the blocks too much
And know how you yearn for a thugs touch
Crazy, as gorgeous as you is, you don't even ask for much
A Corona with a lemon and a Dutch (right)
Pina Coladas when the beach get hot
Cover girl, you got my stomach all caught up in knots
Street rebel or not, put it like this
We got somethin' called Ghetto Love insurance
So you keep it faithful to your boo
And your boo, will keep faithful to you

[Outro: Solomon Childs (sample)]
And then maybe, you can (be my girl)
I'm tellin' you ma, your home girls is even gonna like me (be my girl)
Even your moms, your aunties, your nana (be my girl)
They all gonna dig us, they gon' like how we look (be my girl)
They gonna know what's up with the chemistry (be my girl)
For real, so I'm sayin', so I'm sayin', so I'm sayin' (be my girl)
(Be my girl, be my girl
I need you... in a desperate way
All the girl, I've met, were so full of play
Your brown eyes, converted me
And let me know, that you're the right girl for me)",Be My Girl,2004
Solomon Childs,"Uh-huh, who, just smoothing it out, right now
My nigga Halloween, we gon' get rich this year, nigga (see)
Sip on this little bit of odor, made brown
Zone out, turn the lights off
Ant boogie, what up? Uh-huh

In the crib, with my wiz, getting my grown man on
Listening to classic soul, with the slow jams on
Smokey Robinson, Tears of a Clown, shedding tears
Popping beers, almost twenty five years in the town
I seen niggas die off, like dandelions in the fall
Niggas heard of Chip Banks and left him lying in the hall
Your boy Sandy Brock was ill, like Kobe Bryant with the ball
It's no exceptions, even the biggest giants gotta fall
Cause we living in denial, but these lessons are vital
When marinating in the slums, you gotta practice survival
Now everybody wants to be next American idol
But these are more than just songs pressed up your vinyl
Being rich is a poor man's dream, and we all wanna shine
But we all can't green, knahImean?
Being rich is a poor man's dream, and we all wanna shine
But we all can't green

[Chorus]
I grew up hard, maybe you grew up harder
But I ain't been to many operas
Or had money for private doctors
As harsh it sound, these just a tears of a clown
I grew up hard, maybe you grew up harder
The message is I'm too strong to hold down
I know the ledge, and I ain't planning to drown
As harsh it sound, these just a tears of a clown

Momma ain't raised no fool, they say we gotta save the children
But first, we gotta save our spoons
I was taught not to waste my food
Even if I didn't like it, every scrap on my plate got chewed
Either you ate, or you didn't eat, the memories are bitter sweet
Used to get teased by my friends, cause I had bigger feet
I think about them jokes and laugh, crack a smile
Cause as a child, I never knew that being broke was bad
Growing up I was close to my dad, but that still didn't stop a nigga
From putting that coke in them bags
That was the past, now, I'm riding with the oak in the dash
Got jealous niggas hating, big time, hoping I crash
I can't blame 'em, and on the same note, I can't change 'em
Let a nigga disrespect my shit, I'm gonna flame 'em
That's word to my son little Jay, my little homey
Ask niggas how your boy get down, ain't nothing phony

[Chorus]

Yeah, they say two heads are better than one, and in the process
I learned that slow progress, is better than none
That's why I'm still here pursuing my goals, baking that bread
In the bakery, if I ain't out, doing no shows
I hit the block, once in a blue, and front with the crew
And show niggas a good time, by getting drunk in the stud'
Some niggas find happiness, with a blunt and a brew
They talented niggas, but they just need something to do
It's kinda hard try'nna look beyond buildings and bricks
We can't condone broken homes, when our children is sick
Tryina' survive off the cereal and milk from the WIC
And all the good ones we got, be getting killed in the mix
He could of been the next Jordan, who knows, the next Emmit
Young Tiger Woods, or the new Arthur Ashe of tennis
That's why I'm looking past the gimmicks, getting cash with Dennis
Criminal grind, we gonna smash the business

Mix coke with dust, still can hold me
What made ya muthafuckas think you control me?

[Lounge Mode]
Staten Island been wildin', so Osama's nothing
And my niggaz out in Brooklyn said Saddam was frontin'
Gotta squad, what you think, it ain't no guns or something?
Picture Me Rollin', holdin' less than a one or somethin'
You fake faggots, yeah we got that big automatic
Like, Bruce Willis and the Jackal type, yeah, right
You want to see it? Then get on my nerves
Oh you live, and I'm gettin' money spit on my curb
In the hood where it get no harder, only tougher
Crack fiends suffer, baby moms, baby brother
Hustlin', still forty off a hundred packs
I'd rather lounge in the back of the bar
Me and my dog throw crack in the jar
Listen to this rap star, while I sit back in the car
And I told ya'll niggaz how the Staten rock
We don't, trick on chicks, yo we clap them shots
You get caught if you ask a lot, like you don't know
And where you at, then ya ass is got

We bringin' back the Twin Towers, 20-0-3, crack game electronic
Conceived with slow jams by The Delfonics
At a level that you should of been years ago
Responsible usually for coke traffic, usually for broken bone tragic
Rest in peace, to Mayor Guliani's term
They say I'm wrong, shit
I'm try'nna see 26, with my daughters at the Emmy Awards
All around the ball glowin', they got the weed flow droughted
Or maybe niggaz in the hood just ain't 'bout it
Talkin' Hercules, and ain't nothin' but dog food
Staten Island, New York City drools
Crazy glue on my fingerprints
Name on the concrete of my hood, what's really good?
Vendetta's with these rap stars
Frontin' like this crime and the pet is they cars
Believe I was God in my last life
What if it was your knife? What if they was your gloves, nigga..

[Chorus]

[Cappadonna]
Aiyo, I came into this game on some real love shit
And ya'll bitch ass niggaz, ya'll wanted me to quit
Because the way I dress ill and the way that I spit
But I ain't never gon' stop, droppin' these joints
And ya'll fake ass niggaz, ya'll ain't gettin' no points
Don't try to sabotage me, 'cause you just can't do it
You had me in the Square, last year, but you blew it
Big Donna from the group home, that's my word
Splash shots at your whip, splash shots at your bird
Leave your brains and your Gucci boots up on the curb
Pillage for life, Allah's will be the most superb
Smoke weed with the cannon, smoke the herb
So bow down, all you crab ass clowns you can't live
My gun's on empty, but it's more shots to give
I pop you like a slave cop, run in your crib
Throw darts at your wife, throw darts at your kid
Leave your house flooded with hits like O.J. did
Escapin' the crime scene and you love how I slid

Indoor pools with steel doors, flipping eggs over in my silk drawers
While I""m charging my cell, sparking the L
Baby mother reading my mail, just that they switched seats
To another jail, and his banger is old fire
He's locked up with them dudes from the fucking Wire
That's when I passed her the bone, started to cough
And flossed all through the house, robe on, rugger out
Homebuyers see the sign, yeah y'all, I'm moving out
In front of the crib, niggas flipped, I had to shoot it out
Thirty G, living room sets, porcelain plates
With big giant wall units, even the front grass
Saw your boy doing it, Tone Stark he'll never fall
I even put work in, under the floor
In the box with the ox, and my skeleton jaw
Tell 'em soldiers I'm in the bush if the President call

Get 'em, the'll be nothing but smooth sailing
When the heat shot, now your crew's bailing
I refuse to bow down, refuse to lay down
Go five and turn, to let the biz, all I found

Man I thought we told y'all niggas before, Wu-Tang is for the children
P.O.'s violate your dirty urine
These dealers in the lobby of my building, ice grilling
I don't catch cold to catch feelings
I put in that work, then catch millions
If that don't work, back to stealing
Snatch me a purse, and stack real in
Meth, I'm that dealing, millionaire, slash chameleon
I mastered the juks, one of my niggas ""Masta, killing""
Spray shots, clap civilians at the dealing table
Off of the love of crack dealing
Once again the fatal, flying guillotine, the millions
Paper rob me able, my woman is all pre-matul
I got mouths to feed, nigga, and I'm the hand that rocks the cradle
Just like Hova, but I ain't trying to 'roc' the label
I'm a soldier, I stay on job, me, eye a coka
Honey's wanna fuck and the industry fucks 'em over

I live the Streetlife, why, I'm that nigga
Label me a beast, call me U-Godzilla
When I rumble in the jungle, I go gorilla
Step on the set, Inspectah Deck you
Dead in your face, straight RZArect you
You highly mistaken, I'm hotter than Satan
Catch me in the kitchen with blood on Chef apron
I'm known to, Cap a Don, big gun in my palm
I'm like my arm is gone, plus I Masta the Kill
Give you something, you can really feel
Got many Methods to kill a Man, if it's real, you real
The world's worse like Dirt McGirt
Fuck a bitch raw dog, then dig in her purse
Yeah that boy's a Genius, I stay fresh like I'm straight out the cleaners
I walk hard like a criminal, holding my penis

Solomon Olds,"So this is real, the window sill, it cannot heal.
All the secrets are here now.
All I've known, my cover's blown, the ages shown.
You know that they all fake the hope.

The neon lights, the fade of night, the fear of heights.
The complex and effects start.
Breaking tide to beach the white, and early light.
And the water only from His side.

All alone.
There's whispers of defenses gone.

This is the way, this is the motion.
Let go now.
This is the threat, this is the ocean.
Let go now.

And so it's made, the frozen shade has turned my gaze.
This effect is in motion.
Strength is gone, my breath is on the last is drawn.
You know that it will soon be gone.
Still I wait in today and complicate.
And all time is just frozen.
I see through, was never you, and what you said.
The hope is where His hand has bled.

Just let go.

I got my bands and my shades on,
Hit the floor, I hear my song,
And then I see this girl,
And I'm like hold up wait,

In the world, 
Turnin' heads all up in dis party,

Standing tryina keep the groove,
But what I really need to do is...

Not to mention her eyes,

And keep her dancein' by..my..side,
HOLD Up wait,

But what I rally need to do is...

I remember the start you can't recall.
By the time it was right, you didn't want to fall.
If it's over, say it's over

Blindly, I let you destroy me!
Love is not so beautiful when your lungs are caving in,
And beautiful's gone!
Oh don't lie to me when we both know baby, 
Beautiful is gone
Beautiful's gone!

And I pushed you so hard but not at all.
You closed your eyes.
I could see it all.
Run out the door, see no more of you,
And what you do. 

Blindly, I let you destroy me!
Love is not so beautiful when your lungs are caving in,

Peek in through the open crack.

Soma,"Despierto sin ganas de otro día, y será el último 
Pocos me creen, hoy llega mi edén 
Lo asumo y ni dudo, lo juro 
De corazón, advierte mi alma muerta 
No es una amenaza, es una mentira 
Que acabo siendo cierta 
Dejé la puerta abierta y una nota 
A medio escrita, se leía con dificultad 
Adiós mamá y papá, decía en ella 
Salí descalzo, sin fuerzas, sin ganas 
Me imaginé en el suelo, muerto, y nadie lloraba 
Paseo por una calle solitaria 
Todo está oscuro y llueve 
Las farolas me observan 
Y el paso en el tiempo me duele 
El filo de mi cuchilla me apreta, es ella 
Llegaré al final de la forma más fácil 
La vida no es bella 
Tan sólo busco estar solo ahora 
En un laberinto sin salida 
Dejé de pedirla ayuda a Dios 
Hablo con mi conciencia, a solas 
Ella me pide que apriete el gatillo 
Y tengo miedo de decir adiós 
Lo siento si he fallado una vez más 
He notado la vergüenza al mirarme en el espejo mamá 
Perdóname, te lo suplico! 
No se si me explico 
Estoy sentado en la varandilla de un séptimo piso 
Pero, ya estoy muerto, por dentro y estoy cansado 
Estoy harto de vivir huyendo siempre del pasado 
Fui cobarde, me rendí más de una vez estuve a punto 
Punto en mi libreta esta historia incompleta, ya ni lucho 
Páginas en blanco, tintadas del rojo de mi sangre 
No merezco ni una lágrima 
Mi nota de suicidio llegó tarde 
Firmé un documento con Satanás 
Para liberarme sólo tengo que saltar sin más

Salto, salto a un vacío que nunca se acaba 
Pasa mi vida por mis ojos y el tiempo se para 
Para no verme mas la cara, dispárame bah! 
Mi alma pide a gritos salir de su cuerpo ya 

Salto, salto a un vacío que nunca se acaba 
Pasa mi vida por mis ojos y el tiempo se para 
Para no verme mas la cara, dispárame bah! 
Mi alma pide a gritos salir de su cuerpo ya 

Y siento como si ya estuviera muerto 
En un mundo de ciegos, rey tuerto 
Me paso por el forro el LP a puerto 
Es cierto, no tengo nada que dar ni recibir 
Sorrazos alerto, vivo boquiabierto 
Y apenas escribo, algo está jodido mi mente 
Me siento hijo adoptivo 
Demasiado impulsivo, me dicen 
Cautivo de lo negativo si volar es el fin 
Que alas se deslicen 
Calo mejor las mentiras, tras este intervalo 
Regalo rimas, con mi boca de escualo 
En forma de íntimas palabras sin pantomima 
Si no tienes el disco del Z, róbalo 
Pero yo ya no quiero vivir más 
Es demasiad duro 
Cuando muera, escupid en mi tumba 
Si apuro, he hecho el conjuro 
De la eterna estupidez 
Siento la rigidez en mis músculos 
Es liberador vivir sin futuro 
Sentir la traición hace que muera prematuro 
Es puro veneno lo que siento lo juro 
Con rabia la sangre sólo supe pedir perdón 
Cuando fui inmaduro 
Dile a mi madre que siempre la quise y que lo siento 
A mi bro que busque mis palabras en el viento, cuando sople 
A los que desearon mi mal, yo les deseo el doble 
Por haber hecho pedazos un corazón noble 

Salto, salto a un vacío que nunca se acaba 
Pasa mi vida por mis ojos y el tiempo se para 
Para no verme mas la cara, dispárame bah! 
Mi alma pide a gritos salir de su cuerpo ya 

Salto, salto a un vacío que nunca se acaba 
Pasa mi vida por mis ojos y el tiempo se para

Estoy solo en un silencio que molesta y grito 
Escucha mi última palabra, léete mi último escrito 
Préstame atención, sólo pido eso, lo necesito 
Caen gotas de sudor y de mis ojos en mi nota de suicidio 
Siento no poder no decir mas, 
Pocos llorarán, pero cuantos se alegrarán 
Vi mi nombre en una lápida y ni se me hizo extraño 
Cuántas cargas he llevado para tan pocos años 
No hay nada que me frene 
Llevo tanto tiempo muerto dentro de mi ya no hay nada 
Tan sólo soy otro cuerpo, arrastrado por el viento 
Tan violento que sopla el destino 
No hay testigo, no hay amigos, no queda ningún motivo 
Solo recorro el camino, se que en las puertas del cielo 
No hay sitio para este peregrino 
Dios? parece ser mentira, hoy sabré si es cierto 
Lo de que tras la muerte, existe otra vida

Hoy es lunes, martes, miércoles quizás puede que jueves 
No se el por qué pero en mis ojos ya no llueve 
Puede que tu recuerdo me mantenga vivo 
Si el exilio no quiere mandarme directo al olvido

We'll see how far we get on courage and regret. 
I loved you more than life, it almost killed us both. 
And it's funny 'cause I think I need you more than you need me. 
I have eaten enough of my own sentiment, it would kill me to choke down the rest.

Pushing a world around on four wheels

Like a Chinese whisper
Not the same when it reaches me
Safer to see than to be seen
Safer given lines to drive
Between, between, between

It's a danger
And the pictures on the wall
Might mean nothing at all

Will you notice, will you notice, will you notice...

Would not go unnoticed

Sometimes Three,"Away, away, oh, away, away

This feels like the coldest day in a hurricane
Looking through a glass window
And ya screaming to the top of yours lungs
And the bells done rung and the crowd can't hear you

And all that I can see is a building burning
I just gotta rescue my baby
But you don't even recognize me

And even though the feeling's been gone
I just wanna be here to pick up the little pieces of remains
I'm going down, the plane is smoking, and the only one
Who can save me is you but you wanna throw me

I wanna know
I wanna know why you wanna throw me away

You used to ask why was I so skeptic of love
Girls, 'cause it changes, and it ain't got to be no real season
You start to live the dream and before you know
There's a door that open, and the moment you walk in it close

Maybe it's somebody else or a situation that you can't help
Oh love, oh love, oh love, oh love, just ain't what it used to be
I confronted my fears with open arms, although you said
You will never give up on us, but now you blow me

SoMo,"She wanted my heart,
Wanted my soul,
Wanted that loving
But I ain’t tryna hold on to her heart
To see it fold.
Girl’s holding on to the thought so tight
Holding on for her life
I just might have to give it to her,
For one loving night.
She whispers so slow
Said to my ear, “I love Somo.”
I said, “you just wanna get in my pants,
'Cause I’m ‘bout to get that dough.”
She says, “I like it fast.”
I say, “Why you gotta rev my gas?”
Next thing I know,
I’m standing in my front door tryna stop my hands

I just wanna take your picture
Go 'head stand there in the door
Let’s get naughty, let’s get naughty
Take your body to the floor
Take that thing and make it drop
Come over and show me more
Hold me softly, I’ll keep going
Till you’re screaming and you’re sore

And we live for that rush.
And we rush for that love.
And we love for that one
That just straps up your heart.
And you’re back to the start again
That just straps up your heart.
And you’re back to the start

She’s dripping to the core
Says to me, “can I explore
Your body, feeling exotic
And I just need a little tour.”
We start off just by touching
Then we go on to rubbing
She says “I’m on top
Let me ride.”
I say, “uh-uh, I’mma get that loving.”
I thought you could take it fast
Yeah, you like it when I slap your ass
Take it all, I’mma go deep
Keep it so sweet, one night to make it last
She’s close, I’m about to wrap
She can’t open up her eyes
I’m driving deep and her body’s so weak
And I can’t let go inside

I just wanna take your picture
Go 'head stand there in the door
Let’s get naughty, let’s get naughty
Take your body to the floor
Take that thing and make it drop
Come over and show me more
Hold me softly, I’ll keep going
Till you’re screaming and you’re sore

And we live for that rush.
And we rush for that love.
And we love for that one
That just straps up your heart.
And you’re back to the start again
And she prays for the love
So I stay and we run
Sends a wish on a star
Now just wraps up her heart
We were trapped from the start

So we live for that rush.
And we rush for that love.
Why can’t we",Back to the Start,2014

You know that feeling
That feeling you get when you're in love
Well it sounds a little like this

When I wake up and you're next to me
Gotta pinch myself cause you're a dream
You're beautiful, you're heavenly
Then you wake up with that smiling face
I know that I'm in the perfect place
And you know that you're my saving grace

I do it all for you, I do it all for us
The stars in the sky can't amount to my love
Ain't no cloudy days, just sweet lemonade
You're the perfect addition to my every wish
And I pray for that day you come around
And I'll say, ""I do it all for you, I do it all for us
My heart is alive because of your love""

When you come home from a hard day
And I tell you that it'll be okay
It's so beautiful, it's so heavenly
Then you kiss my lips and turn off the lights

She closed the door
No turning back
This time it is clear now
Forgotten words and hopeless heard
All left in the past now
Maybe it's for the best
Don't call it an angel's test
My heart has no fear now

But you'll always be a part of me
And I got this red lighter, red lighter
Got this red lighter, red lighter

All these thoughts are driving me insane
Memory of your eyes, hiding this flame
You can't take any of that away
Let it burn out, we're caught in the rain
Rain rain, rain rain rain

Even after the storm, the clouds are reborn but it's never been wetter
It must have been fate, two hearts didn't break, it's gotta get better
I'll keep these thoughts alive inside to remind me whenever
I'm down and out, I'll think about when you said forever

And you'll always be a part of me

So them tears you can tie them up
Just don’t wanna let ‘em running down your face
Baby the world is frozen
I told her if she shared it with me then it’d be ours
Like anything you maw
How can you give and drown?
Under water I can’t hear a sound but I
See the rain dropping like tears from God am I
Mother’s telling me that it’s a sign of wealth
When I don’t think the Lord is too fond of her
But there’s gotta be a reason
I’m not drowning, right?

I’m going in the downer shape
Into the darker days (kill my lights in here baby)
Please don’t let me drown (drown)
All life was fatally(it’s black out now)
The burst of your judgment day
Please don’t let me drown
(Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me, don't let me)
Please don’t let me drown

Puede que encuentres tal vez
Quien pueda darte el sol que buscas
Pero de amores conmigo solo ves la luna

Como el agua entre mis manos
Se me fue tu querer

Mucho mas que una flor

La vi llegar a casa de Pedro
En un auto marron
No se si un nissan o un Toyota
Creo que fue a las dos
Parece que vio a un fantasma cuando saludo

Deja ese cuento ya
Ella es mi amiga solamente
Ya dejenme en paz
Solo pasaba por mi casa
Why quiso saludar

Como la nieve en verano
Cuando oye que alguien me dice
Que vas a regresar conmigo

Entre estas cuatro paredes

Enloquecia
En una casa que tenia su olor
Su ultima nota en la puerta del refrigerador
Nunca pense que para oir su voz
Dependeria d eun mensaje ya gastado en el contestador

Pero eres tu
La que el suelo me vio
Caer de rodillas con mi cruz de dolor
Pero en un segundo todo desvanecio
Con tus besos de amor

Pero eres tu, la que hoy pinta su amor
Con lapiz labial dibuja mi corazon
Junto a un te quiero que siempre adornara
El espejo del salon

Paso los dias lleno de dicha why de felicidad
Cada detalle es un evento nada de trivial
Es como ir tomado de la mano por el mismo Dios
Iluminas este mundo sin sentido
Que no alcanzaba el sol

Es mi escuela 
Se antojaba de una estrella 
Why sin pedirla ya era de ella 
Olvido que fui quien rescato su vida 
Al levantarla de la ruina que existia 
En lo mas hondo why mas oscuro 
De su negro corazon 
Nunca imagine que eran espinas 
Lo que me esperaba 
Antes de mi ella no era nada

Cuando oye que alguien me dice
Que vas a regresar conmigo

Entre estas cuatro paredes
Donde querer nunca acaba

Solos tu why yo

Son by Four,"Pasaban los dias
Todo era oscuro, todo era igual
No habia motivo, no habia nada que fuera especial
Seguia buscando razones para despertar
En una cama de tormentos, tan vacia, junto a mi soledad

Enloquecia
En una casa que tenia su olor
Su ultima nota en la puerta del refrigerador
Nunca pense que para oir su voz
Dependeria d eun mensaje ya gastado en el contestador

Pero eres tu
La que el suelo me vio
Caer de rodillas con mi cruz de dolor
Pero en un segundo todo desvanecio
Con tus besos de amor

Pero eres tu, la que hoy pinta su amor
Con lapiz labial dibuja mi corazon
Junto a un te quiero que siempre adornara
El espejo del salon

Paso los dias lleno de dicha why de felicidad
Cada detalle es un evento nada de trivial
Es como ir tomado de la mano por el mismo Dios
Iluminas este mundo sin sentido
Que no alcanzaba el sol

And nothing's changed

I'm not the desperate type

Left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

No, no, no, no, no, no I need you baby
I still believe that we can be together, no no
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again.

Lo halló como todos los otros de su pasado: soñando ganarse el ""Gordo"" en la Lotería
Los hijos y la mujer durmiendo a su lado
Adan salió de su casa, al mediodía
Después de una discusión muy acalorada
Su esposa quería pedirle plata a los suegros
Y Adan besaba a sus hijos mientras gritaba
""Esto se acabó, vida
La ilusión se fue, vieja
Y el tiempo es mi enemigo
En vez de vivir con miedo
Mejor es morir
Sonriendo, con el recuerdo vivo""

Por ultima vez entró en la tienda del barrio
Y ahí le fiaron un paquete de cigarrillos
Por la Avenida Central lo vieron andando
""Sin rumbo, las manos dentro de los bolsillos""
""Desde que a Adan fue botado de su trabajo""
Dijo un vecino
""Noté en su forma de ser un cambio muy raro
Él, siempre muy vivaracho
Ahora andaba quieto
Pero en la tranquilidad del desesperado""

Dice el parte policial
Que Adan llegó a un Banco
Y le gritó a la
Cajera que le entregara t
Todo el dinero que ella en su caja tuviera
Y que si no lo hacia pronto, él la mataba
""El hombre me amenazó con una pistola""
Dijo una doña, ""por eso
Es que le daba lo que él quisiera
Por la clase de salario
Que aquí me pagan
No voy a arriesgar la vida que Dios me diera""

Cuentan que al salir Adan corriendo del Banco
Se halló con una patrulla parqueada al frente
Que no le hizo caso al guardia
Que le dio el ""Alto""
Que iba, ""gritando y sonriendo como un demente""
Al otro día, los periódicos publicaban
La foto de su cadaver en calzoncillos
La viuda de Adan leyó, en la primera plana
""Ladrón usaba el revolver de agua de su chiquillo""

después de ver a mi mamá
luchando contra un cáncer
que no se puede curar

vi pasar a una familia
al frente iba un señor de edad
una doña, dos muchachas
y varias personas mas

de la mano del señor
un hombre joven caminaba
cabizbajo y luciendo arrepentido
que el era la causa de
una situación familiar
de la que nos enteramos al oír
al señor gritar

aunque tu seas un ladrón
y aunque no tienes razón
yo tengo la obligación de socorrerte
y por mas drogas que uses
y por mas que nos abuses
la familia y yo tenemos que atenderte
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Solo quien tiene hijos entiende
que el deber de un padre no acaba jamas
que el amor de padre y madre
no se cansa de entregar
que deseamos para ustedes lo que nunca
hemos tenido, que a pesar de los problemas
familia es familia y cariño es cariño
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

los vi marcharse con su llanto
su laberinto enfrentando
en la buena y en la mala juntos caminando
y pensé mucho en mi familia
los quise tanto aquel momento
que sentí que me ahogaba en sentimiento
aquel muchacho y mi pobre madre
dos personas distintas,pero,
dos tragedias iguales

cuanto control y cuanto amor
tiene que haber en una casa
mucho control y mucho amor
para enfrentar a la desgracia
por mas problemas que existan
dentro en tu casa, por mas que
creas que tu amor es causa perdida
ten la seguridad de que ellos te quieren
y que ese cariño dura toda la vida
cuanto control y cuanto amor
tiene que haber en una casa
mucho control y mucho amor
para enfrentar a la desgracia

mantén amor y control siempre ante
la pena combinando la esperanza
y el sentimiento dando la espalda
no se van los problemas
ni la impaciencia resuelve los sufrimientos

tiene que haber en una casa
mucho control y mucho amor
para enfrentar a la desgracia

De cielo que alegraba su miseria con su luz. Sobre sus cuerpos

El amor que lo celebró
Uno por uno fuimos pagando el precio 
Cruel de los que basan su felicidad en error
El gobierno explicó a través de expertos que, ""los muertos fueron 
Víctimas de radiactividad""
Le dieron una multa a un hospital local
""por botar substancias tóxicas en un área popular""
No hubo milagro, ni hubo justicia, y esa tragedia no es noticia ya
Ni aquel cilindro, con el polvo de cielo, que alegraba a la miseria

En la oscuridad

Las estrellas, sólo sé que en ti veo mi fortuna
Y una carita que es de lo más bella

Quiere ""salvarme"" ya no creo en lo que dicen los diarios
Ni tampoco en lo que habla la radio, pero en ti sí, cariño
Yo creo en ti
Con cada beso juntos nos sumergiremos en un mar de 
Pasión, placer y sabrosura
Y yo, al compás sensual que 
Marca tu cintura me dejaré llevar a una delicia eterna

No me pregunten más, yo no sé nada, no me interesa 
Hablar de zoquetadas
De qué nos vale el tener inteligencia
Si no aprendemos a usar la conciencia, pero tu sí, cariño
Yo creo en ti

En tu abrazo encuentro tranquilidad, cariño yo creo en ti
Llenas mi martirio en un mar lleno de felicidad, cariño yo creo en ti
Eres una prieta; un fin de semana un fin de semana y no voy a parar
Cariño yo creo en ti

Sin tu cariño son de cartón todas las estrellas
Cariño yo creo en ti En mis noches de dolor fuiste luna llana
Cariño yo creo en ti

I grabbed up my suitcase, and I said and I took off down the road
I said, but when I got there she was already layin on a coolin' board

Said, the good ol' gal got to lay here 'til the Judgment Day
I walked up right close, and I said I looked down in her face
I said the good ol' gal, she got to lay here 'til the Judgment Day

Looked like there was 10,000 people standin' round the buryin' ground
I didn't know I loved her 'til they laid her down
Looked like ten thousand were standin' round the buryin' ground
You know I didn't know I loved her 'til they damn laid her down

I wouldn't mistreat you baby, for my weight in gold
I said, Lord, have mercy on my wicked soul

I said, farewell, farewell, I'll see you on the Judgment Day

Dear Gerald, you’re fourteen years and a truant
You’re trying to find your place, and figure out where you fit
You’re finna start rappin’ with a kid you went to school with
But, more on that later, right now you’re going through it
See, you’re going to have to prove that you ain't soft and you ain't stupid
And you gon’ have to scrap with some kids that you ain’t cool with
You got a short temper, just be careful when you lose it
You wanna be the man, but it’s gon’ take some time to prove it
You’ll fall in love, but she’s gon’ break your heart and put you through it
Fuck falling for that bullshit, you gon’ fall in love with music
You’re finna get arrested, almost fuck around and lose it
Spend days in juvy standing at the window, looking through it
Nothing in life is promised, not even free-time is
So, only chase dreams, and only chase commas
Won’t happen on its own, trust, trust, we’ve been through it

I mean, I was fucking up
I was seventeen, I was eighteen, just doing dumb shit
My moms made me move to New Orleans and shit, I went to school down there on a scholarship
I finally got my shit together, I started taking music seriously
Then it started to kinda pop off a little bit, almost

Dear Gerald, 21, you think you’ve got it figured out
Got a big head from them labels trying to bring you out
'Til they passed on you, they ain’t see what they was missing out
On, that flight home gave you some shit to think about
Scrambling trying to figure out, went back to the drawing board
Know they say rejection’s only supposed to make you want it more
But, no lie, you contemplating quitting, walking out the door
But, what the fuck you supposed to do? This is all you’re living for
Really it was that and Dev, that was all you had
Paying rent by engineering other rappers at the pad
Barely getting by, hella broke, you was doing bad
Then “These Things Happened”, you finally seen a bag
You drove down the highway, a fork in the road
A normal life with her, or going for broke?
I seen an open lane and I drove straight through it

If it was easy, everyone would do it
This game is not

Easy, easy

I moved out of my place in New Orleans
I was bouncing around, living out of a suitcase
Crashing on friends’ couches
Living at AirBnbs, hotels
Trying to make the album
Trying to make When It’s Dark Out
And take it there and be great

Dear Gerald, life changed since you dropped your second album
And Me, Myself & I just went 7x Platinum
Toured around the world, damn, you really had ‘em
But now you’re 27 and it’s time to be a legend
Back when it all started, grinding hard on that promo tour
Tired from the night before and the night before and the night before
Fuck it, tomorrow, gotta fly some more
Don’t complain, this is what you signed up for
You’re working for your family, managers, agents
They all want something different from you, tell 'em all patience
But, this one’s on you, the lonely quest of greatness
Been trying to be famous, been trying to be A-list
When you arrive, it will appear as if there’s nothing to it
But, you planted the seeds and you grew it
There’s people taking credit for success that they had nothing to do with

So now you’re here
What you gon’ do with it?
You know?

Yeah, uh, make no mistake, listen it’s the life that I was chosen for
All I prayed for was an open door
I’ve been rich, I’ve been broke before
I’ve seen the floor
You try to put me in a box, I’ll box out like Okafor
And fuck being indecisive now I’m so for sure
And fuck Trump, it’s like “What the fuck we voted for?”
And most of y’all should probably party less and focus more
And if that line resonates, you’re probably who I wrote it for
Where will I go from here? ""IDK""
They want me to architect Rome, in a day
Juice knew I was greatness when he looked at me
Right away, I’ve made platinum records that’ll never see the light of day
This is what the whole world’s been waiting for
The crowd’s jumping, going dumb 'til they break the floor
Come take a walk inside my mind, come and take a tour
I’m really not playing, what the fuck you take me for?

Eats low carb ice cream with his Mum
Sews Cub Scout badges on his sweater

Asteroids, Pacman written on his 'games to get' list
Wasted nights spent up in his bedroom

I shout at you
But you don't blink an eye

Kept turning her nose up at my band
She's into Yellow Card, Blink and Simple Plan

She's into Jane's Addiction
But she don't know their songs
And I fall over laughing when she tries to sing along
She thinks that she's so ""emo""
Next week she'll be a ""goth""
It all amounts to nothing
She gets murdered in the mosh

One night I crashed at her apartment
Her Sonic Youth cd's were nowhere to be seen
Instead, all I found was a letter
Her correspondence with some pop star magazine

And I fall over laughing when she tries to sing along

Sometimes I wonder what goes on inside her mind
When she said she though
Dave Grohl had died and Kurt Cobain was still alive
Just go to concerts that you love
'cause there's no shame in liking Backstreet Boys

Heard someone say he got her clothes off playing poker

Can I assume this spells the end for me and you?

Morning after
I go outside and the garden's a disaster
The kitchen table's in the pool
The sound of laughter
Echoes on inside my mind, holes in the plaster
And I feel like such a tool
And so abused, don't think I've ever felt this used

I'm lost without a cause

Son of Dork,"Eddie kick started his career
One Summertime in May
A shitty band with friends from school
But only he could really play
The moment that he took the stage
The fans were blown away
I always knew that he'd go far
I'm glad I lived to see the day

Eddie's got twenty-seven kids but he 
Doesn't know
Shame he'll never be around to 
See them grow
Said he screwed a different girl
After every show
But he was always way too gone
To remember though
So Eddie doesn't know

At 3a.m, it's getting late
The after party's closed
But everybody follows Eddie
They just won't leave him alone
Calls seven girls to his hotel room
Takes off all their clothes
Some people say he had it easy
But that is just the way it goes

Eddie's got twenty-seven kids but he 
Doesn't know
Shame he'll never be around to 
See them grow
Said he screwed a different girl
After every show
But he was always way too gone
To remember though
So Eddie doesn't know

He's in deep and there's a reason
He's all alone and he can't change
Like the seasons
They come and they go

To all the kids who don't look
Like their Mum and Dad
Don't freak out, don't you let
It make you mad
As long as they both love you then
You should be glad
Just think about the little problem
Eddie had

Eddie's got twenty-seven kids but he 
Doesn't know
Shame he'll never be around to 
See them grow
Said he screwed a different girl
After every show
But he was always way too gone
To remember though
So Eddie doesn't know

Eddie's got twenty-seven kids but he 
Doesn't know
Shame he'll never be around to 
See them grow
Said he screwed a different girl
After every show
But he was always way too gone
To remember though

Just wanna live forever this way 

Flash back to seventeen 
Got my ass kicked by the football team 
Another Loser on the scene 
Every Guy With A Chick I Fancy 

I asked you out for losing truth or dare 
The guys were cracking up 'til you said yeah 

Pinch me, is this real? 
I'm on a one way ticket out of loserville 
Now I'm off the social flat line 
Things are so good that I'm 

Taking down my star trek shrine 
And you're more than just my valentine 
You're my ticket outta loserville 

She gives me butterflies 
Says I'm not like all the other guys 
Doesn't care what car I drive 
She still enjoys the ride 

When I got to sleep I know 
That you'll be there tomorrow 
And it gives me vertigo 
It was just a week ago that

Pinch me, is this real? 
I'm on a one way ticket out of loserville 
Now I'm off the social flat line 
Things are so good that I'm 
Taking down my star-trek shrine 

You blew me out on a Sunday night 
You were bored to tears pretending 
Knew what you wanted and I'm nothing like the 
Guy in your happy ending 

Well you were wrong to lead me on 
Now in the night I wake up screaming 
Where the hell did I go wrong? 
Where's Scotty when you need him? 

Pinch me, is this real? 
I'm on a one way ticket back to loserville 
Heading for the social flat line 
Things are so that bad 
I'm dusting off my star trek shrine 

This is where it ends and I can taste the glory 
How can I depend 
On a better story? 
Made it, blew it, couldn't save it 

Think about her all the time 
It's like I never had her valentine 
So I guess I better kiss goodbye to my ticket outta loserville",Ticket Outta Loserville,2006

Without you there’s only time
Making the most situations
Living on love that’s living blind

You say you’re no affected
You always read between the lines

Can ever change your mind

The level’s rising on the river
We just go where the current goes
There’s no sense in a heartache
A condition that’s always known

There’s a reckless side of tradition

Burning answers on display

Know it’s hard to your easy start
You don’t let the clicks or injustice get you down
There’s more to find than what you pick up
Sometimes the furthest isn’t quite enough
Shadows are good companions for the lot that you say

The world’s deserted and down
Like there’s no love around
The river of life cuts across
Hearts no longer entwine

Words shine on like precious stones
Judgment day, the truth be known
The miles and years make it better
Through gilded tears

Race around to the rattling drone
Diamonds in the distance make the battle sound

The windshield shattered
All for an instant fleeting like cars from the street
Cat tops spin across the highway and horses die in backseats

Don't blink now
I know I can't talk man, but I understand
Any way I look at him my love, you've got to come back soon it's not fair
They choke your neck with a seatbelt that meant to help

Break it apart
Misunderstand me
Flash this evening on the sky screen
Drive to Vegas and get yourself hitched

If I live through my imperfections - two glass decades and you're still angry - I don't want to be your friend anymore
We turned a wheel that raised a wall and made this living world turn red
But I'm not scared
I pulled my arms from the fence where I leapt

Violet...
Like rain returning (...Violet...) back to the earth from a cloud
Falling down makes you squint as it hits your glasses lens
I set a trap, caught myself

So I surrender
That's what I did
It wasn't there
No, no, n-n-no, it wasn't there

I looked, I looked
I looked everywhere
The girl I lived for Saturdays she watched this brilliant star grow faint
But it's not there - It's not there

"Son, Ambulance","There's a voice on the phone
Telling what had happened,
Some kind of confusion
More like a disaster.

And it wondered how you were left unaffected,
But you had no knowledge.
No, the chemicals covered you.
So a jury was formed

As more liquor was poured.
No need for conviction,
They're not thirsting for justice.
But I slept with the lies I keep inside my head.

I found out I was guilty.
I found out I was guilty.
But I won't be around for the sentencing,
Cause I'm leaving

On the next airplane.
And though I know that my actions are impossible to justify
They seem adequate to fill up my time.
But if I could talk to myself

Like I was someone else,
Well then maybe I could take your advice,
And I wouldn't act like such an asshole all the time.

There's a film on the wall,
Makes the people look small
Who are sitting beside it,
All consumed in the drama.

They must return to their lives once the hero has died.
They will drive to the office
Stopping somewhere for coffee,
Where the folk singers, poets and playwrights convene,

Dispensing their wisdom,
Oh dear amateur orators.

They will detail their pain
In some standard refrain.
They will recite their sadness
Like it's some kind of contest.

Well, if it is, I think I am winning it,
All beaming with confidence
As I make my final lap.
The gold medal gleams

So hang it around my neck
Cause I am deserving it:
The champion of idiots.

But a kid carries his walkman on that long bus ride to Omaha.
I know a girl who cries when she practices violin.
Cause each note sounds so pure, it just cuts into her,
And then the melody comes pouring out her eyes.

"Son, Ambulance","Love is real
It is not just in novels or the movies
It is fact
And it is standing here right in front of you
So if you open your eyes
Oh what a sweet discovery
There is hope, and there is joy, and there is acceptance
So now let all of the light that collects on your plants
Keep you warm, make you smile
And I will be there with this pen in my hand
To record all the while
You'll be laughing so loud
That the house would shake with sound
And everything will be as new as the day it was found
Love is real
It is not just in long distance commercials
Or something that you thought you felt back in high school
So I will turn black and white
Become that horoscope you're reading
It predicts something good is on its way
Oh, and then I will send you the world green and blue
In a box through the mail
You can open it up, hold it right in your hand
And be glad that it's there
And be glad that you're there
Now, you can feel all the knots in your stomach start to untie
And suddenly it's not so hard to say you're all right
Love is real
It is not just in poetry and stories
It is truth, and it will follow you
Everywhere you go from now on
So if you'd just cast off your doubt
Then your lips would answer for you
Oh my darling, when you smile, it is like a song
And I can hear it now
And I can hear it now
And I can hear it now
Yes, I can, I can, I can
I can hear it now

"Son, Ambulance","It was in the march of the winter I turned seventeen
That I bought those pills
I thought I would need
And I wrote a letter to my family
Said it's not your fault
And you've been good to me
Just lately I've been feeling
Like I don't belong
Like the ground's not mine to walk upon
And I've heard that music
Echo through the house
Where my grandmother drank
By herself
And I sat watching a flower
As it was withering
I was embarrassed by its honesty
So I'd prefer to be remembered as a smiling face
Not this fucking wreck
That's taken its place

So please forgive what I have done
No you can't stay mad at the setting sun
'Cause we all get tired, I mean eventually
There is nothing left to do but sleep

But spring came bearing sunlight
Those persuasive rays
So I gave myself a few more days
My salvation it came, quite suddenly
When Justin spoke very plainly
He said ""Of course it's your decision,
But just so you know,
If you decide to leave,
Soon I will follow""

I wrote this for a baby
Who has yet to be born
My brother's first child
I hope that womb's not too warm
'Cause it's cold out here
And it'll be quite a shock
To breathe this air
To discover loss
So I'd like to make some changes
Before you arive
So when your new eyes meet mine
They won't see no lies
Just love.
Just love.

I will be pure
No, no, I know i will be pure

Like snow, like gold
Like snow, like snow
Like gold, like gold, like gold","No Lies, Just Love",2001

In Junior high she said goodbye to her parents and ran away with a boy. 
She left her family warm and kind, all of her friends said 
""you´re out of your mind"". 
Life of her own she would find, it´s Monday and she´s gotta grind.

A Job as a waitress she sure was to find, beautiful face, mind of a child.

Oh why did you lie"" You said ""it´s okay if we do it today"", 
I was so scared that you would go away. 
""Despite all the papers been signed, 
Mama take me back be so kind"".

Only a child, reckless and wild, needs to come home again. 
He promised the moon but won´t marry you. 
Nothing to do, eating for two, he´s goin´ out with someone new. 
Sunshine or rain, it´s all the same, life isn´t gray
Oh Mary-Lou.

Mamas do your children still sleep, 
In the safe of their cradles so sweet. 
Story I told you I have forseen, 
Your little angel ain´t always so clean.

Drink the wine from her stream
Have a time, she's there for thee

Build the campfire in a place you know safe
And then see that you put it out right
Can you see trail of garbage in there
Maybe not, and that is a sign to follow

Drink the wine from her stream
Have a time, she's there for thee

Earmarked me, hurt me, burned me.

The walls around me, eyes surround me, feed my fear again
I must be freed or I will die before the harvest moon, my friend
I do not have another year in me, you've gotta set me free

The dream is alive, I can run up the hills every night
Go around and see another side of the tree
Freedom has a meaning for me, howl with me

Fear in the dark, I advice you
You can not see the eyes, they grow behind
you
It's my song they now sing to you
You stand no chance

They'll kill for me, steal back my freedom, set me free
It's my minions versus thee
Fiery the vengeance, hate will drain me

Move aside I'm choking on this life
I think I tolerate your hate
As long as you're afraid
All I wanted was to be with you and suffer every day

Under the moon I hold a wake for a promise torn
Mortally wounded, feeling sheltered me
Once again my shadow will enter your life
Time to walk with me the last mile

I read the book about a man, the love, the women, how they die
How I was waved aside, listen how the headless doves cry
I truly see a madman in the mirror when I'm weak
I spent a year in love before I realized it's me

Open your blue eyes tell me that you love me, whore
Make me believe it, oh I know you're lying
Broke the vow I thought you made my angel why
Could I let you wait out the night 

Mother always said: ""My son, do the noble thing""
You have to finish what you started, 
no matter what, Now, sit watch and learn
""It's not how long you live but what your morals say""
Cannot keep your part of the deal
So don't say a word, don't say a word 

It won't be long now love, like mist I slowly feel the room
I place a black candle on your chest
The path of night its manifest
I never wanted us to end up in this catatonic phase
It wasn't me who ran away, you made me stray

Open your blue eyes tell me that you love me, whore
Make me believe it, oh I know you lie

I never had a chance to prove I wasn't guilty,
I always seemed to get blamed for
Every little crime I didn't even have a name for 

Still running, still defeated in my mind
I never even tried to defend my own pride

But this world is imperfect too,
And that just has to do

I chose not to hear what the smart people said,
And instead played my cards like a fool

Where's my applause?

I see no reason to live in Hell.
How can life make me feel so incomplete?

I had a weakness and my walls came down
My tears won't reach the ground

I know I cannot feel regret for anything
If I was numb, I'd end this once and for all

I cannot face this day, my guards are down
I cannot love myself, weak, sad clown

Believe me when I say this
I would not if I did not care

You know how it must hurt, and I know,
There is nothing you've done to deserve this.

Apology's a policy,
Sometimes it really has to be, it's kept me afloat thus far

This sure nuf's one nice
Loose noose, perfect times
Are we happy in this hell?
Is there someone who can measure
Whose pain is bigger?

It all has ended, the clock's re-winded.
We don't mean anything to me. You think?
I killed this silence for you to end the night
The words are loaded

Unprotected, one torso, no head
One valid reason, the life's suspended
If love's the neck that kept us together, and apart
Now it's broken

There's no cast, no real solution
When it is broken, it will stay that way

Sonata Arctica,"The premonition

Remember when I told you how my
Kin is different in some ways?
And how you should not fall in love
With someone like me, anyway
Between the lines, people see signs
When they feel the sear, every day's fear
And one night their torches
Find the girl without a name
And the one who has her
Love is no more safe

And until I get my peace I'm but a shade

(The witch-hunt)

The sun lit the white mountain's snow covered peaks,
There I see you, amongst the good people, suffering
She is the one, the unwanted, decidedly so,
'Cause she makes our children cry.
It's a fact, she is exactly that!
A harbinger of death from the world of witchcraft,
And she's feeding them cakes and her ale to this innocent boy,
And her magic brings dismay

(Exposing the heathen)

""I hear her in the wind, the bane of our town
Come with me, father, I'm to expose a heathen""

In my home town
No one's safe now
Young love's been forbidden
For five-fold kisses, my only love had to die

(Envy)

""Your crops are all flourishing, so what's the catch?
I know what you are, the new evil unhatched
As sure as the dawn, they will hear what I know,
And recognize you, and you'll be cleansed too""

(The fear)

For the good, trusting people in town,
In their fear stricken hearts,
Seeing skyclad's a sign like the deathaura,
Every night, so painful's the memory of love in the dark.
One wheel of the year ends their short lives in fear

""I hear her in the wind, the bane of our town.
Come with me, oh, father the heathen is exposed.""

(The grudge)

In the age of burning times, you saved my life
The blaze grew ever higher.
I was your cunning man, hiding in the light,
Now your land shall go sour

Your own fears will destroy everything
Envy consumes all, and ""thou shall not""
Though it hurts, I must tell you
""I am truly the one
Behind it all""

(The curse)

In the hands of time we all will die
The dead of night will devour your child
The creation o' beliefs you've been fed
The fear, the unknown, the poison loved by death.

(The flames)

In the cool of the night air
Flames purify minds, where
Almost anyone could be the next
""Unless morning finds all of them somehow hexed""

(Together, today, for all eternity)

I remember how you told me,
Your kin's different, on that sunny day?

You made me smile,

And after all these years we get to be together for all eternity",Deathaura,2009

There is always something to learn,
Repetition proves it's worth
Without those moments, we would not remember

Everything becomes finally clear.
It's not fair to lose it,
And how, there was a time now

Come here now

Can't walk away, nothing to say

I don't like this state of mind
I can see, but I can't find it,
Horrified to see what the following two days will bring

Can I trust my own eyes?
Is that me in disguise?
Is this bliss or am I insane?

Found the thin red line of madness
Far from the Skyland Mountain

I found a truth beneath a lie
Buried deep, explain me why
The world is upside down
I do not know a soul in here
But I can remember the faces
The truth is in their eyes

Don't really want to know
Don't want to go out there
I feel hypnotized
The truth is somewhere

Wake up, I only want to wake up
Don't wanna fall asleep, but
I'm already dreaming
I feel my skin is peeling off.
What I've been concealing?
Something underneath

My crawling skin (my crawling skin)
I can't wake up anymore (not anymore)
I've seen how this will end (oh it will end)
Don't want to soak anymore

The truth is out there.
Somewhere between two fairy tales,
Caught somewhere deep between someone's truth and a lie

Another really rainy morning, it's a perfect day
I'm too tired to be hypnotized now
It's all to real for me anyway

Wake up, I only want to wake up,
Don't wanna fall asleep, but
I'm already dreaming
I feel my skin is peeling off.
What I've been concealing?

Hello, although I'm a static Zero.
I'm fighting all your wars,
While you dwell in your hypocrisy
You think the world is fine,
When all the evil's over lined
Before you wake up this morning

Well, hello there, you're the local superhero?
Your stronghold's but a paper bag,
We suffer for your promised land
Excuse is really thin,
Hide your revealed Achilles' heel
Before a new brave morning

All you little superheroes,
Fall short without all them zeroes
A pie in the sky is your brave new world,

And so powerless are thy miracles

Ones, they walk before the rows of O's,
And soon it dawns on them, how to make billions

Dream up a world, oh how powerless are thy miracles
I'm so tired to fight you
The Sun is, oh, so desperate to set tonight,
Ashamed to light a lie

All you little superheroes,
Fall short without all them zeroes
The pie in the sky's your brave new world,

Your homestead's not yours much longer

These people win elections, empowered by you!
These wars are never ending, acceptance just mind-bending

It's a conspiracy and as always the end is here
We were born that day
This destiny wrote us a life we now waste away
Waste it away, do it today

My life is fine, so why would I care
Because it's not my ass, per se, on the line.

The love that's meant to fade away
(Vade retro, alter ego)
Move aside I'm choking on this life
I think I tolerate your hate
As long as you're afraid
All I wanted was to be with you and suffer every day

Under the moon I hold a wake for a promise torn
Mortally wounded, feeling sheltered me
Once again my shadow will enter your life
Time to walk with me the last mile

I read the book about a man, the love, the women, how they die
How I was waved aside, listen how the headless doves cry
I truly see a madman in the mirror when I'm weak
I spent a year in love before I realized it's me

Open your blue eyes tell me that you love me, whore
Make me believe it, oh I know you're lying
Broke the vow I thought you made my angel why
Could I let you wait out the night?

Mother always said: ""My son, do the noble thing""
You have to finish what you started
No matter what, now, sit watch and learn

So don't say a word, don't say a word

It won't be long now love, like mist I slowly feel the room
I place a black candle on your chest
The path of night its manifest
I never wanted us to end up in this catatonic phase
It wasn't me who ran away, you made me stray

Strawberry blonde your stranglehold
On my heart is bound to end
I suppose, life sometimes
It doesn't go the way it was meant
Though you never were a believer
I assure you, I won't die before you
You read the book now
The part ""ashes to ashes, dust to dust""

Short is the flight of this little sparkle
Love sounds familiar, but the emotion escapes me
I will carpe the diem while it's still here
And see how the fear of death becomes her

We had it all so sweet
Made for me, you, indeed
Big secrets, small the lie
Don't cry for me, oh, argentite

No words you say tonight
Can make this be alright
I'll help you follow through
Remember this?: pacta sunt servanda

The wounds are to deep
I need to keep the scars
To prove there was a time
When I loved something more than life

Unlike the last time here
I now have the means and a will sincere
Your knight is nowhere near
Unfortunate for you, this make me your God

Closing your eyes, don't ever say you love me, whore
You never meant a word, I know you lied
When there is life there is despair, indulge me now 
and stay alive this night
I promise you the end before the first light arrives

So here I walk up the road back home,
This place is me, my skin, blood and bones
You'd have to remember in order to fear me
""Your past will now burn down your town""

There is a mountain, in the horizon
Rebuilding the fire, the flames are arising
I am the flint and the kindler they need

This is where we used to live
You were scared. You all were.
You cast me out, all for one, family.
You draw my blood, they will burn down your town

There is a mountain, in the horizon
Rebuilding the fire, the flames are arising
Strong is the fear, and the anger it breeds

I can take all the blame, for the sake of my name
Our blood on your hands, running hot in my veins
They say ""Do yourself well and stay away from your family"" what?

Build a wall on the hill and write a book out of fear
Then aim a gun at your son to keep him safe from us 
You´re not foolish, you're insane. They would die for me. Twice.

Build a wall on the hill, write a book out of fear
You are out of your minds, blind; your love´s the killing kind

Children play,
Your riddles and games
Are hurtful, this pains me to know, they will teach them to fear.
But if anything, they teach them to hate
The bells of my fate play my songs, 
But I don´t want to dance anymore
But I don´t want to dance anymore
Cause I don´t want to dance with fire!

Love is the infinite power
You´re gonna sing when the mountain tells you,
Now, you'll sing, you'll bow, as we dance around you
In a dream, you believe, you have seen our soul,
You have seen our heart,
You have seen through the wall,
You have seen what we are,
But what have you learned?

I can take all the blame, for the sake of my name
Our blood on your hands, running hot in the veins
They say: ""Do yourself well and stay away from your family"" what?

Build a wall on the hill, write a book out of fear
Aim a gun at your son, keep him safe from us 
You're not foolish, you're insane. They will love me till death

Build a wall on the hill, write a book out of fear
Aim a gun at your sons, make them all read it
You are out of your minds, your love is the killing kind

Write a book about us, family infamous
Memorize every leaf, every word, every phrase
See your name on the last page
Consumed by fire

The bells of my fate play a song, but I don´t want to dance anymore
But I don´t want to dance anymore
Cause I don´t want to dance with fire!

The innocence slain, the price you have paid
So tonight, if you teach your own children to hate
Remember to tell of both heaven and hell
Never open those gates for the weak

Because we're up on the mountain
We are one with the mountain
Cause we are the mountain, one with the Mountain

You are in a battle you´re not supposed to win
Still you run to your death, face it with a grin
Run home, kids, while you still have homes

A place where you learn about harmony and peace
These you never knew, wish you would, but never will
It's in your blood, but your blood runs thin

The Mountain still wants to believe, you can turn the page again
You lose your hope here, one by one
Listen to me, son, you've got nowhere to run

You are not perfect at anything, least of all in things we were always good at

Slow to learn, you are slow to learn, children grow and burn, 'cause you'll never learn

Thy will be done, Thy will be done,
Thy will be done, Thy will be, Thy will be
Thou wilt be dead.

Durch leblose Straßen

Einfach mal weg vom Stress

You'd stop and see it's enough

Tell me now make believe

Just to get over it
I wouldn't wait for you

'Cause time won't wait 
'Til it's too late

You cannot leave, you can't release
To keep you far from those dreams
Ignoring the right times
Oh, waiting was my life

For now it's too late
For you may not wait
And things that I have yet to know
Vanish before they're complete
I may turn around
To see if you're still there
But as for now, it's just not safe
Maybe you'll wait for me
Maybe you're gone

You've been preparing all your life
You've had some trouble getting it right
And you try to tell yourself it may work,
As it should

If it's because of me
Then I may well have to
Tell you what I would do

And to think is more simple than changing the mood
Is it more, is it less?

Won't you whisper your blues as heartfelt as you can?

Meet me halfway
By the bedrock
On the tower

If I translate you wrong
When I complete your song
That would be my two feet

About the house packed with people and their loneliness
But the hour is so late
Take some weight off your chest
Let's just pray for our fates and then give it a rest

So why am I writing to the moon?

Down came the sky

I was red and bleak
We often joke it's over 
But it's never enough
I take it you are afraid
Afraid of everything I am 
And of some things, I am not
A fear I share before I go to bed

When tears are pretzels pouring 
Down each time 
The sweetness is returning
At times when you appreciate 
That you survived

Tricks tend to track you down
Even when you're high
It's the reason they made 
It all easier
You'll never know the hit
Tricks they track you down

Down came the sky
And everything went black
I saw you
You saw me
And you were naked
Which was weird
But in that space in time 
We played the strangers again
In oceans of oh I see, I see
When my words lost their meaning 
On their way to your door
Yours lost their way out of your

I don't want to want you to go
But I think you've left me 
Without options

And there is love
There are reports of a heart-robbing beauty whose victim I know

I don't know that tone

I can just call it love
Yes, you heard right
I call it love

There is romance
And there is love
That seems to be the only system that they know of

When there are games you should know of
Such as romance and turtledoves
Who wonder if it's love
I wanna call it love

Can we dance instead of walking?
We wanna break in to love's industry
Lie down where it's machinery slows down
When we've danced our socks off and it's late
We'll lie down to anticipate forever

When we romance
I feel a part
Of the loveliest human creature that I know by far
Who stays away from other boys
'Cause she knows where she's life or death or love
Where she is thought so highly of
Where someone calls her love
I wanna call it love

When we dance
Darling explosions!
We are chemistry without chemicals
A constant chain outside us both
Remember!
I've never felt so right before
And chances are it could be so
Can we dance instead of walking?
We wanna break into love's industry
Lie down where it's machinery slows down
When we've danced our socks off and it's late

Or just sad statistics I answer with anti-remorse

I'll know that it is love
Or at least I call it love",(I Wanna) Call It Love,2006

There's a boy somewhere holding hands with himself

Checkmate in three moves in your heyday
But the girls don't listen to your line anymore

Now you manufacture happiness
And get sold on the cheap for someone's satisfaction

Hoping you'll never grow old

To get this day off your mind

Sifting through all the remaining files
Counting down all the remaining miles
Drifting off into a different night
Paralyzed by all the warning lights

Waking the patient satellites
Sleepy benevolent eyes
Heavily drunk on distant love
They never once misplaced a call
I hope they never grow old

And someday we're gonna live on the shores
But nowadays we just hold our breath
Until the meeting next Monday

And it's going through the roof
We're blowing through the roof
If only you guys could see us

Me and my baby we bicker but I know the talented devil inside
And so we bond over raising toasts
To absent minds, who paint the sky
Two absent minds, expecting to fly
My baby does tend to contradict it's only natural

That it's going through the roof
B-blowing through the roof
If only you guys could see that I'm giving you the proof
I'm telling you the truth
They were gonna call tomorrow

How big it's gonna be

No one can deny us
People who once passed me by
Will turn their heads
I'm happy just to be with you
And lovin' you the way I do
Is everything I need to know
Just restin' in the afterglow (of your fire/love)

You
Yes, you have always been here
A feelin' deep inside
A feelin' that I could not see
Or touch, or try to hide
My love is in and without you
I bless the day that I found you
So listen baby
I'm happy just to be with you

Love is like a voice in my head
Keeps turning out (all) the things that we said

Songs Kids Love To Sing,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie

Songs of Green Pheasant,"You were a lovely child
And your hair was like the morning sun
And i knew we were in love
We were alone to dream a dream
We held our love that held our hearts
And who are we who knew
All there was in life and coming through
And every lonely sad mistake
Every change and interchange we make
We held our love and that held our hearts

Songs: Ohia,"When you are old enough to read this words
Their meaning will unfold
These words all that's left
And though we've never meet, my only son
I hope you know
That I would have been there to watch you grow

Now your mission lies ahead of you
As it did mine so long ago
To help the helpless ones who all look up to you
And to defend them to the end

Defender
Ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son
You're the defender
God has sent

Father,father,father
I look up to you and heed thy call
This letter ends my search
I'll live your dream now passed on to me
And I now wait to shake the hand of fate
Like the dusk awaiting dawn

So wizards cast your spell
With no heart to do me well
So it's written,it shall be

So a long kiss is alright
So a long night is alright

And all night is alright
There ain't no contest
Against the final day
We'll rise above us either way

We're either greeted
By life or it's reverse
Then each day greeted
By fortune or it's reverse

Will you stand up for your one chance

You will know",Captain Badass,1999

See them brake lights burning feel my motor turnin
On the bridge out of Hammond
See the big city moon
See how it close comes (x2)
Watch my wiper blades pound it like a drum

Think about what's darkening my life (x2)
See the light of the afterworld shining on the ruins
It's the light of nowhere else burning to the west
See its sulphery shine (x2)
From the bridge out of Hammond (x2)

Songs: Ohia,"It's been hard doing anything
Winter stuck around so long
I kept trying anyhow and I'm still trying now
Just to keep working just to keep working
I remember when it didn't use to be so hard
This used to be impossible
A new season has to begin
I can feel it leaning in whispering ""Nothing's lonely now""
Nothing anymore in pain
A tall shadow dressed how secrets always dress
When they want everyone to know that they're around
Leaning in whispering ""my friend over there

Don't know what he's talking about""
Did you really believe
That everyone makes it out?
Almost no one makes it out
I'm going to use that street to hide
From that human doubt
To hide from what was shining
And has finally burned us out
But if no one makes it out
How come you're talking to one right now
For once almost was good enough",Almost Was Good Enough,2003

Shine on the distance between me and the last thing I see

Let it be me helping
Let it be me honestly
Let it be me working

On being a better me
Rise moon on the shores of the seas
Shine on the distance between me and the last thing I see

Mark twain to Thomas Jefferson strike
Luke the Drifter to Zimmerman line drive

Everything against you sweetness
You bring the first down again
See it's ones like this you can always trust
Not to disappoint us

Moon shine that white lightning light
Down on the Possums' stage tonight
Maybe on the Man in Black
You could hold a little something back
Let his eyes adjust to the light
Rise Moon Rise above me
Show an American if really I am the snake they're all saying
If they look up here do they see just my black tail swaying?

Leave in the true love that they'll never find

I already knew who the party was for
All of my pain found a partner in that room
And the devil's tail swayed with the tune

How we sing as we limp through the air
Look below, there's our field over there
With our full crew aboard and our trust in the Lord
We're comin' in on a wing and a prayer

They waited for a word
Then a voice broke through the humming
And this is what they heard

I was full of hope and joy till this girl called me a boy

""Something's wrong with you, Jew""

Sonia,"I would take the stars
Out of the sky for you
Stop the rain from falling
If you asked me to
I'd do anything for you
Your wish is my command
I could move a mountain when
Your hand is in my hand
Words cannot express
How much you mean to me
There must be some other way
To make you see
If it takes my heart and soul
You know I'd pay the price
Everything that I possess
I'd gladly sacrifice

Oh you to me are everything
The sweetest song
That I could sing
Oh baby, oh baby
To you I guess
I'm just a clown
Who picks you up
Each time you're down
Oh baby, oh baby
You give me just
A taste of love to
Build my hopes upon
You know you got
The power boy
To keep me holding on
So now you got
The best of me
Come on and
Take the rest of me
Oh baby

Though you're close to me
We seem so far apart
Maybe given time
You'll have a change of heart
If it takes forever boy then
I'm prepared to wait
The day you give your love to me
Won't be a day too late

In tattered flames that will bring an end
To this dark and fragile world

With things I like
See me dance

Last July it was raining hard
I was cold I was wet I walked into the bar
There you stood
With your t-shirt torn

And your ripped up jeans
What a way to be born
And the ice in my glass
Just like me

Melted, like
Rain rolled over and out to sea
And we ran to my truck
Out of breath, full of luck

And there was something different about the way
That it felt when we touched
Going all through me
And the look in your eye

Seemed to say
Fix my life
With things I like
See me dance

In your light
That was back in 1987
When love was free
And life was heaven, it was the coldest day in February

We drove down to the cemetery
You said it was a fine day for a funeral
But I couldn't see through
Your cool black case of h.i.v.

Attacking our entire society
Condoms become a way of life
Without it, man
Your dick's a knife

Believe it, I mean it

Where the hot sand burns our barefoot skin
She's puttin' on sunscreen 'cause the hole in the ozone's

Son 8 años tratando de estar donde estoy 
En un transcurso de vida hasta el sol de hoy 
Me he caído y mi ego me levanto 
Me he jodído pa' ser quien soy y no me voy 
Entre medio de tripeos y de pichaera 
Yo luchaba por un sueño y ayudar mi vieja 
Echarle pa'l de chelitos en la cartera 
Y demostrarle a la gente quien Christian Colón era 
Un chamaquito que quería superar to' los atrasos 
Sufriendo de pobresa y a la vez de rechazo 
Y dicho sea de paso nunca me arrepiento del pasado 
Por el a fin de cuenta he madurado y he aprendido 
A ser agradecido con quien me ha ayudado 
A superarme y dar por hecho mi sueño dorado 
Muchas cicatrices llevo por lo que he resbalado 
Pero en exito y progreso me han recompensado 
Ahora río por lo que he llorado 
Y to'as las noches de rodilla Dios es alabado 
En la esquinita de la cama que tanto sufrí 
Porque me lo he ganado, ahora es que me toca a mi

Buscando plata pa' comer, y no pa' un bling bling 
Trabajando fuerte para poder subsistir 
Y mi desahogo era sentarme a escribir 
Y rimar de lo bueno que la vida era 
Del jangueo' y de to'a la jerga callejera 
Si hacia rimas de mi alacena 
Serian pocas porque no habia avena 
Y en el closet mucho menos ropa 
Inspirandome en la vida de otras personas 
Yo siendo material pa' la portada del ""Primera Hora"" 
Escribiendo lo que vi descubrí un talento 
Que aunque fuera en vano despejaba mi mente de este infierno
Pero en la calle ya la gente decía 
Que el que en la esquina vendía un gran futuro tendría 
Que si seguía como iba daban un vastagazo 
Y si volvia al callejon cogería un balaso 
Decidi cambiar y no dejar llevarme 
Buscar trabajo y en la universidad matricularme

I wish you love and heart
And days are laughter and joy
I wish you happy life
But it has to be life without me
Blinded I was blinded by your shining light
Lost myself and my future
Thank you oh thank you for all the wrongs and rights
And for giving me all of your love

Sonic Syndicate,"I recognized your scars, because I have them too
It cured my contamination to speak of each other's misery
Can't deny that you were a substitute of a greater loss
But after all you reminded me of

You're someone to the world
And you're the world for someone
You really think you have a future without me?
There's a place not far away
Where I want to take you
The first snowfall is always the whitest

Alone again in my broken dreams
What is love if not a psychic suicide
Alone again in my restless dreams
Love is nothing but a psychic suicide

Sonic Trance,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2004

Until I had this dream last night
I still remember their savage cries
So serious in their right
Faces painted in joyous fright
In the dawns early light
Oh say did you see the color of my eternity
And the sweat on my skin
Our founding fathers laid right down
And Indian ghost from long ago
They gave birth to my bastard kin
