Part the seas, don't be having me in the line (oh shit)

I'm Fergie Ferg, and me love you long time (oh shit)

Back to back, drop it down real low (oh shit)
I'm such a lady, but I'm dancing like a ho (oh shit)
'Cause you know I don't give a fuck, so here we go (oh shit)

How come every time you come around

And my speech start slurring
Everybody start looking real good

That Grey Goose got your girl feeling loose
Now I'm wishing that I didn't wear these shoes (I hate heels)
It's like every time I get up on the dude
Paparazzi put my business in the news
And I'm like, get up out my face
Before I turn around and spray your ass with mace
My lips make you wanna have a taste
You got that...I got the bass

How come every time you come around
My London, London Bridge wanna go down, like

And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""

And you'll always wonder why... because you never tried

Oh, you better know your maker

Who agrees the things you've seen in visions can be done
So you gotta realize
That the truth that makes you wise, also makes you Faith rise!

Trust me, you can note that, in Him there is no lack
You can drick from His fount in Zion's Mountain With no cash
Man, ya life is on smash, but you're in ya room
With a box of tissues, wiping sniffles, wishing for Ya tomb
But the sky is the limit God knew you in the womb

But if I'd only known how the king would fall
Hey who's to say you know I might have changed it all

Thanks a lot next semester I'll be thirty five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser,
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Ow!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a space ship
While they screamin' at me ""Let's just be friends!""
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
Try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans (Ahh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)

I just drank a fifth of vodka,
Dare me to drive? (Go ahead) all my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide

I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breast feed me Mom? You ain't got not tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang!)

I can still remember 
How that music used to make me smile 
And i knew that if i had one chance 
I could make those people dance 
And maybe they'd be happy for awhile 

Did you write the book of love 
And do you have faith in God above 
If the bible tells you so 
Now do you believe in rock n roll 
And can music save your mortal soul 
And can it teach me how to dance real slow 
Well i know that your in love with him 
Cause i saw you dancing in the gym 
You both kicked off your shoes 
And i did Gods rhythm and blues 
I was a lonely teenage brock of luck 
With a great carnation and a pick up truck 
But i knew that i was out of luck 
The day the music died 
I started singing 

[Chorus] 
Bye bye Miss American Pie 
Drove my chevy to the levy 
But the levy was dry 
And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye 
singing 
This will be the day that I die 
This will be the day that I die 

I met a girl who sang the blues 
And i asked her for some happy news 
But she just smiled and turned away 
Well i went down to the sachet store 
Where i heard the music years before 
But the man there said the music wouldn't play 
Well now in the streets the children screamed 
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed 
But not a word was spoken 
The church bells all broken 
And the three men i admire the most, 
The father, son, and the holy ghost 
They caught the last train for the coast 
The day the music died 
I started singing 

Bye bye Miss American Pie 
Drove my chevy to the levy

And good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye

The Hit Crew,"In the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumor spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree.

And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked ""Why not?"" and I replied ""I don't know""
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be

And he laughed insane and quipped ""Kahlil Gibran""
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

So I said ""So long"" and I waved ""Bye-bye""
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind

Got laid by a young bordello
I was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag

And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said ""You'll never go down to the Gods again""
(Turn around,go back!)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said ""Do it again, do it again""
(Turn around,go back!)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said ""Do it again, do it again""
(Turn around, go back!)

Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply

And I was seething, breathing deeply

Weathered faces lined in pain

But still your love was true 
And when no hope was left inside 
On that starry, starry night 
You took your life as lovers often do 
But I could have told you, Vincent 
This world was never meant 
For one as beautiful as you 

Starry, starry night 
Portraits hung in empty halls 
Frameless heads on nameless walls 
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget 
Like the strangers that you've met 
The ragged men in ragged clothes 
A silver thorn, a bloody rose 
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow 

Now I think I know what you tried to say to me 
And how you suffered for your sanity 
And how you tried to set them free 
They would not listen, they're not listening still 
Perhaps they never will",Vincent,

And things you ain't never thought about thinkin'
If you ain't peeped then you must be drinkin' and smokin'
Pretending that you're loc'in but you're broken, let me get you open
Now little Timmy got his diploma and little Jimmy got life
And Tamika 'round the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
The other homie shot the other homie and ran off with his money
And when the other homies heard about it they thought that it was funny
But who's the dummy, 'cause, now you done lost the hustler
A down-ass brother done been replaced by a buster
And though I got love for ya, I know I can't trust ya
'Cause my crew is rollin' Hummers and your crew is rollin' dusters
And just because of that you act like you don't like the brother no more
I guess that's just the way it goes

More temptation than faith, I guess we livin' for the day
I seen a man get swept off his feet, by a boy with an AK
The situation so twisted everybody gettin' lifted
I'm just tryin' to take care of my kids and handle my business
'Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
So you don't get caught slippin' when they come and do all the gettin'
Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big heart
Some of us gotta run a little faster 'cause we gotta later start
I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender
If everybody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner
No matter your rag color, deep down we all brothers
And regardless of the time, somebody up there still love us
I'ma scuffle and struggle until I'm breathless and weak
I done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something
I'll be there when you get there waitin' with the sounds bumpin'

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there

You need to loosen up and live a little
And if you got kids let them know how you feelin'
For your own sake give a little
Oh, you don't want to hear that, you busy tryna stack
And keep up with the Joneses, takin' advantage of your own
The realest homies that you've been knowing for the longest
But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us
We prefer to keep our eyes shut 'til it's right
When there's something involved that we desire
So hold your head up high if your're poor and righteous
I know times seem strife, and problems seem endless
But at the times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together
And if you feel you're out of the game then you need to get back in it
'Cause nothing worse than a quitter
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother
So wrap up your pity and turn it to ambition
And put your vehicle in 'drive' and stop by my side

I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there

As we walk down the road of our destiny
And the time comes to choose which shall it be
The wide and crooked, or the straight and narrow
We got one voice to give and one life to live
Stand up for something or lie down in your game
Listen to the song that we sing
It's up to you to make it big

When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys, breaking all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Hugging on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And running from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whooping to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Lady
Don't ya know we love ya? Sweet lady
Dear mama
Place no one above ya, sweet lady
You are appreciated
Don't ya know we love ya?

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was looking for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hanging
I needed money of my own so I started slanging
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you coming home after work late
You're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate
Ya just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Lady
Don't ya know we love ya? Sweet lady
And dear mama
Place no one above ya, sweet lady
You are appreciated
Don't ya know we love ya?

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Raise up cups of Christmas cheer
I just need to catch my breath
Christmas by myself this year

Calendar picture, frozen landscape
Chill this room for twenty-four days
Evergreens Sparkling snow
Get this winter over with!
Flash back to spring time saw him again
Would have been good to go for lunch
Couldn't agree when we were both free
We tried, we said we'd keep in touch
Didn't of course 'till summertime
Out to the beach to his boat
Could I join him?
No This time it was me
Sunburn in the third degree
Now the calendar's just one page
Of course I am excited
Tonight's the night I've set my mind
Not to do too much about it

Hardly dashing through the snow
'Cause I bundled up too tight
Last minute have-to-dos
A few cards, a few calls
Because it's RSVP
No, thanks No party lights
It's Christmas Eve, gonna relax
Turn down all of my invites
Last fall I had a night to myself
Same guy called, Halloween party
Waited all night for him to show
This time his car wouldn't go
Forget it, it's cold, it's getting late
Trudge on home to celebrate
In a quiet way unwind
Doing Christmas right this time

A&P has provided me
With the world's smallest turkey
Already in the oven, nice and hot
Oh damn! Guess what I forgot
So on with the boots
Back out in the snow
To the only all night grocery
When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year
'Spending this one alone,' he said
'Give me a break, this year's been crazy'
I said 'Me too, but why are you
You mean you forgot cranberries too?'
Then suddenly we laughed and laughed
Caught on to what was happening
That Christmas magic's brought this tale
To a very happy ending

I was unfurling a flag of defiance

This is the end of the session.
I ain't gonna be taking any more questions.

I'm pretty sure I wasn't your first choice.
I think I was the last one remaining.
I wish we hadn't gone and destroyed it.
'Cause I was thinking we could pull another weekender.
If you've still got a little bit of clairvoyance.

I remember the metal bar.
I remember the reservoir.
You could say our paths have crossed before.

So if it has to be a secret.
Then I guess that I can deal with it.
You and I both know it's a negative thing.
In the end only the girls know the whole truth.

There were a couple pretty crass propositions.
There were some bugs in the bars.
There was a kid camped out by the coat check.
She said the theme of this party is the industrial age.
You came in dressed like a train wreck.

I remember the OTB.
The five second delivery.
You could say our paths have crossed before.

So if it has to be a secret.
Then I guess that I can deal with it.
God only knows it's not always a positive thing.

Working for the FBI
Sitting in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high

Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman singing a song

A pair of forty fives made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise

She was a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9"" beautiful 'n' tall
Just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all

I saw her heading to the table
Well, a tall walking big black cat
Charlie said, I hope that you're able, boy
'Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at

Suddenly we hear the sirens
And everybody started to run
Jumping under doors and tables
Well, I heard somebody shooting a gun

Well, the DA was pumping my left hand
She was holding my right
Well, I told her, don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared
I'm gonna be forgiven if I wanna spend my living

Sweat is falling just like a tear drop running from her head
Now she's dancing, going through the movements, swaying to and fro

The Hollies,"Would you like to slide down a rainbow 
Catch a falling star in your hands 
Chase a moonbeam right by your window 
Close your eyes and you`ll be there 

In a land of dragons and castles 
be a knight in armor that shines 
on a horse with trappings of silver 
Close your eyes and you`ll be there 

You will be there 
Hoping that no one 
will come and wake you up 
You will be there 
While the mooning is peeping 
as you lie a-sleeping 
in your dream world 

[Chorus:]
See the witches fly on their broomsticks 
stirring cauldrons casting their spells 
Kisses changing frogs into princes 
Close your eyes and you`ll be 
close your eyes and you`ll be 
close your eyes and you`ll be there",Lullaby to Tim,1967
The Hollies,"When I hear pitter-patter the rain on the window 
Reminds of her 
When I hear pitter-patter the rain on the window 

It was raining hard 
The trees looked bare the night I met her 
She was wet her hands were cold 
The wind blew through her hair 

Though I`d known her quite a long time 
We were just good friends 
So it didn't seem so strange 
Inviting her back home 

We sat by the fire 
The flames brought out something in her 
Melting all the cold 
Projecting warmth I never knew 

As the rain beat on my window 
Did she understand 
That in the glow of dying embers 
Everything was planned 

Pitter-patter pitter-patter pitter-patter pitter-patter 
Pitter-patter pitter-patter pitter-patter pitter-patter 
Pitter-patter pitter-patter pitter-patter pitter-patter 
Pitter-patter pitter-patter pitter-patter pitter-patter 

We made love later on that night 
While the rain beat on my window 
I can`t forget the things that happened 
While the rain beat down on my window 

Next time I saw her 
I knew she didn't want to know me 
If I disappointed her 
I think she should have told me 

Can`t she understand 
I only tried to be a man 
She made me feel so ashamed 
Of everything I am

The rain on the window 
Reminds of her",Rain on the Window,1967
The Hollies,"And the power you have over
Won't ever let me be
It's always holding me to you
And the strange things you say to me
Why do you play with me
It's just too sad to see

Stop right there
Tell me what you're doing to my mind in there
Tell me what you're doing Am I blind
Long ago everything about you was for me to hold
Now my thoughts about you won't stay cold
And in time I might slip away
Into the light of day
But with you I must stay it's true
Wishful thinking will just bring me down

I`m sure it`s started showing

I`m telling you 
The heartaches begin 

I need someone to guide me 
someone to reconcile me 
to take away this pain 
before it starts again 
But no one listens to me 
Can`t control what`s set in deeply

An empty shell`s all you see

Of the little toffee shop

A penny every day that I have saved 
To buy myself some sweets

With glasses and shawl 
Gives love away to good little boys 
Who do as they are told 

She`s always telling stories 
Of her childhood days 
She couldn't buy the things that I can 
For families in those days 

Imagine the sweets that I can buy 
With six pennies of my own

Brown sugar in my hand

And sugar that looks like sand",Ye Olde Toffee Shoppe,1967

Rolling high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flamin' roads

Proud 'neath heated brow

I'm younger than that now

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
Rip down all hate I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundation deep somehow

Ah, but I was so much older than
I'm younger than that now

Girls faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizin' politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Unthought of, though, somehow

Ah, but I was so much older than
I'm younger than that now

Ah, but I was so much older than
I'm younger than that now

My guard stood hard
When abstract threats too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinkin'
I had somethin' to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow

Them that will and them that won`t

If you lie with me, you won`t sleep

A room that once was filled with gloom 
Know that I will love you for a long time

The Hollies,"She looks from side to side 
The tear drops fill her eyes 
As once again she hears the sound of shouting 
turns to the window pane 
Funny there`s rain again 
Inside her head she hears the sound of shouting 

They are fighting again 
All she feels is cold and pain 
She don`t know whose side to take 
Mother`s or Father`s 
She can`t know that soon they`ll part 
That they broke each other`s heart 
They are breaking up, but she don`t understand it 

She leaves the room in fright 
Each time they start to fight 
She runs up to her bed 
But there`s no sleeping 
Clings to her teddy bear 
But even teddy bear can`t stop her weeping 

Little girl dry your eyes 
Your Ma and Pa one day will put you wise 
Little girl don`t you cry 
You`ll understand what happened by and by

Took you from dakota from the black hills to the plains
I brought you up a lady and the right way to behave
Turned my pockets inside-out and not a dime was saved
And now you're trying to decide whether to go or stay

Don't let a little thing like love keep on bringing you down, my babe
Or ever change the plans you made
Don't let a little thing like tears keep on turning you 'round, my babe
You're old enough to change your ways
And if you're feeling all run down, you look for the brighter lights uptown
Don't let a little thing like me ever stand in your way

Took you on a fast train across the rio grande
A mexicano wedding with a tijuana band
You blew my whole life savings and all the gold I'd panned
So if you're trying to find a way to say your sweet goodbyes

Sipping at the wine
I'm drinking all the time
I'm drinking kinda slow
And I'm hoping it won't go
See when I get dry
I just sit and cry over my baby
Seems that in the past
It was gonna last
Somewhere it went wrong
All the good times gone
But I don't know why
So I sit and cry over my baby

Well, now, yeah I thought that, I thought that
If we could take it, we'd love each other so much
We'd be sure to make it
But oh baby oh my baby
Look what we've got
There's nothing at all

Thinking of the bad times
Stretched out on my bed
Images of you, girl
Running through my head
Wish that I could die
So I lay and cry over my baby

I've been a real bad man and I oughta be dead
Oh what a life I've led
I've been real mean man, full of cheating and lying
Left a lot of men dead and a lot of girls crying

I went there to steal all the railmen's pay
And when I left town all the streets ran red
I had ten grand in gold, and three guards lay dead

If you were a wise man, you would've left me alone

Leave the bridge and captain's walking

Valued things are hard to find 
My mind's gone I know not where 
left without a care 

When my thoughts are taking flight 
pen them down on sheets of white 
Building castles in the air 
left without a care 

In a crowded room alone that's where you'll find me 
I have left my mind somewhere floating behind me 

Blue skies white clouds to be seen 
wish my mind could be as clean 
As the clouds that swim above 
all the world is love

The Hollies,"Standing by a riverside 
A river so deep and so wide 
Current's too strong for only one man 
I know because I tried 

I got eight oars - 
four on either side 
Is there anybody with me 
Eight hands four willing hearts 
Won't someone answer my plea 

Well I got in the boat 
I stayed afloat 
Some way across I was tiring 
Well I need someone to help me 
to get to the other side 

Along came son of Alabama south 
He said ""I heard you calling 
If you don't mind the colour of my skin 
I'll help you not to fall in"" 

Then suddenly Joe from out of Tokyo 
""If my eyes don't make you nervous 
I used to handle a junk back home"" 
Said 'Can I be of service' 

Well we got in the boat 
we stayed afloat 
Halfway across we were tiring 
We got to row this boat together 
to get to the other side 

Two more oars 
only one seat left 
One more person to lean on 
A brotherhood boat to a land called home 
with our share of freedom 

Got in the boat 
stayed afloat

The Hollies,"See the girl with cymbals on her fingers
Entering through the door
Ruby glistening from her navel
Shimmering around the floor

Bells on feet go, ting a ling a linging
Going through my head
Sweat is falling just-a-like-a tear drops
Running from her head

Now she dancing, going through the movements
Swaying to and fro
Body moving, bringing back a memory
Thoughts of long ago

Blood is rushing, temperature is rising
Sweating from my brow
Like a snake, her body fascinates me
I can’t look away now

Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Give me time to breathe
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Or I’ll have to leave

Now, she’s moving all around the tables
Luring all in sight
But I know that she cannot see me
Hidden by the light

Closer, closer, she is getting nearer
Soon she’ll be in reach
As I enter into a spotlight
She stands lost for speech

Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Give me time to breathe
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Or I’ll have to leave

Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Give me time to breathe
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Or I’ll have to leave

Now I hold her, people are staring
Don’t know what to think
And we struggle knocking over tables
Spilling all the drinks

Can’t they understand that I want her?
Happens every week
Heavy hand upon my collar
Throws me in the street

Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Give me time to breathe
Stop, stop, stop all the dancing
Or I’ll have to leave, leave

I am alone, gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock, I am an island

I've built walls, a fortress deep and mighty that none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock, I am an island

Don't talk of love well I've heard the words before
It's sleeping in my memory
And I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried

I am shielded in my armor, hiding in my room, safe within my womb

The Hollies,"The smoke was slowly rising as the light began to fade
There were fires on the skyline from some distant border raid
There I was riding out at seventeen to join my first brigade
Many years ago 

And I chanced upon a farmhouse where the woman took me in
She gave me food and wine she gave me shelter from the wind
She delayed me from my regiment and service of my king
Many years ago 

She said, ""Soldier before I lose you to the fight
Oh, my soldier, I'll make a man of you tonight""
She took me over in the fading fire glow
On that wild and misty night she was my woman 

When I rose next morning I was gone before she stood
Tore myself away from there and left without a word
The sound of distant infantry was the only sound I heard
On that morning 

And in that day I aged ten years and died a thousand deaths
I learned the feel of frozen steel and fear within my breast
But the lesson I'll remember till they lay me to my rest
Keeps returning 

She said, ""Soldier before I lose you to the fight
Oh, my soldier, I'll make a man of you tonight""
She took me over in the fading fire glow
On that wild and misty night she was my woman 

And when the dice of war were thrown and victory was won
My drunken young compatriots went out to have their fun
And there was no single house they didn't burn or overrun on that evening 

And I rode out to that place again as hard as I could ride
But I found her by the cradle on that lonely mountainside
In the hands of those brave friends of mine she suffered and she died
Many years ago

The early bird's been up all morning
But I've got no notion of moving from where I am
Though my legs won't move I feel disabled

Waiting for someone to fetch me from lost and found

Kept the secret from me they thought it was shameful

Left on their own couldn't afford to clothe me

Just a five nine

Tall
With just one look I was a bad mess

Boy""

Well suddenly we heard a siren
And every body started to run
A jumping out of doors and tables
Well I heard somebody shooting a gun.

I want to shout aloud
and then I think about the love
I had inside me and how you brought what's inside out.
So now love's made it to the outside
I want to tell the world of everything I've found
somehow your love released a spring wound up inside me
you turned my living upside down;

And I can't tell the bottom from the top

Am I standing on my head or on my heels?
Is it cloudy
is it bright?
Is it day or is it night?
Am I wrong or am I right and is it real?

Tell me where you learned the magic
The spell you used the day you made me fall

Baby now I know that love is no illusion
I'm upside down
But ten feet tall.

And I can't tell the bottom from the top

Am I standing on my head or on my heels?
Is it cloudy

Am I wrong or am I right and is it real?

On and on I drifted with the tide
I didn't know that love could move me so

You filled my life with love and much more besides
And you showed me which way to go

And I can't tell the bottom from the top

Just a five nine

Thought it was my sister who fell off the wall

Kept the secret from me they thought it was shameful

Left on their own couldn't afford to clothe me
And I, I don't even know my real name

Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler ""Woo woo woo""

I used to walk you home
I used to hold your hand
You used to use my umbrella ev'ry time it rained
You used to cry so much it was a crying shame


Hello Josephine. How do you do?
Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler 'Woo woo woo""

You used to live over yonder by the railroad track.
When it rained you couldn't walk I used to tote you on my back
Now you gotta make believe it was a thrill at that.

The Holmes Brothers,"[ VERSE 1: Mike G ]
Remedies for house parties stayed simple and plain
Little wine, little music, little Mary Jane
Gotta keep the lights dim, so when the people walk in
The vibe stays nice and mellow, everybody fits in
And everybody hey and ho, are gettin they groove on
The record only stops when the lights came on
Then they went back off, we continued to groove
Then somebody grabbed the mic like they had somethin to prove
It was just the spirit got em, it wouldn't let loose
There right before our eyes hip-hop was produced
The fire kept on burnin like a doggie in heat
You couldn't help to feel the flavor as you walked through the streets
Everybody had a crew on every block for blocks
This seemed to be insurance that the beat won't stop
So one day shots ring and it was no one to blame
All you thought was would it ever all be the same
But if you got the love, baby, won't a damn thing change
As long as you remember it always remains

[ CHORUS: The Holmes Brothers ]
I remember
When we used to play shoot-em-up, bang-bang
I remember
When we used to play shoot-em-up, bang-bang
MC's and DJ's						(2x)

[ VERSE 2: Afrika Baby Bam ]
Block parties jam-packed, the first time I heard rap
And deejays spinnin breakbeats back
These were the last good days of the ghetto
It wasn't all about bein jiggy, so save that rap for Jell-O
Down on my knees in the street playin skelly
Rushin upstairs to see _Graffiti Rock_ on the telly
With one eye on the beats droppin
I knew that one day would come when I'd be on the mic rockin
Every day after school practisin
I mixed blues smarts with street smarts, and then started battle rappin
But for me it wasn't happenin 
So I changed up my style, to the ladies been mackin
I wrote a rhyme about 'Roxanne, Roxanne'
I used to bust it out when I went to a jam
My mother read the dirty rap
She said, ""You ain't gon' go too far expressin yourself like that
Disrespectin black women
And what's gon' happen when you turn around and try to have your own children?""
So I changed up my style once again
So me and my moms could still be friends
My daddy wasn't buggin out so far
Watchin me pretend to be another rap star
Through my eyes he saw a child changin
Growin up to be a man and leave behind the shootin, bangin

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Afrika Baby Bam ]
Now this one goes out to the ones who set it off
And all the pioneers that made it what it was
Cause we been doin this for 25 years long
So we gotta represent and keep hip-hop strong
JBeez, we on a plateau, ain't nothin stoppin us
Will with the spirit of God, now watch it jump in us
Cause when you cut the roots off the family tree
All you leave behind is the sweet memory
Right from the start, we did it in the park
It wasn't for the money, and it came from the heart
But in these days and times, when rappers write rhymes
All we think about is signin on the dotted line
Me, I been thinkin about the way it used to be
When before you was a rapper, you became an MC
I'm proud of my heritage, and glad that we made it
I still bust rhymes without bein player-hated
Standin on the same stage, rockin with the JBeez
Was a dream come true for a brother like me
Before rap was consumed, and hip-hop was doomed
I was bangin on tables, rhymin in the lunchroom
I used to walk the street with my ghetto blaster
My brothers on the block was startin Zulu chapters
You know what I'm talkin about if you go way back
And yo, big ups to all my sisters, in the name of rap
Cause when it comes to hip-hop, you know you gotta keep it true
Take from the old, mix it with the new
I used to go by the name of MC Shazaam
But now you know me as Afrika Baby Bam

Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Made Galileo look like a Boy Scout

The Honour Recital,"Sing me to sleep tonight
Sing me to sleep

Blank pages filled the spaces
I've held open so long
Train tracks pressing towards our faces
Ear drums clinging to the sound
One bright sun to say hello
Two of us to watch the moon
Three million miles 'till we make it
We'll never make it 'till we go
Let's rock the road, my sweet incredible
And we'll sing

Sing me to sleep tonight
The ink pressed to the page
The blankets tucked in tightly
And a kiss from my love

Quiet whispers breaking silence
What goes on behind closed doors?
We sit, terrible asylum
But You'll hear us no more
The world lies before us
Turn the key and watch us burn
Our past lies behind us
But come on, let's go
Let's rock the road, my sweet incredible
And we'll sing

Sing me to sleep tonight
The ink pressed to the page
The blankets tucked in tightly
And a kiss from my love
Read me a lullaby
The cold's biting at both ends
And don't leave me with the light out
The beginning to the end

I will stay on the path I've chose.
One last breath, don't take it away.
Headlights shine through the surreal.
Stars bright to destiny.
Grasp tightly to the wheel.
We'll find if we believe.

The Honour Recital,"Take down all the percacet.
Try to keep the pain away
That you didn't even know was there
Until you swallowed drugs anyway.
An empty glass makes number nine
And watch it all evaporate.
Make another dream come true
Through the comfort of a smoky haze. 

And don't open up those blinds

All we need's another bump
For another wasted holiday.

Reach for the sky.
If I don't get off this couch, I'll disintegrate. 
Just one more time.
No more, I think I've had to much.
This silence always seems to keep me wide awake
Always seems to keep me wide awake yeah

Maybe I'll stay in tonight
But imagine what my friends would all say.
We'll let the ether calm our nerves
As we slowly drive ourselves insane.
An empty bottle, swollen lungs.
We'll take it and don't hesitate.
Maybe if we're not alone
We can all share our mistakes.

I live and breath your lovin' twenty-five hours a day

The Hooters,"She was a be-bop baby on a hard day's night.
She was hangin' on Johnny , he was holdin' on tight
I could feel her coming from a mile away.
There was no use talking, there was nothing to say
When the band began to play and play.

And we danced like a wave on the ocean, romanced
We were liars in love and we danced
Swept away for a moment by chance
And we danced and danced danced.

I met my be-bop baby at the Union Hall
She cold dance all night and shake the paint off the walls.
But when I saw her smile across a crowded room
Well I knew we'd have to leave the party soon
As the band began to play out of tune.

And we danced like a wave on the ocean, romanced
We were liars in love and we danced
Swept away for a moment by chance
And we danced and danced danced.

The endless beat she's walking my way
Hear the music fade when she says
Are we getting too close, do we dare to get closer
The room is spinning as she whispers my name

And we danced like wave on the ocean, romanced
We were liars in love and we danced
Swept away for a moment by chance
And we danced, danced, danced.",And We Danced,1996

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.

Towering over your head.

And she's gone.

where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.

That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Caught up in circles confusion is nothing new
Flashback warm nights, almost left behind
Suitcases of memories time after

Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say go slow, I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting

If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting

Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside, the drum beats out of time

Silently take my hand.
Nobody knows what's inside us.
Nobody understands.
They handed us down a dream
To live in this lovely town.

Only the echo of a hollow sound.

Between the bright night and darkest day?
Where do the children go?
And who's that deadly piper who leads them away?

Together we make our way
Passengers on a train.
Whisper a secret forever.
Promises in the rain.
We're leaving it all behind,
While castles are falling down.
We're going where no one can find us.
And if there's a heaven,
We'll find it somehow.
