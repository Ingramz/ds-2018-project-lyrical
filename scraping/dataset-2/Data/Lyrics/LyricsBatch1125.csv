Big Daddy Weave,"Standing here in the presence
Of something more than merely real
There are no words to describe you
Or explain the way I feel

As you speak I find healing for my soul
And your touch alone can make me whole

And my heart cries Holy
And my spirit feels the change
As my heart cries Holy I will never be the same

Your mercies toward me last forever
Your faithfulness is true
And as You touch the coal to my lips
My mind is made brand new

I could never repay all that You've done
So use my life to the glory of Your Son

Everything inside me
Everything untrue
Oh Lord I surrender
All of it to You",Heart Cries Holy,2003
Big Daddy Weave,"Strangers are attacking me
Ruthless they seek to steal my life
They have no regard for You, Lord
Vindicate me by Your might

[Chorus]
Though the darkness tries to steal my heart
It comes without warning
But Your mercy covers me because
It's new every morning

I place my trust in Your holy blood
To cleanse and protect me from all my sin
Though the Enemy rushes in
Your Spirit will lift up a standard against him

[Chorus]",New Every Morning,2003
Big Daddy Weave,"Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil
On the outside
Full of pride, full of lies, so well they hide
On the inside

[Chorus]
They'll never be all that they say
They live the life of a Pharisee

Not perfect on the surface, so far to go
On the outside
But a true heart and a new start is what what lives
On the inside

[Chorus]

For whom the Son has set free
He is free, free indeed
Receive the Son who mkes us free
Then you will be free indeed",Pharisee,2003
Big Daddy Weave,"Locked inside this cell of flesh 
I sat awaiting an eminent death
The fruitful labor of my sin 
Had brought me to what I knew would be the end

Well I had a debt I couldn't pay 
You paid a debt you didn't owe
You gave your life for me that day 
So freedom I could know

Set me free 
From the chains that bound me to my sin
Set me free 
From this life that I've been living 
Set me free

There has never been a time 
When Your mercy did not find me
Tangled up in all my sin 
And then so faithfully unwind me

But just before I slipped away 
You heard me when I called Your name
There'll never be a day when You won't come and

You are the author and the finisher of the faith in me
I know I can trust in You to come and set me free",Set Me Free,2003
Big Daddy Weave,"Walking down the road this life is on
The narrow path I try to stay
But I must confess I have a tendency to stray
I'd love to call it a mistake
A momentary lapse of faith
But the truth is sometimes I feel like I'm being dragged away

By the other side that people never see
A war is on between the good and bad inside of me

[Chorus]
Why do I do all the things that I do
When I want to do what is right
Change this wicked heart of mine
Let me walk with you in the new life

So what will ever put an end
To my recurring bout with sin
It seems I'm always at a loss for a way to win
When what I really need to do
Is to confront it with the truth
And let Your words of life sink in and make my mind brand new

A transformation that happens over time
Is the product of a renewed mind

Create in me a clean heart
Place Your spirit deep inside
Capture every thought
Til there's no place left to hide

[Chorus]",Why,2003
Big Daddy Weave,"Up tight, down right
Wound up like a spring
Funny how I worry 'bout what just don't mean a thing
But then that's when
You speak Your truth to me
You say things aren't what they seem
This life's not what it seems
And it changes

I'm in less of a hurry
I'm less likely to worry
When in my heart I receive
Thoughts of my eternal destiny
I've given up frustration
Trust You with out hesitation
But my mind just can't conceive
That it must be the You in me Lord

I tried till I cried
To bring about some change
But in spite of all the work
My efforts were in vain
I guess for this mess
I'm the one to blame
Cause when I'm trusting You
My life's just not the same
I'm different now

No matter what my present situation
I need to give it all to You",You in Me,2003
Big Daddy Weave,"Totally, completely
Entirely amazing
That the unseen has become seen
And is to me unfailing

You are the Lord, the Father of lights
You are God the Keeper of my heart
And I praise You, and I praise You

You are the lover of my soul
You are the giver of the second start
And I praise You for who You are

Seems too high for me to reach
To wrap my mind around the mystery
That who You are so constantly
Is who you're making me to be

And who You are does not rely on
What I'm currently surrounded by
You're teaching me to fly
Teach me to fly so high",For Who You Are,2005
Big Daddy Weave,"It's not about me
It's all about You
It's not about my pride
It's all about Your truth

And so right here from the start
I open up my heart
And say, Lord, here's every part
'Cause it's all about You

Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, it's all about You",It's All About You,2005
Big Daddy Weave,"Unbelievable, I'm blown away, it's true
By the matchless love that I've found in You
Undeniable, the change in me
I've never felt so free

It makes me want to dance
You make me want to dance
When I think about how

You love me, You love me
You love me just the way I am
You love me, You love me
You love me just the way
Just the way I am

Ever patiently accepting me
You love in spite of everything I do
But, oh, so faithfully you're committed
To the process that makes me like You

And I feel like I can dance
Oh, You make me want to dance
When I think about how

Not when I'm good enough
Not when I clean my act up
Not when I cross that line the thousandth time
And become a better man

Your grace is more than enough
To cover all my sins You washed them away
So right here today
You love me just the way I am",Just the Way I Am,2005
Big Daddy Weave,"Sneakin? 'round after midnight
There's no one there to see me
Participating on the wrong side
Then I hear a voice in my mind

When I see you running away
It makes me wanna cry
When I see you
Reminding me of the day I had to die

Don't you know that in My heart I still can feel the pain
'Cause when I see you it's like killing Me again

A Holy King is returning
It could be any time
He's coming back for a spotless bride
Not for those who've got something they're trying to hide",Killing Me Again,2005
Big Daddy Weave,"I used to think that I was never good enough to cut it
I bought the lines that they were selling time after time
But when You opened up my mind and I refused to shut it
You brought me to a place where I could leave it all behind

Goodbye to my old life, I don't listen to those lies anymore
You've given me new life, loving You is what I was made for

It took a while for me to see but when I finally saw it
I knew I had to leave my sorted past in the past
I couldn't get there on my own, it was Your grace that taught it
My sin is covered by Your blood and I'm not looking back

You saw right through me, Your kindness drew me
Your mercy knew me, You love came to me",What I Was Made For,2005
Big Daddy Weave,"Would we hear the sound
Of breathing in the dark?
Where would be life's spark
Without you

And would the birds every sing
Would the wind blow through the trees?
Could I touch the grass so green
Under this big sky so blue?
Without you, without You

And the sun doesn't shine
And my world stops spinnin' 'round
Without you, without you, yeah

And tell me where else could I ever find
The peace that floods this heart of mine
Without you, without you, yeah

Who could fill the emptiness inside?
Who would ease the pain in my broken heart?
Who would come in and abide?
Promise never to depart
Without you, without you, yeah, yeah

And the sun doesn't shine
And my world stops spinnin' 'round
Without you, without you, yeah

I can't live without you, I don't want to try to
Live one more moment without you, yeah, yeah
I can't live without you, I don't want to try to
Live one more moment without you

Without you, yeah

Big Daddy Weave,"On this hallowed ground

Words of life to me, to me

Big Daddy Weave,"I wanna sing like I'm driving in the car all by myself
I wanna dance like I just won the lottery
I wanna lift my hands and spin around
I wanna throw my head back and shout
Like a prisoner who's just found out he's free

I will give my everything
I'll be a fool for You
Because I am in love with You

I wanna sing and shout
I wanna dance around
I wanna forget who I used to be
And embrace Your truth

So when I sing and shout
Or when I dance around
When I lay my pride down
It's all for You, it's all for You

I wanna live learning how to make my life a sacrifice
I wanna die to find my true identity
I wanna answer at Your beckon call
Wanna do my best and give my all
I wanna hold on to You and let go of me

So let me give my everything
I'll be a fool for You
Because I am in love with You

I wanna sing and shout
I wanna dance around
I wanna forget who I used to be
And embrace Your truth

So when I sing and shout
Or when I dance around
When I lay my pride down
It's all for You

With sweet success already gained
Self righteousness is not my aim
I'm raised from death into Your life, so free

Not on my own but by Your grace
I'm gazing long into Your face
And I can't keep this passion bottled up inside of me

I wanna sing and shout
I wanna dance around
I wanna forget who I used to be
And embrace Your truth

So when I sing and shout
Or when I dance around
When I lay my pride down

Big Daddy Weave,"There's an old man sitting on a lonely park bench
He doesn't have a place to stay
And there's a woman who's living all by herself now
Since her husband left one day

Seems like we're all just pawns
In a game that has no rules
And I keep wondering, am I the biggest fool

There's an unborn child who never had a chance
Since convenience took its toll
And there's a guy who lost his house and wife and kids
Since the bottle took control

It just goes on and on
Who knows when it will end
And I can't stop thinking

Is it all the same? 'Cause nothing ever changes, oh
Under the sun I can't seem to find what I need, oh
You know it's all the same
Because they're only different faces, oh
Under the sun I can't seem to find any peace

There was a man who came and lived a perfect life
He came to give it all away
And the people clung to every word He said
Oh, until that final day

And then they nailed Him to a bloody tree
And He hung and bled
And died there just for me

He was not the same
Because He gave his life so freely, oh
He was God's Son

But as my world was spinning 'round
I saw His grace as it came down
To dwell within to make a change
Oh thank You Lord, I'm not the same

And now I'm not the same
Because the love He gives has changed me, oh
Now I walk in peace inside, oh
You know I'm not the same because
He placed His life within me, oh
Without a doubt I know I'm free, yeah, I am free
I am free, I am free, I am free",All the Same,2006
Big Daddy Weave,"I am sure all of Heaven's heard me cry
As I tell You all the reasons why
This life is just too hard

But day by day, without fail
I'm finding everything I need
And everything that You are to me

Every time I breathe You seem a little bit closer
I never wanna leave, I wanna stay in Your warm embrace
Oh, basking in the glory shining from Your face

And every time I get another glimpse of Your heart
I realize it's true that You are so marvelous God
And I am so in love with You, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So in love with You

Now how could I after knowing One so great
Respond to You in any way
That's less than all I have to give?

But by Your grace I wanna love You
Not with what I say but everyday
In a way that my life is lived

Every time I breathe You seem a little bit closer
I never wanna leave, I wanna stay in Your warm embrace
Oh, basking in the glory shining from Your face

And every time I get another glimpse of Your heart
I realize it's true that You are so marvelous, God
And I am so in love with You

Wrapped in Your mercy I wanna live and never leave
I am held by how humble
Yet overwhelmed by Your majesty

Captured by grace, now I'm finding
I am free, You are marvelous, God
And knowing You is everything

Every time I breathe You seem a little bit closer
I never wanna leave, I wanna stay in Your warm embrace

Big Daddy Weave,"Sometimes my life just don't make sense at all
When the mountains look so big
And my faith just seems so small

So hold me, Jesus, 'cause I'm shaking like a leaf
You have been King of my glory
Won't You be my Prince of peace?

When I wake up in the night, I feel the dark
It's so hot inside my soul
I swear there must be blisters on my heart

So hold me, Jesus, 'cause I'm shaking like a leaf
You have been King of my glory
Won't You be my Prince of peace?

Surrender don't come natural to me
I'd rather fight You for something I don't really want
Than to take what You give that I need
And I've beat my head against so many walls
I'm falling down, I'm falling on my knees, God please

And the Salvation Army band is playing this hymn
And Your grace rings out so deep
It makes my resistance seem so thin

So hold me, Jesus, 'cause I'm shaking like a leaf
You have been King of my glory
Won't You be my Prince of peace?

So hold me, Jesus, 'cause I'm shaking like a leaf
You have been King of my glory
Won't You be my Prince of peace?
(I surrender all)
Come and be my Prince of peace, oh Lord
(I surrender all)

Hold me, Jesus, 'cause I'm shaking like a leaf
You have been King of my glory
Won't You be my Prince of peace?

And hold me, Jesus, 'cause I'm shaking like a leaf
You have been King of my glory
Won't You be my Prince of peace?

You have been King of my glory
Come and be my Prince of peace

Come and be my Prince of peace

",Hold Me Jesus,2006
Big Daddy Weave,"Who could ever find the words
To describe the Indescribable
Limited vocabulary falls
So short of depicting You, God

Yet I'm distracted, the things
Of this world threaten to pull me apart
But in Your mercy You hear
The cry of my heart

Only Jesus, only Jesus
Lord, I'm tired of all the rest
When my heart knows You are best
Only Jesus, only Jesus

A Son of God and Son of Man who
Came to destroy the work of sin
And it's work in me was crushed when
You became the way for me

That I can live on my own
I'll find who I am wrapped up in You alone

You are the only and You are the only one for me
For all my days
You are the only, You are the only one for me
Come and make me Yours forever

I heard You say that the thing about passion is where all the action is
Your heart ain't trailin' far behind
I'm makin' a list and lookin' at what I missin'
And at where I'm spendin' my time
Am I missin' the one thing that I wanna find?

But wise men prize what the fools call lies
And the carnal call no fun
But I'm no fool to be cravin' You
To be wantin' to be with the only one

You are the only and You are the only one for me
For all my days, yeah
You are the only and You are the only one for me

Big Daddy Weave,"She calls out to the man on the street
Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I’ve nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?

He walks on, doesn’t look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh, think twice 'cause it's another day
For you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise

Just think about it

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she’s been crying
She’s got blisters on the soles of her feet
Can't walk but she’s trying

Oh, think twice 'cause it's another day
For you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice 'cause it's another day for you
You and me in paradise

Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do?
Oh Lord, there must be something You can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she’s been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn’t fit in there

Oh, think twice 'cause it's another day
For you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise

Oh, think twice 'cause it's another day
For you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, it's just another day for you
You and me in paradise

Think about it, just think about it
Won’t you, won’t you please?

It’s another day for you and me in paradise
It’s just another day for you and me in paradise
It’s another day for you and me in paradise
It’s just another day for you and me in paradise
In paradise, in paradise, in paradise, in paradise

Big Daddy Weave,"Yesterday's forecast called for rain and I
Found all my so called friends to be fair weather kind
Looking for shelter I was standing out in my pain
That's when You came and You changed everything

'Cause April showers bring may flowers like
Only You turn my darkest hour into

Blue skies, blue skies
Not a cloud over head in my life
When it's gray out I don't mind
I've got blue skies on the inside

Tossed about upon the stormy sea I swayed
Scared to death not at the wind but what I heard You say
It's not every time Your hand the wind will stay
Sometimes You're calling me to walk out on the waves

My perception should be a reflection
Not of what my eyes see but what Jesus tells me

Blue skies, blue skies
Not a cloud over head in my life
When it's gray out I don't mind
I've got blue skies on the inside

Blue skies, blue skies
Not a cloud over head in my life
When it's gray out I don't mind
'Cause I've got blue skies on the inside

I'm not sayin' I won't ever have a problem
Sometimes life's gonna rain on my parade
But if I know that you're right here with me then
Why should I worry? Why should I be afraid?

Outside when the rain is pourin' all around
I don't have to let it get me down

Not a cloud over head in my life
When it's gray out I don't mind

But I'm scared of losing it all
I'm standing on the edge of so much more

I'm falling into You and all Your mysterious ways
Draw me into You and Your unfailing grace
This will be the end of me

Don't know how much more 'cause it's been just that long
Seasons came and they've gone but still I remain
So sick of singing the same sad song

Now all that's left for me to do
Is to choose to embrace following You

Stepping out from the old into the new
I'll be following right here behind You

But now it all seems silly

A million miles too wide for me to reach the other side
In deep depression, broken over my rejection I failed to realize
To my great surprise, you'd paved a way with Your own life

I accept the invitation

And I realized in their embrace
To be held so tight
I've never felt so free

I know you are out on the town
You're runnin' around again
And if they ask me, if somebody ask me why I'm not with you oh yeah
I guess I'll have to confess 
That I've been wondering too
Why must I be denied the thrill of your kiss
What did I do to you to be treated like this
Why must I spend another night with the boys
Although their good company
I'd much rather be with you
Why can't you tell me, why can't you tell me baby what I've done wrong

It's all the same to me, there is no difference I can see
Well can you, take the boundaries of your cage?
Don't need me to refine, the truth is just a bit unkind
And she hates it when I play it straight like that
The time has come it's now or never
Can't afford to let it pass you by
You can say I've been wondering forever
Spinning your wheels till the day you die
I can't imagine, no I haven't really tried
To wait it out so long, you'll bend your feelings right or wrong
So that's why, now we're getting right to this
Seems so wrong because it is, your stupid fucking aunt's a bitch (funny)

Be the real love that I need

Oh, when I met you I just knew
That you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you felt for me
You said I'm not the one
So I slowly came to see
All of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspirations
Lead me to want some real love

I thought you were the answer to
The questions in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong
If I stay strong maybe
I'll find my real love

So I try my best and pray to God
He'll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards
A love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful
I can be your all in all
I'll give you good lovin' through the summertime

And I don't know where to go
Been around the world and high and low
And still I'll never know
How it feels to have a real love
'Cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way because it
Seems he can't be found

And now I'm grown, and they wonder why I'm crazy 
Imagine feedin' tablets and beer to a baby
Never had a chance when I was 5 
Nigga took me in the car, took me on the ghetto ride
Cruisin' through streets that I've never seen 
Pull the clip off a 30 round magazine 
Taught me how to deal with a triple beam 
And ever since then I've been servin' dope fiends
I got the game in the bag that's so big
Nigga see my nuts it's like two figs
Swoll to the fullest,

Rap me up between the sheets

I shot the hoe who set me up
I'm drivin' off mad because the niggas threw off my nut
I'm going through a thang, ain't no thang though

Lean my body if they could,

I'm hittin' my momma for some pocket change,

Should I kill a nigga for respect, or should I let him go?

But tru niggaz , say fuck that
You owe me money , its time to meet the chrome gat
I got the drank , finna tomorrow i take a piss test
And i know my probs. want me to go back
An ex-con addicted to gangsta rhymes
Last year i caught a bullet but it wasn't mine
Time to go nigga on dead row , or should i say I'm stuck in the ghetto

Chorus:
(2x) just a ghetto thang , a ghetto thang , you would understand if you
Was
From the ghetto man
(1x)its a ghetto thang , a ghetto thang , these niggaz got me caught up in
This ghetto thang

Silk:
See i ain't got no money up in my pocket
How the fuck ima stop it
Ima get the glock and cock and plug you like a socket
See game get deeper but why'all don't feel me
Telling me to gets up out the game , get a job
I shouldn't rob a nigga , i might kill yah
See up on the block i rides deep on gold thangs
These niggaz be trippin up on my shit and they'll jack you like it ain't no
Thang
See I'm from the city where niggaz be salty and they stay faulty like wires
And i ain't seen a gangsta retire yet
On a bet , threw my cothes up on the floor and i sweat
Trust nobody cause these niggaz today will smoke you like a cigarette
Now bet , rest in peace to all homies that didn't make it
Took life for granted , an i panic while seeing niggaz with ski masks
We blast with ski masks and bust a cap into they weak ass
Everyday struggle and i stay hustlin like a pan handler
Fuck it if i took a chance to get dead like cancer
I betta not chance it
Slik , just another nigga tryin to make it up out the ghetto

(chorus)
Big ed:
Got a hold on me , jealous fools want to roll on me
Will i die or will god just let me be
Fufill the prophecy reach my destiny avoid the burial plot
Unlive the ones that got popped
I got a son but she says that it isn't mine
I'm 24 and since birth I've served hard time
In this concrete jungle , a war zone , many of my peers die
Finally made it back home
Self preservation is a thing for me
Duckin and dodgin bullets stone faces on the ones who pulled it
I promise my mama i wouldn't die before she did
I got my life right got my wife and then my kids
But everywhere i look i see sadness
Imagine tryin to raise your babies in this worldwide madness

Looked out the window 

it must be the giggidy first of the month 

cause everybody in the ghetto is smilin' and dressed up 

Little kids havin' fun in my neighborhood 

And fiends walkin' up, talkin' bout its all good 

See I'm a G, ????? I got that 2 for 3 

And y'all a know that I slang, that I-see-E 

And everybody in the ghetto use nicknames 

Like V-90, Master P, Boz, and Big Man 

My little homies posted up 

some hang, hang, and some slangin' 

Others gang bangin' 

I'm tryin' to make it out the hood with this gangsta rap 

And stay TRU to the game, and put the town on the map 

But haters hate me and niggas try to talk shit 

Cause I done made, a dollar out of 15 cents 

On the curb, posted up with them bouldas 

And servin' fiends, A-1 yola 

And still tryin' stay true with my frist meal 

Cause in the ghetto, you got money, you might get killed 

And stayin' TRU to the game, is a part of life 

And if you don't player, you might lose your life

Stayin' gangstafied 

While I'm tryin' to make a million 

But politicians run for office 

They rather me bust a cap in a rat, cause they both gonna try and stop

Now I lay me down to sleep 

I pray the Lord that my momma will never weep 

and let her live in peace and stop spendin' a hundred G's up in her sleep 

When will it stop 

I guess when they leave me lyin' on the block 

With tears on my glock 

A pocket full of lemon drops, laughin' at crooked cops 

I guess I'm doin' what I gotta do 

As long as I stay TRU, until they put me through 

I know its a shame, things'll never change 

I hope I live long enough to see my daughter spell my name 

I'm TRU 2 Da Game

Where the niggas at, how you do dat there?
Motherfuckers uptown nigga we don't care

I can't fly when I jump shot I'm bringin' this clean
'Cause my boy bringin' noise like a truck full of fifteens

Squeeze when it's right in the heat of the night
Told two niggas better defeat the world fo fish

The killas fo spot, fo block and fo clock
I move more hoes let's go hot when I'm ready to pull shot, pull shots
I know when I breed 'em, hold down for sure

Full time,  four W-D plus, shots, niggas get rushed out
Bust the guts out and no limit soldiers had enough shots
Cut throats to the fullest, keep a niggas hemp out
Toe to toe we make noise, action packed we slang boys
Trenitty flexing real shits
Cut throat committed hurry, hurry and we in this bitch

Started off as a youngster kickin' up dust
Until I slain motherfuckers who be ready to bust, give a fuck

Gotti be the title that I hold for sure
Pokin' hoes after shows with my nigga Feano
Hit the scheme for your cream if you know what I mean
Triple beam when I'm in it fourteen

Gettin' bad with me, I screw your head off your shoulders

Jump in the cut roll a fat one up
Fire it up, better love 'cause a soldier don't stut, yeah

My nigga Snoop brought the weed, Slim brought the liquor
C brought the cash and I brought the stripper
Freak ho shake that ass while niggas tip her
Got a pocket full of rubbers so we all goin' hit her

Bitch cleaner than Mr. Clean, a nigga decked out
Eyes hella red, Kane and Abel sessed out
Respect the tank, nigga stick my chest out
And this how we do it in the dirty south

Woah, please somebody tell me where the party at?
I'm tired of holding back, I wanna shine in my Cadillac
I'm here representing a soldier named Slim
See the tank on this neck, see the ice on this wrist

Picture this, I'm riding with Snoop Doggy Dogg
And so y'all don't worry 'bout the corners, we smokin' till the morning
Y'all just keep the bitches, now we on the way
Hold on man, I think Snoop got somethin' to say

Think fast when you dunk, 'cause I won't front
And when it's time to dunk I won't be no punk
I'll just pick the heater up and bust a shot
I'm the last nigga up to rock the spot

I'm represent a nigga to the fullest cause
And if y'all wanna trip, we tear this club up

Huh bro, nigga, nigga what, I'm tryin' to bust again

Big Ed,"[Mac] 
No Limit black sheep played the back seat for months 
Stayed away from the Tanqueray bitches and blunts 
Still Mac nigga ain't nothin' changed 
Got the rings and the gold chains 
Now bitches want to know my whole name 
I penetrate em then I disintegrate em 
I let the next nigga date em 'cause I don't hate em 
I spit voodoo to the most hard to get hoes 
And at the end of the night, I rippin' off clothes 
You fuckin' with the realest, from lyrical spillers 
To killers and dealers and cap peelers, and street guerrillas 
From villains to chillers, we made millions 
And paid killers to protect scrilla 
So what the fuck you talk about winners? 
You hear that word camouflage when you hear my name 
I represent the shell shocked 'cause it's in my veins 
(No Limit soldier) is on my left arm, I took it in blood 
Throw your hood up if you a thug 
And all them niggas say 

[Chorus: Mac] 
You see a soldier on the streets holler 
You hear them soldiers on them beats holler 
Every time them soldiers speak holler 

[Kane and Abel] 
Load your weapons, grab your gats 
We sprinkle daily verbs over tracks 
Hit the chest like heart attacks 
When my lyrical hammer cock back 
And leave bullet holes in your Bourbons and 'Lacs 
The only thing we give them hoes is a dick and a smack 
Gangstafied Kane and Abel you know the camouflage assassin 
Blastin' and mashin', kidnappin' and head bashin' 
Razor blade slashin', the endo blunt passin' 
For the cash and, woah it's bout to happen 
What you want (?) ugly with that 223 
Hit em up in 3-d, now it's banned from TV 
Niggas playa hated, I sure hated 
Spark the weed, cremated 
See this game, we regulated 

[Mr. Serv-On] 
Nigga, you know me 
The nigga that spell everything out? (nah) 
The nigga that'll run through your motherfuckin' set and bang 
your hoe motherfuckin' out (Fuck yeah nigga) 
The nigga that's catchin these niggas and beatin em down 
'cause they wearin' Tanks, they don't know what the fuck it mean 
Nigga, that's the fuck, that's about punchin' your fuckin' mouth 
The nigga that'll tear the club up 
Nigga, I don't give a fuck if you bangin' or slangin' 
Nigga when I put this Tank up nigga you get rowdy as the fuck 
But if you think I was gonna leave this motherfucker without 
spellin' a line 
K-L you done lost your motherfuckin' mind 
Stop the track 'cause these niggas don't know about my click black 
I down with the M to the A to the see 
It's the S to the E to the are to the V 
Fuckin' with the T to the A to the N to the K 
And when I come through motherfucker and I raise my Tank up high 
You best believe some a you coward motherfuckers goin' die 

[Chorus] 

[Big Ed] 
Nigga what I claim? 
Nigga I claim true! 
I hang with niggas that's killers with true tattoos 
I got my name Big Ed from what I put between hips 
I got my name Assassin from the way I empty out clips 
Wear the No Limit soldier, thuggin' at heart 
Hittin' niggas with throw aways when I toss em I break em apart 
Niggas get your guns up if you rowdy 
And when Assassin hit the stores, buy the album if you bout it 
bout it 

[Snoop Dogg] 
Rowdy gangsta in this motherfucker, loco 
So I can come through and keep it true 
and do what the fuck I must 
I bust, I keep it true from the 'ginnin

A true tank dog, bank y'all in y'all face 
If y'all try to come close, y'all can't run this race 
I place my self above the stack 
With my homeboys Mac and sack you fact, we strap for strap 
We got your back, don't even flip out or trip out 
Or dip out, these niggas lookin' at me strange

Face it, when they hear me on the K-L track 
All them niggas grab they head and jump back

Make my money right now, you get on that street and you look good
And you work good and you suck good ok

Hustlas pimp hoes for pussy let them fake bustas eat em

Hit that trick from the back and let her suck my brother dick
We don't sweat these hoes, we let these hoes
Find em, fuck em, duck em and forget these hoes
I need fresh money everyday bitch have my cash

Understand you da hoe and I'm the pimp
All paper comes to me, see you the gimp
Put some stretchmarks on that pussy and fuck till you limp
When the sun goes down you gonna do it again

I started off two hoes on the block for me
Now it's two hundred hoes wanna shop with me

Chorus: (magic, kane & abel)

Look, I got a proposition every gimp needs a pimp

All females ain't hoes, I love the ladies
But gimps get tag team freaks in backseats of jeeps
I'm that big dick nigga drivin up ya street
Big dick nigga got em going mouth to me
I'll hit ya in ya grill hole if you want it there

Wrap around rub your clit through your pubic hairs
Women call me the assassin cause they know I'm gone kill it

I fuck em and duck, give em wrong numbers and what
Camouflage love all night making you moan
Yeah I get mine and I'm gone but I gotta go finish my song
Look you ain't gotta go home but you gotta leave
Now straighten up your weave
And call me soon as you make it to your crib please
And I'm gone give you a beep next time I want to creep
Wouldn't give a fuck if you sleep, wake up and greet it's me
I like them thug girls y'all can have them pretty hoes
Them giddy hoes ain't good for nothing but videos

Chorus 4x

No disrespecting my sisters, I'm disrespecting you bitches
Scandalous hoes sucking and fucking for a nigga's riches
Keep your hands out my pockets ho cause I'm a pimp
You can't play this fucking player that's why I treat you like a gimp
You ain't nothing but a fuck or two
So if you ain't got no cash then I really don't want your ass
I'm bout bigger and fucking better
If you really want me then bring the cheddar
And I promise you that you'll never need another fellow
Treat ya like daddy but be sure to call me magic
And if I ever catch you stashing, girl I'm gone let you have
When a nigga call you, call me and I decide (hmmm...)
Whether this nigga deserves the pussy...trust me
Sign your name on the dotted line and if you ever need this nigga
Just call me I ain't hard to find

Chorus 4x

Military minded, usually blinded
Lookin for a crew like mine, you can't find it
We all be soldiers but I'm also an assassin
I came out the womb with my trigger finger blasting
Cock the gauge when I'm up in a rage
Three inch double O shell, I make the front page
ain't here for no stunting but you can get shot
That's how it is when you come up on my block
However, my crew is bout it bout it cause we're better
We ride Range Rovers, Mercedes or Randettas
And if you run up, click clack and cock the hammer
And if you act wild, we all go pow
Hit your girl from the back, I want to grab that ass
Bust the pubic or a friend, I jump it just as fast
I keep a tight fade, I cut my jerry curl
My fantasy's two women, so nigga watch your girl
Cause your girl looks so good and my wood is still ready, and she knows
She'd rather fuck with a soldier then a buster like you, so here we go
I'm not a scary ass nigga, I never ever want to panic
I simply bust down with my fully automatic
I watch these killers back when I was a kid
But I bust more shots then they ever did
This is not the last of them be	-I-G is just the second
But how many times must I point my hand your direction
You need protection when I'm on the go
Yesterday I purchased a desert eagle four four
You the hoe, I'm a soldier, I'm a soldier, you the hoe
If this is uniroll you would have to catch a cold
Cause hoes get stuck and soldiers get milited
Duckin what you did in the past, yo that's irrelivant
Especially when your not soldier material
Step to me and get away yo that would be a miracle
The beats by the pound, plus the players increase
Big Ed, AKA Assassin, revolutionary
Won't go deep into this subject cause that's against who would
It's just a second knows some niggas that hang out front
Say I'm now all that, hoping you get a tank
But if you think how you figure that you can hang with killers
Charging where the soldiers do, me it's fine
Cause when you cross that line we all pull out a nine
You can see no limit soldiers are mentally binded
In other words, we're military minded

We some military minded niggas (what)
We some military minded niggas (what)
We some military minded niggas (what)
That don't give a fuck about pulling the trigger
We some military minded niggas (what)
We some military minded niggas (what)

Chorus
I only fuck with a few
You never know what these niggas'll do
You better choose careful who you call your crew
And do a review on these bitches, before you call em your boo x2

You never know what's goin on with
Some of these hungry ass niggas arrested
And what you got, never allowed the chance to touch it
Was it obvious that nigga ain't die
He was in from the begginning had a piece of the pie
Cause in his eyes, cold like chicago weather
Birds of a feather fuck over together, that's forever
The only change, they accepted when I got him killed
Well they all a time for real over a dollar bill
So now you feel that all street family ain't yours
Receiving cuts and sores because you opened your pores
These niggas ride like volvos, and we ain't talkin bout these whores
Give a section of the beach, nigga surfers gotta swim ashore
If you need more, then take this notion with my devotion
Remember jealousy is a wasted emotion.

Chorus x2

[master p]
I'd rather die hustling then be broke and lonely
Cause most of these niggas out here be phony
Find me on the street corner living my life fast
[big ed]
Remember take a bullet for your homie
[master p]
That's my nigga big ed
[big ed]
See this tru shit nigga I'm a kill for it
When the rents due, ya know I'm a steal for it
Take a ride with my homies if I have to
Keep your eyes on your enemies cause they'll blast you
[master p]
And momma sheds tears cause my homies seen that
Nigga gangbang seen tru up on my chest
To my niggas in jail, stay strong doin time
I thank the lord for taking me out the ghetto with these rhymes
Blood stains on the street cause this ghetto life's a bitch
And that's a shame cause it's bound to change once a niggas rich

Chorus x2

[silkk the shocker]
Come take a ride at, before the game begins
I seen niggas die bad, and they die for pennies
Can't trust nobody seen around my way
Niggas dead, and that's why they ain't around today
See penetentaries, they ain't no place for me
I tell my mom don't trip, just pray for me
And to all the slugs from niggas that have hate for me
Tell my lady I'll take two years don't even wait for me
And see, you never get a second chance to live a first life
That's why I ball till I fall and live the first right
So even though I thug with them, I still ask these niggas
I've seen a lot of cold shit, ? ? ? ? ? been home test if I get ya
I only ride with niggas that I test the water with
Niggas I slang quarters with, slaughter shit, spent the hardest shit
Only trust a few, only trust a few
You fakes, I can't even fuck with you

Verse 1:
They call my game Alaska
Ice cubes in the cup that simmer Nebraska
The final chapter
Took me some time to master
Many crashed and burned, ain't my concern
No, I ain't gettin' paid to teach, but you can learn
I wake up 'fore the sun, speak to God 'fore I run
Review skills, cause now I'm more effective than the gun
Told since day one that my time gon' come
Step into the field and I can't be outdone
I roam the rectangle
Dangers from all angles
Leave your feelings at home
Cause this could get painful
Stamped and approved
Born not to lose
'Till you play wit me, don't talk
Then get your own shoes

I'm cold wit it, I'm cold wit it
Throw it against the glass and watch me go get it
I'm cold wit it, I'm cold wit it
I want to put my game in cans so you can go get it

I make layers cough up their last chips
My feet came with springs like a mattress

Faster than the speed of lightnin'
Excitnin'

Naturally made for the game like D.A. and Brian Mercer

Time to get hyped now
want to be a soldier

Can't be ignored, showed every time I scored
Had to put money aside
Cause I just shattered the backboard

I'm 'bout to glide right passed ya watch me just go get it
I'm cold wit it, I'm cold wit it
'Bout to put it in a can so you can just go get it

All I'm trying to tell you
Is this here, I see a opportunity to eat
It's them niggas sleeping across the street
And I'm go get em'(gun shots)

I was a reject on the ghetto blocks
In the end thangs trend thangs servin out them rocks(baby)
Quanties but I know nobody
In this contest I got to hold somebody
Got a gun name Scottie
And he bout to put his beam on him
I want to if he know I'm bout to put that gangsta lean on him(bzzzz)
Thinkin' to myself it's only for the worst if I miss him
When I'm cappin' none of you take it personal
Bustin' got me stuck, (damn) All I see is brains bitch
2 more got to go and I got the aim still(gunshots)
Don't blame this
I said you was go bleed when I greed
It was a matter of time before my mind it find speed
Proceed with 2 slaves damn open it up like Keize Soza
Broke it off to a J' everyday

That this nigga got to eat(I'm hungry)
So I'm a handle my bussiness on these triflin' streets
My rifle keeps
My mind at ease at all times
Along with a blunt helps commit all crimes
My style brangin' the whole, put me into crack
My paper stack
Even though I did erase the black(so what)
Picture that
A survivor takin' and robbin' for his
I want to guide the surviving kids
After me
Next I done bought me some plastic glocks
And teach my lil homies how to sell and bag these rocks
I'm a beast some say I'm just like Gotti
Mainataining my respect with my A-k shottie
Don't know karate
But I got some hands of steel
(slap slap didn't I tell ya bout playin huh)
But baby in these streets it's kill or be killed
Murderous skills
Ready to do what I gotta
Keys for 1-3 so I got a lot on the collar(come hollar at the collar)
Herion and powder
This shit go keep me in power
I want money as my mattress and take moet showers
Drug deals go sour
That's why my gat on the side
So want ya come test the mother fuckin' baddest alive

I ain't to be fucking with I'm a Jones nigga
Born to get it on for the throne
The dirt I did got me named Capone
Blowin' homes
In revenge, for my partners and kins
Murdered many men 
Some personal but mostly for ends
My sins
Be forgotten, survivors actin rotten
With the cocaine crockin'
I got the Champagne poppin'
Plottin up stragetted warfares
For my heirs, Nigga
I don't care
For that ? got me scared
Somewhere niggas made it home
With there loss souls
Heads I done toss those
Left in the crossroads(handle that)
The yard full with mother fuckers who died in the game
But a car full of niggas died crying my name
Releasing pain like Charde
But in my way(my way)
Split a blunt on the highway(highway)
Cause it was my say(my say)
I died that day but GOD told me finish my task
Hit the hash, grab all the guns and cash

There comes a time, where uhhh, you have things of yourself, when you
Lose someone, how you gonna take that feelin away? I got sons of funk,
An me fiend, an my people, master p an silkk
They ready to tell you how I feel, trapped, everyday life.

Verse 1- (fiend)

Everytime I open my eyes, I thank God for wakin this soldier,
'cause in this cruel world it's hard to walk these streets bein sober,
It hurts, tryin to get over all the weight on my shoulders,
Mom used to be babysitters buyin boulders,
It's all on me to really except that I lost my brother,
An to be stong an juss to go on since we shared the same mother,
Pillows an covers can't smother the pain that I have,
Sometimes I feel like I lost my better half, so sad,
But that's the way of the ghetto,
See yo life is already made, it's an accomplishment to pass ""a"" grade,
See they hate my city, givin us the pushers an tramps for our highs,
Sellin they book of food stamps at night,
I light the porch lamp, until my lil cousin came in,
'cause I can't afford to lose another gender life,
But livin this bend you could lose it if it came today,
It rained away, you be wonderin how to take the pain away.

Tell me what we gonna do? the world ain't the same man,
The way we live is a shame, I can't hide this pain. (x2)

Verse 2-(master p)

Ughhh! lord the world ain't the same, from the cradel to the grave,
Dear mama keep yo head up I'm tryin ta get paid,
These ghetto tears got me out there wantin to scream,
My auntie 35, but bumpin 17 off a dope fiend,
I live my whole life to stack some chips,
An it's a shame when yo own homie, sank yo ship,
An mama cryin......'cause church's be packed,
An all yo family an friends dressed in black,
An it's a shame, to see homies leave this earth,
Some say ball, til you fall, now it's ashes an dirt,
Sometimes, I feel like I'm trapped between heaven an hell,
In the ghetto's ? ? ? tory, wit fiends an crack cells.

(chorus x2)
(master p chorus x4)

Verse 3-(silkk the shocker)

You might catch me, walkin wit my head down,
In the pourin rain,
Tryin to find answers to questions, no one can seem to explain,
I coulda been born son of a king,
Instead I was born son of a, killa, surrounded by dealaz an fiends,
Dear God I got some questions, that maybe you can answer,
Why my brother got shot, an my grandmother died of cancer,
Now through it all I tried to ball an keep it real,
They say they don't feel what I feel,
I guess 'cause they don't live where I live,
See my mom tried to be strong, my brother died
Didn't wanna see her cry,
But I seen her through the face of the mirror
Wipin tears from her eyes,
An my next door neighbor committed suicide, was it 'cause of stress,
An if it was, was it that bad that he had to choose death?

I wanna pull you close and whisper in your ear
I need you ma..just stay right here with me

But you always leave before I could open
Up my mouth to speak and I'm left by my self all alone
But I year for the day to complete my soul
And I don't know if it's you but you make me feel

Like the way I ain't felt since my teenage years
But it's more than a crush, more than a lush, cool
It be that I'm fallin' in, naa, it can't be, It can't be that
Only a fool can love someone who don't love them back

And that won't be me

Take it back to the warehouse
Plot back in

A late night escape, hit me on the script
On the hip, gotta dip
Hollering, calling me out like a Girl Scout
Better go ahead and sell your cookies later
Fuck up out my face, rookie
Took me on a trip away
Chopping trees, eating grits with runny eggs
I'm always tripping on the beggars working the same corner
Trying to vamp me with the creases in your clothes
Sticking cuffs up in my face, don't act
Fumbling, pretty scared like tailbacks they flow
Knees and elbows got drug in the parking lot
So jellybeans (where ya at?) come clean
Come on in, sit down, relax and catch your wind
Some pretend but this man don't bend
Limping like Willy, turning bunks face down
On the military campground
And I'm out, nigga

Yeah, all this goddam grinding ain't shit
(Ho hustling) Cause I ain't got nathan to show
Except small quantities of blow
And enough flow to keep my lil boy belly full
But when that little bit run out
Pray your card don't get pulled
Should my path ever be crossed
On my family-feeding missions
Missing persons lives lost, inside edition
Kissing ass on nine-to-fives ain't gon keep me alive
Had to do without a lot still I seem to survive
Tried that straight path with the bow lean
Better with this new world, fitting in
Like a buzzard in a bed of swirl
Pearl handle on this firearm
Partner stay calm, now pass me your bomb
I thought your moms
Had told you about them niggas in the slums
(East Point, smoke something)

I wish you were me and I was you
Maybe then you would see what I go through
Each and every day, making up thangs to say, to speak
Uplifting words from my soul to keep
And my niggas that fantasize how wide the ride get
The concert, never the need to rob or car jack
The fact is to keep a cool head and chill
And get your Bible, it says thou shalt not kill
We do it anyway, and focus on short-lived enjoyment
And blame it on the white folks cause they supporting it
360 degrees of emcees from the Tree
To from one fourth of the MoB (SWATs)

Yeah, smallest predator on the Georgia plains
I'm about to take your mind on a journey
Uh, seeker no sleeper
I walk the streets, God keep me safe
Evil's raped this planet, damn it
I can't stand it, come travel to South West Atlant-ic
With me, there will be no stops in the bluff
A motherfucker sniffs his snuff
Sometimes it's tough to cope
Came a long way, and with so far to cover
Let me drank with why'all Gs
Moether Nature's seeds keep your eyes open
The seven seas rumbling, bullets they coming
Uh, the devil's shot it, human beings robotic
I'm got my chrome, man
When niggas start disappearing about cloning
Sometimes I feel weak
Mentally I'm one of the firest niggas in the street
With this rap shit I paid my dues
I never thought that I was better than you
Uh, niggas want to die you'll get your wish
Goodbye, you outta here, never coming back
Niggas dying with their straps, uh
I can't adapt, I want a free life
I'm in the dark throw me a light
Blaze ?em high, let's expand
Rule the land, invest with a vest
If you catch a slug to the chest
So much turmoil you put yourself in
So much sin each of us has slept in
Bout to inject this chord
You know something about this rap shit
But you ain't know nathan about the Lord
Outta here",4 in the Temple,1997
Big Gipp,"Piece by piece, this puzzle comes together
Sever your ties with the bad guys, let the lies go
If you wanna be a hoe, go 'head and don't be scared
Many a bitch, represents, and is led
Whichever way no I'm not gay
And really don't give a fuck bout what you doing
Long as I pave the way
For my SouthWest GA warriors
To come in packs, to feed, taking what we need
To succeed, you know what we gon' do, on this road
We gon' explode, now are you ready for this territory
Makin our life one big story to tell
Reality amongst the youth, long as, breath is in my body
I got proof, I'm not scared

If you scared, say you scared

In this world I'm Gipp, in second the mutant
The third the Geechee, how many ways can you reach me?
Now most be scully, went from clean to muddy
Polished to shine, the season to rhyme
Been down like brown, like dirt to the ground
Been looking for love, now I bubble like suds
Others flew sky high, while others were duds
Live high up on the hills, to escape the floods
Situation they change, like faces and names
Went from cool to plain, from lame to flame
Man down or not, man plans or plots
Give a fuck what you think, we ain't moving out this spot
And I'm out

If you scared, say you scared

Yo, paragraph indent, I make intense sense
Niggas on that Gil Scott dope (hint hint)
At age fifteen they start smoking Billy Clint'
Now he's twenty-one and wants to know where the time went
Hey hey hey what's the haps? Well see your time elapsed
Have you ever thought of the meaning of the word trapped
Baboon on your back, but what's sad is that crack
Was introduced to Hispanic communities and blacks
But then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention
Cause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it
Maybe your son tried it, rehab too crowded
You scared, she scared, they scared, I said
They scared they scared to talk about it
Bout it bout it bout it bout it bout it

If you scared, say you scared

February 1st, 1975's my birthdate
The player the B-O-I, was brought onto this Earth on Thursday
I think see, my cap I twist it back from all the dank
But if you see me on the Ave, you betta believe I tote that shank
So what y'all though bruh?
I gotta protect my name and what we fought for
Southernplayalistic ATLiens in your sock drawer
No lockjaw, we got that raw shit and all the trimmings
Even though we got two albums, this one feel like the beginning
The intro, the Goodie we kinfolk, nigga it's fin to jump off
But now it's time I lay low
'Cause I believe the track goin' cut off
Psych, the track is bumping like pussies on some dykes
So if you scared say you scared cause everybody can die tonight
'Cause my heart don't pump no Slushee
You touch my niggas you touch me
I blow up the microphone like Marilyn Manson, you can't hush me
Yeah

Heat'll make anything move
Even Tyson, can get laid down, with this tool
Just cause the name say Goodie, you take us for fools
Out they rabbit ass mind, don't give me mine, I go off like mines
Blowing suckers to smithereens, we was never folks
If we fell out over this lil' cream
Or let some soft legs come in between our dreams
We live like Kings, and die like fucking men
I don't care how rough you roll, we can't be shut down
Ain't no opening up shop, we already established
You lap dogging, we boss hogging
Grown men, don't beg for attention
Keep wishin, high heels clicking
Paper champions, leaving with they feet behind
Zap em for the pumpkin, at twelve
On the bottom bunk, holla at me
Six to the left, last one, can't turn over with dirt on ya
Slain dead, devils, don't have enough to purchase my essence
In the head, missing ounces, zip code, eight miles
Suckers, think I got they package
But they still eating moo-moo, oink-oink
And fowl-fowl-fowl-fowl 

The truth hurts, but you can't be scared of it
So remember that, OutKast, Goodie Mo.B.
Still standing for something while y'all falling for nothing
Stop dying over this lil' concrete and lil' paper

I got a problem with fuck niggas
Always talkin' shit and try to duck niggas
Sucker niggas won't finish what they started
Be coppin' dueces cause them niggas soft-hearted
They straight bitches
Always puttin' on shows for these niggas and hoes
Be wantin' to run your mouth but won't throw no blows
Ain't got no scrap, better kill that rap
Think life is a game, until that ass get tapped
And when it do, what you do, you run like a bitch
Or do you straight turn state on a nigga and snitch
When you ain't got your boys, you ain't got no balls
And you ain't gangsta with all them 911 calls
Real niggas don't call police
Real niggas handle theirs when they got beef

And I ain't talking bout' the reeboks
Getting three glocks and jumping out of treetops
Making suckers flee spots, and leave knots
Got guns, get funds, yeah I'm packing styles
Suckers acting foul, get smoked like Black and Milds
Nigga know a plan, laying down this thing
Beyond all that rap shit, I only spit game
You scared, say you scared, but just peep what I said
I'm so wicked off the head, probably shoot out of dread
that's right, all you suckers better recognize
Before I start recognizing, ain't gonna have you niggas sweatin' mine

I wear my hat low, when I walk through a circle of folks I don't know
It ain't to much chalk in these streets that can hold me back
I make stacks and stacks, for the weeks and weeks I got slapped
Freaks, I got the grill with the white gold
Keep a pistol in my hand with the tight hold
From the city where they drop blows
Known to pin-hold down off them figure fours
Shit shady, we all about to bust on sight, lighting up the night
Putting hoes off in 74's and watching em' all blow
It ain't shit funny, its the money man and Gipp
Holding sawed-off pumps in your face chump

Niggas from Miami and Atlanta holdin' heat
It ain't nothing happy

You niggas don't want war, talking all that shit

Get round' the motherfucking boys, listen to this goddamn rap music
And niggas think its a motherfucking game

I gotta move on
Ya know, be gone, ya know

Ya know, I think I was feelin' the same way anyway
So it's over?

[Gipp]
I'm out

[Sole']
Cool

[Gipp]
We been down this street
Down this block before
Bout to let it all go and hit the front door
Down and up, up and down

Told you I was in it big
This the last time that me and you will have this conversation
In a situation goin' back and forth
About, who right, who wrong

The same ol' song
See I'm a fresh hit
Another girl goin' get
Slow rides, through the park

Gettin' hugs in the dark
I know you don't trust me
That's why you beeped my thirty times
But I wasn't doin nothin but in the street gettin mine

And everytime I tried to explain you wouldn't listen
So I left irratated, confused on what to do
You, used to bring light, now you bring pain
So I gotta let you go and let you do ya thang

You used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I gotta let ya go and let ya do ya thang

(uh, yeah, to get it right but it just won't work)
We've been trying too long

Don't mean to press ya but I'm needin to know
If this the end
And if you leave, am I your friend or your foe?
Don't want to go, you see me turn and look

I walk away slow
Motion be the way
Make sure you catch the kisses I blow
I see you lookin like you want to take me back in yo' arms

Like when you used to hold me tight
And you protect me from harm
But now we can't resolve the problems that we share
It's a mess

I thought we'd work it out
But now it seems I have to confess
That this the end
But you still knowin that I wish it's the start

You slowly breakin my heart
I gave you everything, you tore it apart
Can't go in circles anymore 'cause we been trying too long
Sometimes you just can't work it out

That's why I'm crying this song
You, used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I'm a have to let ya go and let ya do ya thang
You used to bring light, but now you bring pain

So now I gotta let ya go and let ya do ya thang

Me and you, used to be cute
But now we paint a different picture
Love'll get 'cha, and leave ya deaf, dumb, and blind
Everytime, we had some good days, remember those

Momma told me that's the way love goes
So I'ma leave it at that, get my hat, get my strap, get my bags
Be gone in the wind, baby girl

[Sole']
But now I hear you so I guess it's nothin left to be said
It's time that I fled
It's feelin like a blow to the head
I thought that soon I'd see the day that you and I would be wed

But now the end has come, the love is gone, I'm cryin instead
And you, used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I'm a have to let ya go and let ya do ya thang

[Gipp]
Nah, you used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I gotta let ya go and let ya do ya thang
You used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I gotta let ya go and let ya do ya thang

Who are you, what you do, who you tryin to threat?

I'm the wrong cat to call out; we fall out
The police gon' have some dead bodies to haul out
All out in the open for the world to see
Avire-x to the z-I, be-I-t
V.i.p., you're small time, three on three
Cause you can't ball accurately, tackle the beast
Stomp it down, slap it with heat, bitch behave
Shit, we blaze to make a nigga act his age
I'm tryin to write the phrase that pays
You kick it with gays, dykes, and all type of wackness
Preach what you practice
Here we separate the real niggaz from the actors
A&r's, mc searchin, suck my cactus!
Blackness surround your sight and sound
As xzibit hit you and you hit the ground
My chips ain't never gon' be down, watch me smoke
And flatline the first nigga to cross this line

It's the gipp goodie, we kick the soul slang
To yo' block, or they streets, we all gon' hang
We like to shine and ride, bump corners in our bumper cars
Top down, with the candy paint job
Import export up and down the highway
Old ladies transportin straight through the skyways
In the corner in the five(? ) I got purple haze
Fat knot short sess with the tree ton(? )
These streets we run, rapper refund
You ridin up but we want yo' flows old like girbauds
We hold, everything it takes to create the odes
To north to the west to the south again
If it's war that you want just pull the pin
Rules we don't break 'em, we refuse to bend
If you don't build right you better take yo' ass home
Cause some catch stray bullets all alone

Collarless, japanese aikido with, rottweiler mixed
Top dollar dick now, swallow my whole nut rap
Gun in my mouth, pop shit, still sayin, ""fuck that""
You have to listen, brew, trapped in a tragic addiction
Styles, multiply like japanese mathematicians
Cut cause chaos - my kicks kill criminals
I'm the subliminal adolf
I'm the bomb that's attached to the time of a ticker
Figure or swastika
Quicker to pick a form of execution, pull it
Bullet, to the head instead of eletrocution
The rambunctious, bump in yo' trunk shit
Totally insane, hurricane with pharoahe monch, gipp

Fallin in a crater
Of lost memories
I'm so out of hand
I don't even fuck with me
I'm goin trippin drunk and slippin
Sleepin in ditches
Switchin prescriptions
Bangin a random hoe and itchin
I don't give a flyin feces
I ain't one with the human species
Slappin the nurse tryin to up my cc's
I fall apart
Take all my pain turn it into art
Blowin up a K-Mart and blame it all on Mozart
Fuck I'm surprised I got a deal
Every two hours I take a pill
That's where I'm at,
Its all surreal
I got imaginary friends
An imaginary life
An imaginary wife
And a real knife
Out of here by next weekend
Hung over on the dresser with my brain leakin
And I run away
From the light of day
I am not okay
My soul's a misery
I think I'm losin my mind
I'm whacked out on jack and blacked out
Trapped in a crack house full of doubt
I got guilt to the hilt
I fight tears and fears
Been out for ten years
Hit a big bump up off the mirror
Find me at www dot
I came to trouble you dot
Come here mothafucka take your best shot
Suicidal
Got a lot of demons to fight
I'll probably sit in a chair and put my mouth around a rifle
I feel abused to lose the blues
I'll bring my booze
I'm in the who's who's
And dope fees and floozies in the land
Preparin for news
These niggas are never choosy
The morning sun is like a sledgehammer to my forehead
And I'm barely here
Look in the mirror every day and slowly disappear
Been through a million and 67 emotions in my short career
Riddles I fear
Staggered out in the street for beer awww fuck it
And I run away
From the light of day
I am not okay

So close to overdose that night the day hurts my eyes
Wishin my death to be a surprise

Than four walls and a floor
But that's all that is mine
God give me a sign
'Cause I'm tryin and dyin at the same time
I'm not hesitatin
Just waitin
Heck yeah comin with a flurry
And like the spice up in you throat
I get ya chokin like that curry
Somethin bout the police and them lights that get me worried
Made a lap up on that bastard in a hurry
Flyin from the spirits so I got a story

In case somebody want to disturb the peace (Always keeping my eyes open)
Cause you, can't, stop the hustle

[Chorus: x2]

[Slimm Calhoun]
Well I'm known for my shine, Southside
Eyes on the prize, it's Mr. Fly Guy
Mobbing, '68 Chevy, door vault ties
Jumped out mugging like I'm holding twenty pies
Rocked up, work on the block,
We keep it, chopped up in the spot, in the pot
Where we keep it, stocked up from the Frosty Flakes
To the chickens in the cake
If I drop it on the tool, it must be weight
Went with two and a quarter, came back with eight
Let Juke lick the plate, I re-rock the shape
Like it hot in the kitchen nigga, oven on bake
Got gorillas with banana clips, who love to go apes
Southpaw, side-strapped, known to leave yellow tape
Try and stop the hustle and crushed like grapes
Just for the taste, just for the taste

And goggle, goggle, slurpy slurp and she swallow swallow
I met this Caramel Sundae, her name was Betty Boo
She put her period blood in her spaghetti stew (fuck no! fuck no!)
I knew her mama, her papa, plus her naughty daughter
She filled her baby's ba-ba up with toilet water
And Sun Dew, the whole Clan used to run threw
Her Power you, then just bless her wit the hair doo

One fuck from the apple head and shorty lost it

Big Gipp,"I chose to live this life, I be stickin this dick up in these hoes hoes
'Til a couple of bitches bitches get caught by they niggaz

Niggaz trippin' and for what?
Why must he think he 'posed to change her
When she'll give the pussy up, even to a total stranger?
And, I'm just one of 'em, you can't trust none of them
They'll say they love you while they wipin' your cum on them

Then they'll run and tell her friends how she found another sucker
To pay a fee for pussy but not me, motherfuckah
I move quick with my pool stick, slicker than Willie
Slicker than Kelly, slicker than KY Jelly

But really this dick has got me in a lot of trouble recently
I bend 'em and go in 'em and don't even have the decency
To call her, my balls have been leaked of most of their fluids
I used to put the rubber on and skeet straight through it

And it seems, that I always keep my pipe in these hoes
Keep my mic at these shows, 'cause that's the life that I chose
Pimp life, I chose to live the pimp life

Come talk a walk up in my shoes, pay a couple of my dues
Roll my boulevard on trues, while your lady sings the blues
Got everythang to lose, not a damn thang to gain
I be tryin' to cross the line but with that I gotta bring the pain

Now I tried to compromise, see the other side of the story
But that's easier said that done
When it comes to your pride and your glory
I'm a pimp with a glide in my worries, limp pimp I'ma step when I wreck
But my armor's on at all times, 'cause I gots me a rep to protect

Now I mights be known for this and maybe recognized for that
But they be high beamin' me and I be like where my visors at?
Nowadays I'm a wiser cat, after what I been through I better be
Back then I woulda broke ya broad, nowadays I just let her be

'Cause through seconds, minutes, hours, days
Weeks, months and years
Man I reckon that it's power fuckin' freaks, blunts and beers
That ain't what I'm supposed to be, pimp life that's the life I chose for me

I be stickin' this dick up in these hoes hoes
'Til a couple of bitches bitches get caught by they niggaz
Niggaz trippin', I chose to live the pimp life

Yeah I have menage-a-trois with superstars, one night stands, quickies
Booty calls, it ain't nuttin for her to just stick around here and lick me
'Cause I run through broads and never get enough, maybe I'm too selfish
But I can't help it, can't stay witchu girl
'Cause I can't tell if it's official or just another ritual

It's hard for me to find a wife, it's nothin' for me to get a hoe
I know it sounds pitiful, sometimes I'm blessed, sometimes I'm cursed
If it's supposed to be the best then tell me, what's the worst?
I'll be a PFL 'til I'm a old nigga

'Cause I never spend my life with groupies or gold diggers
I see these bitches now, shake it naked tryin' to make it
If you spendin' all his money, take it bitch, you can't fake it
When it's real, I'm cappin' like the snub-nosed, they pay me

I love hoes, never go home when the club close
I do shows, ride new vogues and keep two hoes
I'm all about this money girl, that's why I chose
To live the pimp life, pimp life, I chose to live this life
Pimp life, pimp life, I chose to live the pimp life

People ask me question 'bout this
People ask me question 'bout that, say what?
I'm a handsome John motherfucker
Independent of the nasty ass cuts

I know, I know, I know, I know pain

Let it be known Gipp love to bury muffins with no stuffin'
Problem child to this industry like David Ruffin'
155 pounds going straight in your kisser
And take a position, then split a partition, I started rollin' with a mo' home

Pick up a penny hope it turn into a twenty but the day end home
A classic in the street like Reebok
Grew up on the human beat box, I kick the door up off the hinge
I roll the windows to the ceiling

Been on a mission, dealing with my feelings like Max Payne
Analytically driven, emotionally living in pain
If I had to do it, oversee, I do it again
I know

I know, I know, I know, I know pain
I know, I know, I know, I know pain
I know, I know, I know, I know pain

Yeah, I do this for the kids, I do this for the mommas
I do this for the children that ain't ever had a father
Too many to remember mentally but yo I try
Sometimes I'm blinded by the cataracts up in my eye

Like Little Bo Peep, she standing in the street
And even ain't got no shoes for them mutilated feet
Good golly Miss Molly, addicted to Bacardi
Don't even know the difference between love and a party

And old men con young women, that's wrong
Don't they know the 30s and the 40s been gone
Inconspicuously, I slide to the side on
[Incomprehensible] I hypnotize through the voice tone

Already been, confronted myself to transcend
Tales from an adolescent years to young teens
When everything I used to own, used to sit on the dresser
I rode the bus to [Incomprehensible] the train
I know the rain, I know the pain

Construction jobs kept callouses on my hand
I know the pain
Crystallize me to a man
I know the pain
Believe in something higher then man
I know the pain
When it didn't work I fell on my knees and called his name

Straight from the A-T
I ain't even going say the motherfucking rest
But you know
We can talk about it all day long baby
We fin'a break you off with some fresh new shit

This rap game lovely
Konkrete play a part cause the Feds want to bug me
Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me
Bending corners in the Benz
Riding it like a bucket, nigga fuck it
I know some hoes slutty
I optioned a bitch off like a nigga playing rugby
I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me
Jump European, came clean through customs, no questions
Perpetrators in the booth, rapping lame like they drug related
It made me sick to my stomach, lost a two and a baby
You don't grind, you be lying
Should be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe

Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

You see, I cock back glocks, got more pull than slang shots
Hit G spots by giving hoes back shots
I'm a young country boy, long socks with flip flops
But I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop
Konkrete, Aquemini, we taking this here to the top
Bust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop
You say it's hot, well let me turn it up another notch
To my real niggas, won't you pump this out your Speakerboxxx
Fuck the cops, we making noise and we won't stop
Bump, bump, there goes the boom and it's going drop

We keep tools, see fools, bullets will flock

They call me Mr. Ravioli, Mr. Scrotum, Mr. Poke Em with the Noodle
Mr. Cockerspanielle in your poodle, after school tutor
Roto Rooter, addicted to follies
Like brown collies, stay soft fro
Swimming in the fallopian of an Ethiopian
Talking a different language, RBI fly wide
Come to me now, 84 hard, 84 soft wit me now
Beautiful ladies, they want to walk wit me now, talk wit me now
Pussy pop for me now, sell cock for me now
Fight a bitch, hit her in the eye for me now
See you when I see you, now out wit me now

Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

I will never fall off, I haul off heavy weight
Fuck wit me dog, I chop you up like Norman Bates
I'm true to this shit, I ain't new to this shit
Over a million sold on strictly weed and bricks
Flammable like gasoline when I'm lit up
I prefer my liquor dark and a mean white slut
It's over for you, cavern ass rapper, get out the game
You can fool the record labels but not the street fame
I just tell it how I see it nigga, fact is fact
The first verse I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque
I've been to hell and back so nigga give me my props

Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

Ludacris, yeah I keep a glock, in case you like to leak a lot
Meanwhile, cranking the volume knob up on my Speakerboxxx
""So here he is, get the fuck on the ground""
Is just a phase you might hear strolling through the A-Town
They don't believe I will stab them in the abdomen
From College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland
So put your fist up boy, you want to romp
You can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped
Thinking way back before I got mine
Putting bullet holes through neighborhood stop signs
Been a while, it's my adrenaline, yes, ladies and gentleman
A hundred tho, bitch, diamonds shimmering
Catch me with a sack of dro, reaching for the strap below
I'm with some nasty hoes, eating pistachios
Y'all driving Subarus, stuck in your cubicles
I'm stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles

Tomb after tomb
Boom, boom after boom
Serving up emotion once you deep inside the tomb
Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb
Cool, ooh, that's cool

Fourth and goal
Should I take the three point field goal for the score or should I roll
Around and take the ball up the middle up the gut, the what, the hole
Cranium overload, over throwed
Now we got seven more points on the board, for sure
B-I-G B-O-I, me oh my, I think he's blessing me
Excelling in harmonious melody, boy we got the recipe
Like Ragu, it's in there, giving you some of the best of me
Player, pimp, ganster, poet
We goin spit it, we going show it to your ass
""You're a champion"" were my dad's last words before he passed
But I know one day we will once more cross paths
They say ""Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre""
I say ""people, stop the madness cause me and Dre be okay""

We just split it down the middle so you can see both the visions
Been spitting it damn near ten years, why the fuck would be be quitting

Droppin' bombs, atomic, dog I could never chase the cat

Heard he grew into a man and put his family on his back
Had a master plan, Da Vinci code, nobody couldn't crack
Even though when times got difficult, he kept on slangin' rap

Just don't come off the side of my range I might be leavin' a stain
Whether my slab or beam 
N****z gon' respect that we gangsta
T-Shirt and Dickies plus the kicks that I lace up for you wankstas
Everyday is still the same
I be so loud when I bang
And thanks to Screw and P-A-T we got 'em diggin' our slang huh

Verse 4 (Pimp C)
I'm a Screwed Up affiliator strictly rollin' red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn heads
I've been watched by parole, task force, and by the feds
'cause they know I got 'em for 10 and they know the game ain't dead
It's too late
I'm deep up in it ain't nuthin' about me scary
Chiefin' in the club try'na find me somethin' hairy
Dippin' at the bar 
Smokin' on the stokey
Since I came home from the pen seems like everybody know me
You got lots of friends when you up and when you ballin'
Just like Pookey all the haters started callin'
They see the diamonds and the Bentley and the candy thing
They know I'm mob stompin' Texas they know that I'm rollin' with Jane
They know it's UGK for life and that I'm down with Bun
They know we grindin' bitch'll hitcha with another one
It's UGK records right now we need distribution
Since Laura Rebel free the pimp is goin' down in Houston

And everybody that's on the grind
Keep money on your mind, on your mind

I shut em down, cut em down, quick to throw my weight around
To yellow bone or sugar brown, Boss Hogg we holding on
We getting our glow on, and so on and so on
If niggas talking down, that's something you can blow on 
And this song's to let you know, be real about your do'
Keep your mind on pay roll, and I guarantee you'll get mo'
Watch how quick you be rich, I strongly suggest
Get your paper and invest, and don't settle for second best

You went down to 99, you not a percent artificial
Playa hating me detrimental, better watch what you say
This dream team bout green, BB King on my two way
Telling me, E.S.G. let me do a story on your life
To show the world how you emerge, to splurge your ice
Slim and H.A.W.K. on the right, with Key and Mike we assassin
Fat checks we cash em, shut em down to mash em, huh

[Chorus]
[Slim Thug]
Watch out, here come them hogs, in them big L dogs
You want to see somebody ball, follow us to the mall
I need my money tall, when I talk I walk
It's Slim Thug, E.S.G., and my dog Big H.A.W.K.
Living laid in the shade, all dues been paid
To tell the truth we got it made, something hatas can't fade
Riding thick like a parade, shutting all blocks down
Bout to show the whole world, how that H-Town clown

[H.A.W.K.]
Make way, for the H-A-W-K
You can bet your last dolla, I got something to say
I'm not caring like Donna, with mo' hits than Madonna
I got niggas out here, trying peep my persona
Ask your baby mama, bout Slim and E
She got fucked by them, then got fucked by me
This the big three, G-are-I-N-D
I-N-G, all about the currency, what

[Chorus]
[E.S.G.]
be	's for Boss Ballas, best believe we bout bread
O's for off the chain, when we swang we turn heads
The double S is for the Southside, on my SS Impala
Ah fuck it, this year it's staying stacking dollas
Saranada enemies, g's in my vicinity
The H is for you hoes, with homosexual tendencies
The O's for ounce of do-do, and optimo nigga
The double G for ghetto gold, getting green and go-getter

[Slim Thug]
Some hard hitters bout our figgas, out that Texas nigga
We pull triggas on fake niggas, bullshittas and quittas
We shut em down, top bound, turning smiles to frowns
Going round for round, from each town to town
The new pitcher on the mound, is the Mr. Slim Thug
The young boss out the North, that sell like drugs
Show me love, cause this year Boss Hogg gon shine
We on a million dolla grind in our times, watch out

""Damn mane, what you don't fuck with a nigga no mo? ""
Don't even come at me like that!
""Damn nigga, Webbie, where you been at? ""
Out here gettin' rich nigga. Fuck out my face
I'm a fuckin' hustler nigga, I ain't got time to be playin' nigga, I'm tryin' get it
(I'm tryin' to do somethin')

Check me out, look

Now I'ma tell you like a man, I don't owe ya'll shit
And I'm gonna say this shit again
I don't owe ya'll shit
But before a nigga had somethin, (shitt)
I ain't have nothin (my kids)
Yeah they still love me (friends)
I had a couple of em
Wasn't nobody fussin', tryin' to see what was up
When my shoes was been dusty, with a hole in the front
And I'd get mad at Lil Slugger, he put a hole in the blunt
When my daddy lost the house, moved with grandma for a month
Then that month turned into a year
And I turned straight to them streets

Then my dog gave me that b
I turned the shit to that heat
Them school fights turned to that beef
And we was gon' fall for that street
Then my nigga turned to that piece
I ain't seen him since I was 13
I get home and catch my knees
This rap shit was just a dream
Wasn't nobody mad at me tellin' me about how I need to come see em
I ain't have a car, I just need some new rims
Just tell ole boy he just got a new Benz
My daddy used to tell me that I needed some new friends
I guess back then, it just didn't make sense

[Chorus:]
Now come on
Keep it trill
You been knowin' me since I was lil
And you ain't even take me serious mane that's why a nigga feel like (you a trip!)
How you be trippin' (you a trip!)
I be trippin' (you a trip!)
How I be glistenin' (you a trip!)
It's a trip over position (you a trip!)
It's a trip how you miss me (you a trip!)
Now don't take it wrong and think I'm trippin' 'cause I'm on
But um really you can go on and leave me the fuck alone (you a trip!)
How you be trippin' (you a trip!)
I be trippin' (you a trip!)
How I be glistenin' (you a trip!)
It's a trip over position (you a trip!)
It's a trip how you miss me (you a trip!)

I had to tell lil nigga from the club
I'm still the same nigga from the mud
So watch how you be runnin' up questionin' me about stupid stuff
I'm well known from the boot and up
Don't come up to me with that bootin' up
Mane how I been movin' up
I really hate to have to go and shoot ya up
In just 2000 I was ridin' a bus
Show up at school, get expelled, fuck it
I'm out here, If I go to jail, fuck it

Didn't this many people care for me
Now a nigga rich you is there for me
And I owe you this and I owe you that (What?)
You not nothin' till you got somethin', everybody love ya
Pops told me that
Niggas ain't shit, life showed me that
They done stole from me
They done hold me back
You round here actin' like hoes would act
Tell me how I'm supposed to act
I see yo ass, be yo ass
Comin' up, I ain't barely see yo ass
Tryin' to be me, be done beat yo ass
Hard head, make a nigga teach yo ass
Tell you the truth, I don't need yo ass
All I really need is my dog fans
And all my people that I feel fam
This big glock 40 and Trill Fam
Ya'll look mad, I'mma steal laugh
Them new Camaros go real fast
They don't come out till ""09"" already got mine
Man I'm fittin' to act a dog now

[Chorus:]

Look, Big Head the same nigga till he dead and gone
The same nigga that wasn't allowed in yo home
The same nigga that did that same dirt with that chrome
The same nigga that did them same jokestas all along
Why would I change now
Just because the camera's on
And yo girl got my dick in her camera phone
Mane let me do my thing
I'm in that zone
You hatin' cause I'm makin' and you dead wrong
Well if you ain't gon' kill me
Ain't no stoppin' me
Watch, I get the whole board on Monopoly
Matter fact, fuck ya'll with a apostrophe
That is how you want it
So that is how it gotta be
I probably pop yo ass approximately with 6 slugs
While Turk and Mel buy the judge
You got a grudge but remember I don't give a fuck
Whenever you get mad enough,
Try yo luck!

Desire, makes my heart ache, 
Makes my heart ache 

Empty runway, 
Now I know that there's life after you, over you 
Spanish highway, driving back to what belongs to you 
Longs for you 

The first time that I fell for you 
Your eyes read me the book of your heart 
Speaking in recurring dreams, 
Visions and mysteries of how, 
You are my star 

Empty runway, 
Now I know that there's life after you, over you 
Spanish highway, driving back to what belongs to you 
Longs for you 

Hey now my light is shining on 
Every cloud is gone
Hey, everything is singing of your love for me 
On and on

Now I know that there's life after you, over you

Tell your heart to make up your mind,
We can't wait to give at the end,

Of her broken-hearted soul
And the reckless way she go

Red flower in her hair
Tragic twenty-seven she rolls like 
Janis and Jimi running down drinks

Sassy as any supreme, her eyes as black as coal
Walked away and the sun went down 
Singin' that soul song till no one's around 

Back to black was
Her kind of rhythm and blues 
Fade out to black was
Her kind of rhythm and blues

Lay your lamp down low
Suicide doors on that Lincoln
Take in that final drag, well 
You're so intoxicating 
And the evening's afterglow
Turns into a bad hangover

Ten thousand demons
You cheated yourself but you had your reasons

Being black is like being in the yang
Cuz they always gone label you, always gone fable you
And always gone point at you when somethin' go down
And I knew, that it would be me, and not jiz-ou
Cuz they know that I roll, with the biggest black criz-ew
And we all about gettin' green
But when your black tryin' to get green,
It's hectic, know what I'm mean?
Cuz they always gonna, stop ya - drop ya - pop ya - mop ya
And then they gonna sweep ya, up under the rug
No more gangbangin', no more hidin' out thug
I'm tellin' you the real, you better feel what I feel

And they ain't askin' nobody and that's a fact

Now you wonder why I put so much pressure on my brothers
But niggas is niggas, and I can't put it no other 
Way, just play and say what you wanna say
Niggas is the same all throughout the USA
I been around the world, and I came on back home
And niggas is the same, they always try to get ya boy
They like dogs, squabblin, tryin to get yours
But if you ain't gone open it, they knock down the doors
They gone take what they get, gonna get what they take
And if you gone be fake, check that shit from the gate
If you afraid of the dark, then stay out the alley
They got blacks being blacks way out in the valley
I used to be afraid, like to be shook up
Cuz niggas like you always leave the game hooked up
Tryna get yours, but you gone get it too fast
Cuz I'ma tell ya, watch them niggas,
Cuz them black ass niggas on the move in the mash boy
And niggas don't care cuz they out for cash and they know
If they catch you slippin', they gettin' you and gettin' away
Its part of the pay, it's part of the day, they do it they way
And if you black it goes on like ev-er-y-day
I don't know black on black, black for black
But blacks take off on blacks
Blacks need to realize and wake up
And see we all one color, all one game
You my sister, you my brother
So you my daddy, or you my mother
I don't know but I know we all related
And if we stay down there's no way that they can fade it
But that's just a game piece from me to y'all
But if black on black gone continue to brawl
Then black gone fall, then black knah
Y'all better wake up and check out the black Dogg

Then your black, they out for ya stack
And it's a fact, when your black, ya can't come back
Cuz if ya go to the hood, they watchin' you
They will lurk in you, they gonna get you
Cuz your not payin' attention, you led a nigga too much,
But that nigga straight snitchin'

To keep love and romance forever alive

Fuckin' talkin' that comeback shit like they cookin' crack
Shit I ain't frontin' all I want my pockets green like slum change
Yaknahmsayin? Front the roll we roll back like rubbers motherfucker
For real; with no trace of AIDS
We keep our pockets fully blown, Roc-A-Fella click nigga

Aiyyo we pattin down pussy from Sugarhill to the Shark Bar
Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches gaspin' for air in Aspen
Searchin' for aspirin when I ask then, we swing
You cling we do our thing and bring
Sling your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy Brooklyn to Beijing
East coast hostess hostile colossal, money flarin'
Like nostrils for drug dealin' apostles, huh
Al Pacino down to Nino Brown
Me Jay and Primo, got it sewed across the board like poquino
Teflon, make sure your jammy is full
Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull
Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
With my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage, so fuck college
Street knowledge amazin' to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars
Star studded bitches with crystals, get fucked with pistols
Just to see my shit, discharge puss
I drop the stellar, even acapella
I got to tell all about Roc-A-Fella

Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang

Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro, spent Spanish wisdoms
In a whip with dinero, crime organized like the pharaoh
I cream, I diamond gleam
High post like Hakeem, got a lot of things to drop
Brooklyn to Queens, I gotta keep my steam
Niggaz wanna try to hem my long jeans
Uptown fiend for Jay-Z to appear on the scene
In the meanwhile, here's somethin dope for y'all to lean
Liaison for days on in
Money make the world go around so I made songs to spin
Can I Live, did dough, with my nigs, dividends flow
Like the Mississippi riv', lookin jig'
Can't do for dolo, had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo
That's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto
Thug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson
I played him like Benny Blanco, mano a mano
You ain't ready, I find no trigger straight up shoot my guns
Horizontal, get your weight up, I am
Two point two pounds you're barely a hundred and twenty-five grams
Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money
Do the knowledge, do the few dollars, I'm due to demolish
Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck...

(""Bring it on if you think you can hang..."")

Money is power
I'm into cheddick with facial credit
Pure platinum fetish for cheddars
Spread letters you move you're deadish
I make moves that remove pebbles out of shoes
You suck pistol like pipe with the crystal
John Stockton couldn't assist you
Cowboys or Benzes like we foulin in the U.N.
So what the fuck you doin?
Whatever nigga Fahrvegnugen, rugged yet polished
Spankin dollars with the commas
Bangin bitches out the Bahamas
On hides of llama we cry nada, fly frather
Fry hotter, you die gotta
Fuck with me witness manana
Absence of malice in my palace
Call cousin now Dallas trigger finger with the callous
Tip scales from mail to keep these niggaz off balance
Your frequent stops to O.T.B. you feedin me
Steam a nigga schemin on the wrist action with the gleams
Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams
Never put the pure brown sugar before the dirty green cream

Big Joe Duskin,"In a little honky-tonky village in Texas
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far
He can play piano any way that you like it
But the way he likes to play is eight to the bar
When he plays, it's a ball
He's the daddy of them all

The people gather around when he gets on the stand
Then when he plays, he gets a hand
The rhythm he beats puts the cats in a trance
Nobody there bothers to dance
But when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar""

A-plink, a-plank, a-plink plank, plink plank
A-plunkin' on the keys
A-riff, a-raff, a-riff raff, riff raff
A-riffin' out with ease
And when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar""

He plays a boogie, he plays eight to the bar
A boogie-woogie, that is the way he likes to play on his piano
And we all know
That when he plays he puts them all in a trance
The cats all holler ""Hooray""

He talked to his team of huskies
As he mushed on through the snow
With the northen lights a-runnin' wild

I'd trade all the gold that's buried in this land
For one small band of gold to place on sweet little Jenny's hand
'Cause a man needs a woman to love him all the time
Remember Sam a true love is so hard to find

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play

Now, when a little girl becomin' twelve years old
Beginin' to think she grown

Little girl at home

But you have to go there early in the mornin'

Where my baby used to lay

Now, that I've got a little woman
Her name is, Miss Kate
She told me to come to the house this mo'nin'

You fool with too many men

Down in the yard
Gonna catch me a freight train

Though I may try and try

This longing in me

(I'll never be free from your smile so tender)
(The sweet surrender in your eyes)
How can I be free when I still remember

Stay away too long and I can't do without you

Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me

Why do lies make my love stronger

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy

I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

[Verse 1: XL]
We're from the be	 to the O-S-T-O-N
Where cats double push friends for dollars and gems
Platinum artistes they don't want to come here (nah)
Not cause of lack of money or bitches, but out of fear
Rappers up here be gettin' overlooked for years
Started hatin' on eachother sabotagin' careers
Ten o' the best MC's we got to offer
To shut down you cock blockin' shit talkers

[Verse 2: Ed O.G.]
Mad niggaz think they flossin' in rap
But no one knew Boston could rap
Till Edo put this shit on the map
Now the change is drastic, Hip-Hop got Jurassic
And none of you Boston bastards made a classic
Got the right voice, make the right noise
Can't stand none of you niggaz and none of you white boys
My men's is down to take the city, hands down
From the ropes to Pakis all the way to Landsdown

How you gon' lie about the place that you're from?
The house you grow up in, the block that you hung
Politics ain't my fortay
You gettin' fucked without the foreplay
Heaven trouble comin' through the doorway
G ain't playin' you dubs in the clubs
And heads ain't showin' you no love in the Hub
Spend time on the road, hotel's all alone
Not for Hillstreet times ain't no place like home

Whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me

I'm talking Monte Carlos, Crown Vics, Cadillacs and Regals
If I get pulled over, everything I got's illegal
But I ain't got no worries I got Jesus riding shotgun
Knowing that I need a meal ticket and I can't stop until I got one

Shit, I'm whippin' cutty bubble bucket busty, bitches love to ride too
Hanging out the window front and central like a late-night Wendy's drive through
Tweeters, speakers, jeekers fiendin', diamond in the back my nigga
I got two white girls, think I oughta have a curl in return of the mack, my nigga

It's the return of the 'Lac
Riding on so many horses they think I'm playing polo
Candy paint drippin' like a Jheri curl, nigga, I'mma let my soul glo
Fleet, flickin', screaming, bitches, pitchin', counter, past fate
And all of the women get jealous cause of the way my car can make its ass shake

Last to base, in the face
The law's right beside me, my window tint, dawg
My rims are too large
As soon as I hit the back road bet the law can't find me
Ridin', candy paint with two poles in the trunk
Popped up twice with two hoes in the trunk
Disturb our peace with fifteens that thump
Duck my slab get sawed off with the pump

I got two floors in my trunk, club lights in my trunk
I charge at the door them hoes hit the floor, we have club nights in my trunk
Cause it's an earthquake when I park, I keep a UFO in my yard
My wheels so big when I swing my whip I can high five God, lord

I could skydive off of the top of the roof, rims taller than King Kong
Riding around looking for an ass that I could sit my drink on
My seats warm, my drink cold, my paint dry, but her mouth wet
Suffocate that ho till that bitch look like Smurfette

007 pressin' more buttons, I got all these gadgets, ho
I got all these alpine, it could turn a square chick ratchet, ho
Neon lights shine neon bright that I could direct all this traffic, ho
Young and wise my 9 to 5 would be a vortex if I crash it, ho

Like a head on collision with a red bone mouth colder than Michigan
Reach in that glove box and I got more rubbers than Michelin
I'm feeling like Yao Ming in the whip (why?) I need more leg room
So I hit a switch and the whole back seat turned into a god damn bedroom

Stayed at my grandma house with 25 bibles
Stayed in the trap house with like 25 rifles
Drop my top and I dip dip dip
But if I pop my trunk you better duck, don't slip
Chrome lips on the vehicle look like they blowing kisses
Reel them hoes in, it look like I'm going fishing
Okay this how I ride, two bad hoes inside
One ho say she ready, the other ho said she tired
I'ma drop this other ho off, me and the other ho we gon' ride

Big K.R.I.T.,"I did it all for the money, Lord
It's what it seems..
Well, in the world of night terrors it's
Hard to dream, they hollerin' cash rules everything
Just call it cream, cause when it rises to the top
You get the finer things
Oceanfronts, rolling blunts with model chicks
And saying grace over lobster and steak
Like please forgive us for riding Benzes with camera plates
Too busy looking backwards for jackers to pump my brakes
For help signs to symbolize the lives that hunger takes
Addicted to the green, if I don't ball I'll get the shakes
I'd give it all for peace of mind, for Heaven's sake
My heart's so heavy that the ropes that hold my casket breaks
Cause everything that wasn't for me I had to chase
I had to take, I had to take

They told me that the ends
Won't justify the means
They told me at the end
Don't justify the dreams
That I've had since a child
Maybe I'll throw in the towel
Make my (make my)
Make my (make my)
Departure from the world

Tryin' to control the fits of panic
Unwritten and unraveled, it's the dead man's pedantic
Whatever, see it's really just a matter of semantics
When everybody's fresh out of collateral to damage
And my splaying got me praying like a mantis
I begin to vanish
Feel the pull of the blank canvas
I'm contemplating that special dedication
To whoever it concern, my letter of resignation
Fading back to black, my dark coronation
The heat of the day, the long robe of muerte
That soul is in the atmosphere like airplay
If there's a Heaven I can't find a stairway

They told me that the ends
Won't justify the means

Big K.R.I.T.,"Like when autumn leaves fall
Down from the trees
There goes my honey bee
I’ve lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them yet
I wouldn’t wish them on the worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here
Like when autumn leaves

To catch a thief, who stole the soul I prayed to keep
Insomniac, bad dreams got me losing sleep
I’m dead tired, my mind playing tricks, deceit
A face in the glass, unable to admit defeat
All that I am, all that I was is history
The past unraveled, adding insult to this injury
I’m fighting the battle for the soul of the century
Destiny is everything that I pretend to be
Look, and what I did came back to me eventually
The music played on, and told me I was meant to be awake
It’s unresolved like everything I had at stake
Illegal activity controls my black symphony
Orchestrated like it happened incidentally
Oh, there I go, from a man to memory
Damn, I wonder if my fam will remember me

I've lost a lot of sleep to dreams
And I do not miss them yet
I wouldn't wish them on the worst of enemies
Let them burn, go from here

All I wanted was a candy car with hella flakes
Crushing hoes, slamming doors while the chassis shake
From the sub, work the juice, bitch I want the bass
Can't be turning on a dime cause the rims scrape
Kill switches for them jackers outchea tryna take

Big K.R.I.T.,"Get money, don't be no lame
Bench warmers never ride foreign, so play the game
Never drop the ball, never accept a loss, get back up if you fall
And when your number called, you better give your all
I hope you give your all
You gotta play until the end
The only difference between a winner and a loser is a winner plays until he wins

Ain't nothing for free so get your ass up
My partner said if we don't speed then they might pass us
So we hit 85, tryna keep this dream alive
All I see is green, I think these screens is fucking with my sight
Nowadays hoes claiming that they crushin'
Bop a darling in my bucket 'til their heads catch concussions
But please don't push my buttons, I don't know you like that
Can't do no favors for these haters, I don't owe you like that
Well I guess it's the allure like when you need to score
One second on the clock and the shot's all yours
Hit or miss, we take the risk
Cause anything is better than viennas and warm grits
Trading bust it babies for fly divas that buck
Her only concern is if my car match her clutch
Yeah she a gold digger but that pussy good
So what the fuck, don't be late for this player's ball
Hurry up and

Get money, don't be no lame
Bench warmers never ride foreign, so play the game
Never drop the ball, never accept a loss, get back up if you fall

You gotta play until the end
The only difference between a winner and a loser is a winner plays until he wins

They told me life is what you make it
So what you been creating on your free time?
I'll lend you bars if you need rhyme, or reason
Some people change, it's a part of life, like seasons
Just be aware that everybody ain't your friend
They'll be gone with the wind once your jump shot don't go in
Or your ACL torn and you're a couple yards short
From a Super Bowl Championship and it was down 4
Gotta play the field, be willing to ride, willing to dive
For what you desire, call your pop fly, but never collide
With other players that play the game
Don't be eager to run with crowds, stay in your lane
Pass the knowledge on to your team, but carry the flame
Cause it's yours and yours alone to brighten your way
Put God first and free your soul
Cause even Olympic runners sometimes lose their gold
So

Get money, don't be no lame
Bench warmers never ride foreign, so play the game
Never drop the ball, never accept a loss, get back up if you fall

What if I'm fucking that up, so you don't trust in me much
I'm wasting your time, to say I'm straight, I'd be lying
It's either you or this music but I can't make up my mind
I'd throw you a line, I'd give you a sign

I settle for less so when I'm tired of stress
I go through with the motions pretending I'm at my best
Fall victim to flesh, I live to be fresh
But this ain't what I expect because my life is a wreck
I run out of breath cuz I ain't taking the steps
Money comes and it goes 'til family's all I got left
I'm seeing my growth, but I'm still from myself
You'll be hollering out next because you're ready to fly
I can't find the words so you'll just fill in the blanks
I'm doing the norm and not what it takes
I'll keep folding my cards and you'll keep raising the stakes
'Til we forget about us and what we have is too late
I know in your heart, you ain't conditioned to race
So I steady the wheel, forever pumping the breaks
Resort to the bottle, that's how I deal with the shakes
Pray for these haters, that's how I deal with the hate
Look to the sky, don't be content with the now
You ain't concerned with the why, you just wanna know how
I didn't give her the chance, when you just wanna be down
And save me from myself, but I'm wanting to drown
King is much more than the weight of a crown
As good as it feels, that ain't the way that it sounds
Being single is cool 'til ain't nobody around
Then I'm chasing you down, cuz you was ready to fly
I can't be what you want me to be
You're shooting too high cuz you ain't aiming at me
One minute you're calling out for the D
Then the next minute you wanna be free
Then the next minute you hollering out peace
Although I know it's a war and they'll be blood in the street
If you call don't be frustrated at me
Just leave you're heart at the beep, cuz mine is harder to reach
Cuz mine is harder to see
And that don't make it harder to cheat
Being friends would make it harder to breathe
So if you're ready to fly, just forget about me
But if you're willing to try then I'm willing to leap
Out of the window of pain and fall in love at your feet
I ain't the man you want me to be
I guess that's what's been bothering me",Red Eye,2012

Lifting burdens, being worried ’til I pass out
Jumping hurdles, running laps just for scraps in this rat race
Lord knows I’m tired, never step, gotta keep pace
Read my playbook, lay my head down
Caught a sprain, ice buckets by my bed now
Felt a impact like a truck hit me full contact
No pads, Lord come get me, I’m down
I can feel it in my soul
This my last chance to shine but they know I’m getting old
Hard to move on, my legs ain’t been the same
Since I took a fall from greatness
Now I knowing when it rains on my homecoming
See my folks, smiling
I’m the GOAT, but I really need to hold something
One more dime, I’ll be fine, yea I’m the best in my prime
But what about now

On the second set, got to do this for myself
When the balls in my court, can’t depend on no one else

When it’s time, hit the gym trying to win
On the off-season doing what I can, but I’m running out of time
Got a partner going through it
Cause his bills still due and he ain’t started since the moment that he signed
Physical training and all
Rehabilitation the cause of shookin’ jivin’, no hard turf
Ain’t no complaining at all when they overturnin’ your call
This is life and yes it’s hard work

Big K.R.I.T.,"Yeah

Awakened from my slumber by the thunder, lightning clapping
Raining on my window pane and praying I make something happen
A preacher's prophecies never bothered me when I was younger
Sitting on my Grandma's lap, as she cried I often wondered
What was her tears for?
Could it be for my grandfather?
Or maybe she felt for me 'cause I'll see more of those cold tomorrows
Then she see the world will up and turn on me
'Cause the morals that she often spoke were meant for 1923
I fall asleep off in her arms, a Psalm was spoken
The Lord is surely my shepherd, he lead me to the water
Thought that often stuck with with me
Amongst the wolves that run the streets
Out here paying dues to lose
I pray your angels come for me
A non-believer I never have and never could be
Lord give me time to peep the signs I should see
Sipping got me feeling like a player riding clean
Bending corners hoping I might find my Savior on the curb
I rarely go to Church
False prophets rocking Prada so I rarely feel the word
Jezebels lurking in the pews on the first
Preacher's weaker than the deacon 'cause it's hard to fight the urge
It's hard to live and serve when you on the Devil's turf
Sell your soul for the low with no sense of what it's worth
Don't get it twisted, I ain't no saint, I ain't no pastor
But prayer ain't just for cloudy days and natural disasters
Aware of what comes after, I bet you ain't for sure
I was warned that Heaven ain't the only place to go
I'm doing what I can cause there really ain't much time
I leave this in the Lord hands
I'm tired of crying

Yeah, close it

Father forgive us for we know not what we do
Am I bias? I been pious put my nose up in the pews
Like Paul I bear good news
They think I'm pall-bearing
My message sounds like death to these hearers as they perish
Scaring to think we on the brink of death
But no one stops to look for answers on what happens next
Got a couple scriptures from my grandma
Sayings from a preacher
But can't live out these standards that we heard it takes to reach 'em
But when I look at Jesus
He live the life I couldn't
Suffered for my crime so I wouldn't
I used to have to sneak into movies 'cause I couldn't afford to pay
Explain to me how someone paved my way
When I hear K.R.I.T. Confessing I respect him
Cause most of us be lying like our lives don't need perfecting
Nothing that we can muster, nothing that we can change
Admitting that we're imperfect, offending God with our games
Look I'm just being honest so don't take me for no lame
I seen it for myself, I'm a product of this thing
Now I found true religion, and it's not inside a denim
And 'em overpriced shades are never giving us vision, let's go

Man down
Hope and pray and say I can’t turn (Man down)
He will find you, this world will grind you down
Don’t you be another (Man down)
Hope and pray and say you can turn (Man down)
I seen another to know, so urgent
Keep callin'

Don't be afraid to say

See I hustle like my momma but I look just like my pops
And we still duckin' cops, ride round and takin' shots
Hennessy for my enemies, niggas know I'm takin' they spot

Just like T-I-P told you ASAP but you niggas rappin' like Aesop, Aesop get a grip
Oh that's your dream car? Nigga that's my old whip
Oh that's your dream girl? Nigga that's my old bitch
Oh that's your new flow? Nigga that's my old shit!

Got the old school in my old school was to post up on yo block
Yo broad chose like she was supposed to and you up in arms 'cause she bopped
I hate to say it but I got to say that I wish that they would just stop
So fuck these haters, fuck these hoes that ain't slammin' doors on they drop

And I hope that my dick is a whistling flute, and that's not the instrumental
Now pick up my coat
You let that motherfucker drag like RuPaul, I'll drag your ass to the floor
Bitch, I can admit, I'm a recovered addict, paraphernalia that is
Telling the doctor I'm sick, head doctor I'm needing your lips, yea
Proper analogy for it, if I can afford it then I won't ignore it, clear
Cop me a palace and Porsche and right when I floor it that's when I switch gears
Living my life on Uranus, uh, keeping one foot in your anus, uh
The other foot all on your neck, repeatedly stomp 'til I break it, uh

Tried steppin' in it but the shit got shittier

I turn your world to Gotti World, shorty bring your ticket
Jimmy Choo and Red Bottoms, shorty we can kick it
I take her on trips, her boyfriend be tripping
Text her phone a million times, but she ain’t trying to hear it
Tattoos and piercings, Gucci shoes for chirren
Kids just as fresh as she be, She serious
All I do is ball, and all she fuck is winners
Take her to the mall, she don’t want to go to dinner

Have you looking right, I had to follow her on Twitter

I’m out here with them bosses, and she notice from the start

If she broke she get her cheese up
Ever slow, she’ll up the speed

I swear that pussy so good, I wish I could clone it
Go girl, go girl
My new bitch, your old girl
She bust it open for my like a showgirl
Call me king, then tell me that it’s your world
Body Jamaican, but the vagina is Asian
I swear that’s hourglass shape and
That reminds me time wasting
Fuck around, I might taste it
And if I throw it back at her, then she probably gonna chase it
Because she’s a go girl

Shall I pour up, blow some smoke up, get my spit on
Grab a paper, sit on a track and get my shit on
Ice cold water with the flow minus the lemon
I'm Cinematic Multi, what label you been on
Old school ridin' flickin' ashes in the tray
Smokin' up the booth blowin' static in they face
C.R.E.A.M., cash rules everything around me
King, checker board nigga go and crown me

Pushin' rhymes underground like moonshine
With jump like juke joints
Ridin' like old 'lacs
Down like 4 flats
Shine like gold grills
Curls and chrome rims
Bitch you know what it is
I'm live from the underground, underground
Live from the underground, underground
Underground, underground
Live from the underground railroad

Keep it rolled, I'm supposed to lose control
Oh no, pop the trunk, burn a skunk and slam a do', do'
Window crack on the ave, marinate the scene
When I lean and crawl couldn't see me with your high beams
Play my part, I got heart, I'm tailor gator sharp
Plus we sit taller than Monster trucks in them trailer park
My candy coated it cost a grip but I had to blow it
Your sides was dusty, my seats is bucket but you'll never know it
Forever tinted so you can't peep while your bitch up in it
You call her phone she give you tone like ""Why you trippin'""
Cold blooded ain't it but that's how it be when they want that cash
When you ain't around anybody can be in that ass
Heard that from 8-Ball homeboy girlfriend
If she a bopper then she probably ain't your girl then
You claim you pimpin' don't be trickin' wear a curl then
And find some paint to put some swirls in

Even harder cause you bother once the sun goes down
Wonder where I'm going after shows and such
Don't be listening to your friends cause they talk too much

Perhaps because they had taken what I had

But after all this riff raff here, I missed service and it hurts

I lending hand, but I see if you got some time

Asked me how I got far from the beach
Cause they stripped me of my pride and put these shackles on my feet
I was stacked on top of my folk and it was really hard to breathe
It was a little hard to believe that I had been caught up in this mess
And some of my own people would sell me to my death
It was a lot of us on the ride and it was a lot of us that was lost
But some of us couldn't take it so some of us jumped off
And I'm really glad you found me on your course

To be running from these dogs with no shoes up on my feet
I heard of this railroad that ventures underground
And takes my kind of people to a place that we can't be found
And I been wounded for some miles, so I decided to rest my head
I guess they let me go cause they assumed that I was dead
Smiled and said “Son hop in this wagon and get settled”

Now she wanna ride high with her head in the sky look down on all her people
Ain't it crazy how pavement be cracking when I'm slabbing them 'bows
Hoes go to jump in and can't find the handles on my doors
So much twerking and working in here, I should install a pole
For them strippers that love to suck and fuck and get, get down on the floor

Said my back seat softer than a pillow top, paint so wet that it hit the spot
And I'ma quench ya thirst, that little nigga should've did it first
You was holding hands and I was in her purse
I'm getting throwed up under city lights
She right side checking lipstick, tryna make sure that her titties right

Sitting outside the whip with the wood grain wheel like it's 1996

Got one with Sopranos, one with The Wire, the one up front is Boardwalk Empire

Big K.R.I.T.,"Remember a child's places what I often heard while asking
About the things no adolescent could imagine
Trying on the pants of a man I had not yet become
Hands too small to button the buttons my father often fastened
While speaking on his dreams and ambitions
Although I could never understand
There was comfort that I listened, with mention to be better than him, yeah

Be a better man in a world of negligence
Pedophilic malvolence, don't trust your reverend
When they settling for settlements
Lock your doors, shut your windows, don't let the devil in
The media graffiti us with relishments
Money, cars, and clothes I suppose what successful is
They say sow you're oats, it's natural to experiment
But don't get sucked and fuck and run amok - be celibate
Only 14 when I first cut
I wasn't her first, I had to strap up
And thank God for them condoms that my papa gave me
Cause a convo 'bout birds and bees wouldn't save me
From a child I couldn't shoulder, pushin' in a stroller
Down the streets of 3OB while all my homies asked to hold 'em
Proceed to play ball, when he cried I can't console him
I truly wasn't ready for kids, that's what he told me

I had a rich dad, poor dad
I had a rich dad, poor dad
I had a rich dad, poor dad
I had a rich dad, poor dad

Never in a sense of money spent
Christmas trees are beautiful without presents up under them

Lead by example, don't get caught up in the rapture
Life is just a raffle, mostly pain, but some laughter
The older that you get, it's even harder to believe
No superheroes on TV you used to see
Remember that I told you slow down, control your speed
The more you walk with God, the harder it is to scrape your knee
I remember when I fell from my first bike
There were no ""are you okays"" and rarely ""are you alrights""
Just dirt in my pockets, handful of gravel
That's when I realized that getting up is only half the battle
The fear of falling off will haunt me well into my teens
The moment that the world took a shit upon my dreams
Cause money is the root, and love is all we had
In fact, I'm glad, I had a rich dad, poor dad

Living in a tower
In a double S Impala
Horse power, girls follow
Recognize and seek guidance on counting dollars
High on top a money mountain, never coming down it
Looking for a G, capital, well you found it
Green back, stacks, overseas his accounts is
She know all about it, mama ain’t stupid
She know this her time and she's about to choose him

But if you ever need shelter from the worries of the world
I'm the one that you should run to, baby.

Big K.R.I.T.,"I think angels get high
Cause I can't describe all these clouds in the sky
I think God must have cried
Cause I can't describe all this rain in my life
I think angels get high

When the sun goes down, heroes don't come outside
I seen too many villains provide
How can I choose a side to be on?
Tell a junkie be gone
Cause I don't push what he on or she on
Like before
Sometimes it's hard to pay the debt that you owe
Too much of something good will have you strung on the floor
Thunderstorms forever form outside my home
I swear these angels taking bong hits
I wonder if that flood that came through just
because that left us on the curb was one of God's tears
To wash away the pain that we had
The house wasn't much, the neighborhood was bad
The basement won't save us but the prayers get us past
The rumbling and the thundering never last
So I ask, so I ask, so I ask

I think angels get high
Cause I can't describe all these clouds in the sky
I think God must have cried
Cause I can't describe all this rain in my life
I think angels get high

Standing on the roof while helicopters swoop by
I think they don't see us
Not even FEMA could redeem the very faith we all lost
That made us once believers
Natural disasters bring us closer
My partner never prayed until he thought the world was over
2012, December 1st, he called me in a panic
He heard a storm was coming and it might destroy the planet, dammit
I called him back tomorrow because the boat
I been paddling can't deal with so much sorrow
Borrowed time wasted
I probably shoulda played it safe instead of storm chasing
But the prayers will get us past
The rumbling and the thundering never last
So I ask, so I ask, so I ask

And I'ma put some when you told bitch on these hoes bitch

It's some neon that's red, that's my old shit

Swinging on in a Chevy, I bring a ho down like a liver

I got the biggest house on my block, foreign with the drop
For the times I was out here homeless, God flow
Time and time again I tried to tell these niggas
Yo what I say to these niggas?
Re-rock on tap dance, do whatever for a sack
Give a lap dance bitch ass nigga
B bop flow coke up
25 lighters on my dresser, ain't shit changed
Rollin' in the Hamp's image of me pedalin' like a stretcher
So clean you think might I been selling cocaine
Light at the end of the tunnel
When you're flexin' it's hard to be humble
Talkin' fourth down, can't throw the ball to Def Jam
Cause they might fumble
Kick that south flow that you can't get
Try to fuck the world but my dick won't fit

You wanna be king, gotta claim that shit""

When you put on a mink, gotta creep down stairs
When you come from the country
Your feet on the snakes would will make clothes out of bails

Everybody wanna see a monster
Till they see the monster, the monster holla out, ""What's shakin'?""

He must not know better at all
Titans collide on the Zeus to survive
If not me bitch, who the fuck you gone call?
To rain from the mountain tops
Still blood stains on the leaves
I don't do it for the blog spot comment box, I do it for the OGs
And them country folk that can't talk that shit
This ain't your curb, don't walk that bitch
This ain't your porch, so keep off that shit
Go find a cliff and jump off that bitch
If you don't think that I'm king
I done proved them wrong like twice, can't stop my fight
I could murder your favorite rapper
And all I get is ""No way a Mississippi nigga really that nice!""
Fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, fuck em
I said it six times cause it's my pleasure
Say it one more time for just for good measure, fuck em

We pulled up to the Papadeaux poundin'
Sat down, ordered the clam chowder
I had the lobster bisque
I'm what they talkin' 'bout if the topic is
Money, clothes, hoes, weed smoke
Take your panties off, you don't need those
Real niggas stay stuck to the G code
Never cheat, never off my feet
Never let these niggas see your weakness
If I eat then my niggas eat
Hit the weed then we hit the sheets
That be our little secret

Round and round we go
Unlock and unload
Our remote control

Round and round we go
Unlock and unload

That Control beat is like an ugly bitch that everybody done fucked raw
Maybe you hit it
Aww man, I'm more concerned why niggas been textin' my cell, callin' my phone
Ask me about this Kendrick shit, that he ain't even really even diss me on
I ain't drawn to all this propaganda, rap shit 'bout as real as Santa
Now I'm lyrical all of the sudden
Well last year they claim they ain't understand me
I'm buryin' niggas, and pissin' on they graves
Another nigga, other nigga name on your chain
And they call me a slave
Niggas scared of this country boy, lord forbid I catch a body

I'm so prolific with these scriptures they might give me a Bible

Mind your manners, just be cool
I know you lame when you was in school
The little fame you ain't used to
And it was easy for you to move through
English class with your own thesaurus
Like one of these days I'm gonna be a rapper
But all my verses gonna be borrowed
So I'ma take from all these Southern artists
That mainstream never heard of
Recycle all of they lingo
And make sure I screw my words up
Bravo for your swagger-jackin'
I'm overwhelmed by your dedication
You actually fooled these people into thinkin'
That your music was innovative
Frustrated
Rap battlin' never got me out of no public housin'
You tellin' me I can be King of Hip-Hop
And they wouldn't give it to Andre 3000?
Nigga please, this award ain't got shit to do with us
God could physically come down and say ""he the greatest
My favorite, y'all should listen, he have potential
To outlive the heatwave I'ma send through this motherfucker
And rebuild for a whole 'nother other culture""

Either way nigga, I wrote it
Yes, I made the beat, yes, I mixed the track
I am far from wack, you a one-trick pony
I don't fall in line, I define what's rhyme
Fuck what you was thinkin', bloggers they can quote it
Lotta rappers buried underneath my house
They know what I'm 'bout, you ain't even know it
Overdosed on hocus-pocus, jibber-jabber
Snap on my stature was firebreathin' dragon

Knocking down the pictures off the wall
I keep it crackin' in my trunk
Destroy your whole hood with that thump
That's if you want it like that player
Vibrate in my crooked all the way to Himalayas
Pandora box and custom made it
Sonic boom and Jackson stated
My trunk not like Jehovah Witness
I made it like haters, had to play it
It's a really good fuckin' speaker do I have to say it?
It took me a year and some change just to calibrate it

Ain't nobody gonna stop this sub that I got in my trunk today
Crank it to the max till the windows start to crank
And the fuck boy laws give chase
Man hol' up I've been bassin' since bass been bass

Leanin' horizontal
The acrobats on the corner, they flip
So when them white vans pull up, Shawty, we dip
Out of view, could've been a track star at the school
But it took the police just to get that .44 out of you
Dash, sprint, hurdle, over those steel gates
They keep us in and keep folk out but we don't feel safe

Watchin' our uncles drink coolers, talkin' pound-for-pound bruisers

Thrown away half eaten as if their seeds never ever mattered
It ain't ripe, it ain't right

They just fuck and they fight

Die with you, and that means forever

But now we on some other shit
Nah, we ain't got no rubbers here
I know she creepin' so that ain't my son
Apples fall off of trees and roll down hills

More intrigued with your mind

Choice but to watch the neon lights with my name lit

Lames sit your ass up in the stands and eat a hot dog
This is for the big bosses boy and you are not hog
Never been a eagle man, I never seen you soar
Through the sky, looking super fly cause you paid off a whore
You're not a pimp, put that on Pimp, you a fraud
Buying pussy on the side instead of tryna break a broad

Unless she in the comfort of a monster with a mouthpiece, then I reach her on stroll
Pimp shit get rich and quick, tell a bad bitch how I feel
Never laid back, gotta make a quota, if it ain't a high roller keep that pussy sealed
So motherfucker can you buy that? At the rhythm of a bass drum
Hit the club buy the bar like a star take that other nigga bitch like dare that nigga say something
I seen pimps and you ain't one, you're not close to me I'm everything a real nigga supposed to be
You act like you did everything you could, but she was supposed to leave
At her neck like rosaries if she ain't where she supposed to be, I put her on game
She devoted to the notion of roller coasters, and that won't change
With my trunk on bang, sun on shine, break a bitch down like a Garcia y Vega
Fill her up with the gumption to hit the ground running, and go and get me some gators
Yeah suits with the tailor, that fit the frame of a nigga all about his paper

They like to put me on a pedestal for conscious rap
My flesh is edible, it's hard to keep the monsters back
The polar opposite of too emotional
Got feelings and emotions, just hoping I don't overdose
And miss the moments trying to control 'em til I'm on overload

Beating the drums of war to fry lines to your fortunate sons
You think boys point guns when they run to the sun?
A decoy, Pink Floyd, cause they're comfortably numb
Word, wrapping ourselves in denial like it's a warm blanket
Trying to go native like faces that get war painted
Pac shot in Las Vegas of all places
Fighting dark sides of the Force like he was Lord Vader
Y'all haters develop and lead the role

Big K.R.I.T.,"Forbidden knowledge can destroy mankind

I spend large hours of my days alone
I don't believe we share this universal space alone
I think we got a lot from them, they gave us phones
Internet and now we all know what is forbidden knowledge
Forbidden knowledge is too great for a man
Think if man could read your mind, you think that man understands
How to use it with integrity, not conquering land
Would it be good if we increased the lifespan, well that's forbidden knowledge
Forbidden knowledge can destroy mankind
We can grow out of control like cancer under the skin of Mother Nature
Busy cities much alike to a tumor
Too many cells, the residents, the body's pollutor
I say woosah and alley-oop the chubby doobie to Judah
Child of Jacob, I know my history, I know we are moors
There's a universe in her afro, hold us back though
Power in the black folk, well that's forbidden knowledge
At first they want to keep us separate but equal
But it's not so we fight against the hatred and evil
Now they let us think we got it and they killin' our people
Why does history repeat like a sequel? Well that's forbidden knowledge
Is God a man watching TV like people?
Rewinding his favorite parts to play it back like it's TiVo
Have I wrote this shit before? It all feels like a redo
Deja vu is left to die like our dreams do, but that's forbidden knowledge
I had some shocking memories as a kid
Waking up onto a table, a lab, some typa bizz
Too vivid to be a nightmare, mom would tell me that shit
Can't remember anything that they did, guess that's forbidden knowledge

Forbidden knowledge

Are dreams another kind of preview to Heaven?
We manifest our reality based on our personality
Karma from shit we did since the day we were seven
You share toys? Or did you masturbate at eleven
Just a 90s baby, a millennial kid
Indigos are on the rise to make perennial shift
Hope this music stands long as Redwood Sequoias
Pyramids and stones, like stones from Stonehenge
Come on, let the future tell the truth
Cause you a shell of you
You played your cards wrong, now you got hell in you
Be glad I still retain respect for you
Cause I got bullets that'll kill yah if your vest is hell and heaven-proof
I'll never understand your corporate greed
Just a group of people, all they want is more than they need
Signing off on papers, blinded to the pain overseas
Blood resulting from the ink that they bleed, that's forbidden knowledge

Forbidden knowledge

So who put the liquor store on the street across from the gun shop?
The park a hop skip in the dark 'way from the gunshots
That rang out in the neighborhood where the youth's misunderstood
Fighting over concrete squares but the laws just ain't no good
I think their agenda's meant to kill us all
How good is education long as you can ball?
Standin' on the couch inside the club and hit the mall
Barely feed a bum, but you buy it all
Think they laughin' at us, cause while we're watchin' some cable
They was talkin' 'bout the economy, sharecroppers and stables
How to keep the horse runnin' his course, give him some blinders
So he lack remorse for whoever's right beside him
His own kind, I pray you dig deeper
If you don't find, what you're lookin' for on the surface

Cause the energy it lends puts strong women down, down

From just watching, observing things over the years
A secret that I don't think that I'm supposed to share
But I don't care cause if they kill me, I was never here

The only real power is the one over your mind
So once you seek control of every little thing you do
Start to unlock the potential that's inside of you
Don't you get got or cell blocked
Thinking the world's dark and hell's hot
My only hell is being enslaved 'til I'm in the box
And to my brother's treating life like it's another bitch
I encourage you to find yourself another chick
And treat her with respect, cause the moment you neglect
Start to fade and pick away pieces of your flesh
So be smart cause it's never too late for change

Don't sacrifice your canvas to paint a picture of some bullshit
Be weary of the path that talk of private jets in the pool pit
Got to be real, through your heart, to your core
Don't give up on god, when there's so much more in store

I got those jet pack blues
Just like Judy
The kind that makes June feel like September
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember
And I'm trying to find my peace of mind
Behind these two white highway lines
When the city goes silent
The ringing in my ears gets violent
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, ""Baby, come home"" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Did you ever love her, do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing, ""Baby, come home""
""Baby, come home""

I'm talking about another green room, another hotel
Doing what I'm doing a lot, doing it well
Maybe we should kick it next time, go out all the time
Bone appetite it's so bittersweet when I come around
Always on the phone texting and scrolling talking bout business
[?] when I visit
And that's the realest [?] you whispered in my ear
The last time you cried on the phone, I felt the tear, believe it or not
When I vamp, I give you all that I got
I do this for us so don't ask me to stop
The lights and glamour ain't the reason why I put in this work
I'm seconds from the stage but I'm putting you first
Despite my absence, words and closed captions
Read me like a simple I love you wrote on a napkin
This is more than just a fly by night action
You're the fuel everlasting to keep my jet packing

I've got those jet pack blues
Fight off the light tonight and just stay with me
Honey, don't you leave
Don't you remember how we used to split a drink
It never mattered what it was, I think
Our hands were just that close
The sweetness never lasts, you know
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, ""Baby, come home"" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time

And I remember
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Did you ever love her, do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing, ""Baby, come home""

Big K.R.I.T.,"Yo, it's taking a lot for me to give y'all all of me
For y'all to take it and run with it
And turn it into some shit that it's not

Yo, exceeded my expectations a while ago
They wondering why Dizzy the one that's always smiling for
I listen a lot and look at everything I done accomplished, mane
S'till, my baby girl and son is the main thing that I value most
Family, fuck a xanny, I'm puffing on this flower though
You piece of shit, no thang, we keep it lit
No hard feelings, don't ever change, don't ever quit
When I found out living legends s'till exist, I knew I had to commit
So I heard that this new generation was waiting on me
After The Golden Age, these old heads been praying for me
To get involved, maybe vent to y'all, and make an impact
Better plant a seed and water that bitch and watch it grow
Now how many times I gotta say it? I been down and out
But you only get so many chances 'till you're fouling out
And I'm like, let me live without taking no breaths
My mind is focused on which task I'm finna take on next, uh
I think back when I just hung with my dawgs
My mama could never keep a man 'cause we was running him off
Needed a father figure but I don't like how he coming across
He end up gone, she was sad but I felt like that's his loss
I told her, never bend your head, look the world straight in the eyes
You deserve love, but a queen don't need a king to survive
And it's a blessing to be able to rap and not feed y'all lies
Or fake my happiness like everything's just fine
I mean, we all human beings but we not alike
'cause the loudest on the Internet get to sleep through a quiet night
It's a big difference and it's teaching me a lot about who we are, how like
Money don't change people, it just bring out who they truly are
Man, I done seen the most from coast to coast
They got us crossing over the border line
I don't got all the answers but we need to be more organized
So here's a little enlightening for your peace of mind
Everything you need in this life you live will come at the perfect time
So God bless America

In God we trust
Born in royalty, they can't take that from us
No matter what, runs through our blood
We have the power, we just like to trust (Trust)
Just have your faith and believe
Keep calm, my young kings and queens
Watch and you'll see, and when that day comes
May God bless America

Uh, follow me, follow me through the hardships
Pardon my need to be swift with how I start this speech
Who you more like? Malcolm or Martin?
The game that they play with us, brother, don't have no cartridge
Button mashers, disaster casters, they ass backwards
I might slave for a meal but you ain't my master
Running through the field, all I hear is laughter
'cause them chains that kept us here can no longer capture
The heart of my folk, foot on my the throat of my oppressor
For all of them ropes, they tied a tree for my ancestors
If limbs could talk, they'd cry for days
Sad, they gave all they had but couldn't break under pressure
Blood on the leaves, Glock on the dresser
Them laws plotting, protect and serve but I know better
The news a lie, to you and I, TV ain't real
So don't you try, to be like none of them Housewives
Selling us fools' gold
Tell a son to slang dope and daughter twerk when they get old
Damn shame, how we find time to sit around
Smoking and dranking, while they corporate banging
Don't be content with the hood, nigga, what is you thinking?
I got a small violin if you don't vote for complaining
About the government, stand up on some brother shit
And stop being on some other shit, God bless America

Despite all the barriers
If you do whatever you do every day
You can get it, I did it

From the poorest, they said I gotta push for all my dreams and they flourished
Then a forest full of obstacles, I got the dope 'cause I'm morest
Don't ignore it, that I built this vocab without a thesaurus
When the war is pressing, they be asking me questions like Katie Couric
Like, ""Did you sell dope when you fell broke?""
Tryna stop a male's hope who never dropped the jail soap
Made it up out of Hell's scope, they ask, can I spell vote?
I'm feeling like they tryna tell jokes, ya pale rope
I'm a U.S. citizen escaping the penitentiary they hid us in
The kid has been fitted to quit and then spit it and shit again
But I became noble and well-rounded like an oval
Never will I be grounded for disposal
Everybody be astounded by the mogul, Tech N9ne
No more saying, I can't afford this
Even when I was down, my plan was to never abort this
Don't forget, they said I sold my soul, that's horse shit
'cause I simply thought my way onto the Forbes list
So God bless America",God Bless America,2015

Big K.R.I.T.,"My creator gave me the gift to create
And this mind of mine apply to our escape
In an atmosphere that wouldn't hold our weight
If I leave from here, I'll call when I'm safe
Knocking on the door, hoping someone answers
Yeah, I call that faith, this mouth of mine has turned down water for wine
I still recall that taste of bitter-sweet
Like when I realize you're never be as perfect as the one that invented me
And the world full of temptations will make you feel so incomplete
Grew up to better than me, go farther than I can go
See farther than I can see
When my days draw to a close, breathe longer than I can breathe
And I'm fine with that
In the event that I decide to move forward what you've done, they can rewind it back
And I'm a proud parent now as I was a proud parent then
I saw you grow up to become the kind of king that I knew you'd always been
Indeed, there's a finish line for me, but for you, there's no end
So, perhaps, all that work that's been done was a win
And although, my intentions were for good it still brung us to a sin
But I'll continue to pay for your mistakes as long as this world continues to spin
As this vessel of mine breaks down, I know you never been
I'm sure Multi is your home
Hard times will come again
Set aside a book of rhymes that'll pave the way for now and then
I know 4eva is a Mighty Long Time, so where should we begin?
On the southside cuz' I'm a country bumpkin bumping out the system
Fuck if they don't listen
We done came a long way from niggas throwing cd's out the window like I made a frisbee
Better than rapper's favorite rappers, the most conscious of trappers and I'm Mississippi
Dirty Southern muthafucka kicking like a red bucket white top chilling
Shitting on niggas, my rhyme flows hands high
I'm back, I'll blindfold mine
Mind and soul connected to the Most High even when times got low
Look how they hate me, but copy me
Possibly, I was the one with components and properties
To be the greatest of all time, but you won geography lottery so
I keep kicking, flipping tables, chosen and favored
Fuck being major when giant is greater
Fortune and fame, but you fuck for the label
Truth is what made me
Settle down settle down, I was angry, but I'm better now
Niggas talking raising bars, mine amongst the stars
Give it time to level out
If you worried about the flow, I'll make a beat
Write you a hook, then you repeat

Big K.R.I.T.,"All I ever wanted was a gold chain with a gold ring
Twinkle, twinkle, 'cause they gold, man
Candy paint with the gold flakes
""Stay gold,"" said Granny as she smiled with her gold teeth
I got a goal to be golden like King Tut
Often those pictures of that gold
They would flicker, make it hard to call me nigga
'Cause the chains can change they chained us up with
This rope ain't the rope they hanged us up with
24k goldface with the rollie
Invisible set with the grill, that's how gold taste
Jordan 7s golden moment with the gold lace
Gold time, gold mines with the gold gates
If I die bury mine in a gold case
Slow down, never mind it's a gold chase
Goin' for the gusto in a gold place
May God forgive my sins for a gold space

Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case the old man doesn't know me and claims that I owe
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case I'm forsaken and I have to pay for my soul

I had a patna' that went gold on the track and field
But, the gold never shined in our atmosphere
Gold bottles I ain't talking about the champagne
Malt liquor sipping gold helped us maintain
Hood niggas watching Goldie like that's us
Bagging up the gold dust with the laws rushed
Snitchin' on them golden boys with the gold trust
Represented by the lawyers with gold cuffs
They order sweet potato with the gold crust
At the same restaurant with the gold judge
That hate the confidence and sign that the gold gives
So we take away your freedom and your golden years
The only time you see your mother's golden tears
Like what good is gold if you never here
What good is gold that you never wear
I hope it pays your way

Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case the old man doesn't know me and claims that I owe
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case I'm forsaken and I have to pay for my soul

And this song isn't meant to be a glorification of gold
But the understanding that even if
I could take all of this with me, that I’d give it away to get to heaven
I’d give it away to see my Grandmother again
I’d give it away to be at paradise and be at peace with myself
Big houses, nice cars, all that stuff cool but its materialistic things 
That we strive so hard for as human beings
And its not fulfilling
It doesn’t take away the pain, it doesn’t take away the loss
You have to search higher
You have to go higher for that
The Higher power, that higher energy
And that’s what I’m striving for
So in the event that I go and you have to bury me
You can bury me with all these things
And as soon as I see my Maker, I would give it all back
I’d give it all away because it wasn’t nowhere near as important 
As being in heaven and being at peace
Believe that doe
Believe that doe
Bury me in gold
Haha
That's the rapper in me, just wanting to do the hook one more time

Big K.R.I.T.,"Yeah, yeah
I got these ideas, I got a lot on my mind and it's so hard to put 'em in a lot of songs
I try to put 'em all in one, you know
Just what I'm feeling, what I'm going through
I've been drinking so please bear with me

Eyes wide shut, barely eating, tryna get my game on
Played it too cool, almost like I froze, had to turn my flame on
All the while watch em X me out
Magazine cover motherfucker, I ain't tripping my flow
Singing silly shit and maybe they'll listen to me when they sixty
Breaking some bread down, treat it like the Last Supper
Toast to all the time we were po' but still we had one another
Hoppin' in out of shuttles, I'ma be big momma
I'ma get rich momma, I'm sorry I ain't got a wife or kids momma
But look what I did momma
Got a house that I barely can stay in
A car I barely can drive
I'd be a liar if I said getting money didn't make me feel alive
Hustling, arguing about who’s better than I in tweets
But what does it matter when a new artist come out like every week?
And the label all on they nutsack, good for them, keep sucking
Most rappers'll bend over for you, but me?
Bitch I'm not for fucking, over
I'd be the biggest star, they told me
Signed my name on that line and when I die, that's when it's over
Moving on to the set, I was just a talented black kid
But to them I was like a check
Another five years of slaving and then it's on to the next
I was tryna be what I envisioned as a child
A king ain't a man of God when ain't no church in the wild
Shit been fucked up 'cause they don't talk about Christ
Everybody trying to die young but who gon' talk about life?
I pull that card Good Lawd, confederate flag shit so flawed
They used to fly it like pilots and burn crosses in our yards
I can't get with ya if you with that whistling Dixie want that old time back
But niggas got a hundred rounds and automatics so we ain't having that
I ain't promoting no violence, it's people out here been wilding
So much that you can get gunned down just for being happy and smiling
Ain't no hotline worth dialing to say the world needs help
We too busy filling our needs that we might kill us ourselves
I got my gumption for my granny, had a dream about her like last night
She held me tight and told me, ""Little one, everything gon' be alright""
My mind playing tricks on me, but I needed that there
In a world where I feel all alone sometimes I'm needing her care
It's hard to share my insecurities so I medicate, I mean meditate
And pray to God for a second chance, for Heaven's sake
I'm just waiting on a sign or two
Like what I'ma do when my heart get rusty and tired
And it ain't shining through, and I think about death a lot
My father scared of dying, I can relate, I call him before every flight
In case it ain't meant for flying, I can't hold it back, can't control these tears
I mean after all these years I'm still the kid writing poems, too shy
To eat in the cafeteria, I'm two cups in and three shots away
I don't give a fuck about any of the shit I didn't have to say
Lord knows, it's hard to see the truth with your eyes closed
It's hard to protect your feelings when you so exposed
Yeah, I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed

I let it all slip away
And now all I can say
Is here's a toast to a better day
And the love that will come and stay
Oh God, oh God, oh God, wherever you are, yeah
I call your name near and far yeah
Oh, oh God, oh God, wherever you are, yeah

The night is young
Somewhere in America
Say, say your prayers, shine your light
For me

For me when I'm out on the creep
Do whatever to get a meal when you barely can eat
I'm determined to fight the power to further the peace
Mama scared the police might make a point out of me
'Cause it's hard to sleep living life in a daze
When kings wanna be niggas, I hope it's a phase
Queens down to be hoes as long as they paid
Chained to our oppressor, unknowing we slaves
Who wants to be saved
When they claim that the prayers that we pray go unheard
In these God-forgotten days, just in case
Keep the lights burning

Oh, I'm coming home
I'm coming home
The road is long
The night is young
The night is young
Somewhere in America
Say, say your prayers, shine your light
For me

For me when I barely can smile
And the sun refuse to shine when I'm out in the wild
And the raindrops tap the window pane on my room
Scared I lost faith, pray I find God soon
In a world full of alt-rights I was left field
Black man born poor, I was black steel
Black man born free, this how blessed feel
Because my dreams are dreams, don't make them less real
Nightmares are still the same thing
I've fallen from grace, wishing I had wings
Like a dunk in the Summer but I ain't had Spring
'Cause all that running from trouble'll give you bad knees
Now how can I make a move without a play
I got freedom of speech but with nothing to say
'Cause all that working for something but they barely can pay
What the glimmer of Heaven giving me every day
So I wade in the water
Filled with the sharks, snakes, gators, and piranhas
Till the higher, higher ground of the mountaintop
Away from the shooters that's down for shooting to take a shot
'Cause they believe in everything they ever heard
From the bigots and racists that twisting every word
So, a hotel balcony could be the end
Or a podium speaking to family and friends

So won't you keep that light, light, light
Keep that light, light, light, light burning for me
So won't you keep that light, light, light
Keep that light, light, light, light burning for me

I'm coming home
The road is long
The night is young
The night is young
Somewhere in America
Say, say your prayers, shine your light
Say your prayers, shine your light
Shine your light
For me
For me
Oh
For me

Vinegar by the bed, that's for the vicious odor
Vicodin from Minnesota, make her kiss the cobra

Dealing with depression, pills on the dresser
Fiending for affection so I'm buying out the section

Lifestyles of the rich and famous
That lifestyle left a lot of rich folk brainless
To the temple
Yeah, we were broke, but that life was simple
Besides, food is food, water is water, air is air, the rest is mental
I did without until I did within
I said on beat what I wrote in pen
I gave my all without giving in
But it's a thin line between heavenly divine and a living a life of sin
Speak in codes to my worthy friends
Greenroom full, I pray we ain't let the devil in
A lot of faces I don't know
A lot of ""where you been""'s, like you was really looking for me
When I was in the wind, life is just a game now
Really got my aim down to shoot for stars
I ain't been to church in years and it ain't even far
This ain't even half of the battle, I ain't even start

When it was only us it was only love, how could this be?
When falling out for some is not getting the V.I.P

You got an artist, but I'm family, but you need a purse

Fade the top, then let it show

Got the cake, smash it in your face

No material possessions shall cloud my judgement

Love is not found but resides insides me, I manifest this
I will respect myself and wear serenity as my necklace
I will replace what I take and have tranquility as my breakfast
Shed a new light on a new path
I will gain rhythm and lose wrath
Attain wisdom and refuse graph
And build upon what I built on
And wisely regulate time I do have
'Cause what is defeat?
But just the evidence of my haste
Lack of preparedness, in my waste
So I wait
Surround myself with nutrition, wholesomeness and true livin'
Use natural codes of conduct to remove the schism when the rules missing

Altruism and empathy will be the first thing extended to my enemy
Clarity will be the trademark of my friendships

The government don't give a fuck either

With them there eyes
You'd better watch them if you're wise
They sparkle
They bubble
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
You're overworkin' 'em
There's danger lurkin' in

Big Kahuna and the Copa Cat Pack,"It seem like happiness is jus' a thing called Joe
He got a smile that make the lilac wanna grow
He got a way that make the angels heave a sigh
When they know little Joe's passing by
Sometime the cabin gloomy and the table bare
Soon he kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere
Trouble fly away and life is easy go
Does he love me good? That's all I has to know
Seem like happiness is jus' a thing called Joe

Big Kahuna and the Copa Cat Pack,"This is our fork in the road 
Love's last episode
There's nowhere to go, oh no
You made your choice
Now it's up to me
To bow out gracefully
Though you hold the key but baby

[Chorus]
Whenever you call me I'll be there
Whenever you want me I'll be there
Whenever you need me I'll be there
I'll be around

I knew just what to say
Now I found out today
All the words had slipped away but I know
There's always a chance
A tiny spark will remain
And sparks turn into flames
And love can burn once again

Big Kahuna and the Copa Cat Pack,"We meet, and the angels sing
The angels sing the sweetest song I ever heard
You speak, and the angels sing
Or am I breathing music into every word

Suddenly, the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

You smile, and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss, and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart.",And the Angels Sing,2001

I got seven Mac 11's, about eight
38's, nine 9's, ten Mac 10's, the shits never ends
You can't touch my riches, even if you had
MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot Glocks
That's how I got the weedspot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the Lamb spread
Little Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give mc's the runs drippin'
When I throw my clip in the AK
I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flow's remarkable, peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniffed the yayo
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God, I'm droppin shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listenin, smackin' babies at they christening

What you gonna do with it 2Pac?
Yeah where the motherfuckin thugs at?
Throw your motherfucking middle finger
We gonna do this shit like this

I thank the Lord for my many blessings, though I'm stressin
Keep a vest for protection, from the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nuttin separatin us from a MacK 10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, hold up
A straight soldier, bucking at the busters
No matter how you try, niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
You see me striking down the block, hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherfucker, living like I - wanna
And ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways
Thug Life motherfucker crime, pays!
Let the cops put they lights on, chase me nigga
Zig zaggin through the freeway, race me nigga

You can catch Luck in the dice game
Tearin' the block up
I don't stop bank I close account stock up
Spend the whole advance and both hands get it rocked up

Street lookin' like a track meet when I pop up
How these broads gonna stop Luck
Without glocks up
Run in the club barefooted throwin' five shots up

Niggas want to bounce , tell em bounce , throw your ox up
You just buck oh five and act like you want some

Ay yo you can catch me in the hood with Papi
Tryin' to cop grands
Screw a dirtbike I'm tryin' na cop me a land
I'm a gorilla nigga feed me black banannas

Might catch me blacked down with a black bandanna
With the 5th choked out
In a Benz with the rims poked out
Or in a truck with Luck gettin' smoked out
