Shane Nicholson,"Oh, woe is mine
Oh, woe is mine
Dark days a-coming
Lord, woe is mine

Poor lonesome boy
Poor lonesome boy
Dark days a-coming
Oh, lonesome boy

Seen no guiding light
Seen no holy sign
Where's my Kingdom Come?
Oh, Lord woe is mine

One burning tear
One burning tear
Brought down a mountain
One burning tear

Poor lonesome boy
Poor lonesome boy
Bring down a mountain
Oh, lonesome boy

Seen no guiding light
Seen no holy sign
Where's my Kingdom Come?
Oh, Lord woe is mine

Ain't no saints in white
Ain't no bread of wine
Ain't no Kingdom Come
Oh, Lord woe is mine",Woe Is Mine,2008
Shane Nicholson,"It's a long long way to home again,
Carryin' a heavy load.
Wake God's child before the dawn,
Pure as a pot o' gold.
And when you go to sleep at night,
Tell me whether demons come
And drag you down with both hands
To where it's hotter than the burnin' sun.

How far can you run?

When the darkness falls around me,
I can hear the wind blow.
Wailin' through the pine tree,
Ghost of a troubled soul.
Everything that goes around,
Comes around in time.
Don't wait on redemption,
It's never gonna take your side!

How long can you hide?

Blackbird on a high wire,
Afraid of what he saw.
Named their only witness,
He won't sing any more.
And when you go to sleep at night,
Tell me whether demons come,
And drag your soul down below
How far can you run?

Soon your day will come!
Soon your day will come!",Your Day Will Come,2008
Shane Nicholson,"Gotta get good with the big black dog
Hanging all around the door
Gotta get wet in the dirty water
Where the fish don't swim no more
Sifting through all of my wreck and ruin

Gotta get a rhythm with the wiper blades
Gotta go bait the rats
Gotta get lost in a street parade
Of clowns and acrobats
Marching through all of my wreck and ruin

Well everybody knows where everybody goes
When everybody wants something
Cooks are in the kitchen, fingers all twitching
Waiting for me to sing
Ain't it true, you love my wreck and ruin

Time to meet the devil inside my head
And find out what he's worth
Catch that monkey on a wire
And bring him back down to earth
Like I do, with all of my wreck and ruin

Gotta get down with the rattlin' bones
Down where the demons lie
Gotta get dragging this bag of stones
Until the day I die
Pay my dues with all of my wreck and ruin

Well everybody knows where everybody goes
When everybody wants something
Cooks are in the kitchen, fingers all twitching
Waiting for me to sing
Ain't it true, you love my wreck and ruin
Ain't it true, you love my wreck and ruin",Wreck and Ruin,2012
Shane Richie,"Oh I could hide 'neath the wings
Of the blue bird as she sings
The six-o'clock alarm would never ring
But six rings and I rise
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes
The shaving razor's cold and it stings

Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh what can it mean to a
Daydream believer and a
Homecoming queen

You once thought of me
As a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh, our good times start and end
Without all I want to spend
But how much baby do we really need

Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh what can it mean to a
Daydream believer and a
Homecoming queen",Daydream Believer,1998
Shane Richie,"Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you
Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most
Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you

So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision
Everybody wants to rule the world
Say that you'll never never never never need it
One headline why believe it ?
Everybody wants to rule the world

All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world",Everybody Wants to Rule the World,1998
Shane Richie,"How can I be sure in a world that's constantly changing?
How can I be sure where I stand with you?

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
I wanna die 'cause you know I wanna stay with you.
How do I know?  Maybe you're trying to use me.
Flying too high can confuse me.  Touch me but don't take me down.

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
My alibi is telling people I don't care for you.
Maybe I'm just hanging around with my head up upside down.
It's a pity, I can't seem to find someone who's as pretty
 and lovely as you.

How can I be sure?  I really really really wanna know.
I really really really wanna know.  Oh.

How can I be sure in a world that's constantly changing?
How can I be sure?  I'll be sure with you.",How Can I Be Sure,1998

Shane Richie,"Woke up this morning and I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing door
I didn't stand in your way

I miss you more than I missed you before
And where I'll find comfort God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
You left me just when I needed you most

Most every morning I stare out the window
And I think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me

I miss you more than I missed you before
And where I'll find comfort God knows
'Cause you left me just when I needed you most
You left me just when I needed you most

Woke up this morning and I stared out the window
And I struggled for somethin to say
You left in the rain without sayin a word

Shane Richie,"When your body's had enough of me
And I'm laying flat out on the floor
When you think I've loved you all I can
I'm gonna love you a little bit more
Come on over and lay by my side
I've got to be touching you.
Let me rub your tired shoulders
The way I used to do.
Look into my eyes and give me that smile
The one that always turns me on
And let me take your hair down
Cause we're staying up to greet the sun.
And when your body's had enough of me
And I'm laying flat out on the floor
When you think I've loved you all I can
I'm gonna love you a little bit more
Got to say a few things that have been on my mind
You know where my mind has been
I guess I learned my lessons
And now's the time to begin
So if you're feelin' alright and you're ready for me
I know that I'm ready for you
We better get it on now
Cause we got our whole life to live through
And when your body's had enough of me 
And I'm layin' flat out on the floor
When you think I've loved you all I can
I'm gonna love you a little bit more

And I'm layin' flat out on the floor",A Little Bit More,1998
Shane Richie,"She ain't got no money
Her clothes are kinda funny
Her hair is kinda wild and free
Oh, but Love grows where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me

She talks kinda lazy
And people say she she's crazy
And her life's a mystery
Oh, but Love grows where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me

There's something about her hand holding mine
It's a feeling that's fine
And I just gotta say
She's really got a magical spell
And it's working so well
That I can't get away

I'm a lucky fella
And I've just got to tell her
That I love her endlessly
Because Love grows where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me

Nobody knows like me",Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes),1998
Shane Richie,"Our love's grown older seems like its colder
Than the rock so which l carved your name
On down the road we walk in separate shadows
Now there's nowhere else to go
And when we read the book of time
We'II see that we were blind but tried to understand

War of words, no one survives
These words of war cut deep inside
War of words the truth, the lies
These words of war hurt more and more. more and more
I thought our love would never end like letters in the sand
Our passion's washed away and so the tide rolls in again
With the morning storm brings another cloudy day
Lt's getting harder day by day
To believe that we can stay together baby

Shane Richie,"What have I got to do to make you love me
What have I got to do to make you care
What do I do when lightning strikes me
And I wake to find that you're not there

What do I do to make you want me
What have I got to do to be heard
What do I say when it's all over
And sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad, so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad, so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh it seems to me

I'm so tired of on-my-own 
Won't you help me girl 
Just as soon as you can 

People say that I've found a way 
To make you say that you love me

I'm so tired of being alone",Tired of Being Alone,1998
Shane Scott,"I've been thinking in between breaks from drinking
About the the things you said concerning my singing

Oh, you said the top ten billboards, I could break in
Tell me are you for real or just faking?
I grow up and you think the hippies would dig me
I would work on my flow if you thought I had hip-hop in me

To impress the girls I'd work on my sensitivity
As for my debts, who's proud for punk crowd longevity

CHORUS
And if you told me that I could be famous
I present you with a list of changes I could make
We could fake the world out

It's all 'cause of us I'd caused shotgun on the tour bus
Playing every show shirt lest ladies would adore us
Throwing pennies on stage at every single chorus
Then we'd break up the band 'cause all this money bores us

CHORUS

We could fake the world out (x3)
",Breathe,2004
Shane Stockton,"You say you can't believe a single thing I've said
You laughed and called me a fool
You tell me that you've heard all of this before
But maybe you should think before you close the door

What if I'm right
What if I'm really gonna love you all my life
What if a brand new me was standing here tonight
Would you take my hand and give me one more try
What if you're wrong. What if I'm right

You said I've made mistakes too many times
You think that won't stop now
And you've been burned too much to play this game again
But girl, until tonight I didn't want to win, so

What if I'm right
What if I'm really gonna love you all my life

You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark

Come on baby this laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up alright
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now baby gimme just one look

You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying over a broken heart

Everyday, everywhere
On a busy thoroughfare
Folks may watch me; some may spot me

Of my soul

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray
To be only yours I pray
To be only yours
I know now you're my only hope

Sing to me the song of the stars
Of your galaxy dancing and laughing and laughing again
When it feels like my dreams are so far
Sing to me of the plans
That you have for me over again

So I lay my head back down
And I lift my hands and pray
To be only yours I pray 
To be only yours I know now you're my only hope

Shane Yellowbird,"Headlights, a hundred cars
Behind somebody's daddy's barn
Batteries draining blasting those radios
Another long lost summer night
Out past some no trespassing signs
Burning time with friends I used to know

All the years have washed away the voices, faces and the names
But anytime I think about those days

I remember the music, that was playing
The way we were singing right along
Still know every word by heart
And I remember the feeling
In the magic of the moment
The rhythm of that song
Dancing underneath the stars
And I might forget some things we said
And what we did
When I think about the way it was back then
I remember the music

Don't know if it was you or me
Different roads or different dreams
All I know is someone said goodbye
Maybe we weren't ready yet
To let go of our innocence
Guess we'll never know the reason why

But broken hearts, tears and mistakes
All vanish like a summer rain
And when I close my eyes I see your face

I remember the music, that was playing
The way we were singing right along
Still know every word by heart
And I remember the feeling
In the magic of the moment
The rhythm of that song
Dancing underneath the stars
And I might forget some things we said
And what we did
When I think about the way it was back then
I remember the music

Like a sweet lullaby
Every time I think about you I

Remember the music, that was playing

songs come on my radio

some are fast and some are slow

some about sunshine some about rain

but to this old heart they sound the same

even though love notes and words might change


They're all about you

those kisses underneath the stars...you

those angel eyes and open arms...you

they're all about you


Layin at night in this big old bed

a million thoughts run through my head

sometimes I can't even sleep

your memory won't let me be

even if I drift off to dream


They're all about you

I close my eyes and all I see is you

yeah your the star of every scene...you

they're all about you


Conversations all begin with ""hey what's up"" and ""how you been"" but by the time they end they're all about you

revelatons late at night

wishes tossed up to the sky

best moments of my life

they're all about you


You

it doesn't matter what it is...you

oh its a fight that I can't win

every scene and every song

girl the list goes on and on

every night girl every dream

every thought and everything

they're all about you

yeah all about you

Setting us all up to fall like the twins, you, struck
Show them a picture of my I.D.
Better enough to prove that it's me
Look in the mirror,
Now who should I believe

This is my resurrection,
So fuck your resolution
I don't need no protection,
I don't need your confusion
Don't know what to believe

Stay pressed while I pack and go 
And she the only one at the airport 
When I'm back from the road
Took me home, two ribs on the stove, 
My favorite how you know?
Hit the couch and she already had the game on, 
Tivo cause it ended hours ago
She screamed when kobe hit the game winning jumper, 
Ran through the house like a playground in summer 
She wrapped her legs around me and I spunned, 
Kissed her forehead and said that I love her
She ran the water for me got down in the lingerie, 
And said that she gon' model for me perfect way to start the day.

I don't think anybody made, 
You the only who got it made
Like every time I see you, 
Our love gets stronger by the days
Take you to different states, 
Every day a different place
You never heard or seen that race, 
I'm different people different faces
You wanna be kind, mommy you mine

And so I step up to the plate,

Shania Twain,"I was into bein' out on my own
I could take love or leave it alone
That's how you get when you're hurt to the bone
One too many times
I had this heart of mine locked away
I kept my guard up night an' day
I had enough of the games they play
Out there on the line

It was the crime of the century
You played Robin Hood an' rescued me
Ali Baba an' the Forty Thieves
Ain't got nothin' on you
You came on like Jesse James
You stole my heart like you were robbin' trains
I'm gonna lock you up for life with me
It was the crime of the century

You stacked the deck, you didn't gamble at all
You knew exactly how the cards would fall
You bet your heart, but as I recall
I didn't even stand a chance
I bet you had an ace up your sleeve
An' here I thought that you were so naive
You took my hand an' made me believe
In love an' real romance

It was the crime of the century
You played Robin Hood an' rescued me

Honey, don'cha think that it would be fun

Shania Twain,"Well he shines like a penny in a little kid's hand
When he's out on a Saturday night
He's a real go-getter and the best two-stepper you'll see
But when I'm sittin' alone at a table for two
Cause he's already out on the floor
I think about somethin' that my mama used to say to me

You got to dance with the one that brought you
Stay with the one that want's you
The one who's gonna love you when all of the others go home
Don't let the green grass fool you
Don't let the moon get to you
Dance with the one that brought you and you can't go wrong

He's got his old best buddies and his new best friends
And all the girls give him the eye
He's a good time Charlie and the life of the party tonight
But when I think about another well I don't think twice
Cause there'll never be another like him
I know he really loves me and I think maybe mama was right

Learning to live with your memory was lesson number two
And I can't lie, baby
I still cry sometimes
But I've come a long way
Towards gettin' you out of my mind

I'm still under the weather
But I'm over the storm
I still miss the shelter
Of your loving arms
But what I thought would kill me 
Has just made me strong

Sometimes your memory still gets the best of me
But that lonely ache in my heart
Ain't as bad as it used to be

I'll get over you, I've just got a long way to go

Shania Twain,"He knew how to reach me deep inside
And he found a part of me I could not hide
And we'd walk and talk and touch tenderly
Then he'd lay me down and make love to me

We built a love so strong it couldn't break
There was not a road we were afraid to take
And we'd kiss all the way from Arkansas to Rome
'Cause in each other's arms we were home sweet home

But he don't feel the same
Since our lives became
Years of bills, babies and chains

Home ain't where his heart is anymore
He may hang his hat behind our bedroom door
But he don't lay his head down to love me like before
Home ain't where his heart is anymore

If foundations made of stone can turn to dust
Then the hardest hearts of steel can turn to rust
If he could only find that feeling once again
If we could only change the way the story ends

And he may still come home
But I live here alone
The love that built these walls is gone

Home ain't where his heart is anymore

And put them back where they belong

I want a heartbreak Harley
A full of steam dream machine

Sexy long stretch limousine

Rev it up, rev it up 'til your engines blow

You win my soul
You win my heart

All we need is just the two of us
My dreams came true because of you

From (this) this moment as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment

I will love you (I will love you) as long as I live
From this moment on
(Oh heyeah)

Shania Twain,"You've got a way with me
Somehow you got me to believe
In everything that I could be
I've gotta say--you really got a way

You've got a way it seems
You gave me faith to find my dreams
You'll never know just what that means
Can't you see, you got a way with me

It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love

You've got a way with words
You get me smiling even when it hurts
There's no way to measure what your love is worth
I can't believe the way you get through to me

It's in the way you want me
It's in the way you hold me
The way you show me just what love's made of
It's in the way we make love

Oh, how I adore you
Like no one before you
I love you just the way you are

Shania Twain,"The car won't start, it's falling apart
I was late for work and the boss got smart
My panty line shows, got a run in my hose

I realized I forgot my purse
With all this stress, I must confess
This could be worse than PMS

Don't act so blue

I know about Lolita

And whose lips have you been kissin'?
And whose ear did you make a wish in?
Is she the one that you've been missin', baby?
Well whose bed have your boots been under? 

I heard you've been sneakin' 
Around with Jill
And what about that weekend
With Beverly Hill
And I've seen you walkin'
With long legs Louise
And you weren't just talkin'

Don't call on me

Maybe she'll be free

Shania Twain,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again

And I'll be there

But your the key to my peace of mind

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman (woman)

When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful, of what I'm living for
And if I make you happy I don't need to do more

Be aware of the look in his eyes
They'll tell you the mood he's in
What kind of day it's been

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

There'll be a times when he won't say a word
And you'll wonder if it's something you said
A gentle touch of your hand
Will tell him you understand

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

Little things he forgets to do
Have you told him today I love you
When he reaches out, I'll be there
Show him how much you care

He's a man and a man has to try
Let him run, let him fall, let him cry
His world won't fall apart
If you take him into your heart

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him

Oh-oo-oh, so you think you're something special

You're the one that I've been thinkin' about
I'm a lonely little fool over you babe

Got me dazed and confused
Got my body cryin' the blues
Come and see me
Got a line I'm throwing to you

You're the mountain that I want to climb
I won't stop till I reach it this time
I just can't get you outta my mind

Gotta hold myself steady
I'm all fired up with nowhere to burn
I know what I want and I'm ready

And you passed every test
You left me here starved and obsessed
With a hunger that begs for you

Draw, aim, fire
You can't run from my desire
It's my arrow through your heart surrender to me

You're the mountain that I want to climb

Shania Twain,"How can you tell me it wasn't for real?
Step into my shoes and see how it really feels
I know, I know why you do it
Still I can't stand, you putting me though it

Don't gimme that, once over
Don't gimme that, once over
That's just one step over the line

Once upon a time I let you near
And there was no reason that I had to fear
I know, I know it's easy for you to leave
But this time it's better for me to give than receive

Don't gimme that, once over
Don't gimme that, once over
That's just one step over the line

You made the place and time
How did you fake that crime?

Once in a while I'll think of you
Maybe somethin' old or somethin' brand new
I know, I know, I know where you'll be
Somewhere in the night lookin' for me

You can seek but you'll never find
'Cause you can't go back in time

Don't gimme that, once over
Don't gimme that, once over
That's just one step over the line

Don't gimme that, once over
Don't gimme that, once over

Shania Twain,"When he opens the door, says I'm home
Be aware of the look in his eyes
They'll tell you the mood he's in
What kind of day it's been

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

There'll be a times when he won't say a word
And you'll wonder if it's something you said
A gentle touch of your hand
Will tell him you understand

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

Little things he forgets to do
Have you told him today I love you
When he reaches out, I'll be there
Show him how much you care

He's a man and a man has to try
Let him run, let him fall, let him cry
His world won't fall apart
If you take him into your heart

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

For the love of him
Make him your reason for living
Give all the love you can give him
All the love you can

Shania Twain,"We live in a greedy little world,
That teaches every little boy and girl
To earn as much as they can possibly,
Then turn around and
Spend it foolishly
We've created us a credit card mess
We spend the money that we don't possess
Our religion is to go and blow it all
So it's shopping every Sunday at the mall
All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

Can you hear it ring
It makes you want to sing
It's such a beautiful thing, ka-ching!
Lots of diamond rings
The happiness it brings
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

When you're broke go and get a loan
Take out another mortgage on your home
Consolidate so you can afford
To go and spend some more when
You get bored

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

Can you hear it ring
It makes you want to sing
It's such a beautiful thing, ka-ching!
Lots of diamond rings
The happiness it brings
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things

Let's swing
Dig deeper in your pocket
Oh, yeah, ha
Come on I know you've got it
Dig deeper in your wallet
Oh

All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store

Can you hear it ring
It makes you want to sing
It's such a beautiful thing, ka-ching!

Shania Twain,"I thought I might begin by filling you in, 
In case you didn't already know
I'll never forget how you got up and left
In fact it was downright pretty low
There ain't no way I want to
You know I ain't going to
Take you back, so don't even try

You can sweat, you can bleed

But would I do it all again, nah,

Naked and cold just a sitting
On the doctor's table
Waiting to be told just a why
I'm no longer able
To feel my heart beating, 
Give me a good reason why
I kind of went numb just around
About the time you told me
You were moving on, and you
Said that you were going to phone me
It's been so long, and there
Ain't nothing wrong with the line

It's too late to regret it
But you're the one who said it
We're better off being apart

Cause you'll never be messing
With my head again the way that you did

Take out another mortgage on your home

you get bored

Take out another mortgage on your home
Consolidate so you can afford

Shania Twain,"Tell me about it.
Ooh! 

Men...
Have you ever tried to figure 'em out?
Huh, me too, but I ain't got no clue
How 'bout you? 

Men are like shoes
A bit too confused
Yeah, there's so many of 'em
I don't know which ones to choose
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ah, sing it to me
If you agree
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

There's the kind made for runnin'
The sneakers and the low down heels
The kind that will keep you on your toes
And every girl knows how that feels
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ouch, ah sing it with me
(yeah, yeah, yeah) 

[Chorus:]
You've got your kickers and your ropers
Your everyday loafers, and some that you can never find
You've got your slippers and your zippers
Your grabbers and your grippers
Man, don't ya hate that kind?
Some you wear in, some you wear out
Some you wanna leave behind
Sometimes you hate 'em
And sometimes you love 'em
I guess it all depends on which way you rub 'em
But a girl can never have too many of 'em 

It's amazing what a little polish will do...
Men are like shoes. 

Some make you feel ten feet tall (tall)
Some make you feel so small (so small)
Some you want to leave out in the hall (out in the hall)
Or make you feel like kicking the wall (like kicking the wall)
(yeah, yeah, yeah) 

Ah, sing it with me, girls
Ooh! (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Mmm... 

[Chorus] 

Some can polish up pretty good...
Ah, men are like shoes. 

It's amazing what a little polish will do
Some clean up good, just like new
Some you can't afford, some are real cheap
Some are good for bummin' around on the beach

'Cause you can't live on love

I worked night and day to keep us goin'
Through the sweat and tears without her knowin'
It was worth it just to watch her grow
Oh, oh, at least I was able to hold her
Whenever she needed my shoulder
I'm so glad I never let her go

I'm gonna hold on
'Cause what I believe in is so strong
No matter how long
No one can tell me I'm wrong
I ain't goin' down

Dried away the tears and filled me with hope
At night I'd lie awake and cry, prayed we would get by
And for the courage to cope, oh, oh, oh

Shania Twain,"I cried a tear, you wiped it dry
I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

And I can't believe it's you
I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave?
I'd be a fool 'cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me ""friend""

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again

As loud as we like

Is what we need
Everyone 
Is on their feet
But we can see that all we wanna do is be together
Get a little crazy and forget what happens later
We made it through the week
Now we're headed to the street
More fun
Is what we need

One day we will be sitting back laughing all about the times
We were doing donuts in the parking lots and running lights
The time of our lives
Is here and now and yes we got the power 'cause we know at all
We're just gettin' started, open-hearted, having a ball
And nothin' but time on our side

More fun
Is what we need

Is on their feet

Get a little crazy and forget what happens later

And we ain't got to worry
We are running out of light but that's alright, no need to hurry
Morning's such a long way away
And we, we got all night to play
More fun
Is what we need
Everyone 
Is on their feet
The weekend is here and all we want is to do be together 
Get a little crazy and forget what happens later
We made it through the week
Now we are headed to the street

More fun
Is what we need
More fun
Is all we need",More Fun,2017
Shania Twain,"Give me sugar when I-m feeling down

This is what you've got to do
Make some lemonade

But all you need is hard anyway

You can't buy love, but you can make it
You can't make sunshine, but you can make love

When you get suspicious that someone wants your wishes
Even more than you do
Don't waste your time fighting
Better spend it finding what you really want for you

There'd be no joy

And when do we reach the promise on the horizon,

Out on the ocean, under a sunset,

with magic and move a mountain.

Is the eagle ever truly tame,
Given just a little time,
I know that you'll find a way.

I swear from now on,

The vision of you in my life

I will be faithful,
but how can I make a promise
to a place I've never been?

Something has taken me off,
and I don't know if I will survive.
I believe that everything
I'll ever need is here by the roadside.

How can you fly,
keeping heaven in sight,
blinded by the light of day?

Given just a little time,
I know that I'll find a way

I would do anything for you,

One beat at a time,
Where are we going,
I just don't know yet,
How will we make it,

Full of rage and lies

So dry your eyes

If our time has gone too fast I've lived at last

I want to hear you say that you love me

I want to hear you say that you'll be there for me

Solo amarnos en silencio hasta el final
Y el corazón me dice que es verdad

A candle light (dinner) and a dozen roses just to name a few (few,few,few)
You always seem to know the things that I'm feelin'

And that I was able to touch your face 
I can remember how I cried 
Wishing you were with me 
I used to wonder about your day 
And if I was present in some way 
I needed to feel like I was loved 
I needed you desperately 

But I'm thankful, I'm grateful 
And you will always be to me

A symbol of love that I can hold 
Your petals shower me 
And I can feel your presence all around me 
Forever like a rose 
You're so incredible 
I can feel it still so powerful 
I finally believe 
That I can have your presence all around me 

I never was able to understand 
Why both of you chose to be just friends 
Thought we were a stronger family 
I guess I was wrong 
I was left with just holidays 
Maybe a Saturday or a Sunday 
Never had much time to spend together 
And I felt so alone 

But I'm thankful and grateful 
And you will always be to me... Forever

Waking up to your smile
And tasting your sweets lips
To put my day in motion
But I don't always recognize you
When you wear the pain you've been through
And I compete against a past
And learn it's more than an ocean

I'm not afraid of work
Even through the worst
Baby I'm staying with you
It's gonna be worth that I love you
Everybody knows that it's still good
(Life's been crazy, but I know baby)
Baby it's so good
(Good and bad times, cause you are mine)
(Our love, our love) Is still good
(Our love, our love) so good

Sometimes I don't know how to steer it
Can't really say that I've been fearless
But we've got too much invested
It's only fair that we're destined
(I don't want nobody but you)
(Big and strong when we go through)
On the other hand you still know you've got my devotion

I'm not afraid of work

(Our love, our love) is still good
(Our love, our love) so good

It's been 10 years and I can't believe that my baby's home
I can even recall the day that you came along
All the years that we dated baby, then I made the call
And I brought you a cla**ic rock like the 80's songs
We the unbreakable perfect couple, he made us strong
Who would've ever predicted that I take a fall
You could've packed up and taken off
But instead you stuck with me through the greatest storm
And that's love, man the rain clouds
Didn't have a rule 'till you thought of how we exchanged vows
Yeah we faced trials, by the grace of God
Still good, now great, now real talk

I'm not afraid of work
Even through the worst
Baby I'm staying with you
It's gonna be worth that I love you
Everybody knows that it's still good

And if you walk right out my life
God knows I'd surely die

And I can't stop doin' without
Without the rhythm of my heart
No I can't stop doin' without

Shankar Mahadevan,"Koi jo mila to mujhe aisa lagta tha
Jaise meri saari duniya main geeton ki rut
Aur rangon ki barkha hai khushbu ki aandhi hai
Mehki hui si ab saari fizaayen hain
Behki hui si ab saari hawaayen hain
Khoyi hui si ab saari dishaayen hain
Badli hui se ab saari adaayen hain
Jaagi ummengein hain, dhadak raha ahi dil
Sanson main toofaan hain, hoton pe nagme hain
Aakhon main sapne hain, sapnon main beete hue
Saare vo lamhe hain
Jab koi aaya tha, nazron pe chhaya tha
Dil main samaya tha, kaise main bataun tumhe
Kaise use paaya tha, pyaar ke chehre pe bikhri jo julphen
To aisa lagta tha jaise kohre ke peechhe
Ek os main dhula hua phool khila hai jaise
Badal main ik chaand chhupa hai
Aur jhaank raha hai jaise raat ke parde main
Ek savera hai roshan roshan aakhon main
Sapnon ka saagar jismain prem sitaron ki chaadar
Jaise jhalak rahi hai
Lahron lahron baat kare to jaise moti barse
Jaise kahin chandi ki payal goonjey
Jaise kahin sheeshe ke jaam girey
Aur chhann se tootey jaise koi chhip ke sitaar bajaye
Jaise koi chaandni raat main gaye
Jaise koi hole se paas bulaye
Kaisi meethi baatain thee vo
Kaisi mulakaatein thee vo
Jab maine jaana tha
Nazron se kaise pighalte hain dil
Aur aarzoo paati hai kaise manzil
Aur kaise utarta hai chaand jameen par
Kaise kabhi lagta hai swarg agar hai
To bas hai yahin par
Usne bulaya mujhe, aur samjhaya mujhe
Hum jo mile hain, hamain aise hi milna tha
Gul jo khile hain, unhe aise hi khilna tha
Janmo ke bandhan, janmo ke rishtey hain
Jab bhi hum janme to hum yuhin milte hain
Kaanon main mere jaise, shahed sa ghulne lage
Khwaabon ke dar jaise aakhon main khulne lage
Khwaabon ki duniya bhi kitni haseen aur
Kaisi rangeen thee khwaabon ki duniya
Jo kahne ko thee par kahin bhi nahi thee
Khwaab jo toote mere, aakh jo khuli meri
Hosh jo aaya mujhe
Maine dekha maine jaana
Vo jo kabhi aaya tha, nazron pe chhaya tha
Dil main samaya tha, ja bhi chuka hai
Aur dil mera hai ab tanha tanha
Na to koi armaan hai, na koi tamanna hai
Aur na koi sapna hai
Ab jo mere din aur ab jo meri ratain hain
Unmain sirf aansoon hain
Unmain seif dard ki ranj ki batain hain
Aur pharyaadein hain
Mera ab bhi koi nahi main hoon aur khoye
Hue pyaar ki yaadein hain",Breathless [Hindi Pop],2003

That's why I'm not talkin' to you

Someone was takin' my place, oh
You wouldn't come to the phone
She forgot to put me on hold
And I can't believe what I heard
What I heard in your very own words
How could you call her...

How could you call her baby?
How could she be your lady?
Thought you were mine
Thought I was yours
How could you call her sweetheart?
How come you're breakin' my heart?
How could you be so wrong?

Baby, baby
Hear what I'm saying
I am not your fool
You should see me now as gone
Baby, baby
You must think I'm crazy
I will not come back
I feel I have been too wronged

Don't try to call me
'Cause I don't have the time
I'll be much, much too busy
Hangin' out with friends of mine, oh
If we meet in the street
You should not even bother to speak
'Cause I still hear the words in my head
Those are some words I will never forget
How could you call her...

Boy, you owe me an apology
Just don't look for forgiveness from me
And I tried my best to understand
But I've done for you all that I can

Just forget that you ever knew me

Jump back like a uncut thang at work

Fire the green up and let me shoot the shit witcha

Because it could have been me, oh, it could have been me 
And that strikes me like a baseball bat across my knees.

Shannon McNally,"All this dreaming will drive me crazy
But is it dreaming if it's all I ever do?
The days are bleeding they just run together
The nights are cold in the deep of Minnesota
From where I lie I can see the airport
I watch them land and I see them leave
So many things that I've never done
So much ends before it's begun 
And I'm so tired I could cry
I'm so tired I lie awake at night 
Watching the moonlight circle my head
It's just about as blue as blue can get 
When I get out of this bed it's gonna
Start all over again? 
Mississippi sun doesn't shine this far north
I'm dreaming of peaches and bare tanned knees
A place that's warm where they just let you be
Where you can stay forever cause the rent is free 
And I'm so tired I could cry
I' m so tired all I can do is sigh 
Watching the moonlight circle my head
It's just about as blue as blue can get
When I get out of this bed it's gonna
Start all over again?",Start All Over,2002
Shannon McNally,"Gonna sing it like a song, sing it mountain high
Gonna sing it river flow
I've been thinking 'bout it in my thoughts alone

When I hear that voice it's like soup to the hungry
Wanna be the teacher, gonna be the kid
I'm gonna get inside
Find out where it's hid

'Cause, baby this is it babe
We're on the miracle mile
Trying to give it up and do it with a smile
'Cause, I'm not alone and I'm not giving in
Till I find out where this miracle begins

Some days I get so mad, still I get out of bed
Put my shoes on and push on ahead
L look for something good to say

Gone are the days that I'm surprised or bewildered
By what they're calling quality
Most of it sounds like bullshit to me

Someday is here and tomorrow never comes

'Cause, this is it baby
We're on the miracle mile
Trying to give it up and do it with a smile
'Cause, I'm not alone and I'm not giving in
Till I find out where this miracle begins

Throw your old skin to the curb
Go and get a match
It's time to light it up and let it burn, oh yeah now

Bet you got a woman to keep you warm
Don't mind me, I'm over here trying not to do anything wrong
My enthusiasm tends to come on too strong

Everybody's shakin' it for the camera
Yeah, you're beautiful but isn't there anything else to say uh
Like how does it feel now?

'Cause, this is it baby
We're on the miracle mile
Trying to give it up and do it with a smile
'Cause, I'm not alone and I'm not giving in

Shannon McNally,"Down around Biloxi
Pretty girls are swimming in the sea
Oh they look like sisters in the ocean
The boy will fill his pail with salted water
And the storms will blow from off towards New Orleans

The sun shines on Biloxi
The air is filled with vapors from the sea
And the boy will dig a pool beside the ocean
He sees creatures from a dream under the water
And the sun will set from off towards New Orleans

The stars can see Biloxi
The stars can find their faces in the sea
We are walking in the evening by the ocean
We are splashing naked in the water

If there's a lesson here I have lost it 
Or maybe its just me I needed to find 

Wrapped in the ease of omission 
I am the casualty of unspoken fears 
Let the tears tell a tale I am too weary to speak 
Let the silence weave a web for you, for you and I dear 

They say that home is where you'll go 
When you have nowhere else to turn 
These string, of this thing, these songs 
Carry me along when I have memories to burn 

Wrapped in the ease of omission 
I am the casualty of unspoken fears 
Let the tears tell a tale I am too weary to speak 
Let the silence weave a web for you, for you and I dear 

I called you up to start a fight 
Because resolution is my favorite motif 
Love is just a cheap disguise for compromise 
What you get isn't always what you need

I'm just a little shy of knowing the differences between me and them 
I wake in the light of another gray sky sunrise 
One more faded shade of tragedy to transcend 

I'm calculating the distance between bed and bath 
The benefits of good oral hygiene and the uselessness of math 
I'm a willing heiress to my own demise 
I trespass on bits of sorrow lashed end to end 

I want to feel like there is more to this 
Than a pocketful of days strung up 
Like cheap tinsel on a dying tree 
Cheap tinsel on a dying tree 

God skipped town with a suitcase full of deodorant spray and chewing gum 
So it's hard to have faith in anything even the saviors on the run 
Ever since that day we looked into the sky 
Heard buy canned cream corn, plastic wrap, bottled water and bb guns 

I want to feel like there is more to this

But I was born to privilege just like every white everybody else

Because the system is set up so the system can take all the blame

Tell me who we gonna blame for our mistakes 
Yeah who we gonna blame for our mistakes

Shannon Noll,"When you feel the dream is over,
Feel the world is on your shoulders,
and you've lost the strength to carry on.
Even though the walls may crumble,
And you find you always stumble through,
Remember never to surrender to the dark.
'cause if you turn another page,
You will see that's not the way, The story has to end.
If you need to find a way back,
Feel you're on the wrong track,
Give it time, Learn to fly,
Tomorrow is a new day,
You will find you're own way,
You'll be stronger with each day that you cry,
Then you'll learn to fly.

In you're head so many questions,
The truth is your possession,
The answer lies within your heart.
You will see the doors are open,
If you only dare to hope and you,
Will find the way to fight the fears that kept you down.
'cause if you turn another page,
You will see that's not the way,
The story has to end.

If you need to find a way back,
Feel you're on the wrong track,
Give it time, Learn to fly,
Tomorrow is a new day,
You will find you're own way,
You'll be stronger with each day that you cry,
Then you'll learn to fly.


Looking at your situation,
There's so much that you can do,
Now's the time to make your stand.
This is just an observation,
In the end it's up to you,
The future's in your hands.

If you need to find a way back,
Feel you're on the wrong track,

But I'm looking forward now I'm trying to find my way. Looking back I see only yesterday. Time is moving at least I know it's real and I'm singing about the way that I feel.

Laying on a deck chair just trying to catch some rays, thinking 'bout this thing that they call love to me it's just a maze. Is it in the trees the breeze or do you see it in a new born's eyes?

He gets to his feet and he says

What about me? It isn't fair
I've had enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I want to live
But you just take more than you give

Well, she's not too proud, to cry out loud
She runs to the street and she screams

More than you give

Take a step back and see the little people
They might be young, but they're the ones that make the big people big
So listen as they whisper:
""What about me?""

And now I'm standing on the corner, all the world's gone home
Nobody's changed, nobody's been saved
And I'm feeling cold and alone
I guess I'm lucky, I smile a lot

And no one ever got under my skin
I thought I had it all together but somehow
Something about her sucked me in

Everything I thought went out the door
I never dreamed that I'd get caught, get caught

'Caught in the afterburn, totally lost control
The moment that I saw her, I knew that I was gone
I'm caught in the afterburn, nowhere I can run
She's bringing me under now
Can't tell which way's up now
Caught in the afterburn
I'm caught in the afterburn

I almost lose it every time I'm near her
I'm so hung up I can't believe
And she has me wrapped all around her finger
So damn tight that I can't breathe

I don't think I can take this anymore
I wish that I never got caught, got caught

'Caught in the afterburn, totally lost control
The moment that I saw her, I knew that I was gone
I'm caught in the afterburn, nowhere I can run

Can't tell which way's up now

I'm caught in the afterburn

She draws you in so perfectly
Does it to everyone she needs
It isn't hard to see, you're just like me

When it all comes crashing down
And I take a look around
Oh, you are all I see, nothing in between

How many times must I walk on this sharp broken glass
And turn the other cheek

'Cause when it all comes crashing down

Shattered like a bullet through glass

On what might've been
Every night I spend asleep less
Smokin' cigarettes till 3am
In an empty bed and I can't get you out of my head

You burnt your name
Into my heart where its scared
I can't erase you form me
You soul and mine intertwined
You cut the line

Holdin to the past

Shannon Noll,"Early days back where it all began
When the money started rolling in
And everyone was reaching
Everyone was reaching in
It was all of them, thought it was all of us
Hit me harder than a coward punch
So I just went out drinking
Tryna let it all sink it

Even when your friends make a mess
Fail the test
Just keep walking
Even when my blood boils hard
I won't stop
I'll still be there
My father always said to be strong
When you're wronged
And rise above it like he did
Sometimes all that it takes is forgiveness
To cross a bridge

Another town far away from home
Redemption is a lonely road
I lay in bed not sleeping
Thought that sleeping was for when you're dead
I've done some stupid things with my reckless highs
Made some big mistakes right from the start
Maybe I was not worth keeping
And that was slowly sinking in

Even when my head let me tread
On the edge
The door stayed open
You never let the fire in your eyes
Be denied
It was always there
My father always said to be strong
When you're wronged
And rise above it like he did
Sometimes all that it takes is forgiveness
To cross a bridge

After all the highs and lows
As the travels come and go
There is nothing more important than this

Even when your friends make a mess
Fail the test
Just keep walking
Even when my blood boils hard
I won't stop
I'll still be there
My father always said to be strong
When you're wronged
And rise above it like he did
Sometimes all that it takes is forgiveness
Sometimes all that we need is forgiveness
Sometimes all that it takes is forgiveness

When what's existing subsides

Shannon Wright,"Shade calls the bone marrow she left a stage so bare
And everyone clapped to see you rise so gracefully
What a fright on such a beautiful night
The soldiers rang around my head
The flies ate the called cabs
Everyone says I'm scared not you you believe I'm dead



",Twilight Hall,1999
Shannon Wright,"He's a man of the grain
Wears his robe of burly pain
Bowls the town for alcohol
Chewed up his name and he sold it all
Perched it up for sale
He turned the light out
He turned the sign down farewell goodnight
The awning falls flat and the clocks are spinning
Bowl the town for alcohol you are what I need
He resides in a carnival turns the pages
And mocks it all he's a martyr with a wide rope
Turns his head to watch it fall
Hacked his hand through the toil
He's a product of failed love



",William's Alabama,1999
Shannon Wright,"Built a house made out of blood
Fought the serpent and his thugs
Played the game fought the fought
All wrapped you astound me living life through
Your sleep
Yard grass in flight on the ledge we fly
Yard grass in flight the serpent has moved from sight



",Yard Grass,1999
Shannon Wright,"Up the hill to a vacant lot
There's nothing to see
Walk the pillars to settle in
And find that you've turned from me
You're the cup and you're the drink
That keeps swimming up north through the stream
I'm the raft that got filled with sand
That keeps knocking about in the drain
My hands are laid out to persuade a gathering
Hair is polished and shiny trim
Just keep a friend in me



",You're the Cup,1999
Shannon Wright,"Mend the sea on this floating tin can
On the branch I bend
This swollen page is a yawning friend
Through the straw I stem
Reframe and cut this, ailing theme
In the lenses I tame
How can I conceal this woven outline
How can I fray from this lane of you



",Absentee,2000
Shannon Wright,"This background is so vague
This falter much too strong
A slew of reluctance
Makes the focus warble on
For every laden vein
Is a grim pail of prey
The true are open
They wrestle with this state
What a dirty facade
The coming of an ugly file
Every guide is ill-timed
Purely lit for the lofty kind
What a dirty facade
The coming of an idle qualm
And everyone is so still
No one ever is pure",Dirty Facade,2000
Shannon Wright,"So stark is this burrow
So void is this valley
So bare is this vessel
These emberdays have grown grey
So vague is this refuge
So wide is this pattern
So clean is this tassel
These emberdays have grown grey



",Ember Days,2000
Shannon Wright,"This drone you sound alarmingly meek
Is inside my head and plummets my bed
It rallies and summons me in my sleep
The sun is groggy and upon your plate
Arms do fumble they're out of their frame
Luster has moved and opted your space
When you call a caddy
I'll be the kind you use
The sagas pose their levee
That's the kind that floats to you
And after all I idle to carry on
The clocks married the dated
Operas sails salutes
The planks are calm with boredom
It's the kind you tend to coo
Every gala's a blanket in flight
And I'm the kind you use
And you with all your ready is a horror
The recital is staged and ready to recite
Stating the flaws and running you wild
But I'll be any stable you like
The radius is starting to stumble and fright
The loveliest station is wailing from sight
But I am ready to part from you



",Fences of Pales,2000
Shannon Wright,"Long before this deserted map
You use to dim to light
The person you show one use to believe
The facet has blurred the link
You boil the greatest of lakes
You lid the envelope of monsoon
Your mar hushes my frame
You lid the envelope of monsoon
Your gilded eye
Your sharpened speech
You use to lend the light
A flask welder
Your jaunty trade
You use to pry the weight



",Flask Welder,2000
Shannon Wright,"The hover is ajar
My worth has fled
Be certain of this empty tray
Do we maintain that there is no one
For me to ring
This stale sight of you
Your spotted eyes
They're soiled through
These fragments I skew



",The Hover Is Ajar,2000
Shannon Wright,"Doldrums badger the hum
Flapping about for everyone
These limbs they do ring
Stagger with frugal means
Hector pillars within
Choking the laughter thin
This checkered timely place
Your babble swells the complaint
Carry the cost
But what will turn this noise down



",Noise,2000
Shannon Wright,"I'm the bagpipe that is bursting
I'm the shuffleboard at night
Your eyes they swim like oceans
Every word is a lovely rhyme
You're sporadic and so lovely
Every room is so alive
I'm laughter and a fake
My bulb is an ugly shrine
Pay no mind to me
I cannot show love



",Pay No Mind,2000
Shannon Wright,"These bloated veins have climbed hillsides and airlines
Looking for a limb to reside
This eager scheme has turned, lathered up your bottled smile
But the notice just passes the tether by
In storms the coils do fail and I will paw for air
You buckle and stir my brittle hand
Oh, this empty glance of you folds only to consume
How they fray away, these ribbons of you",Ribbons of You,2000
Shannon Wright,"What could hinder this haste
Calm strewn the isle of this tattered grain
In all this muzzled distaste
I brush the vial hoping to misplace
Cover me with soil and tread
Drape me with flames this frock of disdain
Stop this sunken ravine pull out the slate
From under me
This kingdom in the quilt of demand
Forces the conquer of the plan



",Within the Quilt of Demand,2000
Shannon Wright,"Your presence howls inside my ear
You lifted the ark from me
Now there's nothing I cannot see
A wooden tin, a hidden sleet

Throw the matches upon my bed
In this boiling light
It swims through this
Hollowed bin to me
Now you ring the bells



",Bells,2001
Shannon Wright,"There goes your body in a box
That is all I have left
Now this odor lines my shaking bed

There's no order to you
Come with me you dirty wretch

How does this duty send me relief
When I've been cheated of you



",Dyed in the Wool,2001
Shannon Wright,"Come let's probe these blackened eyes
Come let's smear this spectacle
Come let's slam on the light
This must soon be revised

Hinterland, I shall descend
Hinterland, I crumble within

I shall feel nothing
I shall be rinsed



",Hinterland,2001
Shannon Wright,"Why is this delight
Excused as nothing?
Is this the vigor
A vast decay?
This ugly state
I shall not answer
This nausea
I delve to slain

This only takes one moment
Could you explain your meaning

This majesty is no longer
A replica with no taste
May I admire
Your tinted cheek
This lobby of worth
I urge to keep



",Less Than a Moment,2001
Shannon Wright,"There goes your mother and her plague
What a terrible display
Of a charcoaled tongue
That wouldn't lend a hand
Though this dead was a thoughtless act
With alcohol intact
Quietly she seeks the day to pass
With those stitches that you clean
You hold your flag of your doleful plea
Now there's nothing left to recall
A fruitless title bestowed
Amongst someone you could never know
In this plight of this dismay
This thickness of your plague
She's a realm that's lost her way



",The Path of Least Persistence (Figure II),2001
Shannon Wright,"Air dives from your reach
You cover your mouth
Hoard your lovely breath
For which not to speak
You're always sweet
In the darkest days



",The Sable,2001
Shannon Wright,"This state it cannot be sound
For seeing through
The day with fresh eyes
Try to lick these bits
Back into place
These tanks bore there wintry weight
To wake to these scraps of morn
It bears a stone
And that's what I've become
These legs are built upon a surly demise
We all reach for a hand in which we will guide
Let's sit quiet and we shall not stir
Your mouth is fragrant
And lassoing this room
And never is too long to date
Your crusty petals are prying away
Pails of cheer have become stains",Surly Demise,2001
Shannon Wright,"This frost you stand in
It draws on wobbled legs
This sway is stabled
I gnaw through your gate
You sort what I bend
You jar me for relief
This canter is guided
This room I pace
You hurry wonder
And fasten it in
You idle my forfeit
My dire you mend
The uproar is cautious
The error absent
This order is frantic
For the marvel you'll send

Cause here comes the Big Mama

Cause y'all weak-ass hoes got me fed up 
So hookers, get your gloves, and yo, let's got head up
Wall to wall y'all all will fall
I don't stall cause in this brawl it's winner takes all
A title bout for all the clout
Any hooker tryin to step to this, it's lights out
One hit, your head split, throat slit
Think you're Miss It, but I started this shit
At 14 years old I was goin gold
While I was on tour, you was tourin the hoe stroll
Suckin dicks and turnin tricks to get a quick fix
While I was puttin dope hits in the mix
Rippin shows with Kane and Biz Markie
Fuckin up Roxanne and takin out Sparky
Niggas came in flocks from blocks and blocks 
To watch the Rox knock bitches out the box
And every place I played, I headlined
Striclty big names on the topic read mine
The q-you-double e-n
Queen of emceein

Cross my path, your ass'll get whipped
Cause Shanté ain't about no games
Matter of fact, yo, I'ma start callin off names
First up there's Latifah
You roll up, and I'ma smoke that ass like reefer
Cause you ain't never in life been a star to me
Sold the fuck out tryin to go R&B
Now that shit is shady
You say ladies first, well I'm the first lady
And all y'all hoes are phoney
Try to get flippid, I'ma rip you and your girl Monie
You're illegitimate, tryin to get a little bit
And I'm about sick of that 'Monie-in-the-middle'-shit

Had one good jam, now you think you a star, bitch
Breakin your neck tryin to be in the limelight
But give you a mic, and you can't even rhyme right
So get the fuck off the scene
Cause I got a M-16 that says 'Shanny's the queen'
And all you bitches got your style from me

Somebody tell her to stop actin like a man
She needs somethin real thick to help her out quick
(What?) And that's a good piece of dick
Now as for that West Coast slut
With fake-ass hair, contacts, and a patted butt
Instead of stompin to the 90s, use your brain
And stomp your ass down to Jack Lelane
You better hurry and hop on a diet plan
And keep the pork chops out the fryin pan
Yeah, I said it, so what?
You roll up, slut, you get a fuckin gumbut to your gut
I'm bringin tears to all my peers
I ain't new, I been doin this shit for 10 years
Bring any hoe, and I wreck her
I rip the nicest, from Isis down to Salt-N-Pepa
And now you know that I'm the star of the show, hoe 
While I get dough, you're givin up the yo-yo
You say a nigga can't play with it
You got another job? Well bitch, you better stay with it
Cause you ain't shit in this here

It would bore me terrifically,too,

Shape of Despair,"Slow mine feet are,
Frozen their veins.
Still closing helplessly afar,
Waking the creatures within.

I am a lonely traveller,
Awaiting to sleep eternally.
Under those cold woods,
As my fall brings them.

Shadows of their wings,
As howling their pleeds.
Wounded, I lay on ground
Listening their needs

It's dark and cold
And they fly slowly
The way they were told.
To feast mine fleshly dreaming.
And they know surely,
They raped mine soul.

I used to sense what were
Inside of me
To feel waves of difference
Waves which brought me to live
I enjoyed this life in me
Breathing and feeling
Burning and suffocating
Didn't curse the hour
Which gave birth to me
Didn't curse another life
When bearing death inside

Now all things I do bear
Are all gone and free
This, myself
Now fleeing around death
Cursing the hour
And another life

Shaquille O'Neal,"I was born three six seven eighteen with ???? on the wisdom
Hail to the moon, just like Kunta Kinte
That means I'm gifted from the get-go
Mom's you never let go
Mad thanks for raising me right, bro'
You gave me confidence to stop the nonsense
Didn't live in Bel Air like the Fresh Prince
Times are hard, times are rough
Didn't have Toys are Us toys, but I had enough love
Plus the guidance from above
To go to the park, sweatin' push and shove
Maybe then for a dunk like you told me
Then there were a few times when Dad had to scold me
Prayed for my safety, I know how you was feeling
Didn't want me wheeling and get to drug-dealing
Remember when you asked me this one day
Who I want to' be like, I said Dr. J
Then you said, ""Good, now you gotta' go
""Take the damn ball and slam it through the hole.""
Mom cracked a smile, Daddy gave a frown
I said to myself, ""I can't let them down.""
So make way, I'm coming in for a landing
And nothing's gonna' stop me, from being outstanding

I'm outstanding

Now let's skip to the time when I was fifteen
Shaq is in the house... no, Shaq is on the scene!
Now my name's in papers, girls caught the vapors
Kids look up to me like a skyscraper
Now, a role model... I mean a role figure
Then I ask myself, can I get any bigger?
My dream is coming through, but coming through slowly
Then I remember what Mom and Dad told me
""Remember this, son, do all the runs
""Shoot your gift like a gun and never forget where you come from
""You're young, gifted, and Black
""If they can't say Shaquille O'Neal then make 'em scream, 'Shaq!'""
Like the fam' do, in the stands who
When I freak the funk on a dunk they, ""Ahhh! Oooh!""
From high school to college, they gave me enough knowledge
Make that gift and now it's
Time for me to fulfill my dream
To be in the [leaders' game?] like Dakeem
I'll make the backboards shatter, 
Fans chit-chatter
Even make the other [sen-tails?] get madder
That's me. Who can it be?
The master of disaster, seven foot three
Brother, ain't no other in the nation
I'm born from my mother but I'm God's creation
I'm outstanding

I'm outstanding

Cause now I'm outstanding
Wave your hands and pump your fist
When I'm on the court you know it's strictly ""Swish!""
Cause there's some things that I gotta' do:
Tape up the ankle, pump up my Shaq-shoe
And now it's time to take care of business
To run up the court with Nick and Dennis
Scott, but I won't stop
Gotta' keep striving until I reach the top
Gonna' take a peek over the mountain
I flow like a fountain
Peace, I gotta' go! And I'm out and... 
But before I go, wave your hands
Peace to all my family, friends, and fam
I'm outstanding",I'm Outstanding,1993

There's two scoops a raisin in the sun
Brothers try to rally up, then dilly dally for some room
Bird peckin', doulbe deckin', rubber neckin' in my tomb
Check it out yo, I smile like Groucho Marx
I make a joke, hokey pokey, and slide by like egg yolk
Play me like a punk like Penguin and the Joker
Snoopin' in my biz like Tom and Roxie Roker

The brothers with the Asian guise making G's
And now we're sellin' records overseas
Holy smokes, oops, your whole plan goofed up
Now you get kicks, 'nough licks, plus cuffed up

So play dosey doe, sufferin' sucotash my mistletoe is gone
Snow White is after my seven dwarves, my styles, and after me Lucky Charms
So leapin' leprechauns, be glad I'm pushin' my pedal to the metal
I'm rugged and rough for Cocoa Puffs, and yes, I love my Fruity Pebbles
So howdy, my partner, I starts to get meaner
So ask Bob for hope, nope, not Mr. Bob Dobailina
Oh were has my mic gone? Tell me, have you seen her?
I stretch like a condom and gets plump like a weiner
Or a sasuage, but of course it's, time for Chip to wreck it
But before my intro I gots to check it
So who is the nicest in your neighborhood?
Lyrics are merry, merry, quite contrary, and Captain Crunch berry good
So rah rah, sis boom bah
Chip Fu is coming again, give thanks and praises to jah
My lyrics are smooth like the head on Terry Savalas
My tongue starts to quicken like Speedy Gonzales
Take up your pen, your pad, your lyrical bag and run go whole a fresh
Touche pussy cat, put down that mic 'cause you can't rap
'cause I'm dip-dip-divin', so socializin'
Clean out your ears, yes, and open up your eyes and
I kick like Bruce Lee and Jean Claude Van Damme
So dunna nana nana nana nana nana, Batman!
I hip-hop, hop-hop
Don't-don't, stop-stop
I'm harder than a Flinstone and much bigger than a Chub Rock
Our types of lyrical styles? yes the Schnickens can pick 'em
I burp, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em

Rippin' the program, slow man, hot damn
I grand slam, swingin' things again and again (whoo)
Golly ha-chooey, macho like Roscoe
Randy Savage manwitch, swingin' the ding-a-ling with damage
Pauish not antoinish nor monetego
Spanish like que for the nine two lingo
Next, a new hex, commentators stand aside
Stringin' emcees like a bikini or panty line (ha ha)
Nut you might bust, but you can't even come right
Spite the strokin' or hopin' or pullin' a peace pipe
Huff and puff so what the fuck is happening?
On the lyrical, miracle, spirutal
but everybody's rockin'
Flip a new hit, catch wreck to the nine ship
Equipped, never slip with tongue twister
All my styles that's buckwild
No fake rap, I push pounds
I flip mad scripts and hips, I hit
So bring the goya oh boy-ah, as I say hasta manana
Soft and chewy Honky Kong fooey, reggae not rasta tough stuff
Can I rock?

[Chorus]

I'm the hooper, the hyper
Protected by Viper
When I rock the hoop yo, you'd better decipher
In other words you'd better make a funky decision (whoo)
'cause I'm a be a Shaq knife, and cut you with precision
Forget Tony Danza, I'm the boss
When it comes to money, I'm like Dick Butkas
Now who's the first pick? me, word is born and
Not a Christean Laettner, not Alonzo Mourning
That's okay, not being bragadocious
Supercalifragelistic, Shaq is alidocious

Who the hell is Shaq Attack you'd better read the paper
Treat me like Biz Markie you'd better catch a vapor
I've got mad props so why would you exploit
Punch you in your face like that kid from Detroit
Really yo you'd better ask MC Hammer 'bout this bad mama jama 
Tall kid with the hoopa hypa lipta-gramma
Watch out yo it's time for MC bashin'
Got more loot than my man Johnny Cash and
I'm hard like a 360 twice jam
Ask Dr. Dre and Ed Lover who's the man
I'm sure they'll say me brother please don't play me like a shrimp
Dunk it on your head then I'll point like Shawn Kemp
Don't need the drink crooked I juice to get loose
My favorite cartoon is Bullwinkle the Moose
I'm 'bout to sting you like rubbing alcohol
Yes yes why'all call me Ed Jones cause I'm too tall
Put the rhyme between my legs then I'll score
Never mind a whore I want to do a phat tour
Come freak the style that the big Michelle display
You know the style that be my fortee

Get on the microphone and rip a funky track

It's the Phife and Shaq mission plus Shaheed's got the goods
Making rough daddy jams knocking harder than wood
Make ya boogie with the fly armstrong crew
Phife Dawg and Shaq Fu this is how we do
Funky renditions there's no competiton
Split mc's apart as if their group was New Edition
Make mc's hush stop look and listen
It's hard to comprehed so they commence to remincising
Far from an amateur microhpone damager
End your whole career beat down your manager
Never was a herb kick you to the curb
There's more to my attitude than the city of Johanesburg
Styles are mean but this year they're even meaner
Carrying chips on my shoulder so call me Sarafina
Gaurantee ?? martin pissin' and a fartin'
Mess around with this and you'll be on a milk carton
Mc's don't like me I say tough titties
Blow up the spot like my man from Jersey City
People always askin' 'why is Phife so cocky?'
I gotta be good at something cause I can't play hockey
You know the status and the status is live
The first draft-pick for the label called Jive

Yo Shaq, where ya at?
I'm over here
Yo Shaq, where ya at?
Phife, I'm right here
Yo Shaq, where ya at
Phife, I'm right here
Yo Shaq, where ya at?
Phife Dawg, I'm right here
Yo Shaq, where ya at?
Phife, I'm over here
You can't front on the track 'cause the track is phat

Yo here I am again you'd better call the cops
Pump up your Reeboks and ya just don't stop
I got mad styles you better sit and watch
I can kick it like he-he then I'll grab my crotch
Yo it's 1993 I mean nineteem-ninety-Shaq
Whatever year it is the Shaq will never slack
Giving mad shouts to my homeys up in New Or'
On and off the court you know I do her

Peace to that dog and peace to this dog
Here comes the Phife Dawg aka the top dog
World's greatest 5-footer as if you didn't know
Rhymes are like the Lord's lessons they constantly flow
Mc's need to step on you see it is to ???
As long as the mic's on that's when I get my run on
Battle anybody come bring your whole crew
You want the short black eskimo come see me in my igloo
Nasty like vomit couldn't clean it with comet
Psycho like the Lords crazy like Onyx
Forget the he's and she's and concentrate just on the flow
Phife Dawg sigining off enjoy the rest of the show

Yo Shaq, where ya at?

I want to dedicated this song to Philip Arthur Harrison
Word up
cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man
So as far as I'm concerned, he's my father cause my biological didn't bother

[Verse 1]
Biological father, left me in the cold, when a few months old
Aa father's child was greater than gold but I guess not
You brought me into the world but your not my dad
Mess around with those drugs makes my moms mad
So we left you with no remorsal pity
Took the first bus from York to Jersey City
Women and child alone now that's pressure
Moms got to go to work, drop me off by Obesa
Momma, Aunt DeDe, whoever
Aunt Falma, Uncle Roy we stuck together
A year went by and I could walk y'all
Moms got that good ol job at city hall
She probably didn't trust men anymore
Until Philip Harrison walk though the door
Went out a few times but what about Shaquille
Moms offered him a million dollar package deal
She said you want me you gotta take my son
or else its like a hot dog but without the bun
Guess what he accepted, responsibility he never left it
He kept it, he kept it
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
cause my biological didn't bother

[chorus] He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father 
cause my biological didn't bother. (4x)

[Verse 2]
January 5th Phil made a promise (what's that)
He joined the army we moved to fort mamth
He disciplined me right from the get go
Age 2 bottle and my Mom shaquille let go
Actin spoiled, rotten, trippin
Got a butt whippin because I didn't listen
Back then you see privates made no bucks
Had to get another job driven trucks
Workin hard as hell didn't satisfy him
Had to another job working at the gym
He wasn't ""Gone with the Wind"" like Clark Gable
Work all them jobs to put food on the table
Phil's my father, daddy and that's the scoop
Can I go to the gym with you and shoot some hoops
Come on he put me under his wing
Was the ball boy for his little Arthur team
Sometimes he even made me mad
But it didn't matter cause I still wanted to be like dad
but a little bit better
Encouraged me to stay in school and to get then good letters
I wasn't a brainiac but I tried hard
Got to watch the Knicks play if I had a good report card
All types, all sorts
Disobeyed my dad and I couldn't play sports
I learned to dribble from right to left
I couldn't do a damn thang with all them F's
Age 15 father and son confrontation that's nothin
but father and son trials and tribulation
Back then I could under stand but I'm glad you did it
cause now I'm a man
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
cause my biological didn't bother

(chorus)
[Verse 3]
Look at me now successful for sure
Phil raised me well, to be an entrepreneur
and if your making big dope be materialistic
cause you'll end up another statistic
everything's going well following my dreams
I dunked on Patrick Ewing
I won the ring like hakeem
Uh oh what do you know
Biological ones on the Ricky Lake show
What does he want, does he want money
What people do for money!!!
It's kinda funny to me
He ain't gettin no check from me (check it)
He can go on all the talk shows he want
Phil is my dad so don't even front
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
cause my biological didn't bother

So G-funk, we funk till the end of our lives
With respect for our mamas Miss Dee is right

I'm glad I found that significant other
She remind me of my mother 'cause yo there ain't no other
I treat her right like father MC
'Cause I check Ralph Tresvant for ""Sensitivity""

Behind every great man is a great woman
I keep it commin baby baby I keep it comin
And you don't have to worry about a thang
'Cause living in the fast lane just ain't my thang

Peace to Lucille and Miss Ola May

I'm glad I found me a girl that's real
She reminds me of my number one baby Lucille yea

attack the track like Shaq on a whack broad, 

coming up with the hits, and I'm coming down with the backboard, 

don't fake the funk, just make the sound's up from the trunk, 

the reason your tape didn't hit the deck is because your hits don't bump,

I mystify minds like I'm a preacher 

when I meet ya start convulsing like a seizure 

you best believe I got more tricks up my shirt sleeve 

expidisouly I get loose like hair weave 

which mc out there want to come test me 

put footprints in your chest like Kareem did me 

I run rhymes like drunk drivers on stop signs 

I change my name to Deon cause I'm mutha freaking prime time 



Chorus 



Verse 3: Peter Gunz 



out the alleys of the ghetto there echos a voice sweeter 

the melon a felon under the first name Peter 

looking out the hour glass what do I see 

Guliani with tacky at me with death penalty 

I dodge the cops bob and weave to the left 

young gifted and black but yet I'm still marked for death 

my breath and oxygen is limited 

they did me in with it 

they took my lungs my heart they kept my brain and headed with it 

I live alive to see my seed breath airs 

in and exhale but please breath clean air 

runnin 'round killin people with sex you flex 

spread in the bed ask me dread who's next

Shaquille O'Neal,"Yo yo
This jam right here dedicated to all the little bad knuckleheads runnin'
Around
Gettin' in trouble
Just follow your dreams and you'll be aight

[Chorus: Peter Gunz]
Yo it was all a dream
Deprising and uprising my schemes
But surprising realzing that
Yo it was all a dream
I kept my head above the water for cream
But now I'm turnin' all heads when I step on the scene
(yesterday it was just a dream
 never thought this could ever happen to me)
It was all a dream
(how a change came around in my life)

[Verse 1: Shaq]
I went back and forth from ??? to chilltown JC
At first it's just me and mommy
Then Phil came along, he bought a basketball go to the park
Get your game on Shaq but have your butt back by dark
I was acting like the doc, my game was the joint
Dribbilin' between my legs like Norm Nixon at the point
Materalism kept them other kids biz'm
While I was selling my game they was sellin' izm
Words by Phil be a leader not a follwa
Don't let the masses of technolgy swallow ya
La-d da-d we all likes to party
I'm followin' my dreams I'm gonna be somebody

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Shaq]
Now check it, commodores was my favorite joint
Til I heard Planet Rock on the bop, that jam's on point
I used to rhyme in the mirrior, like I was down with UTFO
Doug E. Fresh singin' a show
For a big kid I had crazy rhythm
Size 13 suede crews with thick shoe strings in 'em
I was the baddest popa, baddest rhyme dropper
Bustin' more mills than Superman to helicopters
I had the name buckle kids used to jock
Public Enemy came out, I had the clock
My favorite jam was by Big Daddy ain't no half steppa
My mic sounds nice check 1-2 by Salt N' Pepa
Heavy D, Rakim, Eric be	, Ricky D
Scott LaRock and BDP
I never knew 'em but I used to look up to 'em
Battles in the park in the dark I ran through 'em

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Shaq]
Somebody wake me up this can't be real
Lookin' in the paper, Shaq's about to make a hundred mil
Somebody smack me, it's gotta be fake
20,000 square foot crib on the back of a lake
Five movie deal with Disney
Damn I'm getting busy like Dizzy Calepsi
20 mil check from Pepsi
Let's see, red benz and black porsche
??? room suburban with roof-top hole and of course
Boat with my name on the side so I can ride on the water
With my wife and my baby daughter
I oughta write a book so why'all can see
How easy it is to be who the hell you want to be
This is a message from Shaq, react bring it on back
Follow your dreams and it's like that

Take it from the Don
Where I'm from the Man of Steel is made of Teflon
Keep yo' vest on
Hit me with yo' best one baby
& watch me mack you
Comin' through with hard *** & Shaq-Fu
Never up in Spago's when we knock hoes
Head her off with some Reeboks and cagos
Westside rollin' even if the car's stolen
Even if my eyes shut & jaw swollen
That's how it's goin' down
You always smile when I frown
'cause you want the crown
You fuckin' clown
I keep it real no more beef with Cypress Hill
Now we super friends makin' super ends

It's a fact many know that Shaq made of mils
But did you know that Shaq made of Steel

Big **** just like a bus full of Japanese tourists
Or it's styles that flow like Hudson River debris
Ship quarter keys of them Shaq CD's Roo roo

Consider the picture deliver the scripture still hit ya
If the shoe fits ya wear it
You'll inherit the culture
Let me break down the whole structure
East Coast West Coast universal flava
Pullin' together with my neighbor no playa haters
Just real no outrageous fantasies
Jump out the pages from the book of MC's
& nothin' can penetrate the Steel mind state
Like Shaq when he go back & dominate

Squeeze pale **** cause disaster

Yo my mind state all I want is platinum plates 
Everything that my eyes see who can deny me 
Make more in a day that's a lot of why'all touch 
Why'all know the fake ballers' cause they always talk too much 
Now, Question. How why'all gonna be hating on me? 
Criticizing, debating on me 
When I got you're baby mama waitin on me 
While you down on one knee 
I'm doin things that your rhymes can't see 
The world is mine cause now I ain't easy to trust 
Skills to much bet you get brushed and bust 
Got thugs with ice mugs that handle heat for me 
Legal teams that handle things for me like what 
Mad at the players be mad at the game

Don't be mad cause they screaming my name

(Shaquille O' Neal) 
I know a kid with four albums but don't get know respect 
No matter what he do his life's always a test 
He got stress on his chest and the world on his back 
They say he's greedy he do too much he raps and acts 
Then try to play ball and dominate the pros 
I don't know why why'all mad he's just followin those 
Who paved the way, cream and Dr. Jay 
When they did a movie girl didn't have nothing to say 
So can he play, can he claim the world is his? 
Can he do the right thing instead and set example for kids? 
Reach for the sky he's tryin to hold glitramatis 
Handle your biz Shaq know what time it is like what 
Be mad at the players be mad at the game 
(Like what baby) 
Don't be mad cause they screaming my name

Before I burst let me let why'all know 
You got a personal with Shaq better let it go 
Don't why'all see it's not a game when you hittin dough 
My man makes it kinda easy just to hit and go 
Can't why'all see that I can't stand a lazy whirl? 
The same way I can't stand a shady girl

Cause all I want to see is sandals and swim suits 
And get the lotion out cause the sun out

Lookin at the Lexus it's about that time to call my baby girl
Got to protect what's mine the ladies are squallin by the fox
My player never chops take off your shoes and socks

The pool's heated you want to be conceited ? beat it!

Throw my grub down gettin rubbed down 
There's no time for attitude my days shatter proof
Just push up your hands at the pool jam boogie with me

And fixin plates the ladies too fly to swim 
And Kenny's on the air with the poolside basketball rim 
While dirt belly flapper swam guy

I want to dedicated this song to Philip Arthur Harrison
Word up
'Cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man
So as far as I'm concerned, he's my father cause my biological
Didn't bother

Biological father, left me in the cold, when a few months old
Aa father's child was greater than gold but I guess not
You brought me into the world but your not my dad
Mess around with those drugs makes my moms mad

So we left you with no remorsal pity
Took the first bus from York to Jersey City
Women and child alone now that's pressure
Moms got to go to work, drop me off by Obesa

Momma, Aunt DeDe, whoever
Aunt Falma, Uncle Roy we stuck together
A year went by and I could walk y'all
Moms got that good ol job at city hall

She probably didn't trust men anymore
Until Philip Harrison walk though the door
Went out a few times but what about Shaquille
Moms offered him a million dollar package deal

She said you want me you gotta take my son
Or else its like a hot dog but without the bun
Guess what he accepted, responsibility he never left it
He kept it, he kept it

He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
'Cause my biological didn't bother

[Chorus: x4] 
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father 
'Cause my biological didn't bother. (4x)

January 5th Phil made a promise (what's that)
He joined the army we moved to fort mamth
He disciplined me right from the get go
Age 2 bottle and my Mom shaquille let go

Actin spoiled, rotten, trippin
Got a butt whippin because I didn't listen
Back then you see privates made no bucks
Had to get another job driven trucks
Workin hard as hell didn't satisfy him

Had to another job working at the gym
He wasn't 'Gone with the Wind' like Clark Gable
Work all them jobs to put food on the table
Phil's my father, daddy and that's the scoop

Can I go to the gym with you and shoot some hoops
Come on he put me under his wing
Was the ball boy for his little Arthur team
Sometimes he even made me mad

But it didn't matter cause I still wanted to be like dad
But a little bit better
Encouraged me to stay in school and to get then good letters
I wasn't a brainiac but I tried hard

Got to watch the Knicks play if I had a good report card
All types, all sorts
Disobeyed my dad and I couldn't play sports
I learned to dribble from right to left

I couldn't do a damn thang with all them F's
Age 15 father and son confrontation that's nothin
But father and son trials and tribulation
Back then I could under stand but I'm glad you did it

'Cause now I'm a man
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

[Chorus]

Look at me now successful for sure
Phil raised me well, to be an entrepreneur
And if your making big dope be materialistic
'Cause you'll end up another statistic

Everything's going well following my dreams
I dunked on Patrick Ewing
I won the ring like hakeem
Uh oh what do you know

Biological ones on the Ricky Lake show
What does he want, does he want money
What people do for money!!!
It's kinda funny to me

He ain't gettin no check from me (check it)
He can go on all the talk shows he want
Phil is my dad so don't even front
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
'Cause my biological didn't bother

Felt your touch and it always seems
You love me

Where are you? When will we meet?
Take my unfinished life and make it complete
Just like the Moonraker knows his dream will come true someday

Seven years down in the hole, they said
""Your watch, your glasses, and your wedding ring
You won't need them anymore""

I felt abandoned--I felt cast aside
So where is God who never sleeps?
I heard a voice say, ""Why do you cry?""
Then I found my inner peace

Ninoy, you were my first love
But you said I was too tall
The heart gets stronger and grows colder
For the Rose of Tacloban

I begged to God, could he forgive me now
And take back all those things I said?
This moment was a gift from above
Maybe it's some kind of test

You used to walk me to my home?
Who set you free? Who built this hospital?
You think I hate you, but you're wrong

For seven years I wore this crucifix
A necklace that watched over me
Face to face with mortality
I let go of all my fears

Now my husband he might hate you
But you know I saved your life
Ninoy, don't be a hero
I beg you, don't get on that flight

All it takes it Cristal juice to get in they pants, man

and my Roc-a-wear clothes

Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore - Then
Suddenly, I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore.

It was blue as ink
Or at least I think
I remember sky

I remember snow
Soft as feathers
Sharp as thumb tacks
Coming down like lint
And it made you squint
When the wind would blow

And ice like vinyl
On the streets
Cold as silver
White as sheets
Rain like strings
And changing things
Like leaves

I remember leaves
Green as spearmint
Crisp as paper
I remember trees
Bare as coat racks
Spread like broken umbrellas

And parks and bridges
Ponds and zoos
Ruddy faces
Muddy shoes
And light and noise and
Bees and boys
And days

I remember days
Or at least I try
But as years go by
They're a sort of haze
And the bluest ink
Isn't really sky

I would gladly die
For a day of sky",I Remember Sarah,2001
Shari Zippert,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

I'm always tellin' my moms and pops not to worry to much
They always tellin' me to slow down and not to party to much
Sometimes I be like hey, now why ya'll folks buggin?
I'm makin a decent livin' I ain't slangin' or thuggin'
At first I didn't understannd though I was man enough
Frontin' like I'm to tough to be sharing love
Used to take em for granted, including my two little brothers
Treat my home like a hotel and ignoring my mother
But now I realised that I can't live without em
Take away my money, honeys aiyo even the stardom
But can never take away my love for my blood (whut)
My big brother Farez doin' sit ups to loose his gut
Iman wanna emcee and spin records at the same time
While Ash wana be a rockstar, you doin fine
Keep ya head up all the time know I'm feelin for you
And always keep it real whatever ya'll do...ONE LOVE

You are my sunshine, you are my rainbow
After the rain has gone

Verse 2 (Malique)
I spread love to all my peeps that help me make it happen
Ain't talkin' 'bout the fools I knew after I started rappin'
I'm talkin''bout the folks from back then when I was wack
Friends and fam that kept me steady laugh when I was steady slackin'
Y'all usta call me a different name, and yo it's still the same
Ain't nothing changed, y'all never took advantage of my fame
I got y'all free tickets to shows, y'all never asked for it
But still y'all pay and stand in backrows and see me mash for it
Mom and dad y'all still cuttin' those paper interviews
Don't see you daily but trust me daily I think of you
I know I promised to be a lawyer in a court suin'
I'm sorry now but thanks for bein' proud of what I'm doin'
It's impossible to spit love in 16 bars
So imma cut this short just to let you know who you are
Mom and dad, bro, sis and Tim, just know I love you
Wish y'all were here so I could just breakdown while I hug you, ONE.

I guess I played myself

You will leave me someday, someday

I washed your dirty drawers
I made sure the house stayed clean
But you didn't say thanks, not to me

I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""

And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls""

Give me some of that sweeta, sweeta
Like the way your cup runneth over
Sure for sure don't want water, water
Bring your love lover, bring your love lover
Give me some of that sweeta, sweeta
Like the way your cup runneth over
Sure for sure don't want water, water
Bring your love lover, bring your love lover

Verse 1:
Let me captivate you, listen to my tune
Power of the rhythm intoxicate you
Feeling vibration, no more restriction
Baby love you know I give you direction
Give into the moment, try a new assortment
Even if you feel a little distorted
Show me your motion, cause a commotion
Baby let me be your final solution

Verse 2:
Yeah you love to love me, everything about me
Don't hold it back, now is time to act
Burning with desire, body heat on fire
Not hot enough, want it hotter
Just like a volcano, energy overflow
I can?t explain, I don't know you name
Just a perfect stranger put me under pressure
The fire burn, burning just the same

Bridge:
Dark chocolate, hyperactive state
I?ll give you more than you could take
Bold flavor overwhelming you
Careful I?m natural sugar

Sharon,"I've just heard a melody
That is always haunting me
Funny little strain 
Running thru my brain
It's as sweet as can be
It has such a pleading way
Tho' it's with me night and day
When I hear someone playing
I walk right up and say
 
Please play for me 
That sweet melody
Called doodle doo-doo
Doodle doo-doo
I like the rest
But what I like best
I doodle doo-doo
Doodle doo-doo
Simplest thing
There's nothing much to it
Don't have to sing
Just doodle doo-doo it
I love it so  
Wherever I go  
I doodle-doo doo die doo doo
 
I've heard all the melodies
From the blues to rhapsodies
They all come and go 
But there's one I know 
That'll linger and tease
I've found all the blues a pest
Rhapsodies to me a jest
So if you want to please me
Just take this one request
 
Please play for me 
That sweet melody
Called doodle doo-doo
Doodle doo-doo
I like the rest 
But what I like best
I doodle doo-doo
Doodle doo-doo
Simplest thing
There's nothing much to it
Don't have to sing 
Just Doodle doo-doo it

Sharon Clark,"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it queer?

in my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Where's the face that used to cheer me up?
Boy, it makes me wonder...

Why does my heart just keep on beating?
Why do my arms just keep on reaching
Someone who's no longer there?

What can I say besides I'm sorry?
What can I say to change your mind?

Here within this terminal where the buses arrive 
I was a commuter on the 804 
Work for a computer on the 19th floor and

You came down the aisle of the bus and you sat by my side 
Shoulder up to shoulder we share that 9 o clock ride 
Oh, my heart was screaming as you left your seat 
Followin' your movements I was at your feet and

Oh, down into the terminal both of us smiled 
So we entered the terminal just as you smiled 
Won't you leave off work for today?you asked of me then 
So I phoned-in-sick on the way to the home of a friend 
We were all alone from to A.M. till 3 
Really thought the fire had gone out of me but

You woke the sleep of my life from gray into red 
Made the weary wonder of Wall Street rise from the dead 

Could bare held his body my entire life 
But I had to get home to the kids and my life and 

So I left for the terminal where I began 
Baby, no, I wouldn't have left if Id been half a man 

So here I am this morning where love had asked for the dance 
Here within this terminal where I passed on a chance 
Lord, I'll never find him though I've truly tried 
Probably he's found another bus to ride and 

I am now about to begin the last of my days 
I'm within what others would call a terminal phase 
I myself can only say it's living dead 
Riding to the office with a song in my head that goes

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000

",Tell Me,2008
Sharon Jones,"Well now it takes more than a robin
To make the winter go

And it takes two lips for fire
To melt away the snow
Well it takes two hearts a cookin'
To make a fire grow
And baby you've got what it takes
Now listen honey

Alright baby

You know it takes
A lot of kissin'
To make a romance sweep
Oh it takes a lot of lovin'
To make my life complete

Oh, well it takes somebody special
To knock me off my feet
And baby, you've got what it takes
Hmm

I said,
Oh,
Uh huh,
Oh,
Oh you've got just what it takes
Because it takes more
Than an effort, to stay away from you
And it takes more than a lifetime
To prove that I'll be true
Yeah,
But it takes somebody special
To make me say I do
And baby, you've got what it takes

Ah ha,
Oh,
Ah ha,
Oh,
Oh you've got just what it takes
Oh, because it takes a lot of effort
To stay away from you
And it takes more than a lifetime
To prove that I'll be true
Well it takes somebody special
To make me say I do
And baby, you've got what it takes
Come on say that again honey
And baby, you've got what it takes
One more time, come on
And baby, you've got what it takes
You got it, you got it
Mm hmm, you know you've got what it takes
You've got it, you got it
Baby don't you know you've got what it takes
You got it, you got it",Baby (You've Got What It Takes) [Zoned Out Extended],2009
