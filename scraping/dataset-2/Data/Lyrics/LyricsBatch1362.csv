Buddy Holly & the Crickets,"Hearts that are broken and love that's untrue
These go with learning the game
When you love her and she doesn't love you
You're only learning the game
When she says that you're the only one she'll ever love
Then you find that you are not the one she's thinking of
Feeling so sad and you're all alone and blue
That's when you're learning the game",Learning the Game,2004
Buddy Holly & the Crickets,"Hey hey look at me and tell me 
What's gonna happen to you 
When you've broken too many people's hearts 
And can't find anyone new 

Say say look at me and tell me 
About that twinkle in your eye 
Is the twinkle in your eye meant for me 
Or meant for some other guy 

Look at me from now on 
Know the love we share 
Look at me from now on 
Let me know you care 

Hey hey look at me and tell me

When you've spoken sweet words of love to me 
And I want to marry you",Look at Me,2004
Buddy Holly & the Crickets,"Love - love is strange
Lot of people take it for a game
Once you get it - you're in an awful fix
After you've had it - you never want to quit

Many people don't understand, no no
They think lovin', yeah yeah - is money in the hand
Your sweet lovin' - is better than a kiss, yeah yeah
When you leave me - sweet kisses I miss",Love Is Strange,2004
Buddy Holly & the Crickets,"Love can make a fool of you 
You do anything it wants you to 
Love can make you feel so good when it goes like you think it should 
Or it can make you cry at night when your baby donâ??t treat you right 

When youâ??re feeling sad and blue 
You know loveâ??s made a fool of you 

You know love makes fools of men 
But you donâ??t care, youâ??re gonna try again 

Time goes by, itâ??s a-passinâ?? fast you think true love has come at last 
But by and by youâ??re gonna find crazy love has made you blind 

When youâ??re feeling sad and blue 
You know loveâ??s made a fool of you",Love's Made a Fool of You,2004
Buddy Holly & the Crickets,"No one looked as I walked by
Just an invitation would have been just fine
Said no to him again and again
First, he took my heart, then he ran

No one knows how I feel
What I say unless you read between my lines
One man walked away from me
First, he took my hand, take me home

Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
It's all right, it's all right
To be standing in a line
Standing in a line
I would cry

Do not turn away, my friend
Like a willow I can bend
No man calls my name
No man came

So I walked on down away from you
Maybe your attention was more
Than you could do
One man did not call
He asked me for my love
And that was all

Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
It's all right, it's all right
To be standing in a line
Standing in a line
Standing in a line

So I walked on down the line
Away from you
Maybe your attention was more
Than I could do
One man did not call
Well, he asked me for my love
That was all",Midnight Shift,2009
Buddy Holly & the Crickets,"Iâ??m just sittinâ?? here reminiscing 
Wondering who youâ??ve been kissinâ?? 
Baby - wo oh baby 
Iâ??ve been wondering all around 
There must be a new guy in town 
You donâ??t love me anymore 
Iâ??ll get over you baby 
Although my heartâ??s still sore 
Well, you know my heartâ??s still sore 

When I think of all the lies you told 
To that young man my heart you sold 
Youâ??re a cheater and a mean mistreater 
When I think of all the fun we had 
Kinda makes me feel so sad 
Iâ??m lonely - for your love 
And the longest day I live 
Itâ??s only you that Iâ??ll be thinking of 
You know Iâ??m thinkinâ?? of 
Well, itâ??s you Iâ??m thinking of",Reminiscing,2004
Buddy Holly & the Crickets,"Well get out from that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Get out from that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Well roll my breakfast 'cause I'm a hungry man

when you wear those dresses the sun comes shinin' through
When you wear those dresses the sun comes shinin' through
I can't believe my eyes, all of this belongs to you

I said shake, rattle and roll
Shake, rattle and roll
Shake, rattle and roll
Shake, rattle and roll
Well you never do nothin' to save your doggone soul

way over the hill and wigged out underneath
Way over the hill and wigged out underneath
You make me roll my eyes baby make me grit my teeth

I'm like a one-eyed cat peepin' in a sea-food store
I'm like a one-eyed cat peepin' in a sea-food store
I can look at you tell you don't love me no more

Think it over in your pretty little head 
Are you sure that I'm not the one

Think it over but don't be slow

Go by twos through life's mysteries

Well, I won't lie: I pulled that car right over,
An' I sat there on the shoulder tryin' to dry my misty eyes.
An' I whispered: ""Lord, I want to thank you for my children.

With money that he saved from the sweat of his brow
He'd get 'em out of there, someday, somehow

Bet it all on a better life in America

Eleven passports, no turnin' back
Decidin' what they should and shouldn't pack

And the doctor hung a sheet on their front door
For two long weeks they were quarantined
Stranded with nothin' but a shattered dream

Buddy Jewell,"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me 
And then
Spin me around 'till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me 
And I knew for sure 
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk
Another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love 
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother 
Would disagree
To get my way I would run 
From her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
yeah yeah
Then finally make me do 
Just what my mama said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he 
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step 
One final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
Cause I'd love love love to 
Dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how mama would cry for him
I'd pray for her even more than me
I'd pray for her even more than me

I know I'm praying for much to much
But could you send her 
The only man she loved
I know you don't do it usually
But Dear Lord
She's dying to dance with my father again

Every night I fall asleep
And this is all I ever dream",Dance With My Father,2005
Buddy Jewell,"The moment was custom-made to order:
I was ridin' with my daughter on our way back from Monroe.
An' like children do, she started playin' twenty questions,
But I never could've guessed one would touch me to my soul.
She said: ""Daddy, when we get to Heaven, can I taste the Milky Way?
""Are we goin' there to visit, or are we goin' there to stay?
""Am I gonna see my Grandpa? Can I have a pair of wings?
""An' do you think that God could use another Angel,
""To help pour out the rain?""
Well, I won't lie: I pulled that car right over,
An' I sat there on the shoulder tryin' to dry my misty eyes.
An' I whispered: ""Lord, I want to thank you for my children.
""'Cause your innocence that fills them often takes me by surprise.""
Like: ""Daddy, when we get to Heaven, can I taste the Milky Way?
""Are we goin' there to visit, or are we goin' there to stay?
""Am I gonna see my Grandpa? Can I have a pair of wings?
""An' do you think that God could use another Angel,
""To help pour out the rain?""
Well, I thought about it later on,
An' a smile came to my face.
An' when I tucked her in to bed,
I got down on my knees an' prayed.
Lord, when I get to Heaven, can I taste the Milky Way?
""I don't want to come to visit 'cause I'm comin' home to stay?
""An' I can't wait to see my family and meet Jesus face to face.
""An' do you think, Lord, you could use just one more Angel,
""To help pour out the rain?""

How can you tell the river from the rain

No matter what direction I go runnin' to
It always comes back to you

In the latest book I'm readin' in the crisp October air
In a face I see in traffic in some yet unwhispered prayer
You are everything and everyone and everywhere I go
Hangin' like a mornin' mist that's burnin' off too slow
You are burnin' off too slow

How can you tell the river from the rain

Used to be a one-lane gravel road?
Back when Johnny Cash was just somebody
Daddy went to school with years ago
When the cottonwoods reached to the sky
An' honeysuckle vine grew all around
My eyes well up with memories
Every time I think about this little ol' town

'Cause I know there's bigger cities
Full of all the sights and sounds
Where people live in fear an' lock their doors
Long before the sun goes down
The drive-in picture show's been closed for years
No superstores or midi-malls
But everyday I thank the Lord he made Dyess, Arkansas

I used to laugh at all the stories
Daddy'd tell me 'bout the mischief he'd get in
Dream of penny-candy an' nickel soda-pops
Lord, what a dollar'd buy back then
When livin' life was picture perfect
Like a Norman Rockwell paintin' of the South
Lord, I'd give almost anything
To hear my Daddy tell the stories now

He'd say, ""I know there's bigger cities
Full of all the sights and sounds
Where people live in fear an' lock their doors
Long before the sun goes down

Yes, I know there's bigger cities
But there ain't no better town

Couldn't stand to be apart too long or too much
Now's a different situation, funny how love can start to fade
How fast it goes from boom to bust

We'd part as friends, but it ain't up to me
You told me to go where it don't snow
Well, if that's how it's gonna be

All I need's a blacktop road

The moon an' stars will keep me company till the dawn
An' when the sun comes up we'll both be glad I'm gone

So you can keep your Dear John letter if it's all the same to you
I've read the writin' on the wall, we're through
Your own words of consolation, your self-righteous indignation
Sound more like lies to tell the truth

Feels good, I guess
To get it off my chest before I'm up an' leave
So you can save your sermon for someone else
Instead of wastin' it on me

Buddy Jewell,"I stood out on the trestle waitin' for the whistle
The 409 was right on time again
Lord, I'd a-got a lickin' if they caught me playin' chicken
But I was quite the practiced liar way back then

I saw the smoke above the treetops
And when the train came into view
I stood still as a statue, but I knew what to do
When I could read the numbers on the front

I'd run like a gypsy, like the hounds of hell'd get me
Like a rabbit on the wrong end of a gun
I'd run like the lightning cuttin' 'cross the Kansas skyline
Like the tears that momma cried for her lost son
I'd run, yeah, I'd run

I got older but no smarter an' cheatin' fate got harder
But I could still out wit the Devil and his friends
Went through whiskey, cards an' women, takin' more than I was givin'
Throwin' love and caution to wind

Every time I'd let some beauty get a little too close to me
She'd hang around just long enough to find herself the key
When I could feel the lock on my heart come undone

I'd run like a gypsy, like the hounds of hell'd get me
Like a rabbit on the wrong end of a gun
I'd run like the lightning cuttin' 'cross the Kansas skyline
Like the tears that momma cried for her lost son
I'd run, yeah, I'd run

There's broken hearts and broken bottles
Dreams all gone to dust
Girls gone home to momma and cars all gone to rust
If I could go back and undo the hurt I'd done

I'd run like a gypsy, like the hounds of hell'd get me
Like the rabbit on the wrong end of a gun

The only way I can describe it
That feelin' when I'm feelin' all alone

Sometimes, it gets so hard to find that silver linin'
When the clouds come rollin' in
A sky of blue turns to gray and there's no shelter from the rain
And it feels as though the storm will never end

That's when there's nothin' like a mother's arms
To break the fall and heal the scars
In those times when I feel lost and all alone
I wanna run away, run away home

Long enough to get my feet back on the ground
Where I can rest and catch my breath and lay my burdens down
Back where no one knows me except those few who love me only
For who I was, not what I am, where I can be myself again

Sometimes I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders
And it brings me to my knees
Sometimes, I feel as though the things I know I can't control

Addin' up all my mistake you know how it is
An' I was beatin' up myself up real good
Over all those shoulda coulds but never dids

An' I could lose myself in myself pity
But I done that an' that ain't pretty
An' somewhere in this mess I've made
Is my philosophy

That if you don't jump every chance you get
Roll a dice an' run some risks
If you don't fall, then how you ever gonna fly?
An' if you don't break an' you don't bruise
If you don't look back an' laugh at one or two
Wrong moves in your life
Yeah, you ain't doin' it right

I've been flush an' flat broke
Made some lousy bets, but that's okay, yeah that's all right
'Cause never gamblin', never losin'
Is a sorry substitution for livin' life

Yeah, I've got scars that I'm proud of
I've been down but I got up
An' the only thing I know about love is
There ain't no guarantees

So if you don't jump every chance you get
Roll a dice an' run some risks
If you don't fall, then how you ever gonna fly?
An' if you don't break an' you don't bruise
If you don't look back an' laugh at one or two
Wrong moves in your life
Yeah, you ain't doin' it right

So go ahead an' put the bow to the fiddle
Pick you a spot an' jump in the middle
Love just a little
Then love just a little more

If you don't jump every chance you get
Roll a dice an' run some risks
If you don't fall, then how you ever gonna fly?
And if you don't break an' you don't bruise
And if you don't look back an' laugh at one or two

Buddy Johnson & His Orchestra,"When you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?

Buddy Judge,"Finals blew, I barely knew
My graduation speech
And with college out of reach
If I can't find a job it's down to dad
And Myrtle Beach

So, I'm bailing this town-or
Tearing it down-or
Probably more like
Hanging around,
Hanging around

Everyone I know is acting weird
Or way too cool
They hang out by the pool
So I just read a lot and ride my bike
Around the school

'Cause I'm bailing this town-or
Tearing it down-or
Probably more like
Hanging around,
Hanging around

And all that I need now
Is someone with the brains
And the know-how
To tell me what I want,
Anyhow

Twelfth of June, a gibbous moon
Was this the longest day? 
I'll walk down to the bay
And jump off of the dock and watch
The summer waste away

Then, I'm bailing this town-or
Tearing it down-or
Probably more like
Hanging around
Hanging around
Just hanging around

I hope I never waken
It's more than I could bear
To find that I'm forsaken

If you're a fantasy
Then I'm content to be
In love with lovely you
And pray my dream comes true

I long to kiss you
But I would not dare
I'm so afraid that
You may vanish in the air

So darling
If our romance would break up
I hope I never wake up
If you are but a dream

I long to kiss you
But I would not dare
I'm so afraid that
You may vanish in the air

I hope I never wake up

That pit-apats through my brain;
So darn persistent,
The day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane.

Comes in the morning
Without any warning,
And hangs around me all day.
I'll have to sneak up to it
Someday, and speak up to it.
I hope it listens when I say

Fascinating Rhythm,
You've got me on the go!
Fascinating Rhythm, 
I'm all a-quiver.

What a mess you're making!
The neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like a flivver.
Each morning I get up with the sun 
Start a-hopping,
Never stopping 
O find at night no work has been done.

I know that
Once it didn't matter 
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy.
Won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off 
And make it snappy!

Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be!

Oh, won't you stop picking on me?",Fascinating Rhythm,2000
Buddy Lewis,"Sitting at a fancy table, in a ritzy restaurant,
He was staring at his coffee cup,
Trying to get his courage up.
The talk was small when they talked at all,
They both knew what they wanted,
There was no need to talk about it,
They were old enough to talk it out, and still keep it loose.

Buddy Merrill,"When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

You never knew that you could be
Enchanted by a melody
The years will never drive it out
You don't know why
It's something you can't live without
You hear it in the twilight hush
And in the morning traffic rush
A song that's always new
In your heart a part of you
Oh, shines so brightly when you hear the third man theme

When a zither starts to play
You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay

Of a well remembered dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind

Buddy Merrill,"There's a sunny little funny little melody
That was started by a native down in Waikiki
He would gather a crowd down beside the sea
And they'd play his gay Hawaiian chant
Soon the other little natives started singin' it
And the hula hula maidens started swingin' it
Like a tropical storm that's the way it hit
Funny little gay Hawaiian Chant
Ow way tah tualan Me big bad fightin' man
Tho it started on an island down Hawaii way
It's as popular in Tennessee or Ioway
If you wander into any cabaret
You will hear this gay Hawaiian Chant",Hawaiian War Chant,1989
Buddy Merrill,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you",Snowbird,1997
Buddy Merrill,"Somewhere, my love there will be songs to sing
Although the snow covers the hope of spring
Somewhere a hill blossoms in green and gold
And there are dreams all that your heart can hold

Someday we'll meet again my love
Someday whenever the spring breaks through

You'll come to me out of the long ago
Warm as the wind, soft as the kiss of snow
Lara my own, think of me now and then
God speed my love till you are mine again

Buddy Merrill,"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 
In the windmills of your mind!",Windmills of Your Mind,1998

So back to my room I go with a gloom

You'll see sights you don't want to see
I saw one about a year ago
When my wife walked out on me
I didn't care so  much about the junk she took

Right now I'd give anything

If I could see my little girl dance
See I've always  been a traveling man
I still do get around
And it's true I knew a  girl or two
When I was out of town
But they all add up to nothing
In this world of cheap romance

And I'd trade them all for one short hour
Watching  Amy dance
She'd run round  and round in circles and
Clap her little hands
It's a memory that  keeps haunting me
Wish I could see my Amy dance
Wish I could my little girl dance

My brother is  far away
And  the way I thought it would all turn out
And where I am today

Lord I know I don't deserve no favors
Please grant me one more chance
Just to spend an hour or two  watching Amy dance    
She'd run round  and round in circles and
Clap her little hands

They called for blood and  wanted  more
They picked me up off of the floor
My head  was spinning

I staggered round
I couldn't  stand for falling down
The lights were dimmed I heard them say
You can't make it anyway
I was game  I climbed back in 
I tried to  win her back again
In the first round she hurt me bad
In the second round I couldn't handle that
In the third  round I almost died
In the forth round I saw that look in her eyes 
I knew right then how it would be
She turned and  walked away from me
I shouted fair and square there ain't no catch
She's the heartache champion  of the love match

They held their breath  whispered low
Waiting for that final blow
The lights were dimmed I hear them say
You can't make it anyway

In the first round  she broke my heart
In the second round  she tore it  apart
In the third round  I was  on the ropes
In the forth round I didn't have a hope

Buddy Miller,"He said ""Oh my love. Oh my Antonia 
You with the dark eyes and palest of skin 
Tonight I am going from Santa Maria 
Wait for me till I'm in your arms once again""

She held me, she kissed me, begged me not to leave her 
To cross on 1he mountain my fortune to win 
But a letter now tells me she died of a fever 
I'll never see her in this world again

You are my sorrow, you are my splendor 
You are my shelter through storm and through strife 
You are the one I will always remember 
All off the days of my life 

I curse the ambition that took me far from her 
For a treasure not ever so fine or so fair 
As the flash of her smile or the touch of her fingers 
The fire in her heart and the smell of her hair 

She left me a note that cried ""Do not weep for me 
Behold you are with me as sure as the stars 
That rise in the evening to shine down upon me 
Behold I am with you wherever you are"" 

I can still hear him. he calls to me only 
What once was begotten shall come to no end 
But the road is so long and the nights are so lonely 
My soul just to hold him in this world again 

You are my sorrow, you are my splendor 
You are my shelter through storm and through strife 
You are the one I will always remember

We can go out swimming in the high tide

Everybody's gone and its groovy
They went to the one about the big war 
I didn't, I'd seen it before

I guess I'm taking my chances 
Giving up the ring throwing in my gloves
I guess I'm taking my chances 
Trading in my things 
For a couple wings a little white dove

Just go on and kiss him if you want to

Buddy Miller,"O the dragons are gonna fly tonight
They're circling low and inside tonight
It's another round in the losing fight
Out along the great divide tonight

We are aging soldiers in an ancient war
Seeking out some half remembered shore
We drink our fill and still we thirst for more
Asking if there's no heaven what is this hunger for?

Our path is worn our feet are poorly shod
We lift up our prayer against the odds
And fear the silence is the voice of God 

And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah

Sorrow is constant and the joys are brief
The seasons come and bring no sweet relief
Time is a brutal but a careless thief
Who takes our lot but leaves behind the grief

It is the heart that kills us in the end
Just one more old broken bone that cannot mend
As it was now and ever shall be amen

And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah

So there'll be no guiding light for you and me
We are not sailors lost out on the sea
We were always headed toward eternity
Hoping for a glimpse of Gaililee

Like falling stars from the universe we are hurled
Down through the long loneliness of the world
Until we behold the pain become the pearl

CryinÂ´ Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah

And we cry Allelujah Allelujah
We cry Allelujah",The Pearl,2000
Buddy Miller,"Me and my best friend Lillian
And her blue tick hound dog Gideon,
Sittin on the front porch cooling in the shade
Singin every song the radio played
Waitin for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town
Me and Lillian
Just across the line and a little southeast of Meridian.

She loved her brother I remember back when
He was fixin up a '49 Indian
He told her 'Little sister, gonna ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again""
He never got farther than Vietnam,
I was standin there with her when the telegram come
For Lillian.
Now he's lyin somewhere about a million miles from Meridian.

She said there's not much hope for a red dirt girl
Somewhere out there is a great big world
That's where I'm bound
And the stars might fall on Alabama
But one of these days I'm gonna swing
My hammer down
Away from this red dirt town
I'm gonna make a joyful sound

She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush in the back of the yard,
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard
Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in
Across a red dirt line just a little south east from Meridian

She tried hard to love him but it never did take
It was just another way for the heart to break
So she dug right in.
But one thing they don't tell you about the blues
When you got em
You keep on falling cause there ain't no bottom
There ain't know end.
At least not for Lillian

Nobody knows when she started her skid,
She was only twenty seven and she had five kids.
Coulda' been the whiskey,
Coulda been the pills,
Coulda been the dream she was trying to kill.
But there won't be a mention in the news of the world
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl
Names Lillian
Who never got any farther across the line than Meridian.

Now the stars still fall on Alabama
Tonight she finally laid
That hammer down
Without a sound
In the red dirt ground",Red Dirt Girl,2000
Buddy Miller,"Well I don't need you hangin round my door
Trying to drag me back down to the shore
And I ain't gonna drink your dirty water no more

Well I got wet from my head down to my legs
And I drank dirty water down to the dregs
But I won't do it again I don't care who begs

Dirty water, now what's that for
Dirty water, I ain't drinking no more
I ain't drinking no more

You've got a lie underneath your tongue where it can't be seen
'Cause you wanna put the truth on a guillotine
But you might as well put out a fire with gasoline

Well you can serve dirty water from a golden cup
You can try to lock up the truth but the door won't shut
'Cause the truth just keeps comin' out like blood from a cut

Mmm comin' out like blood, comin' out like

Well it sparkles and shines but it's just a trick
So we wash it down with a kiss just to get a kick
Ah well that dirty water 'bout to make me sick

Dirty water, now what's that for
Dirty water, I ain't drinking no more
I ain't drinking no more

Well you could try to sweeten dirty water up with grenadine
Ah but I can still read you just like a magazine
And I ain't gonna drink no more till the water runs clean

Dirty water, now what's that for
Dirty water, I ain't drinking no more
I ain't drinking no more, I ain't drinkin'

Now baby you got the kind of love I can't afford
And I don't have a taste for what's in that glass you poured

No, I ain't gonna drink that dirty water no more
I ain't drinking that dirty water, no more, woo woo woo woo, no more",Dirty Water,2001
Buddy Miller,"When you wrote me you said you were sorry
And you'd still want me for your friend
But now your heart no longer beats for me
I guess forever has come to and end

Now it must be like I never loved you
Like your sweet kiss was never mine
I must move on and stop thinking of you
But sorrow has no sense of time

Now the sun need no longer to shine dear
And the world need no longer to spin
For your love it has run out of time dear
And forever has come to an end

Now the arms that did once used to hold you
Are empty as your promise was
What's to become of the secrets I told you
Would tears run like a river does

Now the sun needs no longer to shine dear
And the world need no longer to spin, my friend
For your love it has run out of time dear
And forever has come to an end

And tears won't keep
When the sun beats down too strong
Our love runs deep

And our love will hold up the sky
When the rain comes down too hard
It's a cord that will not untie
It's a promise the angels guard
It will always be your name
Written on my heart

You are inside my heart

Baby our love was meant to be
It's from God's hands
Even when dreams turn to memories
Our love will dance

And our love will hold up the sky
When the rain comes down too hard
It's a cord that will not untie
It's a promise the angels guard
It will always be your name
Written on my heart

You are inside my heart",Holding Up the Sky,2001
Buddy Miller,"If I cross your path again
Who knows where, who knows when
On some morning without number
On some highway without end
Don't grasp my hand and say
Fate has brought us here today
Oh, fate is only fooling with us friend

Keep your distance, keep your distance
When I feel you close to me, what can I do but fall
Keep your distance, keep your distance
For with us it must be all or none at all

It's a desperate game we play
Throw our souls, our lives away
On wounds that can't be mended
And debts that can't be paid
Well I played and I got stung
Now I'm biting back my tongue
And sweeping out the footprints where I strayed

Keep your distance, keep your distance
When I feel you close to me, what can I do but fall
Keep your distance, keep your distance
For with us it must be all or none at all

Oh, oh

Keep your distance, keep your distance

Buddy Miller,"Little darlin', love is not a crime
If it is then let me do my time
Lock my heart up, throw away the key
I'm a prisoner that don't wanna go free

Come on baby, kill me with a kiss
Come on make me, die of happiness

I know whiskey makes a man a fool
But darlin' whiskey ain't got nothing on you

Tell the doctor, he ain't got no cure
I'm a goner baby, that's for sure
Tell the lawman he ain't got no gun
That could hurt me like the way you've done

Come on baby, kill me with a kiss
Come on make me, die of happiness

Love can taste as sweet as muscat wine
But then go down more like turpentine

Songbirds to sing and I was meant to love you
Hey hey, yeah yeah, woo ooo",Little Darlin,2001
Buddy Miller,"Seventeen years, how could we know?
And thirteen years to make a flower grow
Tears that fell from your eyes
Were the one's heaven cries
For the children left to walk alone

There is a light, no one can take
There is a chain of love no one can break
In all the world there is
No love greater than this
To lay down your life for your friends

And did you feel the longing?
And did you hear a secret song?
And did you sing it out to the dark?
Did you follow the footsteps?
Did you shine a light and did
You dance with all of your heart?

And did you feel the longing?
And did you hear a secret song?
Did you sing it out to the dark?
Did you follow the footsteps?
Did you shine a light and did
You dance with all of your heart?

Shine like a star, beloved child
Upon you, the angels all have smiled
God takes you by the hand
Dance for joy little lamb
In the arms of God forever more
Dance in the arms of God forever more
Dance in the arms of God",Rachel,2001
Buddy Miller,"I got a hole in my pocket
I got a tear in my heart
I got a door I can't unlock it
I live on shadows in the dark

I hear the sound of a heartbeat
I hear a secret in the rain
It's like a kiss of a lover
It's like a stranger knows your name

I'm gonna rock on the water
And dance on the flood
I'm gonna lay down with the wind
Lay down and believe like a child
I feel the swell of the tempest
I can feel the passion of a soul
Like there's a storm comin' in
I can feel the storm going wild

And when the thunderheads starts beating like a drum
And the thunder cracks the sky in two
The wind is gonna blow and the rain is gonna come
And the river's gonna run

I wanna walk on a wire
I wanna walk an unbroken line
I wanna live when I die
And shake my soul loose from time
I wanna ride with the angels
On that invisible street
And leave my footprints in the sky
And feel the stars beneath my feet

And when the thunderheads starts beating like a drum
And the thunder cracks the sky in two
The wind is gonna blow and the rain is gonna come
And the river's gonna run

I'm gonna take the train that's gonna get me there
All the tracks behind me are burning in the air
The cure is gonna kill me but I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care

Buddy Miller,"By the banks of the river, where the willows hang down,
And the wild birds a'warble with a low moaning sound,
Down in the hollow where the water runs cold,
It was there I first listened, to the lies that you told

Now I lie on my bed and I see your sweet face
And the past I remember, time can't erase
The letter you wrote me, it was written in shame,
And I know that your conscience still echos my name

Now the nights are so lonely, Lord sorrow runs deep
But nothing is worse than these nights without sleep
I walk out alone and look at the sky,
Too empty to sing, too lonesome to cry

If the ladies were blackbirds and the ladies were thrushes,
I'd lie there for hours in the chilly cold marshes
If the ladies were squirrels with them high bushy tails,
I'd fill up my shotgun with rock salt and nails
I'd fill up my shotgun with rock salt and nails",Rock Salt and Nails,2001

Then she takes your hand
And with a kiss she lies

Up above a flame
And without wings she flies

Without tears
That's how she cries
So no one hears

She is talking
But she speaks in code
Like a broken heart replies
'Cause that's just how she cries

Without tears
That's how she cries
So no one hears, no hears

Without words she speaks
So listen to her eyes

Together they were tied to live or die as one

All you can do is pray with all your might
There's a few thousand souls no where in sight
It's hard to swing at something you can't see

Sometimes we just don't know the enemy
Can't live by fear can't live by deception
Hey I'm a man of peace with a few exceptions
I need a drink of something like water
I need a taste of love divine

Sometimes you just gotta do what you oughta
Sometimes you bring up the water when the well is dry
When the world starts shaking

And the walls are breaking down till nothing's left
Baby you're gonna need to hold onto something that is
Stronger than yourself

Baby your eyes were wet with tears
Your skin was drenched in sorrow
But you kiss was an open door

So I walked through to a new tomorrow
Honey like a blade of finest steel
Yea like an arrow straight and true
Like gold in the hottest fire

Baby that is my love my love for you
I need a drink of something like water
I need a taste of love divine

Sometimes you just gotta do what you oughta
Sometimes you bring up the water when the well is dry",Water When the Well Is Dry,2002
Buddy Miller,"Baby I got my love light on
Baby I got the beat
I got twenty dollars in my shoe
And rhythm in my feet
I got more than forty different grooves
And twice as many moves
I be a cool rocking daddy that's who
When it comes to you

Well I'm a man with a plan honey
If you got the desire
We can go stepping out
And we can set the money on fire
Just come with me on a little trip
And we can give the blues the slip
There ain't nothin' that I would not do
When it comes to you

If you push the first domino
We'll go flying like a GTO
Baby just have to let me know
Any time I'll be good to go

So let me know darlin'
If you ever wanna fall in love
I gotta tell you
It would not take
Too much of a shove
I got you under my radar
Hey I am ready when you are
Yeah I'm hooked and I'm stuck like glue
When it comes to you

If you push the first domino
We'll go flying like a GTO
Baby just have to let me know
Any time I'll be good to go, ooo ooo

You can send me out on the high wire
Without a net below me
You can stick a feather in my hat
And call it matrimony
You got the time baby, let's do the crime
And we can dance while the wedding bells chime
I see my future coming into view

When it comes to you
I see my future coming into view

'Cause there ain't no wild card ever could beat the house

The deck is stacked against you there ain't no doubt 

Love will make a ramblin man wanna stay home 
Make a family man out of a rolling stone

And just be standing still
He can close his heart - and believe - he is strong

You were left - with a broken wing
The one - love left behind
In the arms - of the night - with nowhere to go

Standing out - out in the rain
Looking for - your way home
You walked on - on through the storm
Through fire and water - you have come

Like a storm carries a seed - away - upon the wind

It tells me (hey/boy) lay down all these worthless things
And let me give you something you can keep

Was the devil laughing
Did you wear a crown
And was the curtain torn

To hell for the key
Buried in the ground
And then did you rise up
Did you go down to hell and back for me

Can be a harder journey
Escaping from the dark side

From the other end of a telescope
Beyond where it's too sad
Past to where there is no hope

Sons and daughters

While we're talking soul to soul
Now here we go

I'm only halfway home I gotta journey on
To where I'll find the things that I have lost

Buddy Miller,"Oh my name it is nothing' my age it means less
The country I come from is called the midwest
I was taught and brought up there the laws to abide
And the land that I live in has god on it's side.

Oh the history books tell it they tell it so well
The cavalries charged the Indians fell
The cavalries charged and the Indians died
Oh the country was young with god on it's side.

The Spanish-American war had it's day
And the civil war too was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes I was taught to memorize
With guns in their hands and god on their side.

The first world war, boys it came and it went
The reason for fighting I never did get
But I learned to accept it and accept it with pride
Or you don't count the dead when god's on your side.

When the second world war came to an end
We forgave the Germans and then we were friends
Though they murdered six million in the ovens they fried
The Germans now too have god on their side.

I've learned to hate Russians all through my whole life
If another war comes it's them we must fight
To hate them and fear them to run and to hide
And accept it all bravely with god on my side.

But now we got weapons of the chemical dust
If fire them we're forced to then fire them we must
One push of the button and a shot the world wide
And you never ask questions when god's on your side.

In a many dark hour I've been thinking' about this
That Jesus Christ was betrayed by a kiss
But I can't think for you you'll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot had god on his side.

So now as I'm leaving' I'm weary as hell
The confusion I'm feeling' ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head and fall to the floor
If god's on our side he'll stop the next war.",With God on Your Side,2004
Buddy Miller,"It's a demolition derby
It's the sport of the hunt
Proud tribe in full war dance
It's the slow smile that the bully gives the runt

It's the force of inertia
It's the lack of constraint
It's the children out playing in the rock garden
All dolled up in black hats and war paint

Sometimes it feels like bars of steel I can't bend with my hands
Oh, I worry too much
Somebody told me that I worry too much

It's these sandpaper eyes
It's the way they rub the luster from what is seen
It's the way we tell ourselves that all these things are normal
'Til we can't remember what we mean

It's the flicker of our flames
It's the friction born of living
It's the way we beat a hot retreat
And heave our smoking guns into the river

It's the quick-step march of history
The vanity of nations
It's the way there'll be no muffled drums
To mark the passage of my generation

It's the lambs born in innocence
It's wondering if the good I know will last

Buddy Miller,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down",Sunday Morning Coming Down,2016
Buddy Miller,"I don't want to hear a love song
I got on this airplane just to fly
And I know there's life below me
But all you can show me
Is the prairie and the sky

And I don't want to hear a sad story
Full of heartbreak and desire
The last time I felt like this
I was in the wilderness
And the canyon was on fire
And I stood on the mountain 
In the night and I watched it burn
I watched it burn, I watched it burn

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see, I could see your face

Well you really got me this time
And the hardest part is knowing I'll survive
And I come to listen for the sound
Of the trucks as they move down
Out on 95
And pretend that it's the ocean
Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean
Baby, do you know what I mean?

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see, I could see your face
If I thought I could see, I could see your face

Buddy Miller,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

So sure that you were the one it was all leading to.
I can't believe that you're walking away
Now no other will do.

You say, to give it time, that I will see,
That you are only doing what is best for me
But I say that my chances now can only be
None to none of finding another only one.

I would so love to believe, it's best for you to go,
Right now, I could use anything to soften the blow.
I can't deny what I know to be to be true,
What you want for me, I just can't be for you.

Buddy Mondlock,"Spin that wheel, just let go
Where she falls, nobody knows
Save your breath
Let those snake eyes roll

We bounce between the devil and the deep blue sea
Bounce between forever and what may never be
Let the light of love keep bouncing off
The diamond in the darker side of me

I never had no education
Just an in articulation of the heart
But burning deep inside me
There is a diamond in the dark

Catch that flame, let it warm your soul
Love's cruel game, is the great unknown
All that fear
Do you know you're not alone

We bounce between the devil and the deep blue sea
Bounce between forever and what may never be
We bounce between decisions, destinations constantly
Let the light of love keep bouncing off
The diamond in the darker side of me

I never had no education
Just an in articulation of the heart
But burning deep inside me
There is a diamond in the dark

A shine, a flash and then it's over
A lightning strike, a chance remark
Am I the only one here
Like a diamond in the dark
Like a diamond in the dark

Buddy Mondlock,"I'm the kid who ran away with the circus
Now I'm watering elephants
But sometimes I lie awake in the sawdust
Dreaming I'm in a suit of light
Late at night in the empty big top I'm 
All alone on the high wire
Look, he's working without a net this time
He's a real death-daffier
 
I'm the kid who always looked out the window
Failing tests in geography
But I've seen things far beyond just the schoolyard
Distant shores of exotic lands
They're the spires of the Turkish empire
It's six months since we made landfall
Riding love with the spice of India
Through Gibraltar, we're rich men all
 
I'm the kid who thought we'd someday be lovers
Always held out that time would tell
Time was talking, I guess I just wasn't listening
No surprise if you know me well
And as we're walking toward the train station
There's a whispering rainfall
'Cross the boulevard you slip your hand in mine
In the distance the train calls
 
I'm the kid who has this habit of dreaming
Sometimes gets me in trouble too
But the truth is I could no more stop dreaming
Than I could make them all come true

Cinema 1 or 2, I noticed you
Standing in line, your eyes met mine

In a perfect moment
A perfect moment in time
For a moment you were mine

So later on I knew the first time
That it would be alright for us that night
Trust in our eyes,
We made a bridge of sighs
When we crossed over it was day

There we were,
In a perfect moment

The first time I felt the tug of what I call the thread of you

There at the Lever House

Leaning in close I'm feeling your fingertip

This time, this place
This state of grace
The promise of tomorrow
Your thread runs through

On the run from a sudden rain with too much to talk about
On our knees we choose to end in St. Bartholomew's

Marries a common road to an uncommon time

Buddy Morrow,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,

And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue

Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure

Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind

I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?

But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me

Many will meet their doom, trumpets will sound
All of the dead shall rise, righteous meet in the skies
Going where no one dies, heavenward bound

Troubles will soon be o'er, happy forevermore
When we meet on that shore, free from all care
Rising up in the sky, telling this world goodbye
Homeward we then shall fly, glory to share

Oh, Jesus is coming soon, morning or night or noon

All of the dead shall rise, righteous meet in the skies
Going where no one dies, heavenward bound

With an engineer that's brave
We must make the run successful
From the cradle to the grave
Watch the curves, the hills, the tunnels
Never falter, never quail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

Blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us
Til we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us
In thy praise for evermore

You will cross the bridge of strife
See that Christ is your conductor
On this lightning train of life
Always mindful of obstruction
Do your duty, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

You will often find obstruction
Look for storms of wind and rain
On a hill, or curve, or trestle
They will almost ditch your train
Put your trust alone in Jesus
Never falter, never fail
Keep your hand upon the throttle
And your eye upon the rail

Spanning Jordan's swelling tide
You behold the union depot
Into which your train will guide
There you'll meet the superintendent

Well, believe me I've tried but there's no explaining, 
Eyes piled up you look like a painting, 
Saintly and sexy, the soft-spoken wind blows, 
Uncertain curtains cover broken windows, 
In desperate need of a safe haven and inflamed, 
I walk around Paris, unshaven and ashamed, 
20 odd years since last time I slow danced, 
Teenage crisis and the end of romance, 

I see myself in the form of a wolf, 
Furry, down on all fours and worried, 
Uneven colours and the echoes of fly tones
Connections I've lost in a collection of jawbones
Apples and oranges, you decide which, 
I'm writing graffiti on suicide bridge
I once knew a woman who was clever and tough
Who said too much make up is never enough
Her eyelids were heavy with words and desire
She lives underwater with the birds and the fire
And it just so happens I'm selling my psyche
If you like love you'll love this, most likely

You and me are meant to be, that's right I love you, 
Can't you see, whatever partner you do choose, you have the ability to marry, 
6, 7, 8, I'll never hurt you, you know.
Husbands love their wives, 
Yeah, love the woman, 
Part of me is here with you, 
One life, where my heart beats for you, 
Well, here we are again, 
Here's a couple, treacherous
I'm impatient in relationships in and love
When will you see quand allez-vous me voir

Tell me what is it is, Gee Whiz, I don't think I know.

Bird girl, sorry I'm too sleepy to make
But the sounds of my dreams always keep me awake
Don't wanna scare the birds away so I speak soft
Memories like the shows of Vanessa Beecroft
Her bedroom philosophies are so perplexing
But I think these two wooden legs are so sexy
Cries of sadness, spectacular 
You be Rossy de Palma and I'll be your Dracula 
Fist is of agony decorate the last room
Shoes by the door, on the floor is your costume
Open the trunk with the car key, the odd way
Love songs, call me the marquee de shad
Lord of the files, you lost me I wonder how 
Midnight, meet me at the entrance for the underground
So many questions, but I'm afraid to ask
So I whisper them to apollinaire by Picasso
I touch all the flowers and break the chain
I wish I could fly, but I'd rather take the train
And it just so happens I'm selling my psyche
If you like love you'll love this

You wouldn't tell me what it was because
I don't think you know",Gee Whiz,2011

I walk around
I can't hear a sound, folks talkin' loud, but I
Don't see at all
I gotta get away, gotta get away, I don't

It's hopeless so
I guess I'll leave it alone well I
Spent all my day
Fixin' up to go somewhere
Thought I was late
And I found she wasn't there
I guess I'll find
Love, peace of mind, some other time, but I
Still have today

Thinking just of you

Headed for the subway home
I took my time
'Cause I felt so all alone

Not far away
I heard a funny sound, took a look around, and I
Could see her face
Smilin' as she came, callin' out my name, so I
Know where to go

How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep

No football hero or smooth Don Juan

Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can
They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
That is how the blues really began
They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues
From a whippoorwill
Out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn

Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

Why are you blind 
To all you ever were
Never were, really are, nearly are?
Little boy false in search of little boy true
Will you ever be done traveling
Always unraveling you, you?
Running away could lead you further astray
And as for fishing in streams for pieces of dreams
Those pieces will never fit 
What is the sense of it? 
Little boy blue, don't let your little sheep roam
It's time ,come blow your horn, meet the morn
Look and see, can you be far from home? 
",Pieces of Dreams,1978
Buddy Rich,"Poor little, sad little blue Bluesette
Don't you cry, don't you fret,
You can bet one lucky day you'll waken,
And your blues will be forsaken,
Some lucky day lovely love will come your way.

If there is love in your heart to share,
Dear Bluesette don't despair
Some blue boy is waiting just like you,
To find a someone to be true to,
Two loving arms you can nestle in to stay.

Get set, Bluesette,
True love is coming,
Your lonely heart soon will be humming. 

Pretty little Bluesette, 
Mustn't be a mourner,
Have you heard the news yet,
Love's 'round the corner.
Love wrapped in rainbows and tied with pink ribbons 
To make your your next springtime 
Your gold wedding ring time.",Bluesette,1978
Buddy Rich,"Maybe I should have saved those leftover dreams,
Funny, but here's that rainy day.
Here's that rainy day they told me about,
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way.

Oh, where's that worn out wish that I threw aside,
After it brought my lover near?
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day,
Funny, that rainy day is here.

I must face a world of strangers
Where I don't belong

Who will always care

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest dream won't come true
I can take all the madness
This world has to give
But I won't last a day without you
So many times
When the city seems to be
Without a friendly face
A lonely place
It's nice to know
That you'll be there if I need you
And you'll always smile

I can take all the madness

And I end up singing
Troubles seem to walk and disappear
Mmm, you touch me

I can really loose
When you're near

My love if all my friends
Have forgotten half their promises
They're not unkind
Just hard to find
And one look at you
And I know that I could learn to live
Without the rest, I've found the best
When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams
Won't come true
I can take all the madness

And I noticed there wasn't a chair

Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said

In the morning and started to laugh

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1997

Somewhere there's heaven

Buddy Rich,"Say, have you seen a Carioca
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye
Goodbye",The Carioca,1998
Buddy Rich,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He's Funny That Way,1998

Thou sweet, thou grand
Wouldst kiss me pretty
Wouldst hold my hand

Hear me holler I choose
A sweet lollapaloosa in thee

I'd feel so rich
In a hut for two

The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
Then in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

Buddy Rich,"Don't you know, he was the king of saxophones
Yes indeed he was;
Talkin' 'bout the guy that made it sound so good
Some people knew him by the Bean
But Hawkins was his name

He sure could swing and play pretty too
Sounds good to me, should sound good to you
I love to hear him playing Body and Soul
Very pleasing to the ear

When I first heard it on the record
I just stopped, right there,
Sounded like a band of angels in the sky,
And I have never ever heard a sweeter tone
In fact I pay no 'ttention to the saxophone
'Til Coleman Hawkins came along and spoke to everyone,
Saying better listen won't you hear me,
While I play for you,

Sometimes it's hot
Then again it's blue
My soul just seems to wander,
Pleasing each and everyone,
It's what I've long been craving for

The doors have not been always open,
But I am trying to please you.
Please don't try to stop me.
Hope you like it folks

And then he started cookin',
Every time he played
Some melodic melody fast or slow
You could tell that it was Hawkins,

No other one ever has
Quite captured his tone
Just he alone,
Has the sound that penetrates
It will sure go right through you
Yes it will,
And every chorus gives you just another thrill

Then along came Eddie Jefferson
He sang the melody like Hawkins played it
He sang it true
He sang it blue
Made words for it too

All his fans in New York loved him
There's no one above him
Here in the USA
I've heard 'em say ol' Eddie was the man

Oh how he could sing
Man did he swing
Sang on the wing, did his own thing
Yes he did

Throughout the country,
Music lovers are still wiggin' on Eddie's singin'
All around the world, he is known
Rhythm was his special joy,
He swung it like a horn

He must have been born to be a singer
'Cause his lyrics were so sincere and true
Funny sad or blue
Oh yeah!

And we've got to remind you
Many years it took him
Singing every day to achieve his first claim to fame

He was twenty years ahead of his time
And he knew it
But he kept right on-a singing
He went all around the world making rhythm
'Cause music sure was in him and he knew it was

Sang with Moody and Richie Cole
He could sing it just like Bird
But his forte was the words he wrote to
Music that he sang

So he sang, and he sang
And he sang his words so clever
And I know they'll silence him never
'Cause he cut this masterpiece

And now we're trying to sing it for you
Hope the Bean and Eddie both would still approve
There we go
We didn't mean to reminisce
You can surely bet
That we won't forget
'Cause we hear them yet

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying

With distinguish traces
That used to be there

By too many through the day

To tempt me to madness
I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me
Ah yes, I was wrong
Again, I was wrong

Life is lonely again
And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore

A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still
Burning inside my brain

Stifling those who strive
So I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be, while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too",Lush Life,1996

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Pining to be sweetly reclining

Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay

And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh

At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet

Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep

I figure you'se a ho but you can't help it
'Cause being raised by a ho is kinda hectic
Old material bitch 
Gold-digging for them tender dicks
A real nigga never give you shit Biotch
Born and raised in the motherfucking projects ho
Getting money by at the pak Jam, by the back door
Wearing them shorts up your ass with a tube top
Letting niggas stick they fingers all in the cock
Pussy all big and wet, looking good and shit
Smelling like dead fish
And every week it's the same shit you and that lil shit
And every time I see you, you got to have dick
You wants mo' respect
You gets no respect
And all you want is some hardcore sex
1, 2, 3, yes you know
4, 5, 6, 7 niggas in your hole
Back-to-back from the back, head and all
Doo-doo brown and licked his hairy ass balls

But who's the fool?

at the nice Lexus lane looking like grands for the night
Times are hard, you scared, your rent is due
It ain't no limit to the shit you do
You making records in the studio
Telling me it ain't who you know it's who you blow

I'll hit you up for a gangbang
Have you doing strange thangs for some small change
Keeping it real
Fucking with the wrong pops

Head, booty and cock
You get what he got
Shooting tech to his whole cat
Took him home let him hit you from the back
With tax because it's like that

You can't trust
A bitch with a big butt
You get the guts, then tell that ho to keep in touch

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow

But when ye come and all the flowers are a dying
And if I am dead, dead I well may be
Just come and find, find the place
Find the place where I lay lying
And kneel and say an ""Ave"" there for me

And I will hear tho soft you tread above me
And my grave, my grave warmer and sweeter be

Our home is a prison since you are gone

A door that won't knock, a phone that don't ring
The postman goes by and he don't leave a thing
A pain in my heart and tears in my eyes
My sweetheart has gone; I'm left here to cry

I'm the biggest pretender you ever could see
I pretend you still love me; false love couldn't be
And then I remember and I know that it's true
For you're with another, and I know I've lost you

Of when you still love me and I thought it would last
But life is so short, and time moves so fast

A shinin in the moonlight
Like two diamonds in the sky

She was standin' on the banks of the sea
With a forty-four strapped around her
And a banjo on her knee

Lay down your last gold dollar
Lay down your gold watch and chain

My rusty bladed hoe I've laid to rest
My mama and my papa they are sleeping side by side
And their spirits now are roaming with the blessed

Oh, the chimney's falling down and the roof is all caved in
Letting in the sunshine and the rain
And the only friend I've got now is that good old dog of mine
And that little old log cabin in the lane

Oh the paths have all grown up that led around the hill
The fences have all gone to decay
And the creeks have all dried up where we used to go to mill
And things have changed their course another way

Oh I ain't got long to stay here, what little time I've got
I want to rest content while I remain

Than that little old log cabin in the lane",Log Cabin in the Lane,1991
Buddy Spicher,"Ten years ago, on a cold, dark night
There was someone killed neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the man who ran looked a lot like me

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave while the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The judge said ""Son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you don't have to die""
I spoke not a word thought it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

The scaffold was high and eternity near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan
In a long black veil she cries over my bones",Long Black Veil,1991
Buddy Spicher,"The stars up in the sky remind me of your eyes
And the way they use to gaze into mine
The moon up above brings back memories of love
I thought was true and so divine

So never again, oh never no more
Never again will I knock upon your door
Never again but these words I can say
I'll try not to love and stay out of your way

We had the greatest start but deep within your heart
You led me on before I knew the score
You cheated and you lied I stayed right by your side
Until one day simply closed the door",Never Again (Will I Knock on Your Door),1991
