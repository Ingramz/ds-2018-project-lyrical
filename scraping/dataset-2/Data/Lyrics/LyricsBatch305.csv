Gerald Levert,"It ain't the fancy cars or diamond rings, no
(It's deeper)
It ain't a fancy home that makes my heart sing, no babe
(It's sweeter)
It ain't the sunny day that makes my nature rise, no
(It's you babe)
It's you babe
The feeling I get when I look into your eyes, ooh
(What you do to me)
What you do to me, said

I need your body baby, but tell me what to do
I'll follow your lead when trying to get you
To come to me, comfort me
Let me see ecstasy
All that matters
Is you lovin' me

It ain't apple pie that that fills my appetite, no
(It's better) Better
It ain't the young girl that we just seen walking by
(Don't sweat it) Don't sweat it baby, no
Girl, it ain't nothing 'bout my favorite song, no no
(It's stronger) It's stronger
It's how you get me comin' back for your love
Baby, it's longer

I need your body baby, but tell me what to do
I'll follow your lead when trying to get you
To come to me, comfort me
Let me see ecstasy

Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Umm, oh baby
Listen to me

Just got laid off from work today
I can't go home, what am I gonna say
Guess I'll go to the local bar
Toss up a few to the bartender what I'm goin' through
He say if you got a good woman
She gon' catch you when you fall
So instead of givin' me an earfull
Here's a quarter, you need to call her
So here I am, baby

If tonight I cry
I need you to be strong
Will you be my shoulder
Girl you are my backbone, my backbone
And I'm falling apart

My little boy's birthday is coming, yeah
And he want that PlayStation II, yes he do
What am I gonna tell him
Gotta save 'cause the rent is due, the rent is due

You say you get another job, yes you do girl
But I won't put you through that
Just hold me close tonight
Say everyting'll be alright
I just need to know
I need to know you got my back, so

If tonight I cry
I need you to be strong
Will you be my shoulder
Girl you are my backbone, my backbone
And I'm falling apart

Girl I know this is really messed up
I think the Lord is tryna test us, yes he is
But I have never meant so much to me
Like any real man, I want my family
To have everything and anything
But I'm struggling to get on my feet

If tonight I cry
I need you to be strong
Will you be my shoulder
Girl you are my backbone, my backbone
And I'm falling apart

I don't want to cry
So I need you to be strong
For the kids and the family
Can't let 'em see us down
'cause yo know they gon' kick ya
(Backbone, backbone)
When you're down and out
See nobody wants ya
Nobody even cares

If tonight I cry
I need you to be strong
Will you be my shoulder
Girl you are my backbone, my backbone
And I'm falling apart",Backbone,2002

Catchin' feelings

I'm catchin' feelings
I'm catchin' feelings
I don't think I can deal with
Hollarin' at cha and you not hollar back
Leavin' messages on your phone
And you don't hit me back

Catchin' feelings
I'm catchin' feelings
I don't think I can deal with
Knowin' you're layin' up with somebody else
I don't want you for my friend
If I can't have you for myself

A friend of a friend introduced us
Had some drinks and some laughs
Told me about your man
I told you 'bout my girlfiend
You said he made you happy sometimes
But it's been way too much time and work
And his family worked your nerves
Baby mamma was a jerk
And his kissin' was the worst
But you still loved him
So we agreed to meet next week
For conversation and some drinks
But baby girl, I think 

I'm catchin' feelings
I'm catchin' feelings
I don't think I can deal with
Hollarin' at cha and you not hollar back
Leavin' messages on your phone
And you don't hit me back

You brought your man the next week
That didn't sit well with me
But our other friends made it easier
For me to be in your company
You said hey, that's my jam
But your man didn't want to dance
So I took you by the hand and led you to the dance floor
The closer we got, I started feelin' hot
Ooh, I know you feel me girl, how embarrassing
But you didn't push away
You pulled me close to your face
Whispered this is wrong
We stopped before the end of the song

I'm catchin' feelings
I'm catchin' feelings
I don't think I can deal with
Hollarin' at cha and you not hollar back
Leavin' messages on your phone
And you don't hit me back

I met many a woman
But never felt this way
You had me wide open
The first time I seen your face
I can't be around you
And know you're not mine
So if you really love him
Tell me, am I wasting my time, oh

I'm catchin' feelings
I'm catchin' feelings
I don't think I can deal with
Hollarin' at cha and you not hollar back

You had nothing.

When I found my clothes outside the door

Girl, then it's long, it's up to your room
And you're getting weak
And I'm already doomed, I want to
Maybe we should say a prayer or two

We 'bout to love, 'bout to make love
We 'bout to love, 'bout to make love
We 'bout to love, 'bout to make love
We 'bout to love, 'bout to make love

Caught up
Can't think, feelings so deep
Tell me babe
Is this the way to heaven?

And you're next to me
Wouldn't you be strong 'cause I'm so weak
Tell me babe
Is this the way to heaven, heaven?

Baby, the feeling's just too strong
And maybe I'd get my hand in coal
Maybe I just need to go
But I, but I just can't seem to let you go

I just wanna hold you close
Close, close, close, close

The best clothes, best cars, best love, best wines
And if you can give her that, you should give her lovin' back

To somebody who's gonna treat her like a queen
Show her what love really means
And if you know it's really love you can never get enough of love

I will stress to the death for m'lady
Be a freak never cheat on m'lady
Go to work go to church with m'lady
Anything, everything I do for m'lady

I will dress to impress for m'lady
I will cry, I would die for m'lady
If you don't even try for your lady
If you don't just say g'bye to your lady, I love m'lady

Don't be afraid to tell the world about her
'Cause she's your rock and you can't do without her
And can't nobody come between what you and your woman mean

'Cause she's your strength when you're weak
Hope when it's clean, faith when you need it
And when you're feeling it's not to you it's really love
You can never get enough, never too much, never too much

If you want to go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh why do I live this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

If you want to go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home)
She can be 18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicky-thicky-thick girl you know that it's on
(Know that it's on)
I peep something coming towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34
I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare

Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Making a living off my brain, instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my momma put the whip in my own name now
Damn shit done changed now
Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White

And I've got something to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""

Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Crissy, bubb' macking

Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty want to knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty want to rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty want to pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas staring or they diss

To every single, single nation
I believe these words are true
For me and you

We are (we are)
They Are (they are)
Each one is God's gift to the world

This one (talkin bout this one),
That one (talkn bout that one),
Each one is God's Gift to the World.

Don't forget about the babies (the babies)
Don't forget about the soldiers ( the soldiers)
This one and that one and
This one and that one
Are God's gift to the world

This one (talkin bout this one),
That one (talkn bout that one),
Each one is God's Gift to the World.

Gerald Levert,"Connect to the stare, climb into bed
While sugar plum fairies dance in your hair
Tomorrow you'll wake and open your eyes
To the wonder of Christmas full of surprise

Sweet dreams, my angel; sleep tight, my child
Sail through the dream--that's where wishes come true
I'll meet you on dawned morning light
My angel, my angel

The New Year has joy and cares of the tomb
And when you get scared, you won't be alone
God's love goes with you wherever you are
The spirit will find you; you're never too far

Sweet dreams, my angel; sleep tight, my child
Sail through the dream--that's where wishes come true
I'll meet you on dawned morning light
My angel, oh, my angel, good night

Sleep, little baby
I'll wake you up on Christmas day

Sweet dreams, my angel; sleep tight, my child
Sail through the dream--that's where wishes come true
I'll meet you on dawned morning light
My angel, my sweet angel, good night

Sleep tight, close your eyes
And tomorrow I'll be there by your side
Can't wait to see your smile in my arms

You're my only friend and I wanna keep you one

Gerald Wolfe,"Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention
I want to introduce to you
In this corner of the good and the right
Stands a champion, robed in white
His height exceeds the heavens
His weight outweighs the world
His reach reaches everywhere
His age is evermore

[Chorus]
He is higher than the highest
Greater than the great
No one will ever take His crown away
He is more mighty than the mightiest
He reigns from above
He's the all-time, undisputed, undefeated
Champion of Love

He left his hometown to enter this arena
To raise His hands in victory for all of you and me
But an angry crowd crucified this King who bore their crown
And they gladly watched the champion going down
But I will never count Him out
For I'm a witness of
The day He arose to retain the title,
""Champion of Love""

How can you buy two blue Irish eyes?
How can you purchase a fond mother's sighs?

Gerard,"Hals über Kopf verlebt
Ich stürz durch diese Clubs als ob sie mir gehören
Und auch den Rest der Stadt muss ich zurückerobern
Denn du hast sie mir zerstört, alles weggenommen, nichts dagelassen
Was nach Jahren bleibt passt scheinbar in zwei Tragetaschen
Hoffentlich habe ich nicht diesen Donnerstagabend
Bis ich mich sonst wo ablenke in meinen Kopf
Denn ich will endlich mal schlafen
Ich habe hier nichts zu suchen
Doch steh rum als wär das mein eigener Laden
Bis ich wirklich nicht mehr kann
Lass mich via Taxi dann irgendwo parken, steig aus und kotz
Ich will weg von hier, weg von hier und bleibe doch
Die Stadt verschluckt mich mit all ihren Clubhits
Der Puls der Stadt hält mich noch wach denn ich muss mit
Doch kann nicht mehr
Es würde höchstens rund laufen wenn im Kreisen  Kanten wären
Unser Film
Ich will ihn doch nur weiterdrehen
Auf meiner Couch sitzen, deine Geister weigern sich seit Wochen heimzugehen

Ich lauf mit Tunnelblick durch diese Stadt und ich wunder mich
Wieso sieht's hier jetzt so anders aus
Seit sie nicht mehr unsere ist?
Alles grau seit du verschwunden bist
Und ich atme und warte bis es anders wird
Was ist da passiert?
Du warst doch grad noch hier
Doch jetzt ist alles verschwommen
Alles verschwommen, alles verschwommen, alles verschwommen

Ich lasse mich im blauen Nebel fallen, draußen ist es kalt
Will trotzdem raus doch ich hab auch noch nicht bezahlt
Stroboskope blitzen grau, der Rauch wirkt schon normal
Ich will dich noch sehen, hab meinen Auftritt schon geplant
Nummer längst gelöscht, doch wen verarsch ich da?
Sicher in alten SMSen noch wo zu finden und ich hab noch paar, Handy raus
Was für 'ne Scheißidee - lieber schnell Handy aus
Weitertanzen, weitertun als gäbs kein Morgen mehr
Kein Übermorgen mehr, kein Über-Übermorgen mehr
Shots schon x-mal geext zwischen Lückenfüllersätzen
Versucht Brückenstützer zu setzen
Doch du hast sie nicht mal entdeckt, einfach weggesehen
Jetzt bewege ich mich zwischen Mädchen
Die leicht beschämt nach gemeinsamen Nächten gehen
Doch eben das will ich nicht
Nora, ey spitze hingekriegt

Ich lauf mit Tunnelblick durch diese Stadt und ich wunder mich
Wieso sieht's hier jetzt so anders aus
Seit sie nicht mehr unsere ist?
Alles grau seit du verschwunden bist

Alles verschwommen, alles verschwommen, alles verschwommen

Will ich dann nachts auf die Uhrzeit auf meinem Handy schauen
Kann ich leider nichts erkennen
Diese verdammten kleinen Ziffern
Sind alle verschwommen
Und auch am Tag sehe ich den ganzen anderen Scheiß von dieser Stadt
Leider auch nur verschwommen
Deine Nummer seh' ich auch verschwommen
Auf deine SMS würde ich gern mal was schreiben
Doch ich kann sie leider nicht lesen
Ich seh' sie auch verschwommen
Würd' gern auf Partys mit dir über irgendwas reden

And I would keep you from all harm
If you would stay beside me

Et des plumes couleur de la nuit
À son front brillant de mille feux

Portait un diamant bleu

De son bec, il a touché ma joue
Dans ma main il a glissé son cou
C'est alors que je l'ai reconnu
Surgissant du passé
Il m'était revenu

Retournons au pays d'autrefois, comme avant
Comme avant dans mes rêves d'enfant

Des étoiles, des étoiles

Comme avant sur un nuage blanc
Comme avant allumer le soleil

Gérard Depardieu,"Dans les paniers d'osier de la salle des ventes 
Une gloire déchue des folles années trente 
Avait mis aux enchères, parmi quelques brocantes 
Un vieux bijou donné par quel amour d'antan 

Elle était là, figée, superbe et déchirante 
Les mains qui se nouaient, se dénouaient tremblantes 
Des mains belles encore, déformées, les doigts nus 
Comme sont nus, parfois, les arbres en Novembre 

Comme chaque matins, dans la salle des ventes 
Bourdonnait une foule, fiévreuse et impatiente 
Ceux qui, pour quelques sous, rachètent pour les vendre 
Les trésors fabuleux d'un passé qui n'est plus 

Dans ce vieux lit cassé, en bois de palissandre 
Que d'ombres enlacées, ont rêvé à s'attendre 
Les choses ont leurs secrets, les choses ont leurs légendes 
Mais les choses murmurent si nous savons entendre 

Le vieux marteau se leva, dans la salle des ventes 
Une fois, puis deux fois, alors, dans le silence 
Elle cria ""je prends, je rachète tout ça 
Ce que vous vendez là, c'est mon passé à moi"" 

C'était trop tard, déjà, dans la salle des ventes 
Le marteau retomba sur sa voix suppliante 
Tout se passa si vite à la salle des ventes
Tout se passa si vite qu'on ne l'entendit pas

Près des paniers d'osier, dans la salle des ventes 
Une femme pleurait ses folles années trente 
Et revoyait soudain défiler son passé 
Défiler son passé, défiler son passé 

Car venait de surgir, du fond de sa mémoire 
Du fond de sa mémoire, un visage oublié 
Une image chérie, du fond de sa mémoire 
Son seul amour de femme, son seul amour de femme 

Hagarde, elle sortit de la salle des ventes 
Froissant quelques billets, dedans ses main tremblantes 
Froissant quelques billets, du bout de ses doigts nus 
Quelques billets froissés, pour un passé perdu 

Hagarde, elle sortit de la salle des ventes 
Je la vis s'éloigner, courbée et déchirante 
De son amours d'antan, rien ne lui restait plus 
Pas même ce souvenir, aujourd'hui disparu",Drouot,2017

Du plus loin, du premier rendez-vous
Du temps des premières peines
Lors, j´avais quinze ans, à peine
Cœur tout blanc, et griffes aux genoux
Que ce fut, j´étais précoce
De tendres amours de gosse
Les morsures d´un amour fou
Du plus loin qu´il m´en souvienne
Si depuis, j´ai dit ""je t´aime""
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour

Me gelait au cou

Celle-là, qui menait jusqu´à vous

Que, pour vous, je l´eus faite à genoux

Mais qu´il me fut doux

Et pour une larme qui venait de vous
J´ai pleuré d´amour
Vous souvenez-vous? 

Ce fut, un soir, en septembre

À vous regarder sourire
À vous aimer, sans rien dire

Gérard Depardieu,"Un beau jour ou peut-être une nuit
Près d'un lac, je m'étais endormi
Quand soudain, semblant crever le ciel
Et venant de nulle part
Surgit un aigle noir

Lentement, les ailes déployées
Lentement, je le vis tournoyer
Près de moi dans un bruissement d'ailes
Comme tombé du ciel
L'oiseau vin se poser

Il avait les yeux couleur rubis
Et des plumes couleur de la nuit
À son front brillant de mille feux
L'oiseau roi couronné
Portait un diamant bleu

De son bec, il a touché ma joue
Dans ma main il a glissé son cou
C'est alors que je l'ai reconnu
Surgissant du passé
Il m'était revenu

Dis l'oiseau, oh dis emmène-moi
Retournons au pays d'autrefois, comme avant
Comme avant dans mes rêves d'enfant
Pour cueillir en tremblant
Des étoiles, des étoiles

Comme avant dans mes rêves d'enfant
Comme avant sur un nuage blanc
Comme avant allumer le soleil
Être faiseur de pluie
Et faire des merveilles

L'aigle noir dans un bruissement d'ailes
Prit son vol pour regagner le ciel

Un beau jour ou peut-être une nuit?
Près d'un lac, je m'étais endormi
Quand soudain, semblant crever le ciel

Surgit un aigle noir

Gérard Depardieu,"Dans les paniers d'osier de la salle des ventes 
Une gloire déchue des folles années trente 
Avait mis aux enchères, parmi quelques brocantes 
Un vieux bijou donné par quel amour d'antan 

Elle était là, figée, superbe et déchirante 
Les mains qui se nouaient, se dénouaient tremblantes 
Des mains belles encore, déformées, les doigts nus 
Comme sont nus, parfois, les arbres en Novembre 

Comme chaque matins, dans la salle des ventes 
Bourdonnait une foule, fiévreuse et impatiente 
Ceux qui, pour quelques sous, rachètent pour les vendre 
Les trésors fabuleux d'un passé qui n'est plus 

Dans ce vieux lit cassé, en bois de palissandre 
Que d'ombres enlacées, ont rêvé à s'attendre 
Les choses ont leurs secrets, les choses ont leurs légendes 
Mais les choses murmurent si nous savons entendre 

Le vieux marteau se leva, dans la salle des ventes 
Une fois, puis deux fois, alors, dans le silence 
Elle cria ""je prends, je rachète tout ça 
Ce que vous vendez là, c'est mon passé à moi"" 

C'était trop tard, déjà, dans la salle des ventes 
Le marteau retomba sur sa voix suppliante 
Tout se passa si vite à la salle des ventes
Tout se passa si vite qu'on ne l'entendit pas

Près des paniers d'osier, dans la salle des ventes 
Une femme pleurait ses folles années trente 
Et revoyait soudain défiler son passé 
Défiler son passé, défiler son passé 

Car venait de surgir, du fond de sa mémoire 
Du fond de sa mémoire, un visage oublié 
Une image chérie, du fond de sa mémoire 
Son seul amour de femme, son seul amour de femme 

Hagarde, elle sortit de la salle des ventes 
Froissant quelques billets, dedans ses main tremblantes 
Froissant quelques billets, du bout de ses doigts nus 
Quelques billets froissés, pour un passé perdu 

Hagarde, elle sortit de la salle des ventes 
Je la vis s'éloigner, courbée et déchirante 
De son amours d'antan, rien ne lui restait plus 
Pas même ce souvenir, aujourd'hui disparu",Drouot [Live],2017
Gérard Depardieu,"Du plus loin, que me revienne
L´ombre de mes amours anciennes
Du plus loin, du premier rendez-vous
Du temps des premières peines
Lors, j´avais quinze ans, à peine
Cœur tout blanc, et griffes aux genoux
Que ce fut, j´étais précoce
De tendres amours de gosse
Les morsures d´un amour fou
Du plus loin qu´il m´en souvienne
Si depuis, j´ai dit ""je t´aime""
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour
C´est vous

C´est vrai, je ne fus pas sage
Et j´ai tourné bien des pages
Sans les lire, blanches, et puis rien dessus, c´est vrai
C'est vrai, je ne fus pas sage
Et mes guerriers de passage
À peine vus, déjà disparus

Mais à travers leur visage
C´était déjà votre image
C´était vous déjà et le cœur nu
Je refaisais mes bagages
Et je poursuivais mon mirage
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous

Sur la longue route
Qui menait vers vous
Sur la longue route
J´allais le cœur fou
Le vent de décembre
Me gelait au cou
Qu´importait décembre
Si c´était pour vous

Elle fut longue la route
Mais je l´ai faite, la route
Celle-là, qui menait jusqu´à vous
Et je ne suis pas parjure
Si ce soir, je vous jure
Que, pour vous, je l´eus faite à genoux
Il en eut fallu bien d´autres
Que quelques mauvais apôtres
Que l´hiver ou la neige à mon cou
Pour que je perde patience
Et j´ai calmé ma violence
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous

Mais tant d'hivers et d'automnes 
De nuit, de jour, et personne
Vous n´étiez jamais au rendez-vous
Et de vous, perdant courage, soudain
Me prenait la rage
Mon Dieu, que j´avais besoin de vous
Que le Diable vous emporte
D´autres m´ont ouvert leur porte
Heureuse, je m´en allais loin de vous
Oui, je vous fus infidèle
Mais vous revenais quand même
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous

J´ai pleuré mes larmes
Mais qu´il me fut doux
Oh, qu´il me fut doux
Ce premier sourire de vous
Et pour une larme qui venait de vous
J´ai pleuré d´amour
Vous souvenez-vous? 

Ce fut, un soir, en septembre
Vous étiez venus m´attendre
Ici même, vous en souvenez-vous?

À vous regarder sourire
À vous aimer, sans rien dire
C´est là que j´ai compris, tout à coup
J´avais fini mon voyage
Et j´ai posé mes bagages
Vous étiez venus
Au rendez-vous
Qu´importe ce qu´on peut en dire
Je tenais à vous le dire

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream

I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

The morning rain's against my window pane
While the world it looks so cold and gray
In my mind I drift away
Then I'm on my way to tropic island
You had always said I was a dreamer
You were right

Gotta buy me a ticket to the tropics
Forget our love and leave this place behind me
Gotta buy me a ticket to the tropics
And prove myself that I can live without your love

Here I'm sitting in the middle place
Sun is shining on my face again
Think about the way it had to end
Now I'm sitting here alone
And it's not the way we were together
I want you to know I'm gonna miss you
Miss you bad

Gotta buy me a ticket to the tropics
Forget our love and leave this place behind me
Gotta buy me a ticket to the tropics
And prove myself that I can live without your love

Gotta buy me a ticket to the tropics
Forget our love and leave this place behind me
Gotta buy me a ticket to the tropics
And prove myself that I can",Ticket to the Tropics,1997

De sommeil, grelottaient sous les assauts du vent

Où le maître nous séparait
Nous retrouvions chaque jour notre place
Et l'on ne pouvait plus se parler
Puis bercés par les vagues d'une douce chaleur
Que nous prodiguait le vieux poêle

Qui autour de moi écoutaient
Et pendant les leçons dans mon coin je rêvais
A des îles

Que tes yeux profonds où je voyage

Quand l'amour
L'amour nous brûle le cœur
Quand l'amour
Nous fait trembler de bonheur
Dans un matin nouveau éclatant de blancheur

Rien n'est plus beau
Que la pluie qui parfume la terre
Rien n'est plus beau
Que tes bras qui me prennent et me serrent

Quand l'amour
Nous fait trembler de bonheur

Gérard Lenorman,"Il était une fois à l'entrée des artistes
Un petit garçon blond au regard un peu triste
Il attendait de moi une phrase magique
Je lui dis simplement, si j'étais Président
Si j'étais Président de la République
Jamais plus un enfant n'aurait de pensée triste
Je nommerais bien sur Mickey premier ministre
De mon gouvernement, si j'étais président
Simplet à la culture me semble une évidence
Tintin à la police et Picsou aux finances
Zorro à la justice et Minnie à la danse
Est c'que tu serais content si j'étais président?
Tarzan serait ministre de l'écologie
Bécassine au commerce, Maya à l'industrie
Je déclarerais publiques toutes les patisseries
Opposition néant, si j'étais Président

Si j'étais Président de la République
J'écrirais mes discours en vers et en musique
Et les jours de conseil on irait en pique-nique
On f'rait des trucs marrants si j'étais Président
Je recevrais la nuit le corps diplomatique
Dans une super disco à l'ambiance atomique
On se ferait la guerre à grands coups de rythmique
Rien ne serait comme avant, si j'étais président
Au bord des fontaines coulerait de l'orangeade
Coluche notre ministre de la rigolade
Imposerait des manèges sur toutes les esplanades
On s'éclaterait vraiment, si j'étais président!

Si t'étais Président de la République
Pour nous, tes p'tits copains, ça s'rait super pratique
On pourrait rigoler et chahuter sans risques
On serait bien contents si t'étais Président

Je s'rais jamais Président de la République
Vous les petits malins vous êtes bien sympathiques
Mais ne comptez pas sur moi pour faire de la politique
Pas besoin d'être Président, pour aimer les enfants",Si Je'tais President,2000

Je te tuerai même si c'était toi

De cette chanson d'innocence
Ça m'fait pleurer quand j'y pense

Catherine le monde a changé
Les chasseurs sont du bon côté
Pour les oiseaux y a plus grand-chose à faire
Ils tueront les pigeons au nucléaire
Les champs de blé de nos jeux d'enfance
Seront bientôt  comme ce désert
Comment me taire quand j'y pense

Ils sont fiers de leurs bombardiers
De leurs soldats, de leurs idées
Y a des goulags pour ceux qui parlent trop
Y a des médailles pour jouer les héros
Y a pas une chanson qui peut faire
Changer les choses, non aucune chose
Ça m'fait chanter quand j'y pense

Les maîtres de la guerre sont là
Dieu est à leurs côtés tu vois
Ils se déguisent derrière leurs discours
Ils nous mentent un peu plus chaque jour
Quand les larmes et le sang
N'auront plus aucun sens
J'irais prier si j'y pense

Elle disait faut pas toucher
Aux oiseaux dans les champs de blé
Je tuerai le chasseur qui les tuera

Et les mains des vieillards
Qui caressent les enfants

Des troncs des marronniers
Et des kiosques à musique

Voler vers l'Amérique

Qui nous guidaient ?
Peut-être étions-nous trop fiers
Pour baisser la tête.
Le monde a tourné sans nous,
Sans nous attendre.
Les ténèbres sont partout
Couvertes de cendres.

Mais souviens-toi
Que l'on s'aimait quand même.
Nous étions si jeunes, si fiers
Et, comment le dire,
Nous avons perdu la lumière,
L'étoile qui caressait nos paupières.
Tout m'est égal.

Et quand même
On se souvient,
On se rappelle
De quelque chose
Qu'on pose près du lit,
D'une lumière
Qui brillait la nuit.

Mais où sont passées les lumières
Qui nous guidaient ?
Devenus statues de pierre,
Qu'avons nous fait ?
Les instants, comme des clous de fer
Qu'on enfonce
Et rien que le bruit de la mer
Pour seule réponse.

Souviens-toi, c'était hier,
Mais aujourd'hui,
Le lion secoue sa crinière.
Peur de la nuit,
Gratte le fond de la rivière
Où il venait boire.
Nous avons perdu la lumière.
Nous sommes dans le noir.

Gérard Manset,"La mer n'a pas cessé de descendre.
Après le goût du sel, goût de cendre.
La mer n'a pas cessé de descendre.
Après le feu de joie, c'est la cendre
Et le vent n'a pas cessé de gémir,
La pluie de tomber, le bois de pourrir.
Non le vent n'a pas cessé de gémir
Au lieu de se taire, de s'endormir.
Alors le mal n'a pas cessé de grandir,
La pluie de chanter, le ciel de rire.
J'avais ton coeur à portée de la main,
Toujours le même par le même chemin
Et ton visage sur l'horizon,
Toujours le même à vouloir avoir raison,
Oui le même à vouloir avoir raison.
La mer n'a pas cessé de descendre,
Les yeux de pleurer, les bras de se tendre.
La mer n'a pas cessé de descendre.
Il faut de l'eau pour éteindre la cendre
Et le vent n'a pas cessé de gémir
Dans la gorge de celui qui va mourir.
Non, le vent n'a pas cessé de gémir.
Y a plus rien dans le filet que tu tires.
Alors le mal n'a pas cessé de grandir,
Le jour de tomber, le ciel de noircir.

La mer me pousse, la mer me tire.
Oui, y a trop d'eau entre nous.

L'eau des larmes du collier de ton cou,
L'eau des larmes du collier de ton cou.
La mer n'a pas cessé de descendre.
Après le goût du sel, goût de cendre.
Elle est si loin qu'on ne peut plus l'entendre
Et je commence aujourd'hui à comprendre.
Elle est si loin qu'on ne peut plus l'atteindre

Et tes yeux sur mes yeux vont déteindre",La Mer N'A Pas Cessé de Descendre,2007

Looking around here you'd think
Sure, she's got everything

I've got gadgets and gizmos a plenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs? I've got twenty!
But who cares? No big deal,
I want more

I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see them dancing

Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down a
What's that word again?
Street

Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wandering free
Wish I could be, part of that world

What would I give if I could live
Out of these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day
Warm on the sand?

Betcha' on land, they'd understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women, sick of swimming
Ready to stand

And ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions
And get some answers
What's a fire and why does it - what's the word?
Burn?

When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world",Cover Me With Flowers of Mauve,2014

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,1991

You know some kids ask us what happiness really is.
Well, to me happiness is a hamburger, going to the movies, new clothes.
Well, what's your happiness, gerard?

Gerard:
My happiness is a hotdog sandwich, new rubber shoes, new t-shirts,
New jeans and also my favorite part of happiness is love.

Happiness is two kinds of ice cream
Finding your skate key, telling the time
Happiness is learning to whistle
Tying your shoe for the very first time
Happiness is playing the drum in your own school band
And happiness is walking hand in hand

Is de nacht niet lang genoeg
Nee, de nacht is altijd veel te kort
Omdat het tegen vieren
Zo ’s morgens tegen vieren
Omdat het dan pas echt gezellig wordt

’t Is gisteren weer eens uit de hand gelopen
Het kwam als altijd heerlijk onverwacht
We zouden effetjes een slokkie kopen
Maar effetjes dat werd een hele nacht
En tegen het ochtendgloren stond die hele zotte troep
Van bassen en tenoren luid te zingen op de stoep
Een agent kwam voorbij
En weet je, weet je, weet je wat hij zei

Ik had allang gehoord “De hoogste tijd”
Maar al die kreten mochten toch niet baten
D’r zaten al weer mensen aan ’t ontbijt
We zongen voor de laatste maal een carnavalsrefrein
En kwamen de melkboer tegen op het lege, stille plein

Gerard-René-Gordon,"If ever you got rain in your heart, 
Someone has hurt you, and torn you apart, 
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me? 

And let it be like they said it would be 
Me loving you girl, and you loving me. 
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me? 

Run to me whenever youÂ´re lonely. (to love me) 
Run to me if you need a shoulder 
Now and then, you need someone older, 
So darling, you run to me. 

And when youÂ´re out in the cold, 
No one beside you, and no one to hold, 
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me? 

And when youÂ´ve got nothing to lose, 
Nothing to pay for, nothing to choose, 
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me 

Run to me whenever youÂ´re lonely. (to love me)

Gerard-René-Gordon,"You took a mystery and made me want it
You got a pedestal and put me on it
You made me love you out of feeling nothing

You set your mark on stealing my heart away
Crying trying anything for you

Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side

And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key

Go on now, go, walk out the door

Somebody new
I'm not that chained-up little person and still in love with you

E sone sempre in mezzo ai guai
Vivo e ti domando cosoa sei
Ma, specchio, tu non parli mai
Io che non potrò mai creare niente
Io amo l'amore ma non la gente
Io, che non sarò mai un Dio

Vivere, nessuno mai ce l'ha insegnato
Vivere, fotocopiandoci il passato
Vivere, anche se non l'ho chiesto io
Di vivere, come una canzone che
Nessuno canterà

Ma se tu vedessi l'uomo
Davanti al tuo portone
Che dorme avvolto in un cartone
Se tu ascoltassi il mondo
Una mattina
Senza il rumore della pioggia
Tu che puoi creare con la tua voce
Tu pensi i pensieri della gente
Poi di Dio c'è solo Dio

Vivere, nessuno mai ce l'ha insegnato
Vivere, non si può vivere senza passato
Vivere è bello anche se non l'hai chiesto mai
Una canzone ci sarà
Sempre qualcuno che la canterà
Qualcuno non mi basta
Vivere cercando ancora il grande amore
Vivere come se mai dovessimo morire
Vivere per poi capire all'improvviso
Che in fondo questo vita tu 
Non l'hai vissuta

I don't drink or smoke ain't into dope
Won't try no coke, ask me how I do it, I cope
My only addiction has to do with the female species
I eat 'em raw like sushi

No me gustan ternos, mi estilo es moderno
Si me enterno, you me enfermo
Mi apariencia es dura, vivo en la locura
No me vengan con ternuras

So please don't judge a book by its cover
There's more to being a latin lover
You got to know how to deal with a woman
That won't let go
The price you pay for being a gigolo

There's not a woman that can handle
A man like me
That's why I juggle two or three
I ain't one to commit, you can omit that bit
You pop the question that's it

No es un delito calmo mi apetito

Take a piece of your pie and say bye
Or be honest and rub your thighs

Gerardo,"Excuse me, where have I seen you? 
They tend to ask me 
A humble answer I give them 
As we start to get closer 
But then even more so 
They all persist on rubbing my torso 
I'm Latin but I ain't wrapping in satin 
No, that old disco look just ain't happening 
I'm fresh and new and making my debut 
So let me run this information by you 
Its true we outdo, it has become an issue 
Love em and leave em fast we won't miss you 
Its tradition were well conditioned 
We outlast the competition, so listen 
We don't care too much about kissing 
No, we know just what you've been missing 
Were straight out and blunt 
We don't put up with stunts 
Baby, you know what we want 

We want the funk 
Give up the funk 
We need the funk 
Gotta have that funk 

don't play shy, don't expect long good-byes 
These are some of the rules that we go by 
No demands and forget holding hands 
Please, not around our friends 
We intend to hold on to our image 
Don't try to cross that line of scrimmage 
Don't say you weren't aware, so have yourself prepared 
And beware, this is a one-time love affair 
See, that's as far as it goes, its our motto 
And you thought you won the lotto 
Waiting to claim your prize you go unrecognized 
Huh! how's that for a surprise? 
So save yourself from confusion and sorrow 
Don't even think about tomorrow 
Tonights the night, enjoy! 
Were here to make some noise 
Let me hear that high pitch in your voice 

We want the funk 
Give up the funk 
We need the funk 
Gotta have that funk 

Smoother than James Bond you wake and were gone 
So you wonder what you did wrong 
Huh! don't be blaming yourself, its a must that we vanish 
Here's the scroop straight to you, but in Spanish... 
Oye nena, rubia o morena, mi excusa est en mis venas 
Soy un simple mujeriego no lo niego ni miento 
Soy latino cien por ciento 
As que piensa lo bien si no es conmigo con quien es? 

Responde de una vez 
No te me hagas la importante la dificil o atorrante 
Al cabo tengo mas amantes 
No te prometo nada saldrs por donde entrastes 
Yo no pienso molestarte 
As que no me busques, me sigas, me asustes 
Busca otro que te la ajuste 

Now there it is, laid out plain and simple 
In Spanish but on tempo 
Can't comprehend at all, confused or in a hole? 
What's the matter? No habla espaol? 
If that's the case then no need to worry 
Bust out the dictionary 
You want some inside info 
Wanna know what you're in for 
Look up right under nympho 

We want the funk 
Give up the funk 
We need the funk

Gerardo,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",A Mi Manera,2007

Tu ronca maldición maleva
Tu lágrima de ron me lleva
Hacia el hondo bajo fondo

Ya sé que me hace daño
Yo sé que te lastimó
Llorando mi sermón de vino
Pero es el viejo amor
Que tiembla, bandoneón
Y busca en el licor que aturda
La curda que al final
Termine la función
Corriéndole un telón
Al corazón

Un poco de recuerdo y sinsabor
Gotea tu rezongo lerdo
Marea tu licor y arrea
La tropilla de la zurda
Al volcar la ultima curda

Cerrame el ventanal, que arrastra el sol
Su lento caracol de sueño
No ves que vengo de un país
Que esta de olvido siempre gris

Contame tu condena
Decime tu fracaso
No ves la pena que me ha herido?

Lord, you never gave up on me.

You're the one truth I have found.

Plebitas hay entre el medio
Norteños en sus festejos
El cinco no va de postre
Para aguantar el desvelo

Los radios están sonando
Creo que estamos avanzando
De rivers aya en San Diego
Me la paso circulando
Ya se fueron las muchachas
En Phoenix se andan paseando

C1 nombre en la clave
El cuate es reconocido
18 que es importante
Para seguir el camino

Gritaba arriba Jalisco",El  C-1,2011

Cuando llegaron las balas 
No era advertencia 
Ni coincidencia 
Era la muerte en mi cara 
Tiempo que es vida 
Blanco ala mira 
Asesinato me tenían rodeado 
En mi mente,Mi familia 
En minutos repase mi vida 
Puse fuerza,en mi cabeza 
Subí tiro a mi 40
Les di pelea 

Era esperado 
Que me arrimaran un golpe 
Cuando hay errores 
Hay correcciones 
Y le falle a los señores 
Hice negocios 
Con los contrarios 
Fui un chapulin aunque debas usar 
Consecuencias ,Que atormentan 
Hay errores que nunca se arreglan 
Si la muerte,Comprendiera 
& si el momento cambiara la escena 
Que me coma la tierra 

Con la fuerza paraba las balas 
El impacto dio una alta descarga 
No hubo tiempo de hacer el intento 
Sin piedad perforaban mi cuerpo 
Con mis manos tapaba mis sesos 
& la Sangre corría entre mi cuerpo 
Ya lo rojo en lo blanco vestía,era la 
Despedida,No tenia salida 

Todo era blanco 
Agonizaba en mi llanto 
Solo en minutos 
Se aproximaba 
Era el eterno descanso 
Muerte en la escena 
Luz de sirenas 
Los agresores tomaron vereda 
En segundos Tocaban mi vida 
Y el espacio quedo en mi familia 
Solo Balas y un hombre tirado 
Y en su cara un lienzo empapado 
Era el afectado 

Pobre y sin llanto 
Y cantidad de rosarios 
Buenos amigos 
Hijos queridos 
Ya les falle en el camino 
cuerpo manchado 
Entrajesado

Para que me arrebataran el camino

Y doy las gracias a la gente que me estima
Esta fue mi despedida

Es difícil quiero recordar mis años
Tuve buenos y momentos apresados
He clavado a mi viejita
Y el amor que siempre tuve a mis hermanos
La pasión por las guitarras
Y el calor que me brindaba un escenario
Los momentos que pasamos trabajando
Junto a temo tantos sueños que logramos
Nunca dejo de extrañarlo

Repasando los momentos en mi vida
Ala mitad de mi tiempo fueron tiempos de alegría
Mi trabajo, mis amigos, mi familia
Y hoy cumplen mi corazón de una mujer tan compresiva
Disfrutaba de mis años muchos rifles regalados
Pues mi error es que fui bueno con los malos
Y es que dios nos hizo como hermanos

Tuve infancia y bien recuerdo los problemas
Y encontrarle la razón solo me quema
El haberle batallado
Y eso me hizo una persona sin barreras
Me paseaba por las calles
Con amigos en mi humilde patineta
Mis recuerdos, los consejos de mi padre
Era niño fue difícil escucharle
El respeto es importante

A mi madre le agradezco sin medida
El momento que dio a luz me dio la vida
Cada voz, cada detalle, cada espacio
Lo recuesto día con día

Mejore las armas

Me dieron el puesto

Solo por tener sangre azul
En mis venas
Soy de piel morena

Aviles principios se isieron camino
Nunca fue tan facil
Pero nos movimos

Corretio riquzas, crecio como pino
Y al tocar el cielo forjo su destino
Los miro de arriva un angulo perfecto
No tengo pendientes
Morire de viejo

No estudien mi historia yo no soy un cuento
Respeto meresco,
Soy muy recervado y
Nunca fui aislado

Medir amistades y me ha funcionado
Ocupe 2 familias
De un lado la mafia, poder y abarisia
De otro mi familia",Sangre Azul [Versión Deluxe] [Version],2011

No puedo ser blanco ni lo quiero ser
Mi gente se altera pues son ageridos
Para ser violentos tengo mis motivos
Ami me respetan la plaza esta al 100
Mi ciudad mi rancho soy creado en DJ
Cartel de la rana pese a quien le pese
Aqui en Tijuana el cielo sigue verde

En el avalancha pues sigue muy firme
Con toda mi raza y el señor aquiles
El roki se activa también a la orden
Se rompen las filas les hace un desorden
Ando bien armado mi equipo me respalda
No traigo comando yo traigo batalla
La rana amenasa cumple con la muerte
Rebelde con causa la sangre le yerbe

Descansa en la plaza soy inperactivo
Me gusta la banda y música en vivo
Por culichitaou mafia siciliana
Saludo de mano al comandante ántrax
Pues se actualiza un cesar romano
Hay buen oficina el cartel de los sapos
Estaremos juntos pero no revueltos
Combois y batallas
Unidos en esto

Sodoma y gomora es la ultima frontera
Defiendo mi sol mi Tijuana es bella
En esta tierra el secuestro es prohibido
Acapte las reglas ya están advertidos
Reino del cuacua sangre deramaron
Villa real no esta pero fue vengado
Pasaje de biblia del rey salomón
Construiré en su día un imperio en su honor

De aqui no nos vamos que se abra la tierra
No esperen en bano no firmamos tregua
El guerrero aquiles se le vanto en armas
No maz digan verdes y brinca la rana

El trique resguarda todo controlado
Por que a los contrarios no damos revanchas

Soy el espectro del que no se habla porque la lengua
Se les escala
Y en mil palabras muchas deseadas aparición ilusión
Traigo mi pelotón soy el fantasma talibán del chapo

Soy con el señor tengo trabajando catorce guerras de tiempo sobrado
Y en otro tiempo en mi pasatiempo la oscilación mi visión

He torturado decapitado unos asaltos y mencionado
Y es que si el miedo se me atraviesa hago un enlace
Con mi inteligencia
Así me entrego en ese trabajo de corazón soy matón
Miro la situación me manifiesto fuerte para dar acción

Tengo campaña y el gobierno sabe en contra los lujos
Para militares
Sobre la fuerza de los repúblicas si señor lo ordeno
A la orden del señor la pausa plaza en la rotación
Tantos minutos horas de guerras días y noches miles de tragedia

Gerardo Ortíz,"Cara ala muerte
Cuando llegaron las balas
No era advertencia
Ni coincidencia
Era la muerte en mi cara
Tiempo que es vida
Blanco ala mira
Asesinato me tenían rodeado
En mi mente, mi familia
En minutos repase mi vida
Puse fuerza, en mi cabeza
Subí tiro a mi cuarenta
Les di pelea

Era esperado
Que me arrimaran un golpe
Cuando hay errores
Hay correcciones
Y le falle a los señores
Hice negocios
Con los contrarios
Fui un chapulin aunque debas usar
Consecuencias ,Que atormentan
Hay errores que nunca se arreglan
Si la muerte,Comprendiera
Y si el momento cambiara la escena
Que me coma la tierra

Con la fuerza paraba las balas
El impacto dio una alta descarga
No hubo tiempo de hacer el intento
Sin piedad perforaban mi cuerpo
Con mis manos tapaba mis sesos
Y la Sangre corría entre mi cuerpo
Ya lo rojo en lo blanco vestía, era la
Despedida,No tenia salida

Todo era blanco
Agonizaba en mi llanto
Solo en minutos
Se aproximaba
Era el eterno descanso
Muerte en la escena
Luz de sirenas
Los agresores tomaron vereda
En segundos Tocaban mi vida
Y el espacio quedo en mi familia
Solo Balas y un hombre tirado
Y en su cara un lienzo empapado
Era el afectado

Pobre y sin llanto
Y cantidad de rosarios
Buenos amigos
Hijos queridos
Ya les falle en el camino

Entrajesado

Le pedí la silla me integre al negocio
Yo se que estoy chavo pero me e ganado
Seguí sus concejos y así lo e logrado

Buenas amistades honor a mi padre
Se tomo un descanso por autoridades
Pero sigue activo la empresa y su equipo
Hoy no esta el viejón pero aquí esta su hijo

Tengo dos amigo, el cuarto y el cinco estamos entrados
Con todo el equipo
Voy encarrerado  pero con cuidado
Así me trabajo no corre peligro

Ya tengo me casa, Culiacán mi plaza
Aquí todos saben quien es el quemando
El whisky y las damas me alegran el alma
Para los negocios yo tengo palabra

Yo soy Chavo Félix feliz e vivido
Tengo mi familia mis ojos mis hijo
Quiero ser tranquilo pero si hay peligro
Me hierve la sangre en caliente me activo

Voy encaramado siempre asegurado
Hay unos conflictos me ando con cuidado
Cuando tengo tiempo me pongo contento
Escuchando corridos con buenos amigos

Ahí tengo testigos de lo que e vivido
Es fuerte el camino pero sigo vivo
Muchas amistades y reconocidas
Amigo y cuñado deberás lo estimo

Si quiero una dama o un grupo norteño
Hago invitaciones  y alegre me enfiesto
Mi gente a mi lado, también mi cuñado
Le gusta la fiesta estamos acoplados

Entre las canciones, algunos corridos
Intercambio palabras así convivimos
Llegan de invitados los ántrax mentados
Defienden la plaza son buenos amigos

Gerardo Ortíz,"El problema no es dejarla el problema es olvidarla
No he encontrado la manera
De decirle que la quiero su cara su cama
Sus besos los recuerdos en mi pecho

Su cuerpo, divino, que tristes olvido olvido, se que debes olvidarme
Me converti en un cobarde
Y te enrede entre mi cadena de problemas ahi que pena
Mis celos, desprecios se fueron
Agotando

Buenos tiempos, lo siento, cariño que tristes olvido, olvido
Ojala que en tu camino se aparesca
Gente buena

Ojala y que pronto encuentres con quien
Mirar las estrellas
Ojala que mi recuerdo no te
Arruine una sonrisa, que frio
Se siente dificil es perderte
Para siempre que tristes
Olvido lo siento no merezco
Tu cariño olvido

Ojala que en tu camino se aparesca
Gente buena ojala y que pronto
Encuentres con quien mirar las
Estrellas ojala que mi recuerdo no te
Arruine una sonrisa, que frio se siente
Dificil es perderte para siempre que
Tristes olvido lo siento no merezco

Contra el poder del estado
Y desde aquel avil recuerdo del año
77 desde entonces no he parado
Yo trabajo pa mi pueblo
Tengo un gran equipo armado
Mil historias an contado hoy por
Ser primer ministro me mantienen señalado

Y me mantienen señalado pero
No sean preguntado quien ayudara
A este pueblo como yo se eh ayudado
Lo recalco y lo repito y bien queda confirmado
Que seguire trabajando contra el poder del estado
Esta no es una amenaza
Es un echo y lo he logradoo

Soy del rancho de la tuna
Serca de badiraguato y desde
Aque 12 de enero del 2001 recuerdo
Me les pele pa mi rancho
Y de las cosas importantes que hoy
Existen en mi vida, el nivel de mis negocios
Amistades de mis socios, el calor de mi familia
El calor de mi familia de mis hijos adorados
Sin olvidas a mis viejas pues soy muy rnamorado
El golde de la famila como olvidar ami hijo
Siempre lo llebo en mi mente como ivan y alfredito
Del estado y mi jente

Que te toque el frío y acaricie con sus manos

Ahora que no estoy no puedes entender
Que no valoraste todo mi querer
Que no me convencen tus dedicaciones
Quieres que regrese con esas canciones
Que te llore el cielo

Que te llore el cielo
Que el entienda tus razones
Que solo el recuerdo te desangre y te traicione
Que te sepa amargo el vivir sin mi
Que ya no soportes sin saber de mi
Solo tu jugaste con mis sentimientos
Yo no soy costumbre de tus pasatiempos
Que te llore el cielo

Te quiero decir que la verdad te extraño
Ahora tu presencia ya no me hace daño
Yo no soy costumbre yo no soy dinero
Vas a recordar lo mucho que te quiero
Y cuando eso pase quiero que por dentro
Sientas que le falta una parte a tu cuerpo
Ese corazón que tienes disfrazado
Porque fue un error haberme enamorado

Que te llore el cielo
Porque yo no puedo y la verdad no quiero
Ya se terminó mi amor
Ya se terminó mi amor
Que te llore el cielo

Que te llore el cielo
Que te empape de emociones
Con agua bendita, él tal vez si te perdone

Tal vez te libere de ese gran demonio
Y quizás te atrape la traición y el odio
Como tu lo hiciste te lo harán un día
Y vas a implorar tener una salida
Que te llore el cielo

Que te llore el cielo
Que él comprenda tus razón
No quiero ni el mas mínimo recuerdo solo borrones
Que tus celos lloren al oír mi nombre
Que por un coraje demuestres el cobre
Solo fue una falsa, fue todo una mentira
Ojalá algún día cures esa herida
Que te llore el cielo

Te quiero decir que la verdad te extraño
Ahora tu presencia ya no me hace daño

Gerardo Ortíz,"Solo vine a despedirme
Aprovechar el momento
Y para darte unas caricias
Mirarte a la cara respirar tu aliento

Y no creas que soy inhumano
pero quiero ese recuerdo
Y quiero llevarlo grabado como una escena en mi pensamiento

solo vine a despedirme
Y me duele este momento
Y solo tomare mis cosas dejare tu cama no querrás saberlo

Porque no puedo ver tu cara
Y la verdad me esta doliendo
Estoy al borde se mojan mis ojos no querrás saberlo
Y yo se que tu no lo esperabas
Pero el dolor se ve en tu cara
Se que presientes y se que lo sientes que mas esperabas

Con la gente que mas quiero y los que andan a mi lado
Muy tranquilo me han mirado por las calles del salado
Ahí tengo a mi familia, cariño, respeto
Mi madre, que es lo mas agrado

Ay nomas)

Lo miran pasar seguido en un carro deportivo
Sin problemas, no hay motivos, el muchacho es decidido
Para arreglar un problema, cabeza, destreza
Así lo miro desde niño

El respeto pa' mi padre porque se ha ganado el mando
No hay palabras pa' a explicarle, se que tengo su respaldo
En las buenas y en las malas, lo tengo presente
Pues siempre me ha echado la mano

Yo no soy de esos 
De los que mandan 
Flores y versos 
Tratare de enamorarte 
Tengo un plan pa convencerte

Yo no acostumbro tantas palabras 
Mejor te lleno de besos las faldas

Yo sé que al pensarlo 
Te muerdes los labios 
Sé que te derriten 
Mis planes macabros 

""Millones de besos"" millones de veces 
En el punto exacto hasta ver que enloqueces 
No la pienses tanto porque ya no aguanto 
Y ahorita en caliente vamos a besarnos

Si le gusta mija vamos a intentarlo

Se puso la cosa buena 
Y con el uno cinco 
Activo y bien alerta 
Existen instrucciones 
Problemas sobre las mesas 
Y cuando tienen gane 
Muy seguido se enfiestan 

Es muy bueno el amigo 
Está de sobra decirlo 
Humilde con la gente 
Del jefe el consentido 
Ya tienen muy buen equipo 
De plano ya estamos listos 
El dedo en el gatillo 
Y al cien con el rayito

Metieron inteligencia 
Y como hombre advertido 
Muy pocos se tropiezan 
Me gusta pasar el rato 
Un trago, una buena pieza 
A mí no se me sube 
La copa a la cabeza

También los tomo en cuenta

Que saca la vuelta 
No nos quita el sueño 
Porque unos respetan 
Se ríen a la espalda 
Y quema la leña 
Para que ser malo 
Nada bueno dejan 
Y siendo realistas 
Aquí el mundo rueda 
Y por ahí nos vemos 
Cuando de la vuelta 

La leyenda dura 
Pa donde voltees 
Se ha puesto difícil 
Han caído plebes 
Así nos toco 
Estar en este ambiente 
Ya no hay vuelta atrás 
También hay billetes 
Música y amigos 
Cerveza y el vino 
Tampoco nos faltan

24 horas al día 
De guerra no lo han cansado 
No importa cuál sea el terreno 
Esté pesado, esté liviano

Que no somos montoneros 
No traemos ese estilo

Ya no van contra Julián mercado
Puro pa' adelante, viejo

Sin hacerle promoción 
Muchos primero amenazan

Ya se imaginan quien soy 
Y eso es porque de hoy en día 
Pa' ellos no hay comparación 
Porque estos de verdad le entran

En el tiempo que llevabamos sin vernos
Dos niños pequeños
Que lo sentían todo y lo sigo sintiendo hoy por ti

Recuerdos que tengo
No entiendo que dejaramos de vernos
Buscando mil besos
Que no son nuestros besos deseo estar contigo hasta morir

Desesperándome
Te he buscado en mis sueños y ahogándome

Y volverá
Seguro que volverá
Y sigo sintiendo y te echo de menos
De acá de mi soledad

Y volverá
Te juro que volverá
Ese amor verdadero cuando era pequeño
Seguro que volverá

Y volverá

Te miro, mi tiempo
Y siento que tú eres lo que quiero
Mi niño, mi sueño
Todo eso que no tengo y que sigo sintiendo hoy por ti

Desesperándome
Te he buscado en mis sueños y ahogándome

Y volverá
Seguro que volverá

Ese amor verdadero cuando era pequeño

Me estoy volviendo loco aqui sin ti

Acordamos alejarnos por un tiempo

Para ver quién podría resistirse a los recuerdos 
Y olvidarse de todo

En las cachas del fierro que tiene
Y un cuerno chapeado por un lado
Por Culiacán terreneando

Las troconas circulando
Y el viene al mando

Aquellos tiempos con Barbarino
Podría decir fueron mis pininos
Hoy con Archivaldo estoy al tiro
Con el Panu y Alfredito

Brindo mi apoyo y equipo
Peguen el grito

Rezo a mi niña de la guadaña
Porque es la que siempre me acompaña
Salgo a las misiones en caliente
Ya no hay nada que me arriende

Yo voy puro para enfrente
No se atraviesen

Tamos forjando un cigarro verde
Y en Mazatlán es donde lo prende
Y así paso el rato y me relajo

En Tijuana fui raizado
Hoy aquí andamos

Compa Marcial aún lo recordamos
Y a don Manuel aunque esté guardado
Con Whisky 18 pa' ambientarnos

Le gane el cajón
Al que comento y gritaba sus planes
En su lista yo, que posiciono entre los principales
Me hice cazador, porque ser la presa no es agradable
No van a quitarme lo que con amor me dio mi madre

Dijo la violencia, que era permitido actuar en respuesta
Supe ser oveja, cuando se acercaron con las ofensas
Los miro al a vuelta, se escuchaba un lobo entre mi cabeza
Me quedan las balas, se me acabaron las buenas

Otra calavera, ya que mi conciencia sigue contando
Otro que anda fiera, una lacra menos que seguirá circulando

Ganó la confianza y el respeto de los jefes
Siempre fue influyente brazo fuerte y eficiente pa' la empresa

Su muerte de veras pesa

Paseaba en un yate por todo el mediterraneo
Con mi compa César y también con Juan Ignacio
Buenas las pisoteadas, arrancones, de mis gustos los caballos
Y en la feria de Zapopan fueron 7 años ganados

Un avión privado del Medio Oriente llegaba
Cerrando los tratos con los príncipes de Arabia
No había limites ni restricciones, donde quiera conectaba
Las pastillas de efedrina y cuadros de colombiana

¡Y ahí suena compa Jesús, y pa' toda mi gente de La perla!

¡Ay nomás!

Venían como 30 camionetas
Formando las caravanas

Chalecos norincos
Y las cortas para trozar de volada

Deben de saber
No siempre fue malo
Fue un hombre de campo así era el
Le mataron su retoño
Y se le metió el demonio
Ese día de la muerte del cuatro marco
Al viejo y cambió todo

Por ondeado sus mismos contrarios
Le pusieron ese apodo

Y con su cuerno siempre a lado de el
Con El Picho coordinando

Levantando y fusilando

Por la higuera y por la palma
Montando a el espejo
Por los Llanos, bailándolo con la banda
Campeón de la feria ganadera
Con Javier haciendo entrada

Recuerdo una vez
Cuando allá en el rancho
Con marinos se trenzo también
Qué bonito le atoraron
Un boludo les tumbaron
Balas volaron quemaron carros
Y pudo salir a salvo
Y una vez se volteó un pistolero
Y ya no está para contarlo

Que va con rumbo al sur
Y quiero que esta noche
Tú me des mi despedida

Muy pronto volveré
Primeramente Dios
Deséame buena suerte
Pedacito de mi vida

Llegando a la estación
Del pueblo a donde voy
Te mando un telegrama
Pa' que sepas mi destino

También la dirección
Y calle donde este
Y así nos escribimos
Aunque sea cada Domingo

Jamás me vayas a olvidar
Así me tarde yo en volver
El día que vuelva por aquí
Si voy por otras tierras
También te llevare

Abrázate de mí
Y bésame otra vez
Para llevar recuerdos
En mi pecho bien grabados

Me marcho más feliz
Llevando tu calor
Y el dulce de tu boca
Saboreando entre mis labios
Jamás me vayas a olvidar
Así me

A tu cuerpo ni tu 
Nombre aclama y le gusta

Correr por la casa con su sonrisa infantil 
Y su inocente alegría, luego se detiene 
Te besa y te abrasa aunque solo 
Acaricia la silla vacía.

Mordiendo el sentimiento
Con el presentimiento

Pregunto las razones
Porque dos corazones
Tan llenos de ilusiones
Se dejan de querer

Y derramar el llano
Por un lejano amor

Vivir desesperado
Vivir atormentado
Sentir que estas cansado
Tan lleno de dolor

Camino por el mundo sin cesar
Como un judío errante sin parar
En sombras y sin luz

Caído y sin amor
Vacío ya por dentro y sin calor
Hasta que dios al fin
Me dé otra vez tu amor

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1997

I can still remember how
That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck

And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But, that's not how it used to be

When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin'

And singin' this'll be the day that I die

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again

So come on Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast

Geresti,"Try to remember the kind of September
When life was slow and oh, so mellow.
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green and grain so yellow.
Try to remember the kind of September
When you were a young and callow fellow,
Try to remember and if you remember then follow.

Try to remember when life was so tender
That no one wept except the willow.
Try to remember when life was so tender
That dreams were kept beside your pillow.
Try to remember when life was so tender
That love was an ember about to billow.
Try to remember and if you remember then follow.

Deep in December it's nice to remember
Although you know the snow will follow.
Deep in December it's nice to remember
Without a hurt the heart is hollow.
Deep in December it's nice to remember
The fire of September that made you mellow.
Deep in December our hearts should remember then follow.

It's a hunger for you
There's a midnight train that keeps on runnin'
Keeps on runnin' through
These empty hours I should be sleeping
Swimming in my dreams
But tonight my mind is dancin'
I'm tearing at the seams

What we had, what we lost
We gave to yesterday
A kiss and a smile, a little while
The heavens blew away

I believe in destiny
One more time for you and me
So let it out and let me in
We can fly, so let's begin
I believe in destiny
Tonight is ours eternally
So give it up and make it true
Set me free 'cause I want you

Gotta keep this moment moving
It's a deja vu
Your memory keeps rolling in
But light keeps spinning through

But though we're both far away
We've never been apart
Time and space, can it race
The love that's in my heart

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A mon regard
Tu vois tout ce que je désire...
Pourquoi demander aux autres
Un roman plus merveilleux ?
Un amour comme le nôtre
Il n'en existe pas deux.

Je sais, les romans c'est certain,
T'emmènent en des pays lointains
Sous des ciels bleus, de clairs rivages...
Oui, mais là-bas qu'y trouve-t-on ?
Des rues, des taxis, des maisons...
Chérie, méfie-toi des mirages...
Tiens, regarde notre intérieur
Des livres, des chansons, des fleurs
Et mes deux bras pour te bercer...
Et mon coeur pour toujours t'aimer...

Refrain",Un Amour Comme le Notre,2002
German All Stars,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune

We were more than sweethearts,
It's so hard to understand.

Don't know why it happened,
Don't know how it started,
Why should we be strangers,
After all we planned.

I can't show my face,
Can't go anyplace,
People stop an' stare,
It's so hard to bear,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town

Every time we meet,
My heart skips a beat,
We don't stop to speak,
'Though it's just a week,
Everybody knows you left me,
It's the talk of the town
 
We send out invitations,
To friends and relations,
Announcing our weddin' day
Friends and our relations,
Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood,

Che danno spazio a dispiaceri che guardano soltanto a ieri

Tutto con il contagocce questa vita nuova

Che danno spazio ai dispiaceri che guardano soltanto a ieri

when my heart can beat no more
I hope I die for a principle 
Or a belief that I have lived for
I will die before my time
Because I feel the shadow's depth
So much I wanted to accomplish 
Before I reached my death
I have to come to grips with the possibility
And wiped the last tear from my eyes
I loved all who were positive
In the event of my demise

In the event of my demise don't shed no tear
I'll share my wisdom with the world, they'll know I was here
Know I was clear, every thing I said I meant
A outlaw, when I was born they prepared my ditch
Said I won't live long, statistic showed
I'm tryna past 24 realistic goal, listen all
You gotta stay cold inside
That's what I tell myself when I feel alone sometime
But I can't cry, I don't tear no more
I love god, from death I don't fear no more
A part taken in this movement to better my people
Though they see me on TV, I tell them we equal
Don't look at me as a stranger, I'm one of your own
We was rised in concrete and grew as a rose
Still I rise, but never get a chance to fly
Mama please don't cry 
In the event of my demise

In the event of my demise
can't breathe no more
hope I die for a principle 
something I lived for
dying before my time
feel the shadows of depth
Trying to fulfill all my dreams before I reach my death
came to grips with the possibility
The world's killing me, and my soldiers die young with no sympathy
I wipe the last tear from my eyes
I loved all who stand strong
In the event of my demise

If I should die before I awake
let my family be straight of the money I make
Give my son, what he needs, other than his father
Is it self respect, better get his honor
with the law come to swallow my soul, it's so big
Cause the street took enough of my life, we all see
It's a cycle make you feel psycho
Everything struggles behind this man, see nobody love you
Got a piece of the streets and it's gonna die with me
may your, soul forgive me
Makaveli's within me
In principle we stand by stronger than power
We gon' die by the rules you can never devour
On the earth from my birth fell nothing but pain
Only thing I ever gave was the baby the name
That's my heart, and if I should go I'll go on in sparks
That's the event of my demise, and it lurks in the dark

[Chorus]

Now as I stand here, a man here
Not a perfect one, but a searching one
Seek in another, blazing time
Sound crazy but I'm actually tryin' to escape my mind
Tryna rise in time
but hoping that you didn't notice
When i was at my low as
So I knew they were watching, I couldn't stop it
So many things I wanted to accomplish
Too many dreams, wasted with no promise
From out the darkness I struggle to see the light
Rumble deep in the night
Hustlin' with all of my might
Some won't see it that way
But us is given praise
But all of them will dream
That I did it my way
In the event of my demise

I was born to a storm that won't lead up
And I was raised to stay brave with my head up
But thing ain't got better
We still gettin' wetter in this bad weather
I need more than a sweater and a leather
Yo, ain't nothin' meant to last forever
So the struggling and the ?starving? ain't gon' last forever
And my will, probably be like two lines long
It will read I'm dead but my soul lives on
And my spirit still living though my body is gone
In the event of my demise I love all who stay strong
I love all who stay strong
In the event of my demise, com'on

If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny

Gerry,"Don't let the sun catch you cryin'  
The night's the time for all your tears  
Your heart may be broken tonight  
But tomorrow in the morning light  
Don't let the sun catch you cryin'    

The night-time shadows disappear  
And with them go all your tears  
For the morning will bring joy  
For every girl and boy  
So don't let the sun catch you cryin'   

We know that cryin's not a bad thing  
But stop your cryin' when the birds sing 

It may be hard to discover  
That you've been left for another  
But don't forget that love's a game  
And it can always come again

Gerry,"Abilene, Abilene,
Prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene

I sit alone most every night
Watch those trains pull out of sight
Don't I wish they were carrying me
Back to Abilene, my Abilene

Abilene, Abilene,
Prettiest town I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean
In Abilene, my Abilene

Crowded city, ain't nothing free
Nothing in this old town for me
Wish to the Lord that I could be
In Abilene, sweet Abilene

Gerry & the Pacemakers,"When you walk through a storm
Hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark

At the end of a storm
There's a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone

You'll never walk alone

With hope in your heart

Don't you ever go away

Don't you ever take your love from me
'Cause it's with you I wanna stay

If you do, I know just what I'll do, I'll be ever blue
But if you stay and give your love to me, well, I'll be ever true

I've loved you from the very start
Why do you try to break my heart?

I'll be faithful, I'll be true, I'll never be blue
So if you stay and give your love to me, well, I'll be ever true
