Merl Saunders,"Now my room has got two windows but the sunshine never comes through,
You know it's always dark and dreary since I broke off, baby, with
you!
CHORUS:
I live on a lonely avenue,
My little girl wouldn't say, ""I do"".
Well, I feel so sad and blue
and it's all because of you.
I could cry, I could cry, i could cry,
I could die, I could die, I could die,
because I live on a lonely avenue, lonely avenue.
2. (Now my) covers they feel like lead and my pillow it feels like
stone,
Well, I've tossed and turned so ev'ry night,
I'm not used to being alone!
CHORUS
3. Now I've been so sad and lonesome since you've left this town,
If I could beg or borrow the money, child, I would be a highway
bound!
CHORUS",Lonely Avenue,1992
Merl Saunders,"Virgil Caine is the name, and I served on the Danville train
'Til Stoneman's cavalry came and it tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65, we were hungry, just barely alive
By May tenth, Richmond had fell, it's a time I remember, oh so well

The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and all the bells were ringing
The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and all the people were singin'
They went

Back with my wife in Tennessee, when one day she called to me
""Say Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E. Lee!""
Now I don't mind choppin' wood, and I don't care if my money's no good
Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and all the bells were ringing
The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and all the people were singin'
They went

Like my father before me, I will work the land
And like my brother up above me, who took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave, but a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet, you can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat

The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, when all the bells were ringing
The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and you could hear 'm all singin'

Merl Saunders,"I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I was hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her""
Yah! Hey, hey, hey
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah!
Ah, I was made to love her
Built my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey
Oo baby, I was made to please her
You know Stevie ain't gonna leave her, no

Tough Mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?

Dark Beauty, Won't you move it on over and make some room?
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
You came through it all the way, flyin' through the skies.
Dark Beauty With that long night's journey in your eyes.

Sweet Goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you've been.
Jack the Cowboy went up north He's buried in your past.
The Lone Wolf went out drinking That was over pretty fast.
Sweet Goddess Your perfect stranger's comin' in at last.

Silver Angel, with the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve,
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you would receive. Today on the
Countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch, I stood alone upon the ridge
And all I did was watch. Sweet Goddess It must be time to carve another
Notch.

I'm crestfallen, the world of illusion is at my door,
I ain't haulin' any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
The prison walls are crumblin', there is no end in sight,
I've gained some recognition but I lost my appetite.
Dark Beauty Meet me at the border late tonight.

But only for one night with no repeat.
And maybe you'll go away and never call,
And a taste of honey is worse that none at all.

In that case I don't want nobody
I do believe that that would only break my heart
Oh, but if you feel like lovin' me
If you got the notion,
I second that emotion.
So, if you feel like giving me a lifetime of devotion
I second that emotion.

Maybe you'll think that love will tie you down
And you don't have the time to hang around.
Or maybe you'll think that love will make us fools,
And so it makes you wise to break the rules.

Tough Mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?

Dark Beauty, Won't you move it on over and make some room?
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
You came through it all the way, flyin' through the skies.
Dark Beauty With that long night's journey in your eyes.

Sweet Goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you've been.
Jack the Cowboy went up north He's buried in your past.
The Lone Wolf went out drinking That was over pretty fast.
Sweet Goddess Your perfect stranger's comin' in at last.

Silver Angel, with the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve,
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you would receive. Today on the
Countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch, I stood alone upon the ridge
And all I did was watch. Sweet Goddess It must be time to carve another
Notch.

I'm crestfallen, the world of illusion is at my door,
I ain't haulin' any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
The prison walls are crumblin', there is no end in sight,
I've gained some recognition but I lost my appetite.
Dark Beauty Meet me at the border late tonight.

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Too used to that certain someone to offer my love to anyone new
My excuse for not wanting no one too used to being with you
Some other's arms may hold and caress you
Some other's lips may burn on my own
That's why your eyes are filled with their beauty
My heart inside will be crying alone

Other offers are just the past time
You'll find their love just a cheap imitation
The love they offer's not real genuine

Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be

I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile will be worth my while
When I go the distance I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though the road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It may take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no, I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope but I won't lose hope
Till I go the distance and my journey is complete

But to look beyond the glory
Is the hardest part
For a hero's strength
Is measured by his heart

Like a shooting star I can go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far I can go the distance
Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms

I will search the world
I will face its harms
Till I find my hero's welcome
Waiting in your arms

Bring that water round
If you don't like your job
Set that water bucket down

Just to draw my pay

And wishing that you were here

When you filled my heart with cheer

I remember the nights when all alone
We sang Sweet Adeline

In my heart old pal of mine

The old pals are always the best you see
New friends you can find every day
But they can't fill their places or ever be
Like the old pals of yesterday

I'm wondering where you are tonight
And if you ever think of me
It would make my weary heart
So light sweetheart your face again to see

But in my checkered life I find
Nothing comes right it seems
Still you'll always be a pal of mine

Though another is taking from me the best pal I've ever had
She's taking the sunshine with her leaving the clouds for me
But why should I be so lonesome when there's nobody lonesome for me

My daddy plowed the ground and promised someday we would leave

Then one night I heard my daddy sayin' to my momma
That he'd finally saved enough to go
California was his dream, a paradise, for he had seen
Pictures in magazines that told him so

California cotton fields 
Where labor camps were filled with weary men with broken dreams
California cotton fields 
As close to wealth as daddy ever came

Nearly everything we had was sold or left behind
From my daddy's plow to the soup that momma canned
Some folks came to say farewell or see what all we had to sell
Some just came to shake my daddy's hand
That model A was loaded down and California bound
A change of luck was just four days away
But the only change that I remember seeing in my daddy
Was when his dark hair turned to silver grey

And we'd count our many blessings, one by one

Of ours is full of trouble

If we'd found more Bibles on the tables
And mothers singing rock of ages, cleft for me

His home is just a disgrace to the town

He'd better pass some laws and tear it down

Maybe even plant some dogwood trees
I guess that they've forgotten
When we were kids what that place used to be

There's not a boy in this whole town
Hasn't stopped for water at his well
Or sat on his porch in the evenin'
And listened to the stories that he'd tell

Oh, his hair was the color of a cotton field
And his skin was old and brown
And he was born in that rundown shack
Before there was a town

He bought that shack and a piece of earth
For the highest price to pay
His mom was bought and sold there
Uncle Lem was born'd a slave

The mayor and some ladies of the garden club
Went out to tell Uncle Lem that he'd have to find a new place to live
Well, they found him there in that old broken down rockin' chair
And on an old paper bag they found his will

""Nor I wanna leave my old shotgun to the fine mayor of this town
For I remember when he a little fella, he used to follow me around
I wish I had more to give to my friends that I love
But all I've got is this old shack and a piece of earth
And I want it to go to the ladies of the garden club""

I must have dropped my comb somewhere
And a man must stay well groomed
It seems I have the right to stay but I know you don't agree

Above the door, there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock and there would stand a stranger

The corn was dry and the weeds were high when Daddy took to drinking
Him and Lucy Walker, they took up and ran away
Mama cried a tear and then she promised fourteen children
I swear you'll never see a hungry day

When Mama sacrificed her pride, the neighbors started talkin'
But I was much too young to understand the things they said
The thing that mattered most of all was Mama's chicken dumplings
And a goodnight kiss before we went to bed

Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock and there would stand a stranger

Not one neighbor volunteered to give a helping hand
So let them gossip all they want, she loved us and she raised us
The truth is standing here, the full grown man

Last summer Mama passed away and left the ones who loved her
Each and every one is more than grateful for their birth
Each Sunday she receives the fresh bouquet of fourteen roses
And a card that reads, 'The greatest Mom on earth'

There's days she almost loves me down to nothin'
And turns around and hates my very soul
So I always wear a T-shirt and a jacket

Merle Haggard,"In downtown Modesto, I was workin' the Holiday Inn
I would stick with a gig that would last us throughout the weekend
I was singing a new song I'd wrote on the way into town
When she came in the front door and found her a place to sit down

Hey, I knew right away that she like the words to my song
Cause she stared at my git guitar and followed my fingers too long
And she had the likeness of a girl I'd seen in my dreams
But lights can do wonders with make up and faded blue jeans

And the last thing I needed was somebody messin' up my mind
So I found a hundred reasons for lookin' her way one more time
She could cause me to sing bad and fall out of love with guitar
And blow all my chances and at bein' a big singing star

With one passin' glance I could tell she was young for her age
Yeah, she got to looking better as she got down closer to the stage
And as she sipped on her wine I knew just the kind she would be
And somehow I knew she was here to the bad things to me

There's where she came to meet me as I stepped down off of 51 and needed sleep
And the baby's overdue I know you need some things

These rails keep getting longer and this feeling's getting stronger she won't let me be

That talks about South Texas where the cactus is in bloom
I feel I oughta be there every evening after dark
To hear the fiddler fiddlin' around a tune called Old Joe Clark

We played that show in Tulsa then it was Ft Worth bound
We headed south on 35 to that South Texas town
It's a different world and a lot of fun if you like that country sound
You can find yourself a partner when they boil that cabbage down

If you're ever down in Texas and feeling all alone

I've written words in many ways to make them rhyme
And at times I've stolen notes that wadn't mine

The bartender knows me, he knows how you do me
And he knows why I'm back here again
He should be given a prize for his patience

Jukebox records don't play those wedding bells.
Looking at the world through the bottom of a glass

Sit down beside me and say its alright
Take me home and make sweet love to me tonight.

But here I am again mixing misery and gin
Sitting with all my friends and talking to myself.

There's a bright and a sunny side too

It will help you everyday
It will brighten all the way
If you'll keep on the sunny side of life

Oh the storm in its fury broke today
Crushing hopes that I cherish so dear
But clouds and storms will soon pass away
And the sun again will shine bright and clear

So keep on the sunny side...

Though the moments be cloudy or fair
Let us trust that our Saviour always
Will keep us, everyone, in his care

When Leonard finally came to California
He was twenty-one years old, as I recall
He loved to write a song and pick on the guitar
And he came to hang a gold one on the wall

The town in which he lived is not important
But you'll know which town I mean by the time I'm through
He soon became a famous entertainer
But Leonard was a name he never used

He was on his way to having what he wanted
Just about as close as one could be
Hey, once he even followed Elvis Presley
And he wrote a lot of country songs for me

But he laid it all aside to follow Jesus
For years he chose to let his music go
But preaching wasn't really meant for Leonard
But how in the hell was Leonard s'posed to know

Well, life began to twist it's way around him
And I wondered how he carried such a load
He came back again to try his luck in music
And lost his wife and family on the road

After that he seemed to bog down even deeper
And I saw what booze and pills could really do
And I wondered if I'd ever see him sober
But I forgot about a friend that Leonard knew

Well, Leonard gave me lots of inspiration
He helped teach me how to write a country song
And he even brought around a bag of groceries
Hey, back before Muskogee came along

I wish I knew which way to turn and go
I feel so good and then, then I feel so bad
I wonder what I ought to do

If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got no where to run
Another sinking sun and one more lonely night

The wind keeps blowing, somewhere, everyday
Tell me things get better, somewhere, up the way
Just dismal thinking on a dismal day
And sad songs for us to bare

If I could only fly
If we could only fly
If we could only fly
There'd be no more lonely nights

You know, sometimes, I write happy songs
Then some little thing goes wrong
I wish they all could make you smile

Coming home soon and I wanna stay
Maybe we can, somehow, get away
I wish you could come with me when I go again

Merle Haggard,"We left out of Tucson with no destination in mind
We were runnin' from trouble and the jail-term the Judge had in mind
And the border meant freedom, a new life and romance
And that's why we thought we should go
And start our lives over on the seashores of old Mexico

Our first night in Juarez, we lost all the money we had
One bad senorita made use of two innocent lad
But we must keep on runnin' it's too late to turn back
And we wanted in Tucson, we know
An' things'll blow over on the seashores of old Mexico

Two Mexican farmers en route to a town, I can't say
Let us ride on the back of a flatbed half-loaded with hay
Down through Durango, Colima, Almiera
Then in the Manzanillos
Where we slept in the sunshine on the seashores of old Mexico

After one long siesta, we came wide awake in the night
We were startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight
Our new-found companion, one young Senorita
Who offered a broken hello
To the gringo she found on the seashores of old Mexico

She spoke of Sonora and swore that she'd never return
For her Mexican husband, she really had no great concern
'Cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo
Well that's all I needed to know
We found what we needed on the seashores of old Mexico

And the pistol rode west with the sun
Now the outlaws of Tombstone and the outlaws forever
Know that death is the way of the gun

They fought side by side, undefeated each time
Speed of their guns were the same
From dark city Kansas to wild Arizon
All outlaws alike knew their name

A shotgun, a pistol, known the world over as
The two biggest guns in the west
But the whole town of Tombstone knew the friendship was shakin'
And they wondered which one was the best

Only a shootout could settle the question
That lay heavy on everyone's mind
Whiskey and loose talk and their love for a woman
Made the shoot out a matter of time

And the pistol rode west with the sun
Now the outlaws of Tombstone and the outlaws forever

That lived up to it's blood-thirsty name
Some said the pistol, some said the shotgun
Some said the town was to blame

But some outlaws named Clanton and the O.K Corral
Changed history and canceled the game
When the shootout was over and the outlaws lay dyin'

The shadows lengthen fast
Come home, come home it's suppertime 
We're going home at last""

Some of my fondest memories of my childhood 
Are woven around suppertime
When my mother used to call from the backsteps 
Of the old homeplace
She said ""come home, son, it's suppertime"" 
Oh what I'd give to hear that one more time
But you know time has woven a realization 
Of truth that is even more thrilling
And that's when we get that call from the 
Greatest glory to come home on suppertime

The table with the love of himself
And we'll celebrate the greatest suppertime of all

With no place to go or shelter anywhere
And it took a while to realize the reason for the dream

The storm was on the trouble we've been having
No shelter was the answer we can't find
And the screaming of the raging wind that chilled me to the bone
Must have been heavy on my mind
And when today you called to tell me it was over
Lord I knelt when the phone began to ring
Yeah it took a while to understand the reason of it all

Outrun the law or spend my life in jail

I'd like to settle down but they won't let me

I'm on the run, the highway is my home

Of having one I love to come along

It's so hard to realize we're through
When we quit, you said you'd always love me

I'll never forget our days together
Even though I know they're very few
I loved you then and will forever
And I wonder if you feel the way I do

Yeah it's the same thing
Fiddle man, fiddle

It's the strangest and the sweetest love, dear
That two people ever knew
You told me that I need not worry
That forever you'd be true

Through this dreary world, alone, I wander
My thoughts will always be with you
But it seems to me, there's no use living
And I wonder if you feel the way I do

For a memory of a man who's chain and bound
Lord knows you need a man and an understandin' hand
Before you run completely out of love

You can't stay in love with a memory
You can't stay in love with a dream
Yet you've fallen in love with the picture on the wall

That cold December day, they took her man away
Never dreamin' of a gentle heart they've grown
Now she waits by the phone, she waits there all alone
But the only one who ever calls is me

Now I'm a prisoner of a slave to one way love
And I'd wish they let him go so I'd be free
Break this chains that bind and release this heart of mine
Before I run completely out of love

(Dallas Frazier)
Â« Â© '67 Acuff-Rose Music, BMI Â»

For years I've tried to leave this poor man's valley
On a train that's on its way to richer ground
Where rivers never overflow and dreams cannot be drowned
But the train never stops at our town
I'd like to buy a mansion for my darling
On a way upon a mountain look it down
I know there's a restless goal up there just waitin' to be found
But the train never stops at our town
Failure has to find something to blame
And the only thing that's left is that old frame
The darkness of the night catches me crying
A whistle soon will blow a lonesome sound
A spark of hope becomes a flame each time the train slows down
But the train never stops at our town that old train never stops at our town

Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""

Met a guy with a drink in his hand.

In that muddy water, I long to be once more
When that shadows creep about and the whippoorwill call
You can hear old mommy shout, ""Come in here, you all""

Way down on the levee, strolling in the pale moon light
You can see those steamboats and fields of snowy white
That's a feeling, I can't lose muddy water in my shoes
When I get those Mississippi Delta blues

I'll drink my beer in a tavern

I might get a little tired on the weekend, after I draw my pay
Then I'll go back workin', come Monday morning I'm right back with the crew
I'll drink a little beer that evening
Sing a little bit of these working man blues

Sometimes I think about leaving, do a little bummin' around
I want to throw my bills out the window catch a train to another town
I'll go back working, I gotta buy my kids a brand new pair of shoes
I drink a little beer in a tavern
Cry a little bit of these working man blues, here comes that workin' man

I ain't never been on welfare, 'n that's one place I won't be

All aboard America here comes the freedom train

The freedom train is rolling down two hundred years of track
Two hundred years of glory never to turn back
The train is called America your ticket is a dream
That left the torture of freedom for all the world to see
She left the station in Lexington in 1776
And rode to Philadelphia where the liberty bell was fixed
George Washington was the engineer John Adams shoveled coal
And Franklin punched the tickets Tom Jefferson added soul
All aboard America here comes the freedom train

She rode to New Orleans the battle of 1812
With old Hickory at the throttle she drove the British out
The freedom train's a fine train the toppest of world it seemed
Her whistle blows for the liberty with a mighty head of steam
Wheels of fortune sweaty Pittsburgh rolled across the Mississippi
From Texas to Missouri to one real exciting trip
Then bang of track was broken smashed by a cannonball
That blew in great divided will the nation stand or fall
All aboard America here comes the freedom train

Will Annistage stepped into the cab and the wheels began to roll
Freedom train must never stop Republic never fall
To the bloody fields of Gettysburg the tear show in his eyes
She drove the train with fury the freedom train survive
Again the train rode westward to California shores
To the deserts and prairies even stronger than before
From Atlantic to Pacific she drove the rail with pride
She traveled a track to glory with the good Lord on her side
All aboard America here comes the freedom train

There's much more to this story like Wilson and Roosevelt
They left the train to Truman who stoked it mighty well
Then old Dwight D Eisenhower or LBJ we sing
Two brothers known as Kennedy and Martin Luther King
And still the train rolls forward over history's rugged trail
Straightening by the journey and the land beneath her rail
And you and I roll along and stroke the freedom fire
For we stand to all Americans hold old honor can't be hired

I dreamed I saw Jesus last night

seated on a mountain in the moonlight.

His hands held a key to a cabin

that cabin I'd dreamed of all my life.

Money makes the rules we have to live by.

A home is just a place they send the bills.

God knows why we work and what we pray for.

So He's building me a cabin in the hills.

Who knows He might be finished in the morning.

So I lie awake and take no sleeping pills.

God knows I'm not happy in a mansion.

So He's building me a cabin in the hills.

I live my lonesome life down in a valley with the factories, the rivers, and the mills.

Sometimes I can almost hear his hammer 'cause he's building me a cabin in the hills.

Someone has to keep the home fire burning.

So I sweat and get the harvest in the field.

Life on earth won't be the same hereafter, so he's building me a cabin in the hills.

I live my lonesome life down in a valley with the factories, the rivers and the mills.

Sometimes I can almost hear His hammer 'cause He's

building me a cabin in the hills. He's building me a cabin in the hills.

Riding on that eastbound freight train speeding through the night
Hobo Bill a railroad bum was fighting for his life
The sadness of his eyes revealed the torture of his soul
He raised a weak and weary hand to brush away the cold
Hobo Bill
No warm lights flickered round him no blankets there to hold
Nothing but the howling wind and the driving rain so cold
When he heard a whistle blowing in a dreamy kind of way
The hobo seemed contented for he smiled there where he lay
Hobo Bill
Outside the rain was falling on that lonely boxcar door
But the little form of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor
While the train sped through the darkness and the raging storm outside
No one knew that Hobo Bill was taking his last ride
It was early in the morning when they raised the hobo's head
The smile still lingered on his face but Hobo Bill was dead

Clyde Barrow was the rounder that took her away

Told of the lawmen left dying or dead
Some say that Clyde made her life a shame
But the legend made Bonnie the head of the game

The rampage grew wilder with each passing day
The odds growing smaller with each getaway
With the end growing closer, the harder they fought
With blood on their hands, they were bound to get caught

They drove back from town on one bright summer day
When a man they befriended stepped out in the way
With no thought of dyin' they pulled to the side
But death lay there waiting for Bonnie and Clyde

For robbin' and killin' they both had to pay

Out where the lights are bright

And we can get married tonight.

Ten notches were carved on his gun 
All the boys around Reno Left wild 
Bill's maiden alone. One night when he was returning 
From riding the range in the cold 
He dreamed of his Hollywood sweetheart 
Her love was as lasting as gold. 

As he drew near her window 
A shadow he saw on the shade 
Was the great Philadelphia Lawyer 
Makin' love to his Hollywood maid. 

The night was as still as the desert 
The moon was bright overhead 
Bill listened awhile to the lawyer 
He could hear ev'ry word that he said.

Your form so rare and divine 
Come, go with me to the city 
And leave this wild cowboy behind.""

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

The odds growing smaller with each get-a-way
With the end growing closer the harder they fought
With blood on their hands they were bound to get caught.

Merle Haggard,"I've been walkin' these streets of Nashville
Since I was just a kid
Either in these boots or in my dreams
I spent all I had to buy this Martin
And I've been richer ever since I did
Even though I can't afford to change the strings
I've heard a lot of ""nos"" and ""no thank yous""
Sometimes I wonder why I'm even here
But I still could be an overnight sensation
It would only take one sympathetic ear

(chorus)
If Merle would sing my song, I could go back home
And tell everyone I know that dreams come true
I'd be someone in their eyes, a face that they'd all recognize
I could prove to them and me I wasn't wrong
If Merle would sing my song

I'll bet I've played this guitar
In every honkytonk and bar
But as of yet they haven't noticed me
But this heart and soul of mine
Is filled with memories, chords, and rhymes
And I know that I'm the future they can't see
I could maybe make a million dollars chokin' in a tie
But then I'd have to live with my regret
I know God didn't give me all these dreams to watch 'em die
I'll make it big, it just hasn't happenned yet

Merle Haggard,"There's a little dive on a dead-end road
Called the Cross-Eyed Cricket Waterin' Hole
Where you can hear the sound of a steel guitar
An' get loud an' rowdy with P-B-R
But at the top of every hour, man, you can hear a pin drop
As ol' Jack drops a quarter an' plays Merle on that jukebox, an' we stop

[Chorus]
An' tip our hats
An' raise our glasses of cold, cold beer
They say country's fadin'
But we still wavin' that flag around here
An' when it's time to go, you know you're welcome back
Where the people pledge allegiance to the Hag

When the weekend comes an' the weather's clear
There's a high spot fifteen miles from here
Where you can always find a few dusty trucks
With the windows down an' the radio up
We sit there poppin' tops, shootin' bull an' singin' songs
But you can bet your boots that when Haggard comes on

[Chorus]

One of these days when my time has come
You can take me back to where I'm from
Put me on a westbound train
An' ship me off in the pourin' rain
Don't cry for me when I'm gone
Just put a quarter in the jukebox an' sing me back home

An' tip our hats
An' raise our glasses of cold, cold beer
They say country's fadin'
But just keep wavin' that flag around here
An' I know, it'll keep on comin' back
Long as people pledge allegiance
Where folks still pledge allegiance

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

Merle Haggard,"Way out in Reno Nevada 
Where romance blooms and fades 
A great Philadelphia Lawyer 
Was in love with a Hollywood maid. 
Come, Love, and we will wander 
Out where the lights are bright 
I'll win you a divorce from your husband 
And we can get married tonight. 

Now, Bill was a gun-totin' cowboy 
Ten notches were carved on his gun 
All the boys around Reno Left wild 
Bill's maiden alone. One night when he was returning 
From riding the range in the cold 
He dreamed of his Hollywood sweetheart 
Her love was as lasting as gold. 

As he drew near her window 
A shadow he saw on the shade 
Was the great Philadelphia Lawyer 
Makin' love to his Hollywood maid. 

The night was as still as the desert 
The moon was bright overhead 
Bill listened awhile to the lawyer 
He could hear ev'ry word that he said. 

""Your hands are so pretty and lovely 
Your form so rare and divine 
Come, go with me to the city 
And leave this wild cowboy behind.""

This is one on me
Took my gal to a dance 
At the armory
Music played, dancers swayed
Then we joined the crowd
I can't dance, took a chance
And right then we started
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose
I fell and when I rose
I felt ashamed and told her 
That's the latest step, that's the latest step
That's the latest step, my honey
Notice all the pep, notice all the pep, notice all the pep
She said, ""Stop mumbling, tho you are stumbling
I like it just a little bit, just a little bit, quite a little bit""
 
Young and small short and tall
Folks most everywhere
Take a chance do this dance
They think it's a bear
People rave and they crave 
Just to do this step
Off they go, nice and slow
When the band starts playing
 
Stumbling all around, stumbling all around
Stumbling all around so funny
Stumbling here and there, stumbling everywhere 
And I must declare, I stepped right on her toes
And when she bumped my nose

When I was just a child in momma's arms.
My daddy plowed the ground and promised someday we would leave
This run-down mortgaged Oklahoma farm.
Then one night I heard my daddy sayin' to my momma
That he'd finally saved enough to go.
California was his dream, a paradise, for he had seen
Pictures in magazines that told him so.

California cotton fields,
Where labor camps were filled with weary men with broken dreams.

As close to wealth as daddy ever came.

From my daddy's plow to the soup that momma canned.

We were runnin' from trouble and the jail-term the Judge had in mind
And the border meant freedom, a new life and romance
And that's why we thought we should go
And start our lives over on the seashores of old Mexico

Our first night in Juarez, we lost all the money we had
One bad senorita made use of two innocent lad
But we must keep on runnin' it's too late to turn back
And we wanted in Tucson, we know
An' things'll blow over on the seashores of old Mexico

Two Mexican farmers en route to a town, I can't say
Let us ride on the back of a flatbed half-loaded with hay
Down through Durango, Colima, Almiera
Then in the Manzanillos
Where we slept in the sunshine on the seashores of old Mexico

After one long siesta, we came wide awake in the night
We were startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight
Our new-found companion, one young Senorita
Who offered a broken hello
To the gringo she found on the seashores of old Mexico

She spoke of Sonora and swore that she'd never return
For her Mexican husband, she really had no great concern
'Cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo
Well that's all I needed to know

All I've taken from you

Merle Haggard,"My world is like a river as dark as it is deep
Night after night the past slips in and gathers all my sleep
My days are just an endless stream of emptiness to me
Filled only by the fleeting moments of her memories
Sweet memories
Sweet memories, hmm

She slipped into the silence of my dreams last night
Wondering from room to room turning on each light
Her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea
And I'm swept away from sadness clinging to her memories

Slow walking Jones (deep voice) slow talking Jones along came long lean lanky Jones

Well commercial came on so I got up to get myself a snack
You should have seen what was going on by the time I got back
Down in the old abandoned mine sweet Sue was a havin' fits
That villain said gimme the deed to your ranch or I'll blow you all to bits
And then he grabbed her (and then) he tied her up (and then)
He lit the fuse to the dynamite (and then and then)

Well I got so bugged I turned it off and turned on another show
But there was the same old shoot-em up and the same old rodeo
Salty Sam was a tryin' to stuff Sweet Sue in a burlap sack
He said if you don't give me the deed to your ranch

You've started back doin' the things you used to do

As I was motivatin' over the hill I saw Maybelline in a Coupe DeVille
Cadillac rollin' on an open road but nothin' outrun my V8 Ford
Cadillac doin' about ninety-five bumper to bumper rollin' side to side
Oh Maybelline...

Well the Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It done got cloudy and started to rain I tooted my horn for the passing lane
The rain water poured up under my motor hood I knew that were doin' my motor good

Well now the heat went down and the motor cooled down
And that's when I heard that highway sound

Workin' for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'

I said, ""Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river""

George you know I cleaned a lot of things down in Memphis
Popped a lot of cane in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
Till I hitched a ride on this river boat queen

Big wheels keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keeps on burnin'
I said, ""Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river""

Well if you come down to the river
Well I bet you gonna find some people joining who do you
You don't have to worry George if you have no money

My heart's a beatin' rhythm and my soul keeps a singin' the blues

We caught the rollin' arthritis sittin' down at a rhythm review

Outside the rain was falling on that lonely boxcar door
But the little form of Hobo Bill lay still upon the floor

Merle Haggard & the Strangers,"I have often dreamed of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be

I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile will be worth my while
When I go the distance I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though the road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It may take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no, I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope but I won't lose hope
Till I go the distance and my journey is complete

But to look beyond the glory
Is the hardest part
For a hero's strength
Is measured by his heart

Like a shooting star I can go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far I can go the distance
Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms

I will search the world
I will face its harms
Till I find my hero's welcome
Waiting in your arms

Just to draw my pay

Why am I lonesome thinking of someone I'm thinking only of you

And wishing that you were here

In my heart old pal of mine

The old pals are always the best you see
New friends you can find every day
But they can't fill their places or ever be
Like the old pals of yesterday

I'm wondering where you are tonight
And if you ever think of me
It would make my weary heart
So light sweetheart your face again to see

But in my checkered life I find
Nothing comes right it seems
Still you'll always be a pal of mine

Oh the moon light's so bright makes me lonely tonight
Everything seems to make me feel blue here
I'm down hearted now I'm lonesome somehow
Cause you are proving untrue
Why should I be so lonely why should I be sad
Though another is taking from me the best pal I've ever had
She's taking the sunshine with her leaving the clouds for me
But why should I be so lonesome when there's nobody lonesome for me
Oh the violets so blue are calling for roses so sweet make me lonely
They bring to my mind a sweet happy time when your love was only for me
Why should I be so lonely...

Of ours is full of trouble

Merle Haggard & the Strangers,"Now when the big bad wolf got in grandma's house
A little Red Ridinghood was scared as the mouse
And just like her I'm scared through and through
Some two legged wolf would run away with you

So run 'em off, no use to talk all day
Run 'em off, they're tryin' to get you to play
Run 'em off and make 'em let us be
If you don't run 'em off, I swear you're cheatin' on me

Now there's an iceman and milkman and folks out of town
They don't come to visit they just hang around
They act just as friendly as can be
But I don't think they care a thing about me

So run 'em off, don't talk too long
Run 'em off, so we can be alone
Run 'em off and make 'em let us be
If you don't run 'em off, I swear you're cheatin' on me

No matter where you are or what you do
Folks start to whistle and how is you
When they get too close I wanna say, ""Shoo""
'Cause it looks like they wanna take what bother you

So run 'em off, don't talk too long
Run 'em off, they are tryin' to get you in Dutch
Run 'em off and make 'em let us be
If you don't run 'em, off I swear you're cheatin' on me

Now once I ended this song but I write so more
'Cause there's a half-a-dozen wolfs comin' up to my door
And I can tell by a lookin' 'cause it's plain to see
That they're not here to make eyes at me

So run 'em off, don't talk too long
Run 'em off, so we can be alone
Run 'em off and make 'em let us be
If you don't run 'em off, I swear you're cheatin' on me

Grey skies never come when I'm with you
Good times hang around only when you're here at home
The sunny side of my life is here with you

Standing at my window watching raindrops hit the ground
Countin' up the days you've been away
It's lonely here without you and the blues had got me down
Come on home and brighten up my days

I'm on the run, the highway is my home
I raised a lot of Cain back in my younger days 
While Mama used to pray my crops would fail

Outrun the law or spend my life in jail

I'd like to settle down but they won't let me

One and only rebel child,
From a family, meek and mild,

Towards the bad, I kept turning

Merle Haggard & the Strangers,"Bonnie was a waitress in a small cafe
Clyde Barrow was the rounder that took her away
They both robbed and killed until both of them died
So goes the legend of Bonnie and Clyde

The poems that she wrote of the life that they led
Told of the lawmen left dying or dead
Some say that Clyde made her life a shame
But the legend made Bonnie the head of the game

The rampage grew wilder with each passing day
The odds growing smaller with each getaway
With the end growing closer, the harder they fought
With blood on their hands, they were bound to get caught

They drove back from town on one bright summer day
When a man they befriended stepped out in the way
With no thought of dyin' they pulled to the side
But death lay there waiting for Bonnie and Clyde

Two years or runnin' was ended that day
For robbin' and killin' they both had to pay
But we'll always remember how they lived and died

Merle Haggard & the Strangers,"THE TRAIN THAT NEVER STOPS
(Dallas Frazier)
Â« Â© '67 Acuff-Rose Music, BMI Â»

For years I've tried to leave this poor man's valley
On a train that's on its way to richer ground
Where rivers never overflow and dreams cannot be drowned
But the train never stops at our town
I'd like to buy a mansion for my darling
On a way upon a mountain look it down
I know there's a restless goal up there just waitin' to be found
But the train never stops at our town
Failure has to find something to blame
And the only thing that's left is that old frame
The darkness of the night catches me crying
A whistle soon will blow a lonesome sound
A spark of hope becomes a flame each time the train slows down
But the train never stops at our town that old train never stops at our town

Will you visit me on Sundays, Will you bring me pretty flowers
Will your big blue eyes be misty, will you brush brush away a tear
A grave is filled with silence, but if a sleeping man could hear
Darling, will I hear your footsteps up there.

Promise me that time won't separate me from your memory
That you will still remember me in days of silver hair
If not for you I know I'd lose my life before the morning
Hold me close and tell me that you care

Merle Haggard & the Strangers,"Beautiful isle of somewhere

If you've got two or three minutes
I'd like to tell you a story
And this a story about a preacher
And I know there's a lot of stories about a lot of preachers

But this is a story of one particular preacher
Who went overseas to fight a war
And this was a war for God and not for any one country
And he fought a long hard fight and he won a lot of souls

But  this preacher got old and he was coming home
Now he just happened to be on the same ship
With what some of us call a celebrity

And when the boat docked
There were thousands of people waiting
To meet the celebrity
And they carried him off on their shoulders

But there was no one there
To meet the old preacher
And he looked up and he said
""Lord did you forget?""

Well, it seemed like the Heavens just broke open
And the Lord said, ""No son I didn't forget
But you must remember
You're not home yet""

You're not home, you're not home
You're not home yet
I can still hear my Lord's voice ringing

""There'll be a crowd to meet you
A choir of angels to greet you
I didn't forget but son
You're not home yet""

Above the door, there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock and there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp

The corn was dry and the weeds were high when Daddy took to drinking
Him and Lucy Walker, they took up and ran away
Mama cried a tear and then she promised fourteen children
I swear you'll never see a hungry day

When Mama sacrificed her pride, the neighbors started talkin'
But I was much too young to understand the things they said
The thing that mattered most of all was Mama's chicken dumplings
And a goodnight kiss before we went to bed

Oh, the path was deep and wide from footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock and there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp

When Daddy left then destitution came upon our family
Not one neighbor volunteered to give a helping hand
So let them gossip all they want, she loved us and she raised us
The truth is standing here, the full grown man

Last summer Mama passed away and left the ones who loved her
Each and every one is more than grateful for their birth
Each Sunday she receives the fresh bouquet of fourteen roses
And a card that reads, 'The greatest Mom on earth'

I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then today I started loving you again","Today, I Started Loving You Again",2007
Merle Haggard & the Strangers,"The first thing I remember knowing,
Was a lonesome whistle blowing,
And a young un's dream of growing up to ride,
On a freight train leaving town,
Not knowing where I'm bound,
No-one could change my mind but Mama tried.
One and only rebel child,
From a family, meek and mild,
My Mama seemed to know what lay in store.  
Despite my Sunday learning,
Towards the bad, I kept turning.
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore.

And I turned twenty-one in prion doing life without parole.
No-one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried.
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading, I denied.
That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried.

Dear old Daddy, rest his soul,
Left my Mom a heavy load,
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes. 
Working hours without rest,
Wanted me to have the best.
She tried to raise me right but I refused.

I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole.
No-one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried,
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading, I denied.
That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried.",Mama Tried [From Killers Three],2008
Merle Haggard & the Strangers,"Julie they've taken me to prison I pulled the gun and robbed the jewelry store
The only thing I took was that big diamond
You know the one you said you wish was yours
The diamond in the window called for money the price was just too much for me to pay
But the price I'm paying now is so much bigger oh Julie don't I have the right to say
Don't get married Julie wait for me don't get married cause someday I'll be free

Julie when I serve the time they gave me
I'll walk out through the gates and I'll be free
I hope you didn't only want the diamond cause I pray that you also wanted me
Don't get married Julie wait for me don't get married cause someday I'll be free",Don't Get Married,2013
Merle Haggard & the Strangers,"Well you took my love for granted and I gave it all willingly
But seeing you with someone else was the breaking point for me
I know I'm goin' crazy I can feel it comin' on
The signs're all around me and I know I'll soon be gone
Gone crazy I may be hard to find gone crazy somewhere out of my mind

But there'll be laughter all around me when they come and take me away
And in case you see me leavin' oh you can bet I've gone to stay
I know you're gonna miss me when you find I've gone insane
But I got the right to lose my mind if I can't stand the pain
Gone crazy I may be hard to find gone crazy somewhere out of my mind",Gone Crazy,2013
