The Drifters,"One month ago today
I was happy as a lark
But now I go for walks
To the movies maybe to the park

And have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play
You know, tomorrow is their future
But for me, just another day

They all gather around me
They seem to know my name
We laugh, tell a few jokes
But it still doesn't ease my pain

I know I can't hide from a memory
Though day after day I've tried
I keep sayin' she'll be back
But today again I've lied

Oh, I see her face everywhere I go
On the street and even at the picture show
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh, I hear her voice as the cold winds blow
In the sweet music on my radio
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Why, oh, why did she have to leave and go away
Oh, I've been used to havin' someone to lean on
And I'm lost, baby, I'm lost

Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh, she left her kiss upon my lips
But left that break within my heart
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Oh, I see her hand reaching out to me
Only she can set me free
Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

Why, oh, why did she have to leave and go away, oh yeah
Oh, I've been used to havin' someone to lean on
And I'm lost, baby, I'm lost

Have you seen her?
Tell me, have you seen her?

As another day comes to an end
I'm lookin' for a letter or somethin'
Anything that she would send

With all the people I know
I'm still a lonely man, you know, it's funny
I thought I had her in the palm of my hand

Tell me, have you seen her?

Have you seen her
Tell me, have you seen her

The Drifters,"Looks like I'll spend another night with the boys
I tried, I called on the phone, but you weren't home again
I guess that you've made some other plans
So I'll just get out the cards
And round up a couple of hands
Looks like I'll spend another night with the boys
I know you are out on the town
You're runnin' around again
And if they ask me, if somebody ask me why I'm not with you oh yeah
I guess I'll have to confess
That I've been wondering too
Why must I be denied the thrill of your kiss
What did I do to you to be treated like this
Why must I spend another night with the boys

I'd much rather be with you

Just dreaming dreams of you

I watched your ship as it sailed out to sea

And people are just too much for me to face
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into space
On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below can't bother me
Let me tell you now

When I come home feelin' tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet (up on the roof)
I get away from the hustling crowd
And all that rat-race noise down in the street (up on the roof)
On the roof, the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Let's go up on the roof (up on the roof)

At night the stars put on a show for free
And, darling, you can share it all with me

I keep a-tellin' you

Right smack dab in the middle of town
I've found a paradise that's trouble proof (up on the roof)
And if this world starts getting you down
There's room enough for two

And there the world below can't bother me
Let me tell you now

When I come home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I get away from the hustling crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street

On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Up on the roof

At night the stars put on a show for free
And darling you can share it all with me

They were old enough to talk it out, and still keep it loose.

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose

Lover please, please come back
Don't take a train coming down the track
Don't, please don't, don't leave me
Don't leave me in misery

You would never call me ""Dear""

The Drifting Cowboys,"I have the invitation that you sent me
You wanted me to see you change your name
I couldn't stand to see you wed another
But dear I hope you're happy just the same

Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
That should be ringing out for you and me
Down the aisle with someone else you're walking
Those wedding bells will never ring for me

I planned a little cottage in the valley
I even bought a little band of gold
I thought some day I'd place it on your finger
But now the future looks so dark and cold

Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel
I hear the children laughing out with glee
At home alone I hang my head in sorrow
Those wedding bells will never ring for me

I fancy that I see a bunch of roses
A blossom from an orange tree in your hair
And while the organ plays I love you truly
Please let me pretend that I am there

Ever since the day you set me free
I knew someday that you would wed another
But wedding bells will never ring for me",Wedding Bells,1966

When you know I love you so
I could tell my heart that I don't miss you
My lips could tell a lie, but my heart would know

I could give you all the blame
But I'm sure the truth would show
I could tell this world I've found a new love
My lips could tell a lie, but my heart would know

'Cause it knows I need you so

His servants will bring, a ring for my finger
And never no more will I roam.

The Drifting Cowboys,"Took my fam'ly away from my Carolina home 
Had dreams about the West and started to roam 
Six long months on a dust covered trail 
They say heaven's at the end but so far it's been hell 
And there's fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air 
Gold in them hills and it's waitin' for me there 

We were diggin' and siftin' from five to five
Sellin' everything we found just to stay alive
Gold flowed free like the whiskey in the bars
Sinnin' was the big thing, lord and Satan was his star 
And there's fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air 
Gold in them hills and it's waitin' for me there 

Dance hall girls were the evenin' treat
Empty cartridges and blood lined the gutters of the street
Men were shot down for the sake of fun
Or just to hear the noise of their forty-four guns
And there's fire on the mountain, lightnin' in the air
Gold in them hills and it's waitin' for me there

Now my widow she weeps by my grave
Tears flow free for her man she couldn't save
Shot down in cold blood by a gun that carried fame
All for a useless and no good worthless claim

I love you so much I want you happy

The Drifting Cowboys,"Oh, once upon a time in Arkansas
An old man sat in his little cabin door
And fiddled at a tune that he liked to hear
A jolly old tune that he played by ear.

It was raining hard but the fiddler didn't care
He sawed away at the popular air
Though his rooftop leaked like a waterfall
That didn't seem to bother the old man at all.

A traveler was riding by that day
And stopped to hear him a-fiddling away
The cabin was afloat and his feet were wet
But the old man still didn't seem to fret.

So the stranger said Now the way it seems to me
You'd better mend your roof said he
But the old man said as he played away
I couldn't mend it now it's a rainy day.

The traveler replied that's all quite true
But this I think is the thing for you to do
Get busy on a day that is fair and bright
Then patch the old roof till it's good and tight.

But the old man kept on a-playing at his reel
And tapped the ground with his leathery heel
Get along said he for you give me a pain
My cabin never leaks when it doesn't rain",Arkansas Traveler,2010

I heard someone began to weep
Then I got up just to see

And tears of pain were being shed

The way to end this misery

And so He set me free
Once I was blinded, but now I can see

As the blood flowed from his side

Before he died he faintly cried oh father forgive them please

In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park

Eight miles high and falling fast

With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance

Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000

The Drummonds,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2000
The Drummonds,"Emily, Emily, Emily
Has the murmuring sound of may
All silver bells, coral shells, carousels
And the laughter of children at play

And we fade to a marvelous view
Two lovers alone and out of sight
Seeing images in the firelight
As my eyes visualize a family
They see Emily, Emily

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

The Drury Lane Orchestra,"Oh, tell us please
Entirely confidentially
How A.D.C.s
Are trained in social grace.
It's awfully brave
Daily to be called upon to save
His Excellency's face!
 
Any explanations
Of the duties of an A.D.C.
Prove the complications
That are rife at Government House.
Certain situations
We could never let a lady see,
There are strange vibrations
In the life at Government House.
Truth is often sacrificed for reasons of diplomacy.
 
That of course we understand
But all the same it must be grand 
To be
So suave, so calm, so dignified!
 
If you knew what all that signified-we-
Who break the Ninth Commandment every day
Would hang our heads in shame and say
Forgive-we have to live
Officially on feet of clay.
Every minute
We're made to sin it
Is really very depraved,
But to Hell
With the lies we tell,
His Excellency's honour must be saved.
 
His Excellency regrets
That owing to an attack of Gout
He really dare not venture out
On Saturday to dine.
His Excellency regrets
That owing to doctor's orders he
Cannot attend the Mission tea
And also must decline
Your kind invitation
For Wednesday week.
A slight operation
And poor circulation
Combined with a weedy physique
Has made him unable to speak.
All this in addition to what
The Doctors describe as a ‘Clot'
Which may disappear
By the end of the year
But may, very possibly, not!
His Excellency regrets
That owing to his exalted state
He can no more associate
With amiable brunettes.
Walk up-walk up-we're willing to take your bets
That that's one of the principal things His Excellency regrets!
 
So now we know
About the Diplomatic Corps,
How it can so
Corrupt the soul of youth.
What happens if
Some day you give the waiting world a whiff
Of plain, unvarnished truth?
 
His Excellency regrets
That, failing a better alibi,
He must admit he'd rather die
Than open your Bazaar.
His Excellency regrets
That, lacking enough official scope,
He can't disband the Band of Hope
No matter where they are.
He frankly despises
The people he rules,
His gorge also rises
When giving the prizes
At co-educational schools
To rows of illiterate fools.
And if you should write in the book
He'll give you a murderous look.
For it ruins his day
To be taken away
From his rod and his line and his hook!
His Excellency regrets
He hasn't enough to run the house
Or pay the staff-or feed a mouse
Upon the pay he gets
Heigho-heigho-he's up to his ears in debts
But that's one of the least of the things His Excellency regrets!",His Excellency Regrets,2009
The Du Droppers,"Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

The Dublin Ramblers,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2010
