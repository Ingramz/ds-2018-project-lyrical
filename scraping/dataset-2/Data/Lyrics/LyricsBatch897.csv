Bang Tango,"Oh, where's my gun?
I want to have some - fun
When you look ahead
That's where I dive right in

Don't try to help me
Don't try to tell me
Just take a look inside of my head
Only time can tell

If I'm to go to - hell
When you see my face
That's where you lose your trace
Don't try to help me

Don't try to tell me
Just take a look inside
I'm a shotgun man - shot
I'm a shotgun man - shot

It's a lie good God
Need my shot
Shot, shot - shotgun man
Shotgun man

Ready to fire
Watch you bleed
Where's my gun?
Hey, dad too many died

Ain't enough
Shotgun
Don't try to help me
Don't try to tell me

Just take a look inside of my head
Shot
I'm a shotgun man - shot
I'm a shotgun man - shot

I'm a shotgun man
Well, I'm a shotgun man
Listen!
Shotgun, shotgun

It'a a lie!
Good God!",Shotgun Man,1989
Bang Tango,"It ain't sweet, the way you cut me
Much too deep for any man
No control, no emotion, just that
Razor in your pretty hands

Time has come babe, you pull my trigger
I feel your life blood, slipping down
The drain
I can feel your heart beat every time

I let you go
Every time I see those greedy eyes,
I've got to let you know, so
I can't help you, your time has come

I see you falling, you're goin' down
I can't help you, your time has come
I got you crawling, down on the ground,
So, crawl!

You take it easy, I take it slow
You try to please me, I just say - no!
I can see inside your eyes, gonna make
Your body burn, I feel you hypnotize,

Gonna take, I'll take my turn
I can't help you, your time has come
I see you falling, you're goin' down
I can't help you, your time has come

I got you crawling, down on the ground,
So crawl!
Every time I see those eyes
I'm about to lse control

I shiver and shake down deep inside
I feel my body blow
I feel this world is a give and take
As I reach down deep inside

I pray to God for Heaven's sake,
I've got to let you know
I can't help you, your time has come
I see you falling, you're goin' down

I can't help you, your time has come
I got you crawling, down on the ground,
So crawl!
I can't help you, your time has come

I see you falling, you're goin' down
I can't help you, your time has come
I got you crawling, down on the ground,
So crawl",Sweet Little Razor,1989
Bang Tango,"Shiny angel unwraps his wings
Clear glass cloud floats over my head
I float through space
It don't mean a thing

I hear the echos of my friends
I fell down from floor forty-nine
Hit the ground going fifty-five
Silent night breaks my fall

As my friends said - boy, you're dead
I'm back
Wrap my wings around your heart
Send the bad ones down

Wrap my wings around your heart
Bring the good to town 
Wrap my wings around your heart
Mother mary calls my name

Sends me down pure and clean
I see you all standing around
As my soul touches down
Your heart's laced with silver and gold

You're innocent so I'm told
I reach out take away your frown
And now the evil running scared
I'm back

Wrap my wings around your heart
Send the bad ones down
Wrap my wings around your heart
Bring the good to town 

Wrap my wings around your heart
I'll wrap them around your heart",Wrap My Wings,1989
Bang Tango,"Outside there's this flickerin' sound
I can feel it rising above me, above the ground

My eyes, they gleam like fluorescence signs
As I start across the sky, I can smell freedom
Prepare to cross the line
Ridin' hard on my rock 'n' roll machine

Well, I'm dressed up the 90's
And I'll always come clean
A body of perfection made of the richest kind
I'm seeking out a hero, the hero of my mind, so

I need a kiss, I need a kiss
I need to feel your plain cold lips
I need a kiss, I need a kiss
I need to feel your cold, cold lips

Well, I'm dressed up, dressed up, dressed up
Vamp tonight
Well, I'm looking for love
And a lonely bite

Well, I'm dressed up, dressed up, dressed up
Vamp tonight
Well, I'm looking for love
On this lonely, lonely night

The voices that surround me
They're my untamed friends
I'm a true believer in
Livin' to the very end, so

All dressed up and I'm runnin' ravaged
I'm lookin' for that one last bite
I'm dressed up and I'm ready to fly
An eager one to satisfy
A broken heart to mystify

Well, I'm dressed up and I'm ready to fly",Dressed up Vamp,1991
Bang Tango,"Darlin', does it feel good?
Darlin', does it feel good?
I'm waitin', waitin' for you
I'm waitin' up in your room

'Cause I'm in love, I'm in love
Perfection is under your skin
Well, your affection should be a sin

You tie, you tie, you tie, you tie me down
I love it so, I love it so, so I'll stick around
Take me

Darlin', I miss your sweet lips
Miss them so
Need to feel your mouth, need the touch

Darlin', where are you goin'?
And where have you been?
I'm gonna crawl to you closer
I lose control",I'm in Love,1991
Bang Tango,"All alone, up in my room
The clock strikes twelve
It feels so soon

Two o'clock, three kicks inFour o'clock
That's when I begin, oh yeah

Through the doors
Through the halls
Down the elevator
To the second floor

Across the bar
In a thin green dress
I catch your smile
And then I said oh God
It's not my bedtime story
Or sience fiction
It's just a matter of fact
If I fall to temptation
It's my decision to turn back
Oh yes, with open eyes in the dark
Oh yeah, we come together
We come together

Soul to soul, I found a love
Soul to soul to soul
Soul to soul to soul, she's got a Gucci love
Soul to soul to soul

Moonswept alibis
Sleepin' away the night
As you and I walk alone
Hand and hand
We cast shadows of love
There's a good thing goin' on
With open eyes
We come together
We come together

It's our song
We sing alone
It's our song
We sing of love

She's got this feelin'
That I can't get enough
It's like strawberry jelly
It's a tough too much
I gotta expert timing
She's skin slappin' love
I can tell you something child
I lose control",Soul to Soul,1991
Bang Tango,"Oh, my little Philly, I'm gonna ride you
I'm gonna write you a love story
And I'll make you my very own star
And when it's cold out
I'm gonna crawl inside of you

She's my little sapphire
I'm gonna shine you, girl
I'm gonna keep you close to my heart
And they'll never tear us apart

And when it's dangerous
I'll always protect you
I'm gonna keep you by my side, love
I'll give you my pride and never be cruel

And when it's over
I'm gonna bring my love to you
And when it's over
Well, I'll be untied and true

And when it's over
I'm gonna crawl right up to you
And when it's over
Well, I'll be untied and I'll be true

She's my little angel
She can part the clouds in the sky Lord
Bringin' down the heavens
With just a wink of her eye

The devil's never laid his hands on her
She never gives a reason why
She's never been sinned before
Never even heard the words

And when it's cold out
I'm gonna crawl inside of you
I'm gonna keep you by my side, girl
I'll dry your eyes, you'll never be blue",Untied and True,1991
Bang Tango,"Wrapped up in this world of anger
There's no second chance out of here
Nail tight your eyes now, honey
Because I know just what you fear
Well, I've seen it all before
And it all comes back to me
Well I see your face now, honey
And I know just where you've been
With someone, someone well there's

Someone just like you
Oh I need someone
To take away the blue
Someone, well there's someone just like you
Oh I need someone to take away the blue

Clench your fist oh so tight
And kick down anything in your way
Spit your words right out now
Becase you ain't got a thing to say
Well I've seen you walk away
But I don't know where you go
And I see your lying eyes
But you ain't gotta thing to show for
Someone, someone, well there's

Someone just like you you
Oh I need someone
To take away the blue
Someone, well there's someone just like you
Oh I need someone to take away the blue

Well I've seen you walking
Through the night
Well I hear you say
You're sick and tired
Well I've hear you kick before
And I've heard you cry for more
I've watched you walking out
But you're back 
Jump back

I need someone
I need someone just like you",Someone Like You,1991
Bang Tango,"Splits your heart at the seams
With the coldness of it all
Feel that life's just a dream
And you lost the ball
Don't cry
Just do it
You think your world's up and down
And you got no place to go
You got your head spinning round
Need your poison just to show
Don't cry
Just do it
Bringing on the attack of life
Bringing on the night, with love
You got yourself in a hole
And you can't get out
Such a shame you lose control
Better turn around
Don't cry
Just do it
Bringing on the attack of life
Bringing on the night, with love
Have you ever stood on the edge
Felt the heat of the sun?
Have you ever stood in the dark
Watch the moon glow?
Have you ever felt the pain from
A shotgun?
Have you ever cried the tears of
The lonely?
From the midnight, with love
Bringing on the attack of life
Bringing on the night, with love",Attack of Life,1992
Bang Tango,"Well I'm always too fast
They're always too slow
And that I'll make you see
That I'm smart as a cracker
And I crack like a whip
Gonna make you believe
I've lived a million times before
And I've seen a million ways
That psychedelic crap coming through the front door
Gettin' kicked out the back, yeah
Sometimes I get tired and I can not sleep
Sometimes I lose control, it takes control of me
And when I'm fallin' down, down on my knees
Takin' me, takin' me, takin' me

Well, I'm dancin' on coals
I'm dancin' with the angels
And I'll do anything, just make me get a smile, yeah
I'm dancin' on coals
I'm dancin' with the angels
I'll do anything, just make me crack a smile

Grip tight to the things I like
And I always steal away
Well, bless those ones with faceless lies

'Cause they carry such a heavy strain
Don't go lookin' for answers
'Cause the road is always bent
The fools use the system
But I know that it's spent
Ain't no fool, no

Got a good thing goin' in life
God knows I'd give it a try
Got a shot of love and there ain't no hate
Don't you know, I'll make no mistakes?

Dancin' all my way through life
I know just what I like
I know just what I want
I know just who I am
I'm dancin' all the way
I'm a modern man
Last night I took a midnight flight
Across the stars
Sat there lookin' down on earth
Straight down from Mars
I know just what I want
I know just who I am
I'm dancin' all the way
Well, I'm back down on earth
And I'm dancin' again",Dancin' on Coals,1992
Bang Tango,"Please forgive me for not smiling
Please excuse the tear in my eye
You were out late, you were playin'
I was alone late last night

It's gettin' too late, it can't be true
Has this lovin' world turned it's back on you?
Out spendin' your time, baby, diggin' for gold
Dig inside yourself, it's inside your soul

Sometimes love gets so hard and only Lord knows
Just to win the fight, we gotta take the scars
If we could change the way things might have been
I'd bet we'd go back to where it first began
I bet you would, baby

Emptiness can be a silent friend
It stays with you until love comes once again
So I hope you find what you're looking for
'Cause that friend may stay with you until the very end

Where were you when midnight struck?
Where were you when midnight hit?
Am I just a fool with such bad luck?
Where were you when midnight struck?

Hang my life by the end of a string
You tell me that our love don't mean a thing
Well, I know that it can't be true
'Cause I was up late, baby, waiting for you

And now my feelings just fade away
All my memories come to an end
That night, girl, you dragged me down
That's the night I swear, I saw the devil in you
The devil in you, girl",Midnight Struck,1992
Bang Tango,"She keeps her Moet et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
(Killer, killer, she's a killer Queen)
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat

Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild

I pick the flowers for the table
Have the phrases memorized so carefully

You walk in smiling and
Suddenly my mind’s unable
To focus on these things so dear to me

What I meant to say is that I’m in love
I never felt like this before
I could tell that you never had a clue
Searching for the things that I meant to say

There are many pleasant things
I can keep my mind distracted
We can laugh and talk till evening, hours away

Here it is on the tip of my tongue
I’m so hopelessly attracted
But if I try to tell you the words will stray

What I meant to say is that I’m in love
I never felt like this before
I could tell that you never had a clue
Searching for the things that I meant to say

I found more love than I can tell you of

It’s a simple honest thing
Just to close my eyes and tell you
There’ll be one less person in your arms tonight

What I meant to say is that I’m in love
I never felt like this before
He’s so good to me and I know that we
Had to be together, my baby

What I meant to say is that I’m in love
I never felt like this before
I can tell that you never had a clue
Searching for the things that I meant to say

Wedding ring was fresh on your hand

Reached over and you grabbed my wood
Don't you know, that it felt so good?

And with you is where I belong
That's why I sing this honeymoon song

Well, I spilled my red wine
Right below your panty-line
I finally got your bra undone

You were blowin' more than my mind
I was slapping' on your behind
Parked in the bush doing sixty nine

Honey, with you I can do no wrong
That's why I sing this honeymoon song

Your nails were digging in
Your teeth were biting skin
Then you pulled out a big black whip
Took me on some love slave trip

Said to call you Madam X
That ain't no country boy sex

Slapped the cuffs on my hands

Throwing dirty dishes with all our might
Sad commentary on a marriage that has failed
I'm at home getting hammered while she's out getting nailed

Police pulled into my trailer park
Domestic violence cost [Incomprehensible] after dark
Late night with her boss, says they're trying to make a sale
I'm at home getting hammered while she's out getting nailed

I'm at home drinking whiskey in my easy chair
Watching Jerry Lawler pulling Andy Kauffman?s hair
Had a suspicion, so I opened up her mail
I'm at home getting hammered while she's out getting nailed

She used to bring me beer and love all over me
Right before I went on disability
My wiggler ain't so straight, I got whiskey dick
She don't perk it up 'cause, 'cause her ankles got so thick

Well, the moral of this story is sad but true
I love to drink and she loves to screw

Singen Hymnen so laut

Moi, tout ça, ça me ronge
J'kiffe voir le bonheur des darons quand je sors tout l'oseille de mon pantalon

L'système, l'État nous escroquent
Voilà c'qui pousse petite soeur à faire escort
Petit-frère lui importe et exporte toutes sortes de choses
On rêve d'autres choses, c'est dur mais faut qu'on s'en sorte
Bonheur s'trouve derrière cette porte
Et moi j'ai pas les clefs, les miens sont paniqués
J'avance bouteille d'essence, un pochon blanc et un briquet

On est tous allumés
Toujours posés dans l'block avec nos bouteilles et nos calumets
Pourtant j'ai pris le relais
J'dois ramener les sous à la maison car Maman est fatiguée
Mais toi t'as pas idée
Tout l'mal qu'on serait prêts à faire à autrui pour de simples billets
Triste réalité
On a grandi dans la de-mer, dis-moi comment la quitter

J'ai voulu que des frères mais j'ai eu trop d'potes
On apprend d'ses erreurs, nous on a touché l'pactole
Regarder l'entourage péter un plomb à force d'allumer trop d'cônes
Disons qu'le ssite-gro déconne
On apprécie la paix quand on est dans la violence
En nous s'installe la haine quand on est en manque d'argent
Toute ma vie j'ai vu maman prier Dieu comme si elle parlait dans l'vent
Toujours Joh, Pims autour de moi et j'te garantis qu'c'est d'jà pas mal

Dans mon cerveau j'suis trop allumé
J'vais redescendre sur terre tout en pensant aux cieux
Dans mon cerveau j'suis trop allumé

J'ai l'impression qu'on est devenu dingue
C'est le cerveau d'nos parents qui maintenant trinque
À cette allure on a des chances d'être foutus
Le mode d'emploi d'nos vies, c'est devenu YouTube
Le manque de force, la haine depuis, nous caressent
Qu'est-ce que tu crois toi? C'est la hass
J'me détruis et on m'dit : ""Arrête, arrête, arrête""
Putain, ils nous allègent pas
Obligé d'me justifier pour pas subir les messes basses
Nos cerveaux sont complètements retournés
J'pense à nos gosses et toutes les prochaines fournées
Je tourne autour, on tourne autour de moi-même
Et j'me dis

Cold sweats occur when I'm not with her

My presence is a must, must, must
Bonita Applebum, I gotta put you on
If I didn't when we cuttin', the feelin' would be too strong
In any form, I'm givin' you sweet dreams

That Sugar Hill, she call me her sweet thing
That Black Rain that take away your pain
Just for one night, baby, take me in vein

Now that feelin' got you trippin', you no wanna feel no different

Stay with me, sway with me

Only you have that magic technique
When we sway, I grow weak

I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Barathrum,"Fire!

I bring the fire from the hell
I am a demon warrior
Listen for this doom bell
It tolls for this burning torch

I bring this torch from the flames
From the flames of Inferno
I bring the end for the days
Of angels' existence
I hunt those white dressed creatures
Creatures with their white wings
My own wings are black skin
And my claws steel

When I meet the angels of the light
I show no mercy for them
I tie them with barbed wire
And then crucify
I cut the veins of heaven's creature
I spill the holy blood
I am the tormentor of saints
And judge from hell

My dark and evil wrath is huge
I have ripped countless angels
And I have brought the fuel
For inferno's high flames
Those flames are getting higher
Til they reach those golden gates
And my deepest desire
Is to destroy all beyond those gates

Lighting up the weather wings
Tearing the burning corpse
And the choir of heaven sings
No, no more",Angelburner,2004
Barathrum,"One hundred of satan's angels, somehow they lost to the heaven
And what a helluva party, they had over there
Two hundred skin winged demons, they made an invasion to the gates
Gates left golden dust behind them, after they were rumbling down
And sixty devilish creatures, attacked against the walls
And those walls of the heaven, were crushed by their force
Fifty dark minded beasts, with their wings of steel
They made a raid to the temple, and it's tower of the gold

Another fifty steel winged ones, they landed on the yard
On the yard of that temple, they massacred angels of God
One hundred warriors of Lucifer, they brought the fire with them
And they made storm of fire, that blew over paradise
And behold, one hundred and six, monsters from the inferno
They brought the nuclear destruction, that devastated The Holy Realm
The legions of the hell, attacked to the heaven
There were no survivors, after this invasion from the hell

Dreams turned to nightmares
Heaven changed to hell
Light turned to dark
White changed to black
Good turned to evil
Green changed to red
Colours of the heaven
Changed to negative

If this is vision, it's incredibly great
If I am dead, why the hell I had life?

And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues

Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it

Du plus loin qu´il m´en souvienne
Si depuis, j´ai dit ""je t´aime""
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous

C´est vrai, je ne fus pas sage
Et j´ai tourné bien des pages
Sans les lire, blanches, et puis rien dessus
C´est vrai, je ne fus pas sage
Et mes guerriers de passage
A peine vus, déjà disparus
Mais à travers leur visage

C´était déjà votre image
C´était vous déjà et le cœur nu
Je refaisais mes bagages
Et poursuivais mon mirage
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous

Sur la longue route
Qui menait vers vous
Sur la longue route
J´allais le cœur fou
Le vent de décembre
Me gelait au cou
Qu´importait décembre
Si c´était pour vous

Elle fut longue la route
Mais je l´ai faite, la route
Celle-là, qui menait jusqu´à vous
Et je ne suis pas parjure
Si ce soir, je vous jure
Que, pour vous, je l´eus faite à genoux
Il en eut fallu bien d´autres
Que quelques mauvais apôtres
Que l´hiver ou la neige à mon cou
Pour que je perde patience
Et j´ai calmé ma violence
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous

Mais tant d'hiver et d'automne 
De nuit, de jour, et personne
Vous n´étiez jamais au rendez-vous
Et de vous, perdant courage
Soudain, me prenait la rage
Mon Dieu, que j´avais besoin de vous
Que le Diable vous emporte
D´autres m´ont ouvert leur porte
Heureuse, je m´en allais loin de vous
Oui, je vous fus infidèle
Mais vous revenais quand même
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous

J´ai pleuré mes larmes
Mais qu´il me fut doux
Oh, qu´il me fut doux
Ce premier sourire de vous
Et pour une larme
Qui venait de vous
J´ai pleuré d´amour
Vous souvenez-vous? 

Ce fut, un soir, en septembre
Vous étiez venus m´attendre
Ici même, vous en souvenez-vous?
A vous regarder sourire
A vous aimer, sans rien dire
C´est là que j´ai compris, tout à coup
J´avais fini mon voyage
Et j´ai posé mes bagages
Vous étiez venus au rendez-vous
Qu´importe ce qu´on peut en dire
Je tenais à vous le dire
Ce soir je vous remercie de vous
Qu´importe ce qu´on peut en dire
Je suis venue pour vous dire
Ma plus belle histoire d´amour, c´est vous",Ma Plus Belle Histoire d' Amour,2005

Dans cette ville, au loin, perdue
Où j'avais passé mon enfance
J'ai eu tort, j'ai voulu revoir
Le côteau où glisse le soir
Bleu et gris, ombre de silence
Et j'ai retrouvé, comme avant
Longtemps après
Le côteau, l'arbre se dressant
Comme au passé
J'ai marché, les tempes brûlantes
Croyant étouffer sous mes pas
Les voix du passé qui nous hantent
Et reviennent sonner le glas
Et je me suis couchée sous l'arbre
Et c'était les mêmes odeurs
Et j'ai laissé couler mes pleurs
Mes pleurs
J'ai mis mon dos nu à l'écorce
L'arbre m'a redonné des forces
Tout comme au temps de mon enfance
Et longtemps, j'ai fermé les yeux
Je crois que j'ai prié un peu
Je retrouvais mon innocence
Avant que le soir ne se pose
J'ai voulu voir
La maison fleurie sous les roses
J'ai voulu voir
Le jardin où nos cris d'enfants
Jaillissaient comme sources claires

Tout redevenait comme hier

Oh mes folles années perdues
Oh mes quinze ans, oh mes merveilles

Et l'odeur des mûres écrasées

Du temps béni de mon enfance

Je veux me saouler de printemps
Je veux m'en payer, des nuits blanches
A coeur qui bat, à coeur battant

Et jusqu'à mon souffle dernier
Je veux encore dire je t'aime
Et vouloir mourir d'aimer

Je sais que tes amours sont mortes
Je suis revenue, me voilà

Tes beaux messieurs, tes beaux enfants
Tes faux Rimbaud, tes faux Verlaine

J'amarrerais mon piano ivre
Pour pouvoir vivre avec toi
Sur ton île aux mimosas
Nous aurions la fierté
Des tours de cathédrales
Et nous serions plus près
Du ciel et des étoiles
Nous saurions le secret
Des aurores boréales
Il y a si peu de temps
Entre vivre et mourir
Qu'il faudrait bien pourtant
S'arrêter de courir
Et prendre un peu de temps
De voir les fleurs s'ouvrir
De voir les fleurs s'ouvrir

A travers d'autres regards

Mémoire
Oh, mémoire

Dans la folie recluse
Où j'étais enfermé
Ma mémoire en intruse
De se réveiller
Dans ma vie sans soleil
Ma mémoire appareille
Vers un passé soleil
Sur fond rouge vermeil
Ma mémoire me diffuse des images confuses
Et je m'en éblouis
Et je les reconstruis
Ma mémoire me balance
Le mal de votre absence
Ce souvenir d'enfer
Me brûle à cœur ouvert

Mémoire
Mémoire d'un autre temps, d'une autre vie tu me reviens
Dans l'eau de paysage
Se mirent vos visages

Ah, mémoire
Des aubes pâles
Des matins pâles, tu me fais mal
Mais tu ramènes doucement
Ma vie recommencée, ô

Ô mémoire
Au bout de mes doigts
J'entends et je vois
L'image d'un paysage dévasté
Comment ai-je pu quitter
Ce que j'ai tant aimé?

J'allais, à demi éveillée
Suivant une allée obscure

Il y eut, je me le rappelle
Surgissant de l'allée obscure
Il y eut un bruissement d'ailes 
Là, tout contre ma figure

C'était au cœur de la nuit 
C'était une forêt profonde
C'était là, comme cette nuit
Un bruit sourd venant d'outre-tombe

Qui es-tu pour me revenir? 
Quel est donc le mal qui t'enchaîne? 
Qui es-tu pour me revenir 
Et veux-tu que, vers toi, je vienne?

Sans jamais revoir le monde

Pour qu'enfin ton cœur se repose
Que tu finisses de mourir

Et dans ce pays-là, j'ai bâti ma maison

Ma maison est un bois, mais c'est presque un jardin
Qui danse au crépuscule, autour d'un feu qui chante
Où les fleurs se mirent dans un lac sans tain
Et leurs images embaument aux brises frissonnantes
Aussi folle que l'aube, aussi belle que l'ombre
Dans cette maison-là, j'ai installé ma chambre

Ma chambre est une église où je suis, à la fois
Si je hante un instant, ce monument étrange
Et le prêtre et le Dieu, et le doute, à la fois
Et l'amour et la femme, et le démon et l'ange
Au ciel de mon église, brûle un soleil de nuit
Dans cette chambre-là, j'y ai couché mon lit

Mon lit est une arène où se mène un combat
Sans merci, sans repos, je repars, tu reviens
Une arène où l'on meurt aussi souvent que ça
Mais où l'on vit, pourtant, sans penser à demain
Où mes grandes fatigues chantent quand je m'endors
Je sais que, dans ce lit, j'ai ma vie, j'ai ma mort

Je m'invente un pays où vivent des soleils
Qui incendient les mers et consument les nuits
Les grands soleils de feu, de bronze ou de vermeil
Les grandes fleurs soleils, les grands soleils soucis
Ce pays est un rêve où rêvent mes saisons
Et dans ce pays-là, j'ai bâti ta maison",Ma Maison,1998

À quoi bon se redire les illusions perdues?

C'est que sans réfléchir
J'ai préféré partir
Et je suis à Vienne sans toi
Je marche, je rêve dans Vienne
Sur trois temps de valse lointaine
Il semble que les ombres
Tournent et se confondent

Et la nuit par-dessus les toits

Au bout d'une invisible chaîne
Tu guettais je pense
Jouant l'indifférence
Et tu m'as gardée malgré moi

Près d'un lac, je m'étais endormie
Quand soudain, semblant crever le ciel
Et venant de nulle part surgit un aigle noir

Lentement, les ailes déployées
Lentement, je le vis tournoyer
Près de moi dans un bruissement d'ailes
Comme tombé du ciel, l'oiseau vint se poser

Il avait des yeux couleur rubis
Et des plumes couleur de la nuit
À son front brillant de mille feux
L'oiseau roi couronné portait un diamant bleu

De son bec, il a touché ma joue
Dans ma main il a glissé son cou

Surgissant du passé, il m'était revenu

Comme avant sur un nuage blanc
Comme avant allumer le soleil
Être faiseur de pluie et faire des merveilles

Prit son vol pour regagner le ciel

Barbara,"À voir tant de gens qui dorment et s'endorment à la nuit
Je finirai, c'est fatal, par pouvoir m'endormir aussi
À voir tant d'yeux qui se ferment, couchés dans leur lit
Je finirai par comprendre qu'il faut que je m'endorme aussi

J'en ai connu des grands, des beaux, des bien bâtis, des gentils
Qui venaient pour me bercer et combattre mes insomnies
Mais au matin, je les retrouvais, endormis dans mon lit
Pendant que je veillais seule, en combattant mes insomnies

À force de compter les moutons qui sautent dans mon lit
J'ai un immense troupeau qui se promène dans mes nuits
Qu'ils aillent brouter ailleurs, par exemple, dans vos prairies
Labourage et pâturage ne sont pas mes travaux de nuit

Sans compter les absents qui me reviennent dans mes nuits
J'ai quelquefois des vivants qui me donnent des insomnies
Et je gravis mon calvaire, sur les escaliers de la nuit
J'ai déjà connu l'enfer, connaîtrai-je le paradis?

Le paradis, ce serait, pour moi, de m'endormir la nuit
Mais je rêve que je rêve qu'on a tué mes insomnies
Et que, pâles, en robe blanche, on les a couchées dans un lit
À tant rêver que j'en rêve, les revoilà, mes insomnies

Je rôde comme les chats, je glisse comme les souris
Et Dieu, lui-même, ne sait pas ce que je peux faire de mes nuits

Mourir ou s'endormir, ce n'est pas du tout la même chose
Pourtant, c'est pareillement se coucher les paupières closes
Une longue nuit, où je les avais tous deux confondus
Peu s'en fallut, au matin, que je ne me réveille plus

Mais au ciel de mon lit, y avait les pompiers de Paris
Au pied de mon lit, les adjudants de la gendarmerie
Ô Messieurs dites-moi, ce que vous faites là, je vous prie
Madame, nous sommes là pour veiller sur vos insomnies

En un cortège chagrin, viennent mes parents, mes amis
Gravement, au nom du Père, du Fils et puis du Saint-Esprit
Si après l'heure, c'est plus l'heure, avant, ce ne l'est pas non plus
Ce n'est pas l'heure en tout cas, mais grand merci d'être venus

Je les vois déjà rire de leurs fines plaisanteries
Ceux qui prétendent connaître un remède à mes insomnies
Un médecin pour mes nuits, j'y avais pensé, moi aussi
C'est contre lui que je couche mes plus belles insomnies

À voir tant de gens qui dorment et s'endorment à la nuit
J'aurais fini, c'est fatal, par pouvoir m'endormir aussi
Mais si s'endormir c'est mourir, ah laissez-moi mes insomnies

Attendait Pygmalion, assis au pied d'un chêne

Je me souviens de vous
Et de vos yeux de jade
Là-bas, à Marienbad
Là-bas, à Marienbad
Mais où donc êtes-vous ?
Où sont vos yeux de jade
Si loin de Marienbad

Je portais, en ces temps, l'étole d'engoulevent
Qui chantait au soleil et dansait dans l'étang
Vous aviez les allures d'un dieu de lune inca
En ces fièvres, en ces lieux, en ces époques-là
Et moi, pauvre vestale, au vent de vos envies
Au cœur de vos dédales, je n'étais qu'Ophélie

Tout propice aux esprits qui habitent les ombres
Et les sorciers, je crois, y battaient leurs sabbats
Quels curieux sacrifices, en ces temps-là
J'étais un peu sauvage, tu me voulais câline
J'étais un peu sorcière, tu voulais Mélusine

Je me souviens de toi
De tes soupirs malades
Là-bas, à Marienbad
A Marienbad
Mais où donc êtes-vous ?
Où sont vos yeux de jade
Si loin de Marienbad
Bien loin de Marienbad

Mais si vous m'appeliez, un de ces temps prochains
Pour parler un instant aux croix de nos chemins
J'ai changé, sachez-le, mais je suis comme avant
Comme me font, me laissent, et me défont les temps
J'ai gardé près de moi l'étole d'engoulevent
Les grands gants de soie noire et l'anneau de diamant

Je serai à votre heure
Au grand château de jade
Au cœur de vos dédales
Là-bas à Marienbad

Dans ces folles parades
L'œil dans tes yeux de jade

Pour entendre une histoire encor 
Approchez: je vous dirai celle 
De doña Padilla del Flor 
Elle était d'Alanje, où s'entassent 
Les collines et les halliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Il est des filles à Grenade 
Il en est à Séville aussi 
Qui, pour la moindre sérénade 
A l'amour demandent merci 
Il en est que parfois embrassent 
Le soir, de hardis cavaliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Ce n'est pas sur ce ton frivole 
Qu'il faut parler de Padilla 
Car jamais prunelle espagnole 
D'un feu plus chaste ne brilla 
Elle fuyait ceux qui pourchassent 
Les filles sous les peupliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Elle prit le voile à Tolède 
Au grand soupir des gens du lieu 
Comme si, quand on n'est pas laide 
On avait droit d'épouser Dieu 
Peu s'en fallut que ne pleurassent 
Les soudards et les écoliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Or, la belle à peine cloîtrée 
Amour en son cœur s'installa 
Un fier brigand de la contrée 
Vint alors et dit : ""Me voilà!"" 
Quelquefois les brigands surpassent 
En audace les chevaliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Il était laid : les traits austères 
La main plus rude que le gant 
Mais l'amour a bien des mystères 
Et la nonne aima le brigand 
On voit des biches qui remplacent 
Leurs beaux cerfs par des sangliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

La nonne osa, dit la chronique 
Au brigand par l'enfer conduit 
Aux pieds de Sainte Véronique 
Donner un rendez-vous la nuit 
A l'heure où les corbeaux croassent 
Volant dans l'ombre par milliers 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Or quand, dans la nef descendue 
La nonne appela le bandit 
Au lieu de la voix attendue 
C'est la foudre qui répondit 
Dieu voulu que ses coups frappassent 
Les amants par Satan liés 
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent 
Cachez vos rouges tabliers 

Cette histoire de la novice 
Saint Ildefonse, abbé, voulut 
Qu'afin de préserver du vice 
Les vierges qui font leur salut 
Les prieurs la racontassent

Il n'y a pas d'amour qui ne soit à douleur
Il n'y a pas d'amour dont on ne soit meurtri

Lentement, les ailes déployées
Lentement, je le vis tournoyer
Près de moi dans un bruissement d'ailes
Comme tombé du ciel, l'oiseau vint se poser

Il avait des yeux couleur rubis
Et des plumes couleur de la nuit
À son front brillant de mille feux
L'oiseau roi couronné portait un diamant bleu

De son bec, il a touché ma joue
Dans ma main il a glissé son cou

Barbara,"Dans les paniers d'osier de la salle des ventes 
Une gloire déchue des folles années trente 
Avait mis aux enchères, parmi quelques brocantes 
Un vieux bijou donné par quel amour d'antan 

Elle était là, figée, superbe et déchirante 
Ses mains qui se nouaient, se dénouaient tremblantes 
Des mains belles encore, déformées, les doigts nus 
Comme sont nus, parfois, les arbres en Novembre 

Comme tous les matins, dans la salle des ventes 
Bourdonnait une foule, fiévreuse et impatiente 
Ceux qui, pour quelques sous, rachètent pour les vendre 
Les trésors fabuleux d'un passé qui n'est plus 

Dans ce vieux lit cassé, en bois de palissandre 
Que d'ombres enlacées, ont rêvé à s'attendre 
Les choses ont leurs secrets, les choses ont leurs légendes 
Mais les choses nous parlent si nous savons entendre 

Le marteau se leva, dans la salle des ventes 
Une fois, puis deux fois, alors, dans le silence 
Elle cria: ""Je prends, je rachète tout ça 
Ce que vous vendez là, c'est mon passé à moi"" 

C'était trop tard, déjà, dans la salle des ventes

Elle vit s'en aller, parmi quelques brocantes

Près des paniers d'osier, dans la salle des ventes

Et revoyait soudain défiler son passé 
Défiler son passé, défiler son passé 

Car venait de surgir, du fond de sa mémoire 
Du fond de sa mémoire, un visage oublié 
Une image chérie, du fond de sa mémoire 
Son seul amour de femme, son seul amour de femme 

Hagarde, elle sortit de la salle des ventes 
Froissant quelques billets, dedans ses main tremblantes 
Froissant quelques billets, du bout de ses doigts nus 
Quelques billets froissés, pour un passé perdu 

Hagarde, elle sortit de la salle des ventes

De ses amours d'antan, rien ne lui restait plus

Qu'on ne m'ordonne pas

On est dix à défendre 
Les vivants par des morts 
Mais cloués par leurs cendres 
Au poteau do remords 
On se retrouve seul 
 
On est cent qui dansons 
Au bal des bons copains 
Mais au dernier lampion 
Mais au premier chagrin 
On se retrouve seul 
 
On est mille contre mille 
A se croire les plus forts 
Mais à l`heure imbécile 
Où ça fait deux mille morts 
On se retrouve seul 
 
On est million à rire 
do million qui est en face 
Mais deux millions de rires 
N`empêchent que dans la glace 
On se retrouve seul 
 
On est mille à s`asseoir 
Au sommet de la fortune 
Mais dans la peur de voir 
Tout fondre sous la lune 
On se retrouve seul 
 
On est cent que la gloire 
Invite sans raison 
Mais quand meurt le hasard 
Quand finit la chanson 
On se retrouve seul 
 
On est dix à coucher 
Dans le lit de la puissance 
Mais devant ces armées 
Qui s`enterrent en silence 
On se retrouve seul 
 
On est deux à vieillir 
Contre le temps qui cogne 
Mais lorsqu`on voit venir 
En riant la charogne 
On se retrouve seul.",Seul,2011
Barbara,"Sur la place chauffée au soleil
Une fille s'est mise à danser
Elle tourne toujours, pareille
Aux danseuses d'antiquités,
Sur la ville il fait trop chaud
Hommes et femmes sont assoupis
Et regardent par le carreau
Cette fille qui danse à midi

Ainsi certains jours, paraît
Une flamme à nos yeux
A l'église où j'allais
On l'appelait le bon Dieu
L'amoureux l'appelle l'amour
Le mendiant la charité
Le soleil l'appelle le jour
Et le brave homme la bonté

Sur la place vibrante d'air chaud
Où pas même ne paraît un chien
Ondulante comme un roseau
La fille bondit, s'en va, s'en vient
Ni guitare ni tambourin
Pour accompagner sa danse
Elle frappe dans ses mains
Pour se donner la cadence

Ainsi certains jours, paraît
Une flamme à nos yeux
A l'église où j'allais
On l'appelait le bon Dieu
L'amoureux l'appelle l'amour
Le mendiant la charité
Le soleil l'appelle le jour
Et le brave homme la bonté

Sur la place où tout est tranquille
Une fille s'est mise à chanter
Et son chant plane sur la ville
Hymne d'amour et de bonté
Mais sur la ville il fait trop chaud
Et, pour ne point entendre son chant,
Les hommes ferment les carreaux
Comme une porte entre morts et vivants

Ainsi certains jours, paraît
Une flamme en nos cœurs
Mais nous ne voulons jamais
Laisser luire sa lueur
Nous nous bouchons les oreilles
Et nous nous voilons les yeux
Nous n'aimons point les réveils
De notre cœur déjà vieux

Car la fille s'en est allée

Des gens de basse source et des grands de la terre
Des prétendus coiffeurs, des soi-disant notaires

To Sir, With Love.
 
Those awkward years, have hurried by why did they fly away.
Why is it Sir children grow up to be people one day,
What takes the place of climbing trees and dirty knees in the world outside?
What is there for you I can buy?  
If you wanted the world I'd surround it with a wall I'd scrall 
These words with letters ten feet tall, 
To Sir, With Love.

Barbara Ann Van,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,

You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

Je t'attendais mon secours et mon voleur.

Un voyageur s'endormait
Deux amoureux s'embrassaient
C'était hier et Paul chantait Yesterday
Déjà le jour se levait
Et lorsque Paul se taisait
Sans m'échanger un mot tu me suivais
Le soleil apparaissait
La vie ouvrait ses volets
La vie était plus belle que jamais

C'est alors que je sentais
Là dans mon cœur
Tous les signes avant-coureurs
Les symptômes de l'amour et du bonheur
Là dans mon cœur
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la",Et Paul Chantait Yesterday,2007

A la buanderie du Martinez

Tu viens juste de rencontrer

Au bras d'Isabelle Adjani
Tu toises la foule et tu souris
Quelle belle démarche

Barbara Carlotti,"Si l'amour a fait quelques pas
sous tes grands airs de bête farouche
Et même si l'on ne se touche pas

à te voir faire la fi ne bouche ?
Mais peut-être ne veux-tu pas
ou bien veux-tu que je te touche ?

toujours pas sur ma bouche
Crois-tu que j'attendrai comme ça
mille années, mille doutes ?
Veux-tu que je fasse le premier pas
d'attraper ta bouche ?

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you

These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.

""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,1959
Barbara Cook,"Castles were crumbling and daydreams were tumbling
December was battling with June
But on this bright afternoon
Guess I'll be changing my tune
Kept on despairing beyond any caring

But I'm arranging from now
To be changing my tune

At last the stars are bright and shiny
It's a human world once more
Yesterday's troubles are tiny
What was I worried for? 

Wanted a permit to make me a hermit
To grumble and glare at the moon
But I'm arranging from now
To be changing my tune

Wishing is good time wasted,
Still it's a habit they say;
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,

For only a day
I'd make a wish

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina

I live in dreams all the day; 
I know it's not the right time,
But still I dream away
What could be sweeter than dreaming,
Just dreazming and drift away.

Barbara Cook,"We were standin' on a mountain top
Where the cactus flowers grow
I was wishin' that the world would stop
When you said we'd better go

We took a rowboat 'cross the Rio Grande
Captain Pablo was our guide
For two dollars in a weathered hand
He rowed us to the other side

And we were dreamin' like the end was not in sight
And we dreamed all afternoon
We asked the world to wait so we could celebrate
A gringo honeymoon

We stepped out onto the golden sand
The sun was high and burning down
Rented donkeys from an old blind man
Saddled up and rode to town

Tied our donkeys to an ironwood tree
By the street where the children play
We walked in the first place we could see
Servin' cold beer in the shade

We were drinkin' like the end was not in sight
And we drank all afternoon
We asked the world to wait so we could celebrate
A gringo honeymoon

Met a cowboy who said that he
Was running from the DEA
He left a home, a wife, a family
When he made his getaway

We followed him on down a street of dust
To his one room run-down shack
He blew a smoke ring and he smiled at us
I ain't never goin' back

We were flyin' like the end was not in sight
And we soared all afternoon
We asked the world to wait so we could celebrate
A gringo honeymoon

He said there's one last place that you should go
He took us to the town's best bar
He knew a crusty caballero
Who played an old gut string guitar

And he sang like Marty Robbins could
Played like no one I've known
For a while we knew that life was good
It was ours to take back home

Did what you had to do and now you deceased

He was only thirteen when he burst his splean
The shot was fatal
He died right there upon the kitchen table blaow
It happened all alone in his house
Not a creature was stirrin', not a roach or a mouse
And I was just with him, playin' Sega
And buggin' on the horn with some honeys like a couple of playas
And now he's gone
I'm speakin' on my man K-Shawn
Forever on my mind mentally as I kick my song
 
He used to talk about the box in the closet
Where his pops kept a glock and all the safety deposits
Now he stressed, fiendin' just to hold some heat
I guess it came from all the stories that he heard in the street
I can't explain it, its ill how we used to feel
I used to tell him stop playin' wit that chrome-piece steel
He never listened, and now my man is missin' in action
I blame it on the fools in the street that's always blastin

Shots gettin' nearer
Paralyzed and right in front of my eyes its gettin' clearer

Tried to rob a deli but the gat he had was raggy
Bullets sprayed, ricocheted and automatically
Hit a bystander, young girl named Amanda
The slugs in her back by this cat buggin' no crap
Another rugrat, somebody tell me where the loves at
Was only seven already on her way to heaven
She reached her day and now she won't see her wedding
Some might say that this was destined or something
But her parents only had one child and now they left with nothing
Book all that flix and when they daughter was six
Before they moved from the bricks and got caught up in the mix
They thought things would get better now they stressed forever
They last vision was image of a blood-soaked sweater

What night?
What day?

Or why
Or how,
As long as I love him now.

When did affection suddenly soar?

Barbara Cook,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

Rather be in some lonely hollow
Where the sun don't ever shine,

And to know that you'll never be mine.

With my suitcase in my hand,
Yes, march me away to the station,

Sometimes I have ten dollars,

Barbara Dickson,"There's an eagle in the eastern sky turning in the wind

Out across the evening resting on the wings.
If I had the wings of an eagle there'd be no holding me -
I'll be free - sailing free.
One day soon I'm gonna run like the wind
One day soon -
Gonna break away from everything
One day soon.
Nothing in the world's gonna pull me back
And nothing's gonna keep me in - gonna run like the wind

And if you should tell me you want to hold me down

Before the glow of morning I'll be gone without a sound.
The more you try to keep me in the less you will succeed

Sailing free, sailing free.

Wish I had the wisdom

To find some simple words to make you see

The things that mean a lot to you

Don't always seem to mean a lot to me

You got me on the road
To one more broken heart

Why it is you say you're leaving
Then you turn around
You won't settle down

Wake up I tell myself but I don't even hear

Barbara Dickson,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1982

For love is Lord of all.

Has lulled the eve to sleep,

And sings in sweet and undertone,

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

Dragged a comb across my head

Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

They had to count them all

In very many ways, 
He's just one more.

Should I scream and shout? 
Should I speak of love,

I should be in this position.

I'd be lost. I'd be frightened.

Barbara Dickson,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory,2006
Barbara Dickson,"When winter's shadowy fingers
First pursue you down the street
And your boots no longer lie
About the cold around your feet

Do you spare a thought for summer
Whose passage is complete
Whose memories lie in ruins
And whose ruins lie in heat
When winter comes howling in

When the wind is singing strangely
Blowing music through your head
And your rain splattered windows
Make you decide to stay in bed

Do you spare a thought for the homeless tramp
Who wishes he was dead
Or do you pull your bedclothes higher
Dream of summertime instead?
When winter comes howling in

The creeping cold has fingers
That caress without permission
And mystic crystal snowdrops
Only aggravate the condition

Do you spare one thought for the gypsy
With no secure position
Who's turned and spurned by village and town
At the magistrate's decision
When winter comes howling in

When the turkey's in the oven
And the Christmas presents are bought
And Santa's in his module
He's an American astronaut

Do you spare one thought for Jesus
Who had nothing but his thoughts
Who got busted just for talking
And befriending the wrong sorts?
When winter comes howling in
When winter comes howling in

Even though I know we're not supposed to touch
Oh I've never wanted anyone so much
How I wish that I had found you first don't you see my heart's about to burst
Let me love you once before you go
Your eyes keep saying yes to me so don't keep saying no
Let me love you once and then you'll see
No one's ever gonna love you more than me

Let me lock the door and open all my love to you
All the love I've longed to give you since we met
It's the only chance I'm ever gonna get
And I just can't let it disappear oh my darling please come over here
Let me love you once before you go...

Barbara Fairchild,"Where you can hear a country song for fun
And someone plays the honky tonk guitar
Where all the lights will go out one by one
Where people join the song 
And the wind takes it away
Where the Mississippi rolls down to the sea
And lovers found the place they like to be
How many times before this song was ending
Love and understanding everywhere around
Mississippi I'll remember you
Whenever I shall go away 
I'll be longing for the day
That I will be in Greenville again
Mississippi you'll be on my mind
Every time I hear this song 
Mississippi roll along
Until the end of time

Now the country song forever lost its soul
When the guitar picker turned to rock 'n' roll
And every time when summer nights are falling
I always will be calling dreams of yesterday
Mississippi I'll remember you",Mississippi,1998

That I wouldn't see you if you came around
But I can't tell my heart what's right or wrong

Saying those things again
Making me believe you're just mine
You've got dreaming those dreams again 
Thinking those things again
I've gotta take you back just one more time

Everybody tells me that I'm a fool
That I never should have put my faith in you
And way down deep inside I guess I know it's true

Barbara Fairchild,"My little boy came into the kitchen this evening
While I was fixing supper
And he handed me a piece of paper he'd been writing on
And after wiping my hands on my apron
I read it - and this is what it said

For mowing the yard - five dollars
And for making my own bed this week - one dollar
And for going to the store - fifty cents
An' playing with little brother, while you went shopping 
Twenty-five cents
Taking out the trash - one dollar
Getting a good report card - five dollars
And for raking the yard - two dollars
Total owed - fourteen seventy-five.

Well, I looked at I'm standing there expectantly
And a thousand memories flashed through my mind
So I picked up the pen, turning the paper over,
This is what I wrote:

For nine months I carried you
Growing inside me - no charge
For the nights I've sat up with you,
Doctored you, prayed for you - no charge
For the time and the tears.
And the cost through the years, there's no charge
When you add it all up.
The full cost of my love is no charge.

For the nights filled with dread
And the worries ahead - no charge
For advice and the knowledge
And the cost of your college - no charge
For the toys, food and clothes and for wiping your nose
There's NO CHARGE, son
When you add it all up,
The full cost of my love, is - charge.

Well, when he finished readin'
He had great big old tears in his eyes
And he looked up at me and he said,
""Mama, I sure do love you.""
Then he took the pen,
And in great big letters
He wrote: ""Paid in full.""

When you add it all up
The cost of real love is - no charge.",No Charge,2002

And all of the while someone was begging To free me from sin 

He was there all the time
He was there all the time 
Waiting patiently in line 
He was there all the time

Never again Will I look for a fake rainbow's end 
Now that I have the answer My life is just starting to rhyme

And oh what I missed, He's been waiting right there all the time

On merely this, a look, a kiss

Barbara Gaskin,"In this world of ups and downs my dreams all fall through
Things just don't work out, no matter what I do
Disappointment haunts me, through each lonely day
The world around I see, in only shades of gray

But when the love light shines upon my face
I'm in a different world
A world I never knew, I'm in a different world
A world so sweet and true, I'm in a different world

I'm no longer just another face in a crowd
Hey, look into my eyes, you'll see I'm strong and I'm proud
You are all the sweetness of my life, you see
You have brought heaven right here on earth to me
No man of wealth, I know I'll ever be
But I'll be satisfied just knowing you love me

It seems like I've been down right from the very start
Every time I lift myself up off the ground
Something always happens to bring the curtain down

But when your love light shines upon my face

A world so warm and sweet, I'm in a different world
Now that you've been loving me, I'm in a different world

The empty life I knew, I leave it far behind
'Cause you gave me the love that I truly felt
Most of all you made me believe in myself

Each a candle, each a flame
All the dangers were outside us
And we knew them all by name

See how the bramble and the rose
Intertwine
Love grows like a bramble and a rose
Round each other we will twine

Now I've hurt you, and it hurts me
Just to see what we can do
To ourselves and to each other
Without really meaning to

So put your arms around me
And we'll sing a true love song
We will learn to sing together
Sing and laugh the whole night long

Barbara Lea,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

Trumpets are tearing my eardrums
Customers crush my toes

The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air.
The walls of my room fade away in the blue,

The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend;
You come to my arms, may this bliss never end,
For we love anew just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you.

Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing,
We glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing
That I'm soon revealing my love for you over again.

Where mockingbirds used to sing

Come over, sit by & hold my hand just one night 
Then maybe my folks will feel everything is still all right 
It's lonely here & I'm alone 
Waiting by a silent phone 
So come over, baby come over 
& spend a little time with me sometime 

With my lonely lonely heart 
Baby, we shouldn't be apart 
So come over, baby come over 
& spend a little time with me sometime 

Come over, spend a little time with me sometime 
How long must I wait for you to make up your mind? 
I'm sitting on a shelf all by myself 
Don't kettle me bound, bored with nobody else 
So won't you please come over 
& spend a little time with me sometime 
My baby, won't you come over 
& spend a little time with me sometime?

When you feel that need
To make it all alone,
Remember no one is thinking of,
Going alone

Just ask the lonely
They know the hurt and pain,
Of losing a love, you can never regain

Just ask the lonely
Just ask the lonely

The young and foolish laugh at love (Woo hoo)
So they run away (Woo hoo hoo hoo)
Confident and sure that fate (Woo hoo)
Will bring another love their way

(Ah) But ask the lonely
(Ah) How vainly a heart can yearn,
(Ah) For losing a love that will never return

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Barbara Long,"""Clang, clang, clang"" went the trolley
""Ding, ding, ding"" went the bell
""Zing, zing, zing"" went my heartstrings
For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2006
