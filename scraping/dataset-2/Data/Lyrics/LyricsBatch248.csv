Fairport Convention,"Near by the swelling ocean,
One morning in the month of June,
While feather'd warbling songsters
Their charming notes did sweetly tune,
I overheard a lady

Lamenting in sad grief and woe,
And talking with young Bonaparte
Concerning the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.

Thus spake the young Napoleon,
And grasp'd his mother by the hand:-
""Oh, mother dear have patience,
Till I am able to command

I'll raise a numerous army,
And through tremendous dangers go,
And in spite of all the universe,
I'll gain the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.""

Oh, son, speak not so venturesome
For England is the heart of oak
Of England, Scotland, and Ireland,
The unity can ne'er be broke.
And think you on your father

In the Island where he now lies low,
He is not yet interred in France,
So beware of the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.

Your father raised great armies,
And likewise kings did join the throng,
He was so well provided.
Enough to sweep the world along.

But when he went to Moscow,
He was o'erpower'd by drifting snow,
And though Moscow was blazing
He lost the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.

""Oh, mother, adieu for ever,
I am now on my dying bed,
If I had liv'd I'd have been brave
But now I droop my youthful head.

And when our bones do moulder,
And weeping-willows o'er us grow,
Its deeds to bold Napoleon
Will stain the bonny Bunch of Roses, O.""",The Bonny Bunch of Roses,1977

Walk awhile, walk awhile, walk awhile with me

Fairport Convention,"Yellow bird, 
up high in banana tree. 
Yellow bird, 
You sit all alone like me. 

Did your lady friend
Leave the nest again?
That is very bad, 
Makes me feel so sad. 
You can fly away,
In the sky away,
You're more lucky than me. 

Yellow bird,
Up high in banana tree. 
Yellow bird,
You sit all alone like me. 

Better fly away,
In the sky away,
Picker coming soon, 
Pick from night to noon.
Black and yellow you,
Like banana too,
They may pick you someday. 

Wish that I was, 
A yellow bird,
I'd fly away with you.

So I sit; nothin' else to do.

Fairport Convention,"Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free

Like a fish on a hook
Like a knight in some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee

And if I, if I have been unkind
I just hope you will let it go by
And if I, if I have been untrue
I just hope you know it was never to you

Like a baby still born
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone
Who reached out to me

But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I'll make it all up to thee

I saw a young man leaning on his wooden crutch
And he called out to me, ""Don't ask for so much""

Fairport Convention,"Funny day, looking for laughter and finding it there
Sunny day, braiding white flowers and leaves in my hair
Picked up a pencil and wrote 'I love you' in my finest hand
Wanted to send it but I don't know where I stand
Telephone, even the sound of your voice is still new
All alone in Carolina and talking to you
And feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that I had planned
Guess it's too early ''cause I don't know where I stand
Crickets talk, courting their ladies in star-dappled green
Crickets talk, until the morning comes up like a dream
All muted and misty, so drowsy now, I'll take what sleep I can

Know that I miss you but I don't know where I stand",I Don't Know Where I Stand,1987
Fairport Convention,"At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind has come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone

I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
because I still miss someone

Oh, no I never got over those blues eyes
I see them every where
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

I wonder if she's sorry
For leavin' what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone",I Still Miss Someone,1987
Fairport Convention,"Jack O'Rion was the finest fiddler ever fiddled on the string
He could drive young ladies wild with a tune his wires would sing
He could fiddle the fish out of salt water, water from a marble stone
Or milk from out a maiden's breast though baby she had none
There he played in the castle hall and there he played them fast asleep
Except it was for the young countess who, for love, she stayed awake
So first he played her a slow air and then he played it brisk and gay
And oh, dear love, behind her glove, this lady she did say",Jack Orion,1992
Fairport Convention,"She's a lady of pleasure, she's a lady of joy
And she has no illusions of grandeur

A sailor-lad's port in a storm
To some she's a sweetheart, to some she's a whore
And to others she's there to come home to
Well, she knows the score ''cause she's done it all before

Just knock and she'll open the door
Knock and she'll open the door
""Oh, where are you going, my fine feathered friend?
Have you someone to sleep with tonight?

If you're willing to pay, you'll have somewhere to stay
I've a nice place a short haul away
It's only a short haul away""
There's some makes it easy, there's some makes it hard

And there's some try to keep it a secret
But she's there on the tide, she's just out for a ride
And you know she's got nothing to hide
Nothing at all to hide

Fairport Convention,"Ye gentlemen of high renown, come listen unto me
That takes delight in fox hunting by every degree
A story I will tell to you, concerning of a fox
Near royston woods and mountains high and over stony rocks
Bold Reynard, being in his hole and hearing of these hounds
Which made him for to prick up his ears and tread upon the ground
""Methinks me hears some jubal hounds a-pressing upon the life
Before that they should come to me, I'll tread upon the ground""
We hunted for four hours or more through parishes sixteen
We hunted for four hours or more and came by Parkworth Green
""Oh, if you'll only spare my life, I promise and fulfil
To touch no more your feathered fowl or lambs on yonder hill""
Bold Reynard, spent and out of breath and treading on this ground
Thinking he must give up his life before these jubal hounds
""So here's adieu to ducks and geese, likewise to lambs also""
They've got poor Reynard by the slabs and will not let them go
",Reynard the Fox,1992
Fairport Convention,"There was an old widow in Westmorland who had no daughter but one
And she has prayed both night and day she should keep her maidenhead long
""Ah, don't be daft, mother,"" she said, ""and say no more to me
For a fine young man in the Grenadier Guards my maidenhead's taken from me""
""You saucy cat, you impudent cat, a-cursed may you be
If some idle rogue in the Grenadier Guards your maidenhead's taken from thee""
But the girlie's off to the Grenadier Guards as fast as go can she
Saying ""Give me back my maidenhead, my mother she nags at me""
So he kissed her and undressed her and he laid her on the bed
And he put her head where her feet were before and gave back her maidenhead
Then he kissed her and he dressed her with a rose in either hand
Invited her round to St. Mary's church to see his fine wedding
Oh, the girlie's off to her mammy's house as fast as go can she
""I'm as full a maiden, mammy dear, as the day you first bore me
He kissed me and undressed me and he laid me on the bed
Put my head where my feet were before and he gave back my maidenhead
Then he kissed me and he dressed me, put a rose in either hand and
Invited me round to St. Mary's church to see his fine wedding
""Ah, never on foot,"" her mammy she said, ""in a carriage and pair you'll ride
With four and twenty fine young girls to go with you beside""
""Ah, who is this?"" the bride she said, ""She comes so high to me""
""I see it is the widow's daughter who ran home and told her mammy""
""How could she do it, how would she do it, how could she do it for shame?
Eleven long nights I lay with a man and I never told anyone""
""If eleven long nights you lay with a man, you never shall lie with me
I'd rather marry the widow's daughter who ran home and told her mammy""

Fairport Convention,"When the stone is grown too cold to kneel
In crystal waters I'll be bound

Fairport Convention,"
 A sailor's life, it is a merry life.
 He robs young girls of their hearts' delight,
 Leaving them behind to weep and mourn,
 They never know when they will return.
 
 Well, there's four and twenty all in a row
 My true love he makes the finest show.
 He's proper tall, genteel and all,
 And if I don't have him, I'll have none at all.
 
 Oh father, build for me a bonny boat,
 That on the wide ocean I may float
 And every Queen's ship that we pass by,
 There I'll enquire for my sailor boy
 
 They had not sailed long on the deep
 When a Queen's ship they chanced to meet.
 ""You sailors all, pray tell me true,
 Does my sweet William sail among your crew?""
 
 ""Oh no, fair maiden, he is not here
 For he's been drownded we greatly fear
 On yon green island as we passed it by,
 There we lost sight of your sailor boy.""

 She was like a young girl in great despair.
 And her little boat against a rock did run.

Fairport Convention,"I went down to the hiring fair for to sell my labor,
And I noticed a maid in the very next row and I hoped she'd be my neighbor
Imagine then my delight when the farmer picked us both
I spoke not a word in the cart to the farm, 
But my heart beat in my throat

My lodging was dry and my master fair and I gave him full measure,
But my envy grew like the corn in the field for in his house was my treasure,
And I'd watch her carry water, or drive cows from the byre,
And the heat from the sun made the corn grow strong and with it my desire

Well I'd see her in my dreaming and in my dreams caress
Her eyes, her lips and her dark brown hair, the curves beneath her dress
But harvest time it came at last, so heavy was the task
That the women and the men worked side by side and I had her near at last

And I swung harder with my scythe, few words between us passed,
And I cursed my tongue-tied youthfulness and I hoped that she'd hear my heart
When all was safely gathered in and we sat down to rest
My trembling fingers touched her arm, and she placed them on her breast

And then she turned to me as the sun went down
And all my senses reeled,
As we lay there on the scented ground
And the moon rose over the field

She was safely gathered in my arms when from the barn
Drifted the sound of a violin and we hurried back to the farm,
And all were dancing in the lantern light and music filled the air,
And I thanked my stars for the harvest moon and the girl from the hiring fair

Oh all were dancing in the lantern light
And music filled the air,
And I thanked my stars for the harvest moon

Till these three men were satisfied John Barleycorn was dead

But little Sir John, with his nut-brown bowl, proved the strongest man at last

They've let him lie for a long long time till the rains from heaven did fall

They've let him stand till midsummer's day and he looks both pale and wan
Then little Sir John's grown a long long beard and so become a man

They've hired men with the sharp-edged forks to prick him to the heart
And the loader has served him worse than that for he's bound him to the cart
So they've wheeled him around and around the field till they've come unto a barn
And here they've kept their solemn word concerning Barleycorn
They've hired men with the crab tree sticks to split him skin from bone
And the miller has served him worse than that for he's ground him between two stones

Lord Donald's wife came into the church, the gospel for to hear 
And when the meeting it was done, she cast her eyes about 
And there she saw little Matty Groves, walking in the crowd 
""Come home with me, little Matty Groves, come home with me tonight 
Come home with me, little Matty Groves, and sleep with me till light"" 
""Oh, I can't come home, I won't come home and sleep with you tonight 
By the rings on your fingers I can tell you are my master's wife"" 
""But if I am Lord Donald's wife, Lord Donald's not at home 
He is out in the far cornfields bringing the yearlings home"" 

And a servant who was standing by and hearing what was said 
He swore Lord Donald he would know before the sun would set 
And in his hurry to carry the news, he bent his breast and ran 
And when he came to the broad millstream, he took off his shoes and he swam 

Little Matty Groves, he lay down and took a little sleep 
When he awoke, Lord Donald was standing at his feet 
Saying ""How do you like my feather bed and how do you like my sheets 
How do you like my lady who lies in your arms asleep?"" 
""Oh, well I like your feather bed and well I like your sheets 
But better I like your lady gay who lies in my arms asleep"" 
""Well, get up, get up,"" Lord Donald cried, ""get up as quick as you can 
It'll never be said in fair England that I slew a naked man"" 
""Oh, I can't get up, I won't get up, I can't get up for my life 
For you have two long beaten swords and I not a pocket knife"" 
""Well it's true I have two beaten swords and they cost me deep in the purse 
But you will have the better of them and I will have the worse 
And you will strike the very first blow and strike it like a man 
I will strike the very next blow and I'll kill you if I can"" 

So Matty struck the very first blow and he hurt Lord Donald sore 
Lord Donald struck the very next blow and Matty struck no more 
And then Lord Donald took his wife and he sat her on his knee 
Saying ""Who do you like the best of us, Matty Groves or me?"" 
And then up spoke his own dear wife, never heard to speak so free 
""I'd rather a kiss from dead Matty's lips than you or your finery"" 

Lord Donald he jumped up and loudly he did bawl 
He struck his wife right through the heart and pinned her against the wall

Fairport Convention,"Red and gold are royal colors
Peasant colours are green and brown
Green is the corn in the brown earth when it's growing
Red and gold when the harvest is cut down.

Through Cropredy in Oxfordshire the Cherwell takes its course
And the willows weep into its waters clear
My name it is Will Tims and it's here that I was born
And raised in faith my King and God to fear.

In 1644 the King in Oxford Town did dwell
Though we'd heard that Cromwell's army was nearby
It did not occur to me that little Cropredy
Could be witness to the meeting of both sides

On June the 29th that year I was about my work
Cutting hedges in the meadow by the stream
My blade slipped, I cut my hand and my own dear blood did flow
Upon the brown earth and the corn still green

Now it did distress me so to watch my own blood flow
And quickly soak into the greedy ground
In red and gold my colors swam and sweat broke on my brow
And faint I knew that I must lay me down

At first I thought the thundering was just inside my head
So I raised myself above the hedge to see
And I watched as in a dream as the armies fought downstream
The battle for the bridge at Cropredy

Now the King's men fought in red and gold though
Cromwell's men were plainer
The blood they spilled was coloured just the same
Through the hedgerow's fragile cover I saw brother killing brother
And all of this was done in Jesus' name

All that day and all the next the battle it was raging
Though when darkness came I slipped away
But the crying of the dying kept me wakeful and just lying
In my bed until the dawning of the day

And the dreams I had were red and gold
And the little stream became a flood
From all my brothers killing one another
Till waking I realised it was all my own dear blood

Some were buried in the church and some just where they fell
With no markers to declare their place of rest
But the poppies they do grow where they were never sown
And to my mind they do declare it best

And each year when the green corn once again turns into gold
And the poppies in the field again remind me
Like the scar upon my hand and the blood spilled on this land
And the hungry earth so eager to confine me

For read and gold they are the colours
One is blood and one is power
Though I may find my rest in Cropredy Church
In golden fields forever will spring the poppy flower

By Cropredy the Cherwell is still bidden to keep flowing
And the willows by its side still gently weep
But still in restless dreams by this most peaceful stream
The poppies wake me from my rightful sleep

And the dreams I have are red and gold
And the little stream becomes a flood
From all my brothers killing one another
Till waking I realise it's all my own dear blood",Red and Gold,1994

**This song is Bob Dylan's 'If You Gotta Go, Go Now'. Here's the original:

 Listen to me, baby,
 There's something you must see.
 I want to be with you, gal,
 If you want to be with me.
 
 But if you got to go,
 It's all right.
 But if you got to go, go now,
 Or else you gotta stay all night.
 
 It ain't that I'm questionin' you.
 To take part in any quiz.
 It's just that I ain't got no watch
 An' you keep askin' me what time it is.
 
 But if you got to go,
 It's all right.
 But if you got to go, go now,
 Or else you gotta stay all night.
 
 I am just a poor boy, baby,
 Lookin' to connect.
 But I certainly don't want you thinkin'
 That I ain't got any respect.
 
 But if you got to go,
 It's all right.
 But if you got to go, go now,
 Or else you gotta stay all night.
 
 You know I'd have nightmares
 And a guilty conscience, too,
 If I kept you from anything
 That you really wanted to do.
 
 But if you got to go,
 It's all right.
 But if you got to go, go now,
 Or else you gotta stay all night.
 
 It ain't that I'm wantin'
 Anything you never gave before.
 It's just that I'll be sleepin' soon,
 It'll be too dark for you to find the door.
 
 But if you got to go,
 It's all right.
 But if you got to go, go now,
 Or else you gotta stay all night.",Si Tu Dois Partir,1994

(Chorus)
Just a roll, just a roll
Just a roll on your drum

And there's no-one else there,
And the world is no more

 Converse with Reynardine.

 Her lips as red as wine,

 Did that sly, bold Reynardine.
 
 She said, ""Kind sir, be civil,
 My company forsake,
 For in my own opinion
 I fear you are some rake.""

London Danny is a real bad penny
The one man time has told me I should fear
For the girl you left behind, she said she would be mine
So why did you have to come and show your face round here


For she always said that time would make it right
But now I always hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go
Ah but please now don't you take her from me, London Danny

Well I've learned to listen for your name round town
Whe people talk of your success in city life
But I could never tell if she heard them talk as well
Or rue the day she ever was a poor man's wife

For she always said that time would make it right
But now I always hear her sighing in the night
And don't think I don't know, if you asked her then she'd go
Ah but please now don't you take her from me, London Danny

Well me' hands are black while yours are clean and clever
There's ways you know to turn her pretty head
Well its all that I can do when me' working day is through
To let her heart beat me to sleep each night in bed

A-picking the primrose just as she went.

From give and take, and still somehow

To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall

Lord Donald's wife came into the church, the gospel for to hear 
And when the meeting it was done, she cast her eyes about 
And there she saw little Matty Groves, walking in the crowd 
""Come home with me, little Matty Groves, come home with me tonight 
Come home with me, little Matty Groves, and sleep with me till light"" 
""Oh, I can't come home, I won't come home and sleep with you tonight 
By the rings on your fingers I can tell you are my master's wife"" 
""But if I am Lord Donald's wife, Lord Donald's not at home 
He is out in the far cornfields bringing the yearlings home"" 

And a servant who was standing by and hearing what was said 
He swore Lord Donald he would know before the sun would set 
And in his hurry to carry the news, he bent his breast and ran 
And when he came to the broad millstream, he took off his shoes and he swam 

Little Matty Groves, he lay down and took a little sleep 
When he awoke, Lord Donald was standing at his feet 
Saying ""How do you like my feather bed and how do you like my sheets 
How do you like my lady who lies in your arms asleep?"" 
""Oh, well I like your feather bed and well I like your sheets 
But better I like your lady gay who lies in my arms asleep"" 
""Well, get up, get up,"" Lord Donald cried, ""get up as quick as you can 
It'll never be said in fair England that I slew a naked man"" 
""Oh, I can't get up, I won't get up, I can't get up for my life 
For you have two long beaten swords and I not a pocket knife"" 
""Well it's true I have two beaten swords and they cost me deep in the purse 
But you will have the better of them and I will have the worse 
And you will strike the very first blow and strike it like a man 
I will strike the very next blow and I'll kill you if I can"" 

So Matty struck the very first blow and he hurt Lord Donald sore 
Lord Donald struck the very next blow and Matty struck no more 
And then Lord Donald took his wife and he sat her on his knee 
Saying ""Who do you like the best of us, Matty Groves or me?"" 
And then up spoke his own dear wife, never heard to speak so free 
""I'd rather a kiss from dead Matty's lips than you or your finery"" 

Lord Donald he jumped up and loudly he did bawl 
He struck his wife right through the heart and pinned her against the wall

It's the perfume of a rose.

And it is there if you are searching,
But the moment must be right,
As the night is black, as the day is white.
Please my friend help to make me glad,
Help me find the one and only thing I've never had.

Faith,"Is it obvious to you
When you walk into a room
Your face is all I see?

And my heart races so fast
I never knew a rush to feel like that
Every time you're touching me

I never did believe in anything
I couldn't hold between my fingers
But the way you make me feel
It's just so real the way it lingers

I get lost inside your stare
Lost when you're not there
When everything I have doesn't mean a thing
If it's without you

If it's a dream, don't wake me up
I'll scream if this isn't love
If bein' lost means never knowin'
How it feels without you
I wanna stay lost forever
I wanna stay lost forever with you

No, this feeling doesn't end
It's with me everywhere I am
Hope it never goes away

It's like defying gravity
Losin' all control and bein' free
And I always wanna stay

I never thought that I'd let go
Long enough to fall for someone deeply
Who had the power to erase my fears
And find me so completely

I get lost inside your stare
Lost when you're not there
When everything I have doesn't mean a thing

Don't tell me where we're goin'
I don't wanna know
I like the mystery
I can't believe we've come this far
So far away from where we started off
You found me when I wasn't lookin'
You found me

And now I'm lost inside your stare
Lost when you're not there
And everything I have doesn't mean a thing
If it's without you, without you

If it's a dream, don't wake me up
I'll scream if this isn't love

Breath held tightly in my body 
A world that's growing darker 
Not worth a longer stay 

All the wisdom that I earned 
Can't make a change to this state 
As I lay down my spirit's arms 
On my knees to seal my fate 

I cast my hopes into the waters 
Awaiting judgement from the sea 
And someday the tide will rise 
Up so high to swallow me 

Collapsing pride and fading joy 
Are marking my capitulation 
To a world that cries in pain 
And slowly dies in misery 

Come the demons of my soul 
To carry my sane mind away 
I'm just a noble soul of honour 
Who has left its way

Cast my thoughts into the water
Awaiting judgement from the sea
And someday the tide will rise
Up so high to swallow me",Judgement [Faith and The Muse],
Faith & the Muse,"When to her lute Corinna sings
Her voice revives the leaden strings
And doth on highest note appeare
As any challeng'd echo cleare
But when she doth of mourning speake
Ev'n with her sighs the strings do breake

And as her lute doth live or die
Led by her passion so must I
For when of pleasure she doth sing
My thoughts enjoy a sudden spring
But if she doth of sorrow speake
Ev'n from my hart the strings do breake",When to Her Lute Corinna Sings,1996
Faith & the Muse,"How carelessly the bound daylight caresses 
Oblivious to wandering eyes extinguished 
Free me reckless with the night 
Elusive scenes enkindled burst to fire 

Where splendor casts umbrageous twin 
And love sparks radiance 
To guide the heart from within All in search for you
Eve of brilliance 

'Till the morning proves indifference 
For the sparks die Leaving shadows in my vision
How dutifully the dull sunlight chastises 
Adopted wings that dare arise with promise 

Incandescent I represent Pandora's uninformed enlightenment 
And fears that creep about my flame 
Evanesce until the dawn calls them 
Home again bearing thoughts of you

And I'm helpless to see 
Unbecoming of me Blindly mythicizing
Etiolation emphasized by merrythoughts 
Once broken by moonlight 

Oh brighter to have never loved 
Than gather ghosts of the blinding 
Relentless sun idealized in you
And I can't bear to see 

Unbecoming of me Love is not dead",Sparks,1998

Got the time and the place and I got rhythm

And if she?ll say my darling I'm yours
I'll throw away my striped tie and my best pressed tweed

Now I'm more debonair, ssh, break
And I sell it here, I start this step, see?
And then I build it, double it

She appears all in white, I take her hand, kiss it
And lead her on the floor
This step's good for the costume, Astaire's pat

No never fall again

Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love
Me then leave again
Cause I'm falling in love with

Last night I was the nigga that shot up your projects
Now I'm back in the hood, with rocks in the Pyrex
Tan khakis and them Nike Airs with the dyed checks
I was forced to live this life, forced to bust my chrome
My pops left me in a foster home
I felt abandoned like Quik now that Mausberg gone
So I don't hop in the SS without the Mossberg homes
I've been rappin' for a year and a half, my life is real
Put the gun in his mouth, he gon' bite the steel
Come to Compton, I got stripes for real
Before Dre, before the ice, before the deal - I was almost killed
Like 'Pac before the Death Row deal
I got shot over two pounds of weed, still ain't found them niggas
But karma come quicker for a nigga on the other side of the gun

Red rags in Uptown Harlem now, I need that love
Front court at the Knicks game, new chick, French name
New car, new house, and sometimes friends change
And you don't need that love, when you G's like us
And your Jesus piece is sim-u-lar to Biggie's
And your life story is sim-u-lar to 50's
First they hate you, then they love you, then they hate you again
What the fuck do it take for a gangsta to win?
No mics, no Unsigned Hype, nigga fuck The Source
Plus them awards I don't need
And them niggas breathing the same air as me, acting like they don't bleed
We don't drive the same speed, this a Continental T
That's a case of Armadale, this a continental suite
So I'mma drown in my own sorrows
Live life, fuck tomorrow, nigga cause reality is

I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change

But I got nieces to feed, two coasts to please
So I roam through the city like the ghost of E
Gotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be
Nothing between all my niggas that's close to me
In the streets with two fellas packing toast for me
I'm 'posed to be, got all the critics watching my pivot
On my block in the Coupe reading kites from prison
I got niggas doing life in prison
All my fallen soldiers is one of the reasons we pour out liquor
So this song is for Ms. Wallace, Afeni Shakur
And all the mothers of dead sons that went out in the war

Ain't nobody who can really love me like you do

Now I have direction
And I know where I want to be

Cuz I love what you do
When you're making sweet love to me
I thought that I was wrong
For wanting to be with you all the time
I never knew
That you would play games with my mind
Ain't nobody who can love me like you do
Ain't no reason that I'll ever be untrue
There's no need for me to try

Ain't nobody who can really love me like you do

I get this feeling
Fill me with your love
Can't nobody love me like you boy

When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

Yo I ain't one to complain but there's things in the game
(What's your name?) Consequence, I'm tight, burnt like flames
(And why's that?) American dreams, they got this ghetto kid in a fiend 

Don't stress that cause it's not in your bloodstream
Your whole being, comes from greatness, d'you remember
Satan got you caught in the storms of December
And brothers on the block packing nines like September
Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender

Yo I be on the avenue where they be acting brand new
I'm splurging on these Reebok joints for shorty boo

All of a sudden, I saw these two kids fronting
Talking out they joints but they wasn't saying nothing
My hand was on my toolie they was acting unruly
(Say word) Yo word up, yo I was tight caught up
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because I'm positive it seems that negative dies

Yo we was at the dice game making these cats look silly
Flaming, steady running off at the Willie

I had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough
I gotta see some loot so all my girls I blow
Shook them shits in my palm let em hit the flo'
Kept my eyeballs scoping for them pigs po-po
I got to go on the ave see my parole by fo'
But I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo

And I was doing it, til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike
One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite

Yo I know the feeling, when you feeling like a villain
You be having good thoughts but the evils be revealing
And the stresses of life can take you off the right path (no doubt)
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff
We gotta hold it down so we can move on past
All adversities, so we can get through fast, like that

I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

You got the N.W.O. (low cash flow)
Your baby's on the way (and you don't know who)
And crosstown niggas trying to (bust at you)
Hey yo they got me stressed out (and you don't know what to do)
So frame this Kodak black, and vision to my contact
With a poultry scrap, workers get pistol smacked
The switch hitting Queens, niggas liquid sword spitting
With raw poppy, and now your first love is krill
Your vision of the mil got crept like Hey Lover
Tried to rise to the top, you just couldn't recover
And all I want is my laceration of the pie
To get this whip cream before the water runs dry
Niggas flash-dancing yo I don't know why
You're sick of snitching, she got you cruising to the pokey
Like Smokey, the stress be trying to squeeze out a homey
While I be trying to get star status like Shinobi
So we can build a dynasty, just like the Toby's
And all I want, is the world to know my steez
These money hungry niggas is seven thirty
And got me stressed out like these frog MC's

I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

I remember the days you used to love me.
I gave you al my precious love and anything you wanted from me.

You can't deny what I'm feeling is real and I stood right by your side,
went through all the hurt and pain.

Hours, days and nights I sat and I prayed
Never thought that I would see this day
I didn't think that it could hurt so bad
A broken heart was never meant for me

Lord, let it please rain on my face
So that it could wash away all my tears
If this is the house that love is in let me leave
Cuz I don't wanna be hurt like this again

Many times I watched you while you were asleep
With thoughts of living life with only you
If I had read your mind and things could have changed
I'll give anything to be with you again

All I ever wanted was to see your face
And hear your pretty voice from day to day
Now that you've gone I have no reason for feeling that way

Lord you got to keep the faith
Faith: don't let your love turn to hate
Right now we got to
Keep the faith
Keep the faith

Lord we got to keep the faith

Tell me baby when I hurt you
Do you keep it all inside
Do you tell me al's forgiven
And just hide behind your pride

Everybody needs somebody to love
(mother, father)
Everybody needs somebody to hate
(please don't leave me)
Everybody's bleeding
'cause the times are tough
Well it's hard to be strong
When there's no one to dream on

Faith: you know you're gonna live thru the rain
Lord you got to keep the faith
Now you know is not too late
Oh you got to keep the faith
Faith: don't let your love turn to hate
Right now we got to
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Keep the faith
Lord we got to keep the faith

Walking in the footsteps
Of society's lies
I don't like what I see no more
Sometimes I wish that I was blind
Sometimes I wait forever

To stand out in the rain
So no one sees me cryin'
Trying to wash away the pain
Mother father

There's things I've done I can't erase
Every night we fall from grace

It's hard with the world in yours face
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on

Faith: you know you're gonna live thru the rain
Lord you got to keep the faith
Faith: don't let your love turn to hate
Right now we got to keep the faith
Faith: now it's not too late
Try to hold on, trying to hold on

You always make me feel
Now I won't try to justify
What I did but I'll tell you why
If you think someone else is in my life
Then maybe you'll treat me right, yeah

 I'm missing you I'm not go lie you were my first and only love
 It's taking every piece of me to be strong and not to leave
 Late at night I get so weak it's that fact that you're not here

 I tried my best to stop you when you were trying to leave
 I tried to tell you that your seed's inside of me

I was wrong
When I looked into your eyes I didn't see all the things I used to,
What's going on

You gave me reasons to believe that we were always meant to be but now I see
You were wrong
You can't keep running back to me with all those baby baby pleases no more
No more

Never imagined you would be a faded picture I'm emotional (I'm emotional)
It's so believing your deceiving it's official I'm emotional, (I'm emotional)

I can't forget that night I saw you in the corner wrapped up tight
You were wrong ooh
Slow dancing on the floor while I was watching from the door so hurt
There you were
You gave me reasons to believe that we were always meant to be but now I see
You were wrong
You can't keep running back to me with all those baby baby pleases no more
No more

Never imagined you would be a faded picture I'm emotional (I'm emotional)
It's so believing your deceiving it's official I'm emotional, (I'm emotional)

You had your chance
But you threw it all away
Thought you had my love always (oh baby)
I don't understand (I just don't understand)
How you think that we could stay

Faith Evans,"Yo believe I paid the dues man I started in the game
With mans on linden and Devan we drinking ghetto champagne
Slinging rocks and packing glock's on the blocks
It's early in the morning I'm selling tumbs from my Reebok

Tres nicks and dimes I write rhymes
But the ghetto times they got the cheeks doing crimes
The street life yeah that's the only life I know
Where niggas sling rocks bust shots and push yeah yo

Sit on crates keep their backs against gates
Every man is insane he's got a brain like Norman bates
Timberland boots ski hats we pack gat's
Carry across town because we tapping Niggers Hoodrats

But they don't want the fam
See a south side Jamaica queen fellas get down man
Listen so what your crew is x-rated
Peoples if you violate you getting violated

[Chorus]
Come on and keep it real; this is saying
that the lost boy and group home fam want it all what would you do
And if you feel that you'se a real soldier from the street
throw your hand in the air we salute you
Bounce it up town bounce it down south
Bounce bounce it up town bounce it down south

I had a messed up childhood the head is mad nappy
I need money in a snap gee kid I'm trying to blow like papi
Fat cat the street life is where it's at
Peeling caps so yo we got to stay strapped

Terrified cause the crew from the south side is bustin
No question
I keep my hear in braids taliq got dreads
Hangin out in the reds wearing levis and pro-keds

Pouring beer on the curb for the dead
I had to bring drama to some powder head
(Freaky TAH) hey yo cut the music down
Yo half the world thought the album failed in this 94 and its on..

I'm smoking weed in 96' with my peeps
Jetting from the police cause police they'se a bunch of creeps
I'm testing off the new burners in the park
We sleep during the day and creep when it's dark

I once had to cry when I seen Tyrone die
This black on black crime I cram to understand why
Baby girls having kids in their teens
Young fellows baggy jeans slinging crack to the crack fiends

That's the type of lifestyle that I lead
With my fams on the corner drinking beers and smoking weed
Yo believe I been through all the struggles and the pain
I'm ripping out my hairs and I can't get to my brain

I want the gold teeth and chains
I hustle with timberland boots and rainsuits when it rains.
Fools make your moves pay dues
Give up your cheese you loose my baby boy need shoes

Stepping to the CHEEKS you made an error
You been to the ?house of pain? now welcome to my yard of terror
What you think I'm some sucka
Word to him I stomp you out with my tim chukkas

Who who you stepping to the lost boy crew
Boy get stomped that ass is through

[Chorus]
See we live the street life
Smoking blunts with the wife stay on point like a ....
Every day on rockaway is getting hotta
I can't do what a want to I do what I gotta

Survive I might not be around in 95
See I was taught young to be strong and just strive
So nowadays we packing guns
We racking grimy hills for funds and I stash all my sons mons

A little man to look after
Taking rap as a joke but I see no laughter
To man Charles Suitte and big tig in Atlanta and Va.....

I was in misery without you
I could not imagine life without you
It was such a painful thing to go through
Have you bein' taken away
But I, I dried my tears
Even though it took a couple of years
I guess I had to just get over my fears
Of bein' alone
But it gets

It gets, it gets easier

I thought my life was over without you
Thought I would be oh so sad darlin'
'Cause you left me here to face all my fears
All by myself, with nobody else
Now that you're gone, I just gotta move on
But my love'll never change
It'll always stay the same
I felt you were gone, the lonely nights alone
I get weak, then I'm strong

Don't feel like movin' on, oh, yet I know
 
Just breathin' air is hard to bare
When the one that you love is not there
 
Thoughts of you sit heavy on my mind
 
I always reminisce on our good times

I just take it day by day
I know that it'll never be easy

I dreamt of, him every night, he had me, on cloud nine
Thought I could trust him, why?, he said to me when I needed him
He was there for me, then I found out he did the same
For every girl, with a pretty face

I just wanted to believe that
He was so innocent, so sweet
He did everything for me and
People told me all along, he was wrong
But I was so naive
Don't let him do to you what he did to me

Thought I told you that, he would break your heart

Thought I told you that, he had another girl
You're not the only woman in his world
Thought I told you that, he would make you cry
I don't see how you believe his lie
Thought I told you that, I hate to say that I told you so
Take it from me, you better leave him alone

He played me the whole time, that's why I'm warning you
I'm not the jealous type
'cause I've already been there done that
And nothing that he says will make me want him back
It does matter what he sends me
A dozen flowers or a diamond that's bling bling
It's all good but I'm not the one to be staying home while he's having fun

I drop a tear when I, hear yo' name
Mariella Holloway, why you gotta be so far away?
Used to say, ""Don't worry, it's gon' be okay""
But it ain't it's like when you left, you took the Lord witchu
Why couldn't I come when he came to get you?
Damn I really miss you I had to say it again
I remember the time when I was like ten
Crept up in the neighbor's yard, yeah, bein hard headed
You told me I would get it you said it!
And boy did I get it, but after you spanked me, you hugged me
Kissed me on my forehead, told me that you love me
And I saw, that it hurt you, more than it hurt me
I thought how bad could this hurt be? I know now
That's why it's only done out of love
What I wouldn't give for one mo' hug, from grandma

I thank you for when you first met her, accepted and lovin' my wife
I thank you for those Sunday dinners, they were vital
I thank you for my life, I thank you for the bible
I thank you for the songs that you sing in the mornin'

I thank you for the two beatings you gave me
Cause I know somewhere along the line
The lesson I learned from the two beatings saved me
And when you died I cried like a baby, I begged the Lord to take me
Cause no one else could give me what you gave me

Get up on some pads Gwen, my chick get her ass in
For the track, make my money
Bring it on back to the middle of the floor
I want the whole stack
Plus I, need a little more, I gotta eat a little mo'
My seed gotta grow
I got a reason to flow, a reason to show
What I mean is I go
off like a champ, when I cling to the floor
My Twinkies shine when I hit the strip, 'llac dipping
Strictly pimping, as long as tricks invest in women
From the Memphis Tenn., to the N-why-see I'm representing
I put mo' spice into yo' life than yo' entire kitchen
Big dicking, choking hoes with anaconda
If my pimping was a drink it'd be a can of Thunder
I slang lumber, a spell I keep my women under
Through all seasons, they fall winter spring and summer
I hit the highway smoked out pistol gripping
But I ain't tripping though I'm high as hell, spaceship'n

When we met I was talkin' that game
Parkin' that thang
Since then between us
A lot of things changed
Now it's like the world got a whole different name
I can't stop chicks from sayin' my name
Most of it's lies
If not, don't be surprised
You knew I was ballin' when I met you
But really, I started layin' low just to net you
I'm raw as hell yet can't deny that you special
These girls can't either
Winter, his and her Vivas
Summer, his and her Louie sneakers
You don't think that bother people
Guess again you even need to check your friends
Sayin' that I cheat
Right, maybe with my heat
Got a pearl handled chrome thing that I call Sweets
I greet wit her, creep wit her, even eat wit her
Late nights under my sheets, yeah I sleep with her
But thats it

Look
Ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryin' to split us as lovebirds
But that's not it
Now you see me buyin' her whips and shit (No)
You see me sendin' her on trips and shit (No)
If the answers no don't forget (How she know you then)
I don't know

If I don't know I don't know, lets not go that road
I don't know who she is, don't care who told
Look stop flippin', no need to explode
I seen the number in the pager, I don't know that code
In the streets too much, come on, that's absurd
Gettin' no complaints when I be flippin' them birds
Your girls just talk 'bout this that and the third
Believe half what you see none of what you heard
You askin' me who's her I'm askin' who's mink fur
With that rock on her hand makin' their eyes blurred
Could that be you plus who cop every gem
Who spend like I spend, then act like it then
Got the dream home and we settled in it
Our lives too perfect that's why they meddle in it
Now, just chalk it up as just part of the game
You know who I'm about, who got part of my name?

Ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryin' to split us as lovebirds

I don't know

Do you love me babe (Sho' you right)
You thinkin' of me babe (Well at least tonight)
I bet you'd tell me anything (Yeah thats right)
Just to be with me (Yep and tonight's the night)

Do you love me babe (Sho' you right)
You thinkin of me babe (Well at least tonight)
I bet you'd tell me anything (Yeah thats right)
Just to be with me (Yep and tonight's the night)

I'm not most men my heart truer than theirs
Of course your girls hate, our whips newer than theirs
We hardly fight, arguements way fewer than theirs
Even down to the ice, look, bluer than theirs
What they gonna tell us about us, huh?
What they talk 'bout without us, huh?
The envy got 'em speakin loosely
Tell 'em walk in your shoes
But first let 'em know they Gucci

And even if I did twist her
I promise I didn't kiss her
Won't shit touchy feely
Grudge on the floor like Mister did to Celie
No respect shown
My homies laugh while she talk dirty on the speaker phone
Now don't you start
I spared your heart
If you ain't see it I didn't do it
Ain't I played my part?
Bricks chics whips chips, that just go with the grind
What else do you want from me, to say it, fine

Ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryin' to split us as lovebirds
But that's not it
Now you see me buyin' her whips and shit (No)
You see me sendin' her on trips and shit (No)
If the answers no don't forget (How she know you then)

It's the things you do make me cling to you, 'cause I know it's alright.

You're not an ordinary lover, you give me sometimes keep me so satisfied.

Faith Evans,"It was all a dream
(""It was all a dream"")

Last night I had a dream
Thoughts was racing through my head (it was all a dream)
Felt so real to me
This is what was said

Had a dream I said, bout who he said?
'Bout B.I.G. I said, that's big he said
Dig he said, proceed he said
Indeed I said, so, breathe I did
Don't repeat what I say I said, he said nothing
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes I repeated what was said
It came to me like a well as even I said
""You feel playboy,"" was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?
""More money, more problems, better believe it,"" he said
""Careful what you wish for you might receive it,"" he said
I see I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said, ""Hov' remind yourself
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself""
I agree I said, my one of a kind self
Get stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before
""Just keep doing your thing,"" he said, say no more

Was it all a dream, tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dream
I gotta know (It was all a dream)
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dream

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hanging pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, ""Rap Attack,"" Mr. Magic, Marley Marl 
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock 
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match 
Remember Rappin' Duke? ""Duh-ha, duh-ha""
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the 
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey be, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
Uhh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Was it all a dream, tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dream
I gotta know (It was all a dream)
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dream

(It was all a dream)
(It was all)

Faith Evans,"I know God is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me

I wanna walk with you, follow in your footsteps
Talk with you to find out where my good's kept
I been gone away from home for so long
Seems like everything I try to do without you go wrong
I'm confused about a lot of things, but not with my fate
So I'm depending on your holy ghost to guide me the way
See I'm a sinner in the 3rd degree
Ain't afraid to admit it, cause I seen niggas worse than me
Who am I to judge a man when I'm a man myself
In the dark, trying to get me some help
I went from pawn to king, king back to pawn
Doing my best to try to ease out the storm
I know that every tunnel's got an end and a light
And I prepared a new beginning in Christ
My life is like a jigsaw dulling in time
And as I'm thumbing through this jigsaw puzzle of mine

I know God is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me

It seems like every other Wednesday I'm attending a wake
But I don't question you, I know that's your way, ok
I know we living for the minute and there's a moment in time
We've got to leave here, cause that's your design
And nothing lasts forever, not even spirit, only your word
That's what I live by, cause that's what I heard
I wasn't there when you rose from the dead or parted the sea
I never seen you, but still I believe
How you explain the moon, the sky, the stars and the rain
The sun and the sea, the earth without form facing the deep
In darkness challenging the powers that be
It's impossible for scientists to make up the seas, to make up the trees
So why we turn our backs on the truth?
It's heaven or hell, the point we seem to hide from the youth
And I was singing this morning, got touched by the spirit
So I wrote it down for the homies to hear it

I know God is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me

Lord I know that I've been wrong
They say a man is lost without a prayer, without a song
So I'm singing on my knees cause I believe you'll keep me strong
Until it's time for me to bring it home
But until it's time for me to bring it home
I'll be out in these streets, hanging in the hood
Even gangsters need to pray, cause when I pray it's understood
That I got flaws about myself, I can't make it by myself
I need the heaven's help, I want to follow in your foot steps
Done seen the strongest man bow down to a higher power
And given all his glory to god cause god towers
Over all, and in that I save this prayer
For all my homies that's been trapped out there
That's stuck in their ways, it's different now than back in the days
So fuck what they say, cause ain't no coming back from the grave
So when the gun goes pop and the lights go out
Then you'll understand what I'm talking about

I know God is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me

The heat hurt, blew off ya front porch, your backyard
Ya'll niggaz like dicks, pause
Thick jaws, act hard, so they keep squirtin'

Like when New York couldn't beat Boston
Controllin' the nets, I float on ya block
Hop out, post up, move rocks often
Shut the shot down, pass it to Chris

When mami's with the ax, make my baby momma ask
Look, that's the crime

An' I don't wanna force y'all to give checks, uh
Without tax, Freeway shoot ya from ya head to ya toe
From ya toes to ya neck

Pull ya top back, drive through at McDonald's
In front of Ronald, put ya brains on ya Big Mac
Make sure the bitch don't leave

With boxers, so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the '89
Dealt with my boys, with my whistle on freeze
That's how you know I got the block on smash

Sister you don't have to cry
Everything will be alright
My sister you don't have to weep
'Cause things are getting better

A mother worries about the son she raised
Alone 'cause he is fighting with danger and
It's getting close, but he won't listen
She prays to god and asks him would you please
Protect him but she is not alone

A young girl's lying about the weight she's 
Gaining because she is hiding a baby
That her boyfriend says he didn't father
He said he was in love but now he can't
Be bothered but keep your head up high
Little sister

Struggling, trying, working days and school at
Night the bills are piling, patience low and 
Pressures high and you can't take it. you say
You'll just throw up your hands but you can make it, somebody understands.

To fight the wind and the waves
To captain the ship
So I don't mind the storm
I'm willing to sail

I rap about love and life, ladies get to know me
If you feelin' lonely, I can be your one and only
I put it out in the world, so people show me love (echoes)
Yeah, I always get it back
This ain't no pimp game here, that's a different track
We talkin' this and that, we need to get with this
I keep it realer than most, this is our business

What we gotta do to make them see
We got a good thing going on
Wanna tell the world if they don't know
That what we have is real
Wanna shout it from the mountains baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me
I know, you know, we know

Yo, hey baby look like you need a break tonight
Let me make it right, baby won't you stay the night
I got a lot of love as you know you're my favorite right?
Hey my lady, what we gon' make tonight (our love...)
That's the dream, but I never sleep
Across the crowded room, our eyes forever meet
But without doubt and gloom, cuz we can never be
That's why I got to go, cuz you're my impossible love
You're the horizon I can see but never ride off into
I write my lyrics to you, you the perfect instrumental
I sound better than the cat who rappin' to you now
That's between me and you, what happened to us now?
Got you hopin' for the glorious
Waitin' for that victorious feelin' wanted by all of us
Kneelin' and praying that the lord in us will help us love ourselves
So much that the confidence attract to someone else

What we gotta do to make them see
We got a good thing going on
Wanna tell the world if they don't know
That what we have is real
Wanna shout it from the mountains baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me
I know, you know, we know

Yo, Rockin' Los Angeles, House of Blues in Sunset
Performin' like an orgasm, my girl ain't even cum yet
Seen her by the side of the stage givin' me energy
Potentially, wife material connectin' mentally
I felt like heaven sent for me, you're meant for me
The doubters and the haters had to acknowledge eventually
You was a non-believer too if memory serves
And a heart that gives shit, tryin' to play your boy for the her
The harder that I run to you, the farther you become
It's like my heart was part of some movie that hadn't yet begun
This woman moves me and I'm a mountain of a man
You pull me in like the waves do the grain of sand (love, love, love)
Yeah, I love the way you bring it to me
I wrote a song for you, I love to hear you to sing it for me
And let the melody carry me through the jealousy
And we can cruise like Tom and Phenelope

What we gotta do to make them see
We got a good thing going on
Wanna tell the world if they don't know
That what we have is real
Wanna shout it from the mountains baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me
I know, you know, we know

What we gotta do to make them see
We got a good thing going on

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

To kids from one to ninety-two

a shepherd who believed 
that peace could come to any man 
made a promise to the star above 
the day that love began 

i will give to him my lamb 
a shepherds all i am 
and so he walked the lonely sand 
to find the place his heart was dreaming of 
the day that love began 

over meadows over mountains 
they came from valleys and from streams 
every poet and every king 
and one little shepherd with a dream 

but as the shepherd knelt to pray 
his lamb just ran away 
and tear drops filled his empty hand 
he broke his promise to the star above 
the day that love began 

then the smiling face of mary 
beckoned the shepherd to her side 
today you gave him the best gift of all 
the moment that you cried 

once upon a christmas eve 
a shepherd who believed 
that peace could come to any man 
found the place his heart was dreaming of 
and he kept his promise to the star above

Giving the tree the trim
You’ll hear voices by starlight
Singing a Yuletide hymn

Very God begotten not created
O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord

Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation
Sing all ye, citizens of heaven above
Glory to God in the highest
O come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord

See how the Shepard's summoned to his cradle
Leaving their flocks, draw nigh with lowly fear
We too will thither hend our joyful footsteps

Faith Evans,"Man, I know we had a lot of tragedies lately.
I just wanna say rest in peace to Aaliyah,
Rest in peace to Left Eye,
Rest in peace to Jam Master Jay,
And everybody lost in the Twin Towers,
And everybody lost period.
All we got is hope!

I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, and I
Wish my brother would of made bail,
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, and I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, and I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, and I
Wish I could go deep in a zone
And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, and I (I wish)
Wish I could teach a soul to fly
Take away the pain out your hands and help you hold them high, and I
Wish God never gave the men power
To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, and I (I wish)
Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous,
When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, but uh
We will never break, though they devastate, we shall motivate,
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith.
Instead of thinking about who gonna die today,
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today.
Sit at the light so long,
And then we gotta move straight forward, 'cause we fight so strong,
So when right go wrong,
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on, let's hope!

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
'Cause we hopeful!

I wish that you could show some love,
Instead of hatin' so much when you see some other people comin' up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing,
Watch the music and have 'em trippin' of the joy I bring, (shit)
I wish that we could hold hands,
Listen instead of dissin' lessons from a grown man, and I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lack that's on dubs, and I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders,
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, you feel me(I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat,
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers stand strong
You can make it whether you with him or your man's gone, and I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary,
And no po-po bring the heat on our peace like they did R. Kelly, and I
Wish that D.O.C. could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breathe again, (shit) (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again,
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN,
I wish that enemies could talk,
And that super homie Christopher Reeves could still walk, (I wish)
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game, let's hope

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
'Cause we hopeful!

Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it
We can make it always be optimistic,
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way that I can live it
I pray for justice when we go to court,
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war
Why can't we kick it and just get 'em on,
And in the famous words of Mr. King why can't we all just get along?
Or we can find a better way to shop and please, and I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, and I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze
And ask why are we fulfilling these downfalls and these prophecies
You can be wrong if it's you doubting
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
And only the heavenly father can ease the hurt
Just let it go and keep prayin' on your knees in church and let's hope

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay.
'Cause we hopeful!

'Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful, hopeful and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay.
'Cause we hopeful!

Let's be hopeful

1970 somethin' nigga I don't sweat the date my moms was late,
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins,
In this world the fly girls, Tanqueray and Hennesey,
Until I call Earl, 10 months in this gut, what the fuck,
I wish moms would hurry up, so I can get buck wild,
Juvenile with the mics 'n' shit, New York, New York, ready for the likes of this,
Then came the worst date, May 21st, 2:19 was when my momma water burst,
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself,
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help,
Umbilical cords wrapped around my neck,
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step,
I made it out i'm bringin' mad joy,
The doctor looked and said he's gonna be Bad Boy!

I remember back in time, 
Before all the homies died,
Before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time,
Before I even got my ride
Before I had nickels and dimes
I knew that I was goin' somewhere

Would 'Pac be alive, if you let 'Pac drive?
Swear to God to reverse it I give my left eye,
With the right I visualized, the king of Bed-Stuy,
Checkin' his daughter Tianna into junior high,
If I was in Brooklyn, and B.I. Was still alive, in 2006 it might sound like this,
N.&. 718 212, where Sue's rendevouz,
Its like Moulin Rouge,
High fashion, up town Air Force Ones,
And Vasquez, Puerto Ricans with fat asses
Lace Dutch masters, we dump ashes, on models and S Classes,
For you bastards, catch a cab to Manhattan,
With that Broadway actin', you hype that 
belly shit'd get you capped, and wrapped in plastic,
Tell the captain, ask Rog' what's happennin',
Out here nor speak no evil, inside the Magnum

I remember back in time, 
Before all the homies died,
Before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time,

Now I'm 13 smokin' blunts, makin' green,
Or on the drug scene, fuck the football team,
Risk it, ruptured spleens, by the age of 16,
Hearin' the coach scream, make my lifetime dream,
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my doe up,
So school I didn't show up, and fuck my flow up,
Mom said that I should grow up, and check myself,
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself,
Put the drugs on the shelf, naww! I couldn't see it,
Scarface king of New York, I wanna be it,
Rap was secondary, money was necessary,
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary,
C74 mark 8, set me straight, not able to move behind a great steel gate,
Time to contemplate, damn were did I fail,
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail,

I remember back in time, 
Before all the homies died,
Before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was

Stretchin' motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my Pedigree, you better be
Filled with energy, niggaz never gettin' me

It's clear to see that I'm the motherfuckin' man, I done learned from the
Best of em; Took the first slot, niggaz still second guessin' em
Hoes, I'm undressin' em', foes, I'm not stresin' em'
Outlastin' a bunch of 'em , outflowed the rest of em'
Cause everyday, I stay preachin' on the pulpit
So tell them haters they could miss me with that bullshit
But I won't miss, I'm Luda, the heat holder
I'm rich, bitch! I've done more shows than Oprah
And I'm a soldier, ready for whatever
Roll with a bunch of niggaz that don't know no better
King like Coretta, countin' mo' cheddar
Just hired two dykes to be my ho getters
When it comes to these women, dog, ain't no one fuckin' wit me
They runnin' back, you think I had TJ Duckett wit me
That's cause I throw it like Vick, from the yard line
Menage a trois, it's safe to say I'm havin' hard times

To my nigga Chopper dot, with the whoopty-whop on the block
Got the heaters cocked, cause I know the suckers on the block
Hennesey and Belve-D, brings a lot of jealousy
Nigga stop snitchin', nephew, why you tellin' me?
They say the game ain't what it use to be no mo'
Used to be a G, but now he just a ho
Runnin' 'round poitin' fingers, tellin' names
You fuckin' up the rules to this dirty game, and it's a diry shame
I ain't flippin' out, that's probably why I'm dippin' out
Ya'll fools trippin' out, that why I'm on a different route
Now, makin' money, havin' clout, what's what it's all about
Twenty seven cars and a tweleve bedroom house
Now they call me Snoopy Trump
I keep my heater close, cause I love to bust
Now hat's a stain on a nigga, I bang on a nigga
Kick rocks and watch how I do my thang, young nigga; I'm livin' the life!

If I had to do it all again

In ATL I caught a case
And the media tried to say
I had a habit
I couldn’t manage and I am throwing my life away
But everything ain’t what it seems just because its on TV

It might make you happy it might make you sad
Sometimes yeah but I know there’s a reason for everything (but I know)
That’s why I keep believing

Anything you ask for, got it, it's yours
The keys to the crib and all of the toys
I hate to be here away from you for too long
So I gotta hurry up so I can get back home

'Cause I'm so gone, so gone over you
I'm crazy over you, baby
I'm so gone, so gone over you

I'm so gone, you ain't gotta tell me 'cause I already know
Take the burden off your shoulders, let the pressure go
You don't owe me an explanation
We're in a situation that gave us inspiration to grow

I could say a few things that I don't like
But I can say a million things that changed my life
I'm so gone
Now we just gotta hold on and go strong

I love the way that you walk
The smile, your sexy talk
Make me wanna act up, crazy thoughts
Lord, I can't stand but it ain't your fault

Anything you ask for, got it, it's yours

I hate to be here away from you for too long
So I gotta hurry up so I can get back home

'Cause I'm so gone, so gone over you
Baby, baby, I'm so gone, I'm so gone over you
Got me goin' crazy
Don't you know you got me goin' crazy

Let me take the time to let you know, yeah
I can't see myself with no one else but you
You're the sun, and girl, I ride with you, you

You used to love me
I remember the days
You used to love me

You don't appreciate the time
I put into this love affair of ours, baby
I couldn't let you walk around
Thinking it's alright to let me down, I remember

I remember the way
You used to love me
I remember the days
You used to love me

I gave you all my precious love
And anything you wanted from me
You didn't hear me callin' out
Callin' for your warm affection, after all this time

You can't deny what I'm feelin', it's real
And I stood right by your side
Went through all the hurt and pain
Then you turned and walked away

I remember the way
You used to love me
I remember the days
You used to love me

Oh, Remember
Can't give up on the way you used to give it to me, give it to me
What a feeling, it's so real

I remember the way
You used to love me
I remember the days
You used to love me

You didn't hear me callin' out
And that's not what love's about (no, no)

You used to love me everyday,
Now your love has gone away

Faith Evans,"I never thought the sun would shine my way
All I've known is empty promises and pain
I need a way out or some type of escape
So I take refuge in this place

Even though the road to glory seems long
The fire in me could win a marathon
Believe there's nothing you can't overcome

If you dream, then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
If you dream, cause a dream's unstoppable

I could've gave up a long time ago
Though the door I need to get through will always close

Storms and Rain everywhere I go
But I don't give up cause I know

Even if they say you just can't win
Believe you can go where you've never been
And you can fly high with the strength of all your friends

If you dream, then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible
If you dream,
cause a dream's unstoppable

Dream
That you can fly,
Dream
That you can climb
Dream
A mountain, all you gotta do is just
Dream
That you can win,
Dream
With Confidence
Dream
To the very end cause dreamers become champions
Dream
Until it's real,
Dream,
Don't let them kill your
Dream
The fight still is in you, all you gotta do is
Dream,
Just keep the faith,
Dream,
Don't ever break
Don't let it slip away cause all you gotta do

Even though the road to glory seems long
The fire in me could win a marathon
Believe there's nothing you can't overcome

If you dream, then you can do anything
If you dream, you're halfway to destiny
If you dream, dream the impossible

Dear Christopher Frank White Wallace
Yeah it's your boy Kiss I just wanna holla
In your memory I keep the Coogi in my closet
Kangol on the rack, a fresh pair of Wallies
You know I'm still the liquor and the weed child
And still got Branson on speed dial
And everybody's the king now
You ain't gotta be nice getting shot is the thing now
Mafia was doing there best they separated
Now Roc and Gutta doing a stretch, uh, yeah
Kim is still in it to win it
I seen Money L awhile ago but I ain't heard from Cease in a minute
People in power is queer
I could go on for a year 'bout how it would be if you were still here
The game got cheaper, rappers is more commercially successful now
But the heart's alot weaker
You know me still got the flow that'll pop speakers
First option on offense the top feature
It's easy BIG all you need is a protool set
And I ain't touch the paper that I was supposed to yet
Everybody that's somebody show respect
Only a matter of time before they notice that
I'm an impecable lyricist
And with the right mechanics, I could take over be clear of this
They well aware of Kiss the light of the city
And I ain't on the label no more but I'm tighter with Diddy
I got my own plan handle mine like a grown man
Long as I know I'm nice, fuck it I'm my own fan
Remixed the joints you had
But, they could never ever duplicate your swag (Never)
Meanwhile I'm a keep it so on my lil' plans
And you might bump into a few of my lil' mans
Up there stepping with God
Down here Mister Cee in BK still repping you hard
Tianna so pretty, CJ turned into a Lil' Biggie
Just a little lighter but so witty
On your born day, we get the highest
Groovy still the best with the garments, he keep me the flyest
Tonight, Patron is dead
Only right that I take a bottle of Bacardi Limo the head
And before I end it, I gotta say thanks
Cause not only was your time well-spent, it was splendid (thanks)
Miss you, my nigga

[Bridge: Faith Evans (Jadakiss)]
So we'll just keep our heads to the sky (Drink wit 'em)
(Sat wit 'em, talked wit 'em)

Cause I'm sick of them, not followin the curriculum (yeah)
It's my shit and I'm evictin them (get out)
Whoever feel like they ain't gotta leave, I'm rippin them
Even though the love's frail the thug's real
All you gotta do is just follow the blood trail
Much harder fightin when the battle is uphill
Whatever the knife can't handle the slug will
Keep a good lawyer that's smart work on cases
Still gotta run from the NARCs, they gon' chase us (run)
In case I gotta put some artwork on faces
If we leave the game for God they gon' +Mase+ us

Understanding now you're ready

Never took the time to know you

I still get butterflies when you look in my eyes,

And your kisses
They still make me want

So glad we've kept this love alive so long
I'm so glad
I'm so glad we've kept our love so strong.
Still can wait to see your smile and face walk through that door,
Every second that goes by I just love you more and more.

And love can change wonderful
From the first day
Still turn me on, still the one I want,
I still look at you like the first time I've saw you.

Being with you never gets old,
Baby the longest we're together don't matter were we go.
You still knock me of my feet,
It feels like day one is on repeat.
I still love you, you're still fond of me,
Still make me laugh; you put a smile on me.

When I hear your name it brightens up my day,
Baby you're the only one that makes me feel this way!
Feels just like the beginning, I hope there is no ending,
You're my lover friend!
I can see you fall in love again.

[Chorus]

If I'm depending on what people say
After all the feelings change,
But baby you don't have to worry cause I
I forgot all the time that passed,
I look on how we've made it last,
You don't never have to question how I feel
How I feel

Do away with the judge and the mug shots
Like we do away with the day when the sun drops
Clap your hands if you're tired of hearing gunshots
Or hear news about who got popped
By another black man or knocking a white cop
If I ain't there when they start the fight stop like ah
Slow your roller or be cold as a ice pop ya
We gotta start helping each other quit hurting each other
Money you will have a nigger thinking 'bout merking his mother
How does it feel being slaves to a dollar bill?
Givin' ya something y'all can feel, are ya for real

Do away with all the fakes Gloria Estefans
Clap your hands if you gettin' in some real estate
Buy the crib ma' the Benz with the wheels can wait

Now I'm the one breaking up the fight
Making sure that detentions straight
Let a nigga get the heart to push me
I'll snuff the biggest nigga with him
Show em that his partner pussy

Clap again and you're ready to see the change come

That's where the knuckle came from

You ain’t tell me it was so hard
Sometimes I just wanna give up, really
Well you know baby
Sometimes in love you gotta take the hurt, you gotta take the pain
Sometimes in love you gotta take a break, and get away
But things gonna get better
If you stick together
Your love will survive

We’ve been through so many changes
Seems like lately all we do is fight
Took a vow that we would make it but I’ve been having some doubts
And you’ve been having some doubts, babe
I know that I love you and I
Know that I don’t like you all the time
Just two people tryna make it through

And you know that sometimes you say shit that hurt
If we’re wanna make it, gotta stop and take a break
If we don’t we’ll lose all

Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule nombre uno, never let no chick know
What you and your man do in the bedroom
Might feel good when you in it
And you probably want to admit it
But it ain't nobody business
Number two, gotta be a pretty girl all the time (take it from your highness)
Gotta build him up and make him strong
You gotta be the only one he want
Number Three, gotta be a lady in the street
And you gotta be a freak in the sheets

Number four, I know you heard this before
Tell him you love him before he step out the door
Number five, gotta let him wear the pants
You be a lady and you let him be the man
Number six, know how to put it down in the kitchen
When he bring it home you gotta have a good meal fixed
Seven, this rule is so underrated, gotta keep your feelings and your money separated
It's okay to let him have control
But girl, you gotta have your own
Do your own thing
Number eight, gotta keep your head game straight
Number nine, shoulda been number one to me
Gotta take care of the family
Number ten, Be careful of the people you meet
When you 'round in the streets, you better listen to me

 Keep walkin' on, gotta keep walkin' on

And I'm still your wild frontier""

Faith Hill,"Couple of guys sittin' around drinkin'
Down at the Starlight Bar
One of 'em says, ""You know I've been thinking""
Other one says, ""That won't get you too far""

He says, ""This is your life, and welcome to it
It's just workin' and drinkin' and dreams
Ad on TV says ?Just Do It'
Hell if I know what that means""

The secret of life is a good cup of coffee
The secret of life is keep your eye on the ball
The secret of life is a beautiful woman
And Marilyn stares down from the barroom wall

""You and me, we're just a couple of zeros
Just a couple of down-and-outs
But movie stars and football heroes
What have they got to be unhappy about?""

So they turn to the bartender, ""Sam, what do you think?
What's the key that unlocks that door?""
Sam don't say nothin', just wipes off the bar
And he pours them a couple more

'Cause the secret of life is in Sam's martinis
The secret of life is in Marilyn's eyes
The secret of life is in Monday Night Football
Rolling Stones records and Mom's apple pie

Sam looks up from his Sunday paper
Says, ""Boys, you're on the wrong track
The secret of life is there ain't no secret
And you don't get your money back""
Hey

The secret of life is gettin' up early
The secret of life is stayin' up late
The secret of life is try not to hurry
But don't wait
Don't wait

The secret of life is keep your eye on the ball
The secret of life is to find the right woman
The secret of life is nothin' at all

But someday, someway
Baby somehow

Who'll be your only
True romancer
You know that answer
It will be me
What will it take to
Bring you to your senses
And finally convince you
It will be me",It Will Be Me,1999
Faith Hill,"He was sitting on a corner with a bottle of beer
And the same shopping cart he'd been pushing for years
A big smile on his face
Like the first day of spring
All the people looked the other way, but they heard him sing
And he sang

""Love
Love is a sweet thing""
He sang ""love
Love is a sweet thing""

She shot out of Texas
Like a bullet from a gun
With a van full of hippies and a band on the run
She didn't want to be famous
She just wanted to play
In old dive bars and pool halls she got up on stage
And she sang

""Love
Love is a sweet thing
Oh yes it is""
She sang ""love
Love is a sweet, sweet thing""

It's everywhere you look
If you look hard enough
Its really not hard to see
Yeah, once you put your arms around it
You can never get too much
Love is a sweet, sweet thing

It's in the smile of a stranger
In the eyes of a child
On the corner of a crowded street
Its everywhere around us
Its always growing wild
Love is a sweet, sweet thing

Love
Love is a sweet thing
I sang ""love, love, love
Love is a sweet thing
Love
Love is a sweet thing
Oh yes it is""

Faith Hill,"It's such a mystery
How she found something in me
That I never knew was there
But she uncovered it so easily

She turned me like a season
And I began to change
She wrapped herself around me
Now I'll never be the same

That's how love works
That's how love moves
Like a river
Running through you

Sometimes it lifts you as high as heaven
It consumes you
But, that's a given
That's how love moves

I've seen walls that could never be broken
Come tumbling down
I've heard the voice of love
Calling without making a sound

See I was touched by an angel
The day she took my hand
You know she's the miracle
That makes me everything that I am

Sometimes it's just a whisper
Sometimes it's a storm
Sometimes it reaches forever
With it's everlasting arms

That's how love works
That's how love moves
Like a river
Running through you

Sometimes it lifts you as high as heaven
It consumes you
But, that's a given
That's how love moves",That's How Love Moves,1999
Faith Hill,"It's not easy trying to understand
How the world can be so cold, stealing the souls of man
Cloudy skies rain down on all your dreams
You wrestle with the fear and doubt
Sometimes it's hard but you gotta believe

There's a better place, where our Father waits
And every tear He'll wipe away
The darkness will be gone,the weak shall be strong
Hold on to your faith

There will come a day, there will come a day
Wars are raging, lives are scattered
Innocence is lost, and hopes are shattered
The old are forgotten, the children are forsaken
In this world we're living in
Is there anything sacred?

There will come a day, there will come a day
The song will ring out, down those golden streets
The voices of earth with the angels will sing
Every knee will bow, sin will have no trace

In the glory of His amazing grace
Every knee will bow, sin will have no trace
In the glory of His amazing grace
There will come a day, there will come a day

Oooh there will come a day
I know there's coming a day, coming a day",There Will Come a Day,1999

It didn't matter what I thought
It didn't matter what I did

I felt the doubt for what I lacked
Right from the start
It did a number on my head
But it could never touch my heart

'Cause I had just enough imagination
Just enough to keep the faith
That somehow I would think of what to do
When I get lost in a momentary weakness of emotion
Honey angels came around to help me through

Winds blows past pages

I've done it all
I've slammed the doors, I've jammed the locks
I've paved the bricks, I've built the wall
No one could tell me back then
What joy eluded me
Kept bumping into that misery
Locked up deep down inside of me

Took that rage and I
Turned that page and I
Packed my tools, went back to school
Yeah, and I passed my graduation
And I hold my PhD in

Don't you worry
Maybe this is what we need

A little bruising, a little bleeding
Some space that we can breathe in
Some silence in between

So cry for me baby, and I'll cry for you
And we'll both break down and we'll both break through
We'll find our way and we'll face the truth
We both will be stronger
And we'll lie down in our loneliness
And wake up with our sad regrets
Even though we don't know it yet
We both will be stronger
We both will be stronger

I can't believe you're really gone now
But I know it's for the best
And I know that we weren't right
But I still reach for you each night
And man that hurts like hell

And pat you on your wings
And before I grew up I heard you whisper so loud

Like a rocket to the moon.

Every face is a cartoon.
And everyone's stoned on pride
And drunk on cheap champagne.

Tonight this joie de vivre
Sure don't live up to its name.
Now all I can say is

I'd give this world to you
Every rock and every stone
Every masterpiece in Rome

And if you'd ask me to
I'd steal the Mona Lisa
Tear it up in little pieces

And lay them at your feet
For all the world to see.
But tonight I can't give you Paris.

Aristicats are everywhere
And the air is as thick as thieves.
She'd like nothing better than to

Steal the breath from me.
And the tower's lights ain't shinin'
As it hangs its head in shame

At the sight of American blood
On the streets of St. Germain
Washin' up into the Seine

And I'd give this world to you
I'd steal the crown and kingdom
From the Queen of England

And if you'd ask me to
I'd take this city in my hands
Break it down to grains of sand

And lay them at your feet

Shining in the East beyond them far

It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, o night divine

Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains He shall break, for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy name

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away, is the bluebird
Here to stay, is the new bird
He's singing a song, as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?""
We'll say ""No man""
You can do the job
When you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream, by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kids come knock him down

When it's snows, ain't it thrilling?
Though you know kids are chilling
We'll frolic and play

Let me remind you
How you can't resist me in the dark somehow
And it'll makes sense when we're skin on skin
We're laying down
Yeah, you remember now

The sky is made from empty space and stars
Our love is made from lonely broken hearts
And the only thing that keeps us from being gone
Is that we're damn good at holding on

It's more than stubborn, baby
We were playing with matches
We were glued together from the green light glow
From a million miles an hour to settling into something sweet and slow
I'm the owner of that heart you stole

The sky got made from empty space and stars
And our love is made from lonely broken hearts
And the only thing that keeps us from being gone
Is that we're damn good at holding on

And it hasn't changed much
We're either tearing it up or fixing it
It's a white-knuckle month
We're jumping in
We keep jumping in

'Cause the sky is made from empty space and stars
And our love is made from lonely broken hearts
Sometimes the only thing that keeps us where we are
Is that we're damn good at holding on
Holding on

And if they tell then the hungry better battle

Aw I keep it comin' and comin' across the table
And if I miss, I never miss, 'cause I'm able
I'm lookin' forward and I'm lookin' over my shoulder

But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.
 
I read your letters when you're not near me, 
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me 
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.
 
I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better, 
So let's get together.

My wounds are bleeding
Because of the main conflict

The scars on my arms filled with their taste of blood

Crying like he missed her. 
Since we moved away from the house,
Where we used to play.
They say I'll understand on day but I doubt it, 
Mama never say nothing about it. 
How'd it get to be so crowded.
I found it a strain, everywhere I look I see pain.
And I can't escape the feeling, 
Maybe I'm to blame. 
So I strain to listen, 
Praying for a decision, wishing they where kissing.
This feels like extradition or exile, 
Mama finds it hard to smile
So I make pretend cups of coffee in her favorite style.
She says child I'm working so there's nothing you lack.
But she know I want my Dad I want my family back.

I'm on Lonely Street, age forty three.
Couldn't gauge when to quit so my wife quit me.
Took offense, took the kids,
I wish that was the end.

She took care of my best friend.

Quick so I had to work real late.

I was eating. We'd do our cheating over coffees,
Making tea for the bosses. 
Making free with me,
And I agree I got sleazy too easily.

This doesn't usually happen to me.

I wonder what my son's doing today.
Suddenly I'm blinking like the screen 
On my computer display. 
And I'm drinking.
Concerned about what's down the track

Faithless,"I'm sittin' at a coffee table, unable to see straight
Watchin' parallel lines unwind and undulate
Behind the rain-streaked windowpane, the scene's bleak
Another train leavin' home,
Conceding defeat with a low moan

Hangin' in A sky, made of stone
Everybody's leavin' home, I called my man Jerome
To come meet me in the twilight zone
Leave your mobile phone at home and come alone

I bought him coffee and a snack,
Settled back, started speakin'
He was tweakin' with the peak of his cap
While I'm seekin' to discover what it takes to stay sober
Not cover my mistakes,
Try to maybe make sense of the evidence
It's over, she's gone for good
Why should I lie, singin' a killer's lullaby
Identified by the dying ring of her goodbye
The last thing you hear before your life disappear

Now it just gets worse, like my stomach 'll burst,
Feel like I've been cursed.
With seven centuries of bitter memories
And inadequacies, previous he's and she's
I'm movin' round this old house for the last time
Scene of my past crimes, been here for lifetimes
Hearin' the chimes of the old clock that used to mock
You got eternity for takin' stock,
This place is like a padlock
You look shocked.
Trust me, nothing ever moves but the dust,
There's just us and I'm here to torment and tease
And that's how it was for centuries
Me and my memories, till you brought the keys
Took the couple of Saturdays
I moved in runnin' from tragedies and boozing
Seven hundred years since I came here
You appear, same hair, same quizzical stare
I couldn't get near,
And the sheer frustration was more than I could bear
I was really cursed, thought I'd been through the worst part

That was just the first part, just the start
Every night I'd be sittin' with dread pickin' my heart
In case the man she'd been chasin' gets to first base
An' I just can't escape, I'm in bad shape
You making love to someone else is more than I can take
And so I make all the movement I can to no avail
Scream and yell, sinkin' deeper into my personal hell

I'm getting heated, I'm sorry, have another coffee
I needed to release my sparrow chest from just a piece of this pressure
Unless an escape route is found,
I'm going down underground
Into lifetimes of pain, it's absurd
The heaviest chain is contained is the sound of one word
So I'm referred back to hell, huh
Just as well, I hate needles an' get twinges at the thought
Of syringes

J, I'm going insane with shame
I dream and watch her makin' love over and over again
With what I call a farmer's swain
Unintelligent, pea-brained retard who's dick is always hard
Oh God, of course I'm jealous, fellows,
Oversexed flexing his pec's
Jesus, what's he going make her do next?
I'm mad vex, the way she gently scratches his chest
You used to do that to me back in 1253
Pity me, while you lie with your lover
I stare and suffer in despair while you ruffle his hair
Unaware of who else is there
I move quick, I want to try my trick one last time
You know it's possible to vaguely define my outline
When dust move in the sunshine
So I'm tryin' to change, vibrate myself to near-human pitch
Which reminds me how I used to come unstitched
And switch 'round the house in a blind rage
It took years and an ocean of tears to find the key to this
Cage
And write another stage into a new age,
It's difficult to gauge
But I know that I'll see you again, on that you may depend
I just don't know how or when
Sleep on, my lost love on gone

Jerome took me home under steel skies
Knowing I'm prone to dramatize but unknown for telling lies
And what I verbalize he can see behind my eyes
The why oh why's that identify killer lullabies
And he surmised
No surprise couldn't hear that
Closed my eyes as he steered that old black BM home again

Recently Mama's crying all the time 
Is it because of me or my younger sister, 
Even Dad was weeping when he kissed her.
Face all puffy like a blister, 
Crying like he missed her. 
Since we moved away from the house,
Where we used to play.
They say I'll understand on day but I doubt it, 
Mama never say nothing about it. 
How'd it get to be so crowded.
I found it a strain, everywhere I look I see pain.
And I can't escape the feeling, 
Maybe I'm to blame. 
So I strain to listen, 
Praying for a decision, wishing they where kissing.
This feels like extradition or exile, 
Mama finds it hard to smile
So I make pretend cups of coffee in her favorite style.
She says child I'm working so there's nothing you lack.
But she know I want my Dad I want my family back.

I'm on Lonely Street, age forty three.
Couldn't gauge when to quit so my wife quit me.
Took offense, took the kids,
I wish that was the end.
But before she took her leave 
She took care of my best friend.
Working all the hours. 
God send was not the tactic
You see, because after ten years I'm
? Wanted to make the cash
Quick so I had to work real late. 
Bad sex, my woman's vex, even if I stay awake.
And if I'm honest, I had a little cake at the office.
I was eating. We'd do our cheating over coffees,
Making tea for the bosses. 
Making free with me,
And I agree I got sleazy too easily.
But I'm forty three, 
This doesn't usually happen to me.
Now I'm lonely, 
I wonder what my son's doing today.
Suddenly I'm blinking like the screen 
On my computer display. 
And I'm drinking.
Concerned about what's down the track 
If I don't get my family back.

Today i woke up feeling sad
I know that you said,
That one day i would be glad
Hold the choirs of winter,

The birds are calling to me and
All the leaves i came to love are falling
Ribbons on evergreen, owls that pull them apart
I can hear you singing my funny valentine
Oh you know that breaks my heart
Hold the choirs of winter,
The birds are calling to me and
All the leaves i came to love

Oh you know that breaks my heart
Oh you know that breaks my heart

Running with my rain face on
No idea of what to say
No idea of who to do
In this fear that never goes
Waiting for all my dreams
Oh you know it breaks my heart
Hold the choirs of winter,
The birds are calling to me and
All the leaves i came to love

Oh you know it breaks my heart
Oh you know it breaks my heart
Oh you know that breaks my heart",Evergreen,2001

Remember Emily?
""That's a long time"" [2x]
In a long dress one summer day she said yes
Now every special request requires another
So many times it feels endless, a big yes
Branded red on each breast
But she selfless out there
Doing her best strangest thing
Nobody seemed to be impressed.
The more she do for this fool
The more she behind schedule
Had no fun for so long
Old records turned her onto High School flings
And she was full of daring

Colourful hair, used to wear thirteen rings
Now she staring drudgery
Full in the face and accepts it as her place
And just in case there's anything she missed,
She recheck the list
Does it over again,
To make sure it's spotless.

Jimmy longed for how it used to be,
She was viscous and volatile
She was feisty, iced tea was the tipple never asked nicely,
Her lips used to curl down ever so slightly, impolite,
Fire burned bright behind the Oakleys,
He just had to get to grips.

After a few long sips juice begin to lose flavour,
She no longer gets to savour being consumed.
Jimmy asleep drunk in the other room still in his shoes
Escaping headlong into the booze,
The whole house vibrating with the changes of moods.

From feisty she turned into ""be nice to me""
In the old days he'd 've been wearing Ice T,
Jimmy prayed those times times returned,
She was fine and so beautifully unconcerned.

Jimmy told her, on the day he quit
""You don't love me you love the relationship""

Me?
I'm the progeny product of Misogeny,
Jimmy and Emily's homogeny
They promised me nothing but honesty,huh,
And that's all I got,
I could never be the cement in their destiny,
They still haven't forgiven me,
You know my own woman's leaving me
Said she stopped believing me,
Can't even see what she saw in me,
I told my woman she was beautiful,
She didn't believe,
Convinced herself I was preparing to leave,
so she took my son and left the world to freeze.

I told my woman she was beautiful Ten Times a Day,
Ten Times a Day she'd Smile, and look away.

I end up throwing my love down a bottomless pit.
And giving myself away...",Giving Myself Away,2001

If you place a thing into the center of your life 
That lacks the power to nourish 
It will eventually poison everything that you are 
And destroy you 

A simple a thing as an idea 
Or your perspective on yourself of the world 
No one can be the source of your contempt, 
It lies within, in the center. 
Only with mellow while your thin enough to slide through

Now when you climb
Into your bed tonight
And when you lock
And bolt the door
Just think of those
Out in the cold and dark
'Cause there's not enough love to go round

Now when you climb [fade]
And when you lock [fade]
Just think of those
out in the cold and dark
'Cause there is not enough love to go round

I tell you, wake up
You people need a shake up
You take up so much time
Worrying, scurrying
Here, there
Losing your hair
No money to spare
No love to share
No wonder you appear under pressure from here
You look fresher
But all I got is dirt in my hair
My nightmares manifest
But I can escape
Your's is in your chest

The tape is running
I push the button to send
Upon each other we all depend

Or where I came from
People fear contamination

I may mistaken be
But I patiently wait
On the path to humanity
I sit at the gates

Like my skin
Rain falling, once again

I'm gonna struggle for air
There's hair in my food
When I get it usually someone already half ate it
I try not to let it
Get me down
But my head's starting to pound
People go round, and round and round

From one I get a cigarette
A little more love found
But the ground is still wet
My teeth are chattering
And there's a spattering of seeds
Sometimes I lose all feeling in my feet
When I sleep I'll do my deep in the mainstream
But unaccountably my heart has grown
Small and mean
I hurry past
Retched people I pretend I haven't seen
But there's money in my pocket
And my clothes are clean

(Repeat 4X)
I said money in my pocket
But I just can't give no love

Blows my mind like munition
I'm amazed

So much heaven, so much hell
So much love, so much pain
So much more than I thought this world could ever contain
So much bought, so much sold
One man's loss, another man's gold
So much more than I thought this world could ever hold

We're just children, we're just dust
We are small, we are lost
And we're nothing
Nothing at all

One bomb
The whole block gone
Can't find my children
And dust covers the sun
Everywhere is noise, panic
And confusion
But to some another fun day in Babylon
I'm going to bury my wife
And dig up my gun
My life is done
So now I'm going to kill someone...

So much heaven, so much hell
So much love, so much pain
So much more than I thought this world could ever contain
So much bought, so much sold

Tried not to slide and let the side down 
Now the plane's on the ground
I'll find a good profession

I've come to the motherland to make a home to put my bed in
This weather does my head in
Some people are less than kind I wish
Mama was here so I could unwind
But I'm supposed to be the good news
So I lace up these hard black shoes
And look - more work
These streets were never paved with gold
They simply make my feet hurt
They just make my feet hurt

To have enough food on my table and a little bit more for those who call

I take a few seconds to kiss her
Then look around at what's happened to my home town
What's going on
But papa doesn't look too strong
Rush home in a cab, windows up
Now I hear dad cough: 
""We gotta get in before they switch the lights and water off
For the night""
I have to get to know the guard dogs
Cause they bite
Progress just passed us by, to the right

Briefly, this is my testimony
I see genius in everybody
To perceive it in yourself is the difficulty
Where you come from really makes no difference to me
Whether country or just another lonely city
Like a lotus you process the ability
To produce flower and fruit simultaneously

[Chorus: x3]
So drop your pebble in the mainstream
Start a ripple
It will buzz you like a tweak on your nipple
Tickle your sensibility speak just a little
The words have enough weight to turn rock to metal

Like a tweak on your nipple

I see genius in everybody
To perceive it in yourself is the difficulty
But your individuality overflows with quality
It manifests solidly
If you believe
A rich creativity, fever pitch energy
And crazy synchronicity
If you believe

It's not the way I choose to live
And something somewhere's got to give
As sharing this relationship gets older, older

You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there?
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
I don't care if that's not fair

Because I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here with nothing at all

There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you with memories
I feel it in my heart but I don't show it, show it
And then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you can see
Those times I don't believe it's right, I know it, know it

Don't make me promises
Baby, you never did know how to keep them well
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you

No where inside for me in your life

And no, you're never gonna get me home

Come on, just change your tone
Or you'll always be alone

Hey, what's going on?
You always get these big ideas
Then nothing's wrong

Open up your small town matress
And find a hut that's built with thatches
It's easier defined as legend
To find a what that's less imagined

By your face, is light to a lens
You could hang me by a thread
And you should wake up all your friends

'Cause they're all lazybones
And no, you're never gonna get me home
We're always alone
And we'll always be here

Complete Lyrics
on the phone I can't say anything in case I say the
wrong thing,
and you smile like you like this but maybe it's not
working,
I'm a stone under a mountain and I wish that you'd stop
thinking,
and you lie under the mountain cause you know you can't
do anything.

And you check your phone 'cause you're looking for an
escape,
sometimes when we fall we just land in the right place,
'cause we're magnetic and we land in the right place,
are you magnetic do you land in the right place?

It tasted bad I wore a mouth guard the blood was
overwhelming,
head over heel a mild concussion do you remember was I
talking,
you've been had and in attack you said maybe we're
exhausting,
it's not real but in attack I know just what you're
saying.

And you check your phone 'cause you're looking for an
escape,

sometimes when we fall we just land in the right place,
'cause we're magnetic and we land in the right place,
are you magnetic? do you land in the right place?

It's not real It's not real It's not real,
oh no it's not real it's not real it's not real,
go.

Do you collapse?
We collapse,
Do we collapse?
Can we do it again?

In this verse I found a credit card with six hundred
dollars on it,
in the next I hired a car and drove away,
if your world just tipped and spun around,
and flipped and flung us from it,
I think we'd land in exactly the same way.

You check your phone cause you're looking for an
escape,
sometimes when we fall we just land in the right place,
'cause we're magnetic and we land in the right place,
are you magnetic do you land in the right place?

it's not real it's not real it's not real,

Mais ce que je sais c'est que sa les agite un max

C'est lui le boss
Vous chopez le roi de l'autre, vous avez gagné

C'est lui qui choisit, c'est lui le roi
Comme ça, comme ça, comme ça, comme ça, d'accord?
Par contre il a aucune force

C'est pas ça le jeu, nan le roi reste le roi, clair?
Chacun reste ce qu'il est. Sauf les pions
Parce que si un pion arrive à faire toute la route jusque l'autre côté
Il devient une reine
Et j'ai déjà dit que la reine c'est pas une merde, elle a le droit d'aller où elle veut

Donc si j'atteint l'autre côté, j'ai gagné?

Par-contre les gens qui sont de l’autre côté, ils sont partagés
Mais ils savent que je ne suis pas loin, alors ils ont beaucoup plus peur de moi

Il vaut mieux être craint ou être aimé?

Bonne question, les deux c’est bien mieux, mais c’est très difficile
Moi si j’avais le choix, je préférerais que l’on me craigne
La peur c’est plus solide que l’amour
Une amitié peu toujours se vendre ou s’acheter
Tu le vois bien si je fais une blague tout le monde se marre sans hésiter
J’suis amusant, mais pas à ce point

Ils rigolent parce qu’ils ont peur de moi
Mais il ne faut pas te faire détester
C’est pour ça que je les traite bien, mais pas trop bien

Welches wohlversteckt leckt und leckt, man fand es nie, es war am Heck

Sind die Flucht nach vorne, dieser Kurs ist viel zu hart am Wind

Und Steuermann, was das Schiff nicht kann,
Hält uns nicht mehr zurück

Man es nie vergißt, was es wirklich ist, solang kein Laster weit und
Breit
Erst Lasterhaftigkeit schafft der Tugend Möglichkeit
Sich zu orientieren, organisieren und wenn allein zu zweit

Da packe ich mein Set, die Schönste aus dem Bett

Sie hat sowohl Geschmack als auch genießt sie schlechten Ruf

Ach wie nett, in seinem Bett.""

The food that we had brought from blessed Swedish land
Was suddenly forbidden and taken from our hand.

A horrid kind of darkness was clouding our view.
We couldn't see each other and hardly breathe or walk
