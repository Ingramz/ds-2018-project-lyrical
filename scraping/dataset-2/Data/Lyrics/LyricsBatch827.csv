Paul Stanley,"You really like my limousine
You like the way the wheels roll
You like my seven inch leather heels
And goin' to all of the shows, but

Do you love me, do you love me
Do you love me, really love me

You like the credit cards and private planes
Money can really take you far
You like the hotels and fancy clothes
And the sound of electric guitars, but

Do you love me, do you love me
Do you love me, I mean like do you
Really love me

You really like rock 'n' roll
All of the fame and the masquerade
You like the concerts and studios
And all the money, honey, that I make, but

Do you love me, do you love me
Do you love me, really love me

Your backstage pass and black sunglasses
Make you look just like a queen
Even the fans, they know your face
From all of the magazines, but

Do you love me (do you love me)
Do you love me (do you love me)
Do you love me (do you love me)
Really love me (really love me)
I want to know

Do you love me (do you love me)
Do you love me (do you love me)
Do you love me (do you love me)

I mean like do you
Really love me (really love me)

I want you to (do you love me, do you love me)
I need you to (do you love me, do you love me)
And you know I'm so tired of everybody sayin' it
And you know, (do you love me, do you love me)

I just gotta know if you really really really, really love me
(do you love me, do you love me)
So come on, do you love me (do you love me)
I need you to
Do you love me (do you love me) I want you to
Do you love me (do you love me) I need you
Really love me (do you love me)

Paul Stanley,"Baby, you know I heard the neighbors say
Baby, you might be leavin' me today
Oh yeah, mmm, someone's come along and shared your time
Don't care, no I don't, no
But you can't be his and still be mine, so

Ooh, got to choose who's your baby
Ooh, got to choose

Sometimes, oh sometimes, I know you need a change of pace
Oh yeah, but I ain't gonna run no race
Baby, you've got to tell me yes or no
Alright, alright, come on and tell me
Tell me if you're gonna go, come on

Ooh, got to choose who's your baby
Ooh, got to choose who's your baby

Ooh, got to choose who's your baby
Ooh, got to choose, got to choose

Paul Stanley,"In the morning I raise my head
And I'm thinkin' of days gone by
And the thing I want out of life is...

I want you
You can run you can hide but you'll never get away
You can lie and deny, but you know you're gonna pay
Never loved, never thought you could,
Treat you right girl you know I would
You can fight but tonight there's nothing you can do

I want you
You can walk in the heat, you can travel 'til you die
You can live in a dream and your life will pass you by
Every day that you hesitate never changes the hand of fate
You can fight but tonight there's nothing you can do

I want you
In the morning I raise my head
And I'm thinkin' of days gone by
And the thing I want out of life is...

I want you",I Want You,2008
Paul Stanley,"I really love you baby, I love what you've got 
Let's get together, we can get hot 
No more tomorrow, baby time is today 
Girl, I can make you feel okay 

No place for hidin' baby, no place to run 
You pull the trigger of my
Love gun, (love gun), love gun 
Love gun, (love gun), love gun 

You can't forget me baby, don't try to lie 
You'll never leave me, mama, so don't try

Paul Stanley,"I know a thing or two about her
I know she'll only make you cry
She'll let you walk the street beside her
But when she wants she'll pass you by

Everybody says she's lookin' good
And the lady knows it's understood
Strutter

She wears her satins like a lady
She gets her way just like a child
You take her home and she says ""Maybe, baby""
She takes you down and drives you wild

Everybody says she's lookin' good
And the lady knows it's understood
Strutter

I know a thing or two about her

Paul Stanley,"Leave and let me go
You're not meant for me, I know
Carry on, carry on
And I'll stay strong

Leave and let me go
I will think of you, I know
But carry on, carry on
And I'll stay strong

Someone else will keep you warm from now on
Someone else will keep you safe from the storm
But I'll be with you wherever you go
So you will never be alone
I'm going where the wind blows
Going where the lost ones go

[Chorus]
I will be with you
I'm losing the love I found
Crying without a sound
Where have you gone?
I will be with you
You were my fool for love
Sent me from high above
You were the one
I will be with you
I'm going where the wind blows
Going where the lost ones go

Leave and let me go
Don't look back, just let me know
Carry on, carry on
You must stay strong

Nothing ever looks the same in the light
Nothing ever seems to quite turn out right
When you realize that you have been loved
Than you will never be alone
I'm going where the wind blows
Going where the lost ones go

[Chorus]

Leave and let me go
Baby I can't come along
Carry on, carry on
You must stay strong",I Will Be with You (Where the Lost Ones Go),2008
Paul Stinga,"You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we walk in the fields of gold

So she took her love
For to gaze awhile
Upon the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of gold

Will you stay with me, will you be my love
Among the fields of barley
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we lie in the fields of gold

See the west wind move like a lover so
Upon the fields of barley
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
Among the fields of gold
I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in the fields of gold
We'll walk in the fields of gold

Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
Among the fields of gold
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in the fields of gold
When we walked in the fields of gold
When we walked in the fields of gold",Fields of Gold,1994
Paul Stookey,"He is now to be among you at the calling of your hearts
Rest assured this troubadour is acting on His part
The union of your spirits here has caused Him to remain
For whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name
There is love, there is love

Well a man shall leave his mother, and a woman leave her home
They shall travel on to where the two shall be as one
As it was in the beginning is now until the end
A woman draws her life from man and gives it back again
And there is love, there is love

Well then what's to be the reason for becoming man and wife
Is it love that brings you here or love that gives you life
For if loving is the answer then who's the giving for
Do you believe in something that you've never seen before
Oh there's love, oh there's love

Oh, the marriage of your spirits here has caused Him to remain
For whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name
There is love, oh there's love",Wedding Song (There Is Love),2012
Paul Strive,"Smile an everlasting smile a smile could bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you're gone cause that would bring a tear to me
This world has lost its glory let's start a brand new story now my love
Right now there'll be no other time and I can show you all my love

Talk an everlasting words and dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my love I'm here if you should call to me
You think that I don't even mean a single word I say
It's only words and words are all I have to take your heart away

You think that I don't even mean a single word I say

Paul Sullivan,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you 
When you need someone to cheer you, all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue see is
That's how deep it goes, if its real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you, all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in between years, come what may

Who know where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you, all the way
All the way",All the Way,1997
Paul Sullivan,"Unforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more
Unforgettable in every way
And forever more, that's how you'll stay
That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Unforgettable,1997
Paul Sullivan,"In the still of the night
I held you, held you tight
Cause I love, love you so
Promise I'll never let you go
In the still of the night

I remember that night in May
The stars were bright above
I'll hope and I'll pray
To keep your precious love
Well before the light
Hold me again with all of your might
In the still of the night

So before the light

Paul Sullivan,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You,2009
Paul Sullivan,"I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces all day through
In that small cafe, the park across the way
The children's carousel, 
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

I'll find you in the morning' sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you",I'll Be Seeing You,2009
Paul Sullivan,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,2009
Paul Sullivan,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?",Skylark,2009
Paul Sullivan,"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,2009
Paul Sullivan,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory,2009
Paul Sullivan,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2009
Paul Summer,"I get no kick from champagne,
Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Some get a kick in a plane,
Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,
Is my idea of nothing to do,
But I get a kick out of you.
I get a kick, out of you.",I Get a Kick Out of You,2008
Paul Summer,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you 
How great you are. 

You're the top! 
You're the Coliseum. 
You're the top! 
You're the Louver Museum. 
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 
You're a Bendel bonnet, 
A Shakespeare's sonnet, 
You're Mickey Mouse. 
You're the Nile, 
You're the Tower of Pisa, 
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa 
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop, 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom you're the top! 

Your words poetic are not pathetic. 
On the other hand, babe, you shine, 
And I can feel after every line 
A thrill divine 
Down my spine. 
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans 
Might think that your song is bad, 
But I got a notion 
I'll second the motion 
And this is what I'm going to add; 

You're the top! 
You're Mahatma Gandhi. 
You're the top! 
You're Napoleon Brandy. 
You're the purple light 
Of a summer night in Spain, 
You're the National Gallery 
You're Garbo's salary, 
You're cellophane. 
You're sublime, 
You're turkey dinner, 
You're the time, the time of a Derby winner 
I'm a toy balloon that's fated soon to pop 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're an arrow collar 
You're the top! 
You're a Coolidge dollar, 
You're the nimble tread 
Of the feet of Fred Astaire, 
You're an O'Neill drama, 

You're Whistler's mama! 

You're camembert. 

You're a rose, 
You're Inferno's Dante, 

You're the nose 
On the great Durante. 
I'm just in a way, 
As the French would say, ""de trop"". 
But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a dance in Bali. 
You're the top! 
You're a hot tamale. 
You're an angel, you, 
Simply too, too, too diveen, 
You're a Boticcelli, 
You're Keats, 
You're Shelly! 

You're Ovaltine! 
You're a boom, 
You're the dam at Boulder, 
You're the moon, 
Over Mae West's shoulder, 
I'm the nominee of the G.O.P. 

Or GOP! 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top! 

You're the top! 
You're a Waldorf salad. 
You're the top! 
You're a Berlin ballad. 
You're the boats that glide 
On the sleepy Zuider Zee, 
You're an old Dutch master, 

You're Lady Astor, 
You're broccoli! 
You're romance, 
You're the steppes of Russia, 
You're the pants, on a Roxy usher, 
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop, 

But if, baby, I'm the bottom, 
You're the top!",You're the Top,2008

Paul T.,"There, out in the darkness
A fugitive running
Fallen from God
Fallen from grace
God be my witness
I never shall yield
Till we come face to face
Till we come face to face

He knows his way in the dark
But mine is the way of the Lord
And those who follow the path of the righteous
Shall have their reward
And if they fall as Lucifer fell
The flame, the sword

Stars in your multitudes
Scarce to be counted
Filling the darkness
With order and light
You are the sentinels
Silent and sure
Keeping watch in the night
Keeping watch in the night

You know your place in the sky
You hold your course and your aim
And each in your season, returns and returns
And is always the same
And if you fall as Lucifer fell
You fall in flame

And so it must be for so it is written
On the doorway to paradise
That those who falter and those who fall

She could win this game and be the queen for good
Save herself up for the cream of the crop
Then she'll look us up when she's ready to stop

Because the rage it burns like Chinese torture
She's just someone's favourite daughter
Spoiled and ugly as she willingly slaughters
Friends and enemies are all that came
To burn her name
Crush her flame

To find a man who loves me as I am
Never tried to change a single part of me

And every day you teach me more and more
Inside me I'm all aglow
And every night you think of only me
OOh you keep me satisfied
You do all the things I like
I want your
Oh I want your soul
Do you want it right now
Or can I let go?
I want you so bad
Give me all you have

Paul van Dyk,"If I have little space
If I deconstruct it all
If I drink until I feel numb

If I take a little time
If I lose a little sleep
I'll forget I thought you were the one

It's complicated

Still chased by ghosts of
Little mistakes

It's complicated
It's complicated
It's complicated
It's complicated

All the promises
That you made to me
Unintentional lies
God I still believe

It's complicated
It's complicated

If I try to turn it off
If I swallow all my pride
If I love till nothing's left at all

If I say but never do
If I weep a little while
If I could only make this stop

Tell me that you love me, oh
Just tell me that you love me
Just tell me that you love me
Just tell me that you love me
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh

Complicated
Complicated

If I bleed until I die
Make love to loneliness
Accept that this is all I've got

If I convince myself
Forget what's in the past
You wouldn't still be what I want

Tell me that you love me, oh
Just tell me that you love me
Just tell me that you love me
Just tell me that you love me
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh

Tumble into lost horizons

I could be crunchy, that's how

Dancin' on tip toes, fo sho

Would you go my way?
I believe you do

Would you save my life?

Tumblin' backwards, my love
Heavenly creatures, too much
Everything changes, the say
Fresh as a daisy, someday

Takin' a road trip, good fit, ain't it
Send me a postcard, backyard, how far?
Genuine laughter, faster, blaster
Suddenly hit me, fit me, tipped me

Head still spinning from the rush
Of all the things I did the night before

And looking down from my hotel
These dawn-lit streets begin to fill
With memories of you and I
On a New York City night
On a New York City night

I shake my head to clear the sounds
The traffic horns, the growing crowd
The sun awaking over central park




But still it creeps beneath my skin
All of these heartbeats in the din
With concrete dreams stirring to life
On a New York City night
On a New York City night


And I take it with me when I leave
The crowded skyline, the energy
The sleepless city always leaves its mark

Just close my eyes and I'm back again
The neon flush upon our skin
Still wrapped in thoughts of love and wine

Into your stormy skies
Your beauty mystifies
And speaks in semaphore

I hang on every word
Your eyes like restless birds
Could feed on what I heard
For evermore

Your stormy skies
Your stormy skies

She's trippin' on high heels
And sensations of love she feels
That's you, you're the sign
You're the scheme in every line

Paul van Dyk,"Missing the train, moving the days around
These moments in time
Always the change of hands that takes you out

When everything is sinking to the top
And something's got you looking till you see you're blind
You know that I would try my best to say

If I could talk in grey
I wouldn't see your face at all
If I could talk in grey

If I could talk in grey
I wouldn't see your face at all
If I could talk in grey

Live in the night, mumble the days aloud
A questions of rights
Things that we left around until they crawl inside

And make you wanna fall across the lines
When everything is sounding like a battle cry
No promises are good enough to take

If I could talk in grey
I wouldn't see your face at all

I'm being pulled into the fire of intoxic flame
I'm too close
And there's a good chance that I won't get away

And I needed going into the daylight
And I'm looking for it into the night
Then I think about it and I can't live without it
You're telling me that, that's alright

Can't get enough, can't get enough
When you're telling me the white lies, champagne

I tell myself that I'm not really hooked on you
But I know
If I stay then your use will become abuse

And the medicine you just won't take

Ain't that the way it goes

All curled and tangled up

I'm falling apart...
Falling in time...

I can't get it out of me 
It's breathing in side of me
It's reaching in side of you 
You feeling infected 
You been infected 
It's just like a cold 
A kiss on your lips
Now you taking control 
I feel like a criminal 
I'm falling apart 
I'm leaving for Venice 
In a getaway car 
No one can save us 
It's no need to try 
I'm looking for savers 
Holding us back 

If you wanna try and save me 
And take my heart and take me 

If you feel you can let go let it go...

I feel like a criminal 
I'm falling apart 
I'm leaving for Venice 
In a getaway car 
You say that you hold me 
But you don't really no 
You ...

If you wanna try and save me 
And take my heart and take me 
If you feel you can let go let it go...

Let go, let go, let go, let go...

If you wanna try and save me 
And take my heart and take me 
If you feel you can let go let it go...

Paul Vandyke,"You're the first face that I see
And the last thing I think about
You're the reason that I'm alive
You're what I can't live without
You're what I can't live without

You never give up
When I'm falling apart
Your arms are always open wide
And you're quick to forgive
When I make a mistake
You love me in the blink of an eye

I don't deserve your love
But you give it to me anyway
Can't get enough
You're everything I need
And when I walk away
Take off running and come right after me
It's what you do
And I don't deserve you

You're the light inside my eyes
Give me a reason to keep trying
Give me more than I could dream
And you bring me to my knees
You bring me to my knees

Your heart is gold and how am I the one
That you've chosen to love
I still can't believe that you're right next to me
After all that I've done

I don't deserve your love

Paul Vogt,"At the watering holes of the well-to-do
I detect a resistance to
Precisely
Our heroine's style
We're glad you noticed

The shooting sticks of the upper-class
Give her an inch
Aren't supporting a single ass
That would rise for the girl
She'll take a mile

Such a shame she wandered into our enclosure
How unfortunate this person has forced us to be blunt
No we wouldn't mind seeing her at Harrod's
But behind the jewelry counter, not in front

Could there be in our fighting corps
A lack of enthusiasm for
Peron's latest flame
You said it brother

Should you wish to cause great distress
In the tidiest officer's mess
Just mention her name

That isn't funny

Peron is a fool, breaking every taboo
Installing a girl in the army H.Q.
And she's an actress, the last straw
Her only good parts are between her thighs
She should stare at the ceiling, not reach for the skies
Or she could be his last whore

The evidence suggests
She has other interests
If it's her who's using him
He's exceptionally dim
Bitch! Dangerous Jade

We have allowed ourselves to slip
We have completely lost our grip
We have declined to an all-time low
Tarts have become the set to know

I am only a radio star with just one weekly show
But speaking as one of the people I want you to know
We are tired of the decline of Argentina
With no sign of a government able to give us the things we deserve

It's no crime for officers to do as they please
As long as they're discreet and keep clear of disease
We ignore, we disregard
But once they allow a bit on the side
To move to the center where she's not qualified
We are forced to mark his card

She should get into her head
She should not get out of bed
She should know that she's not paid
To be loud but to be laid
Slut! Dangerous Jade

This has really been your year, Miss Duarte
Tell us where you go from here, Miss Duarte
Which are the roles that you yearn to play?
Whom did you sleep, dine with yesterday?

Acting is limiting, the line's not mine
That's no help to the Argentine


Can we assume then that you'll quit?
Is this because of your involvement with Colonel Peron?

Goodnight and thank you

She won't be kept happy by her nights on the tiles
She says it's his body, but she's after his files
So get back on to the street

She should get into her head
She should not get out of bed
She should know that she's not paid
To be loud but to be laid
The evidence suggests
She has other interests

Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,

A perfect crime, that soon lived on. A different life it had to develop...
Gripped by every limb it could hold, the lifeless ideas it grew onto its own.
A much needed surrender.

March 11, 1981
My momma gave birth to a hell raising heavenly son
And my daddy was a fool addicted to brown
So he wasn't ever around, but my momma held me down

When me and big sister had nothing to eat
My momma gave up her last trying to make ends meet
She was a school teacher, working to provide for her fam'
Struggling in AA, to submit to gods plan

Them long twelve's steps of hardway are all on your own
No family, few friends, my momma was all alone
She did it for her children, struggling to make a living
And some how we still had food on thanksgiving

When I can barely talk momma taught me to pray
And right then I knew that we'd have a better life some day
She still give up her last just to see me smile
That's the definition of love for you child, I love my momma

[Chorus]

My momma was my role model, I had no father figure
Just a bunch of pipe dreams of being richer
But as times got tougher my life just got rougher
It hurts so bad to see me watch my momma suffer

Its so hard to cope when you so dead broke
So momma used to make me memorize the song quotes
In the middle of a session momma gave god praise
I knew what it meant to struggle at such an early age

Remember them days she barely earned minimum wage
But made sure I had new cloths to start the seventh grade
She met my step father, and walked down the aisle
I praised he sent somebody that would make my momma smile

He raised me as his own, he taught me to be a man
Adopted me and Anne, and gave momma a hand
I just love to see that beautiful smile on momma face
My momma could never be replaced, I love my momma

[Chorus]

20 years of struggling, done came to a close
No more old, torn up, and hand me down cloths
She deserve the best, and never nothing less
No stress, give my momma that Gucci dress

The times were hard but we done made it out the rain
The storm was severe but we overcame the hurricane
Them rainy days seem to last so long
When them times got hard my momma told me be strong

My number 1 supporter ever since day one
And still till this day momma would die for her son
No more slumz, all them rainy days are done
No a days we taking trips to Disney world just for fun

I put you in a Benz take you out that nova
Its been a long rough road, but that bumpy rides over
You raise me from a baby, my number 1 lady
And until the day I'm in my grave, ima stay mommas baby

[Chorus]",Daddy Wasnt Home,
Paul Wall,"Yeah, this what I do when I roll with a thug
Or a gangsta...

Put my hand on the gas, drop my ass low
Slide on fast, then we go slow
Blaze up the endo, raise up the window
That's the way thugs, and gangstas roll

Baby take my advice, I'll lead you right
You need a thug in your life, that can hit it all night
I'll make sure we live laid, and keep the bills paid
You ain't gotta work, just be my personal maid
I don't want much but a bad bitch, that cook and clean
While I'm out in these streets, trying to look for green

Boss Hoggs hit the scene, we finally made it
Now some women strip, and some uneducated
But thanks to having cake, we done got our breaks
Affiliated with the streets, lifestyle ain't fake
Don't hate congratulate, while we demonstrate pimping
I ain't racist but I love to fuck, our black women
E.S.G. and I'm winning, yeah the Boss man's back
Turning heads while I spread, through your shit like anthrax
Sit that ass fat, call E and Slim them
Peanut butter Gucci brims, on them keep-spinning rims

I'm rolling, with a thug and a gangsta
That's the kind of niggas, that I like
Talking bout a hustla, that keep his mind on thangs
He don't care what them hatas say, keeping it gangsta everyday

Come get a ski-taste, we on a paper chase
For a Jada Pinkett face, with a J-Lo shape
Trying to bought a FED case, so I'm shaking and moving
Got partnas that don't rap, what you think that they doing
Now money we pursuing, SES be shining
Slim go ahead, and I done swallowed a dime

Come ride with a thug now, you could let your guards down
Be yourself, you ain't gotta act when I'm around
See I ain't the jealous type, that like to bust and fight
Live your life, sweetheart you not my wife
I'm far from a gentleman, you feel what I'm saying
I'm a hard working hard man, nigga with plans
Understand I get around, and can't be held down
Fuck what I did last night, let's have fun now
I want a brown dime piece, that can roll a sweet
That's a lady in the streets, but a freak in the sheets

Put my hand on the gas, drop my ass low
Slide on fast, then we go slow
Blaze up the endo, raise up the window
That's the way thugs, and gangstas roll

Who say hood rats ain't fine, they done lost they mind
On a scale of one to ten, I done seen plenty nines

I like em high class with ass, Gucci down to the ground
When she pass, she make the whole crowd turn around

Real deal Cedric Hill, trying to make a mill
Give a woman ecstasy, without taking a pill

I want a gal caramel, that smell like Shanel
The kind of female, you put in your V-12

Yellow bones race up, but I reverse on dark
They like Free from BET's, 106 & Park

White, light skinned or dark, don't hate on the race
If she cute with a body, then she in the right place, come on",Rollin',

Fin to put it all in why'all face

I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress
Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness

Biggest diamonds off in my mouth princess cuts all in my chain
Wood grain all in my range dripping stains when I switch lanes
Switched the name It's still the same Swisha House or Swisha Blast

When my trunk unlock pop and show 
Ya already know 
Paint drippin off the door 
Not Engaged with no lady, fall in love with em no! 
You may think I'm crazy never knew this type of love before 
I'm love with my foreign, yes I'm married to my dough.... 
I'm in love with my money... mmmm

You can catch me squeezing grain 
Sittin crooked on D's and swangz 
Color changin lizard he's insane 
Ya womans missing then he's to blame 
Charge it to the game keep the change 
Most marriages blyossom and die... 
When its over I'm tellin her bye 
But she acts like I'm tellin a lie 
While you fallin in love with a she... 
I rather be dubblin a G 
Could you see me in a car that rhymes with rent me and starts with a be 
Could you see a Bentley 
Parked in the crunkest spot in ya hood 
Candy coat on top of the hood 
And my fist on top of the wood 
Sparkling good 
Say you ain't after my change I don't believe ya 
If a skeezer ask me to feed her 
With my visa then I'm gon leave her 
Koopa don't want ya koopa don't need ya 
{ But I Love You } that's sweet 
I rather be ridin on glass feet 
With leather up under my ass cheeks

Seen him last week in a Jag Jeep 
{ But they don't even make them yet 'causezin }

Hold on hold up a second man 
I never mack to a metro dame 
You better respect the game 
See my gecko chain and correct ya brain 
I love my car like it was my girlfriend I like to carress the grain 
Followed the wheel and I got aroused 
Swung in the ditch and I wrecked the frame 
Broke up with my foreign car and fell in love with my cadillac 
The Ringling Brothers enquired to how my trunk turns flips like an acrobat 
I act a rat, 'cause I'm from the gutter 
Ya girl stutter when I pull up next to ya 
You been with the girl 6 months Paul Wall 
Is the reason she won't give sex to ya 
Why all that plex in ya 
'cause a german company made my rims 
My big body's pregant with twins I'm bout to induce a baby benz 
Ya car was fly in the hood but my candy paint just wet ya flames 
I'm sittin on 22 inch baby sitters babelous threatin ya name 
Forgot to change the diaper so when I crept in the lane I left a stain 
Everytime it rains, paint drips It makes a mess and I get the blame 
My TV's are the pet I train I can make em roll over and play dead 
My car was blue on the freeway 
But when I stopped at the light it changed to red 
You betta re arrange ya head thinkin I trick my cash to a broad... 
Go ahead and ask ya broad I got more green than the grass in a yard 
And that's so raw It ain't hard for me to get the class to applaud 
I shine like a blasting star, glass on a car more blacker than tar

",N Luv Wit My Money,2001
Paul Wall,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock
I'm runnin' to the finish yea, when I get there I ain't gonna stop
Success is what I couldn't have, but now I tell em look what I got
It's the sound of revenge",Outro,2002

Boys steady dripping when they gone off the wet, 'cause
Ya better swallow ya project
They have you scared to throw up ya hood on ya own set, 'cause
I'm talking bout those boys running from cops
They don't run they mouth, they too busy running they block
Ya better be fast thinking you can run from a glock
Snap, crackle, pop soon as you run up you get dropped
I know boys with out guns that'll still come jack you
Have you running from your car before they even attack you
If you scared you better not show it at all
Put a mug upon ya face like you ready to brawl
I know boys that's unemployed still working that work, patna (partner)

Paul Wall,"[Chorus] 
Oh no, there go them Texas boys banging in a fo' do' 
Top fell out the drop, crawling on 84's 
Think of taking my slab, baby I don't think so 
My heat under my seat, and I don't love you hoes 
Living it like a G, but still I gotta lay low 
Five percent or ten, but still my screens goin' glow 
These haters be in my mix, and these boppers be on my dick 
Every time I come round the corner 

I'm from the land of opportunity, in God we trust 
But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust 
I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park 
It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks 
Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note 
But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat 
See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus 
It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust 
Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping 
I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping 
Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick 
But take a trip to South Lee, and end up in a ditch 
They got my purple people eater once, the next day 
I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts 
I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch 
Paul Wall and Trae, hit em with that one-two punch 

[Chorus] 

When I flip in my slab 
I'm fin to beat they back off, like I was legs 
Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished 
I'm bout to diminish these haters, when my trunk start waving 
Blue over gray, side of my drop with six T.V.'s I'm displaying 
They hate that I'm shining, with the fifth wheel falling flying down the block 
But if one of these haters, wanna jack me 
Slugs goin' be flying, out the glock 
I click for no reason, this season my slab is staining they brain 
And I be known for getting reckless in Texas, gripping on grain 
Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South 
Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth 
They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em 
Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking 
But not today, cause Trae goin' be flipping on top of his game 
We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me man 
When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the slab is bound to get tossed 
And if you trying to be competition, then you bound to be getting lost 

[Chorus] 
 
Make way for the team, when the fo' do' be coming round the corner 
These haters are goners, cause I'ma drop the top when I wanna 
I know these jackers, better think before they reach out and touch 
Cause in back of the car is the Excursion, full of thugs that'll punch 
I know they wanted to get me, but they don't know what I'm bringing 
I pop the trunk and swing the block, while jamming Slow Loud And Bangin' 
Trae and Paul Wall on a mission, and ain't no stopping it man 
With my hand on my heat in my seat, and the other on grain 

Mo' money mo' problems man, the legend is true 
You better stay up on your toes, when you ride 22's 
I'm rolling strapped, everywhere I go I'm watching my back 
Cause on my block, them jackers don't give a damn if I rap 
People see me being friendly, and they think that I'm soft 
But the truth is, my best friend is a sawed off 
These haters in my mix, got me losing composure 
But if they take one step closer, it ain't gon be kosher naw

You see I am what I am, and it is what it is 
You'd feel how I feel, if you been where I been 
Live what I live, see what I see 
So get out my ear, and just let me be 

I'm a survivor of the struggle, I lived life hard 
Single mama with half a job, I was raised by God 
No dad, the only role model I had 
Was a ounce of that white powder, in a Ziplock bag 
I don't brag about the struggles, I endured as a child 
You don't know the pain I went through, to create this smile 
I got one life to live, know I'm tal'n bout 
So I enjoy it, cause I earned everything that I got 
They hate what I got, I hear em with they cape talk 
They thinking that my life, was a cake walk 
I'm a man of principles, I live by my word 
So it's obscured, when I hear sour words 
They gon get what they deserve, but I don't wish no harm 
What goes around comes around, so partna you been warned 
In the midst of all the trouble, I still remain calm 
Cause sunny days, will follow the storm man, just let me be 

You see I am what I am, and it is what it is 
You'd feel how I feel, if you been where I been 
Live what I live, see what I see 
So get out my ear, and just let me be 

You see I am what I am, and it is what it is 
You'd feel how I feel, if you been where I been 
Live what I live, see what I see 
So get out my ear, and just let me be 

Somebody questioned, if I got the right to recite what I spit 
'Cause I've never been indicted, or divided a brick 
But my life is grit, all types of crisis and shit 
I decided to risk it all, to try to slide in the mix 
And get what I can get, see I'm fighting negative bars 
I knew it wouldn't be easy, but no one said it be hard 
As it is, I mean the evil in the heart of these men 
Got me wondering, if I'll ever see the reward 
At the end of the road, it's kind of hard to remember your goals 
When you grow where, not many live to get old 
I played the cards that I was given, and never listen to those

But me looking like a scrub, just wouldn't safice
I got rolls gold glowing, lap tops showing
Bremie Louis the Thirteenth, to keep it flowing
I can keep going and going, but what's the use
You know I'm balling in the mix, cause I got the juice
I run with wise guys, so it's no surprise
Everywhere I go, women undress me with they eyes
Boys can't knock it, I'm on the rise like a rocket

We need ATM machines, for the loot we stacking
Better think shoot a fee, I bet it won't break me
Plus I spend a few G's, up in VIP
It's the currency, that make these hoochies hunch
All they want is a hour fifty, take em out to lunch
But they must be drunk, I never trick off ends
Just flip a blue Benz, with the blue eyes lens

Hoes attitudes changed, since I'm having thangs
It's hard to explain, but that's the way it goes
Over night I went from showing rocks, to rocking shows
Hoes that wouldn't speak, now they watching me
But I'm trying to figure out, is it the watch or me
Or the foreign car, with the blue eyed lens
It's a bird it's a plane, that's my made back Benz

In my life, a lot of haters talking shit
And I might, expose you hoes you out this bitch
And I ride, with the nine I won't fall or slip
If I die, they still will not get off my dick
But I try, to survive like Destiny's Child
And I smile, cause they been trying to test me a while
But I cry, cause not all my partnas alive
But I smile, cause I know all my partnas with God
In my life, a lot of haters baller blocking my shine
I stay calm, even though I ought to drop em a nine
In my life, I make cash using hoes
And my Sprite, is purple so I'm moving slow
On my side, my dogs moving rocks and hay
And I slide, by how I'm chopping blades
When I drive, I got a big cup of syrup
When I glide, I ride with a couple birds
In my life, I feel like I stand alone
But you still wouldn't leave, out of San Anton'
When I die, don't cry get high for me
So you can feel, like you flying in the sky with me

I been through a few up's, and a whole lot of downs
I take the good with the bad, however the ball bounce
And lately, I've been walking on dangerous ground
It feels like my own partnas, don't want me around
Cause everybody in my crew, be trying to argue me down
They telling me I changed, and I'm not the same
But for the past three years, I've been saying the same thang
I've done a lot of dirt, but I don't brag about it
And since I don't rap about it, you don't know jack about it
People see me being friendly, and they think they know me
But just cause I shake your hand, don't mean you my homie
I got a personality complex, man I'm so complex
But if you come with plex, this ain't fun plex
I'm walking straight, but my mind's in a maze
The only thing that I'm afraid of, is being afraid
I done stared death in the face, I ain't budge one inch
He here beating up myself, and I still don't flinch
Somebody pinch me, I hope I'm dreaming
I'm searching inside my heart, trying to find the meaning of my life

Y'all don't know shit, about my life
It ain't all about the hoes, gold and ice
I go from down to up, up to down
In a blink of an eye, smiles turn to frowns
Kings get crowned, the rich get rich
Where everybody live, screaming life is a bitch
I ball in the mix, and keep to myself
I don't just want to be, another book on the shelf
A lot of y'all fakers, faking the game
I'm one of the real niggas, that's bringing the pain
I've seen hard times, so I spit hard rhymes
I've been around, different people of all kinds
And to this day, I got a few riddle friends
Too many of y'all, that's so fake and pretend
To be what you not, that's why you get got
Don't fuck with my life, that's all that I got

I got 'em moanin', my mackin' game is outta
Control, but I don't know if it's my looks or my big bank roll.
I'm 24 years old with my mouth all gold, my games cold and now the stories been told.
It's Paul Wall, baby (baby).

See I don't know why (why)
I'm feelin' just the way I do (do)
It's been a long time (time)
I thought that I was over you, but now you're coming around again
I'll be remembering what you said
I just can't take it, and I don't wanna go back, oh no.

[Chorus:]
What is a girl to do, if she's still on it, yes
If she done been there before with you, and now she don't want it, yeah
We've spent time and time again.
I just wish this thing would end.
Tell me, what is a girl to do, if she's still on it.

Whenever we talk (talk)
It feels like we had somethin' strong (strong)
And knowin' it's wrong, we tried to do this thing before, but when you coming real close to me
Bringing back all of them memories
I just can't fake it, but I don't wanna go back, oh no.

Auntie Ashanti's a problem, this track here's a problem.
The best thing rockin' since that cotton came to Harlem.
Meth darlin', I'm like that Hershey with the almonds, and I don't pay for nothin', but your pardon.
They start and I finish.
My animals is starvin' for dinners
Straight up menace, y'all don't get involved in my business. 
Look, I witness, spotted like a blemish, off gimmicks.
I'm 59/50 authentic.
Tilted with that NY on it.
There's money to be made, and I want it.
See, my palm been itchin' for the longest, so scratch that, paper like NASDAQ.
We laughed that life, roll the dice, get the cash back, I'm nice.
Plus, I got the juice, so I goes well with ice.
Been drug tested 3 times failed it twice.
Ashanti, you doin' it big, don't hurt 'em auntie.
Matter fact, you killin 'em girl, you're murder mami.

Paul Wall,"Yeah, a lightning bolt strikes in the air, yeah, finally it's here
'Cause y'all are the judge, the day of judgment finally is near
In your eye I see a tear, and it's remindin' me of fear
Rap's been dead so long, so stop denyin' what you feel

Dis payback for the fact that y'all ain't tryin' to keep it real
Grim reaper that we call revenge right beside ya in your ear
He's saying your time expired, time is finally due it's clear
Not sober mind is a weak mind and he's buyin' you a beer

Cheers, time for a toast
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
To the haters that hate you the most

And the friends that pretend to be your folks
(Your heart's beatin')
This is what revenge sounds like
(Your heart's beatin', your heart's beatin')
I hear your heart beatin', keep runnin' your mouth, yeah

Your mouth runnin' ahead of you, your mouth do what your legs should do
Let me walk to the edge with you, jump off of it, it
It sounds like your ready to, 'cause these rappers are terrible
And the game is unbearable but I'ma fix, fix

This feeling that's dead in you got your brains like a vegetable
Use the pro tools and tell 'em to edit it, it
Switch to somethin' that's better fool, turn it up what you better do
When I'm bringing revenge to you it sounds like this, this, this

Somebody call the doctor
(You're not breathin', you're not breathin')
They ain't gonna be well after this one right here
You're not breathin'

That's about to be runnin' the game
(You're not breathin')
Tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne

Shoulda heard what I was tellin' you, I don't do what the jealous do
I don't hate when a nigga make it, 'cause I'm smarter and better too
You run when they tell you to but I move when I'm ready to
If you stop to take a breather, see that I'm light years ahead of you

y'all musta thought y'all wasn't gonna have to see me or somethin'
(I'm not leavin', I'm not leavin')
Houston, Texas, I'm here now

Anybody gotta problem?
(I'm not leavin')
Speak now or forever hold your peace
(I'm not leavin')
I ain't think so, yeah

The feeling's great 'cause they pay me, I expect some hatred so daily
I'm sticking the middle finger up like the feeling's mutual baby
The franchise and they say that the future can't really trade me
In Houston, I'm number one like I'm in the place of McGrady

But keep on pacing it baby, the full truth has arrived
If they ask you about you nigga, you fin' to lie
They ask me about me and hear a truthful reply
They said they seem none better than me so hear the truth wit'cha eyes

Better go take over befo' it rains
'Cause I'd hate to say that I told you Mayne
I know, I know what you're gonna say
But have it your way

I know these haters is gonna hate
And I see that angry look on your face
Tell 'em sound of revenge is on the way
This isn't your day

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?
(Yeah what's that?)
That's The Sound of Revenge

See, I told you
That's what happens when you get on his bad side

[Chorus]
When I call you on the phone
You're never at home
You been gone for so long and I feel so alone
Your love of money gone ruin our relationship
But you say it isn't and that's a lie
[Chamillionaire]
Girl I ain't trippin' I Know that you're feelin' alone
But I feel you should know I'm still in luv wit my dough
And since they say time is money
I'm wastin' my money sittin here chillin' so good bye

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
She love a trick to treat
She be calling me up, Koopa let's eat
I'm Sorry, but I gotta radio interview to do
I gotta hook up with Milla Mack, and Greg Street
Maybe we can retreat, to get a bite to eat
Take a night to sneak, to a tight lil' suite
You can invite some freaks
But get it right I'm cheap
You could leave, with tonight's receipt
Makin' moves wit hatter
Ke'Noe and Dobey, BeBe and Jabber
When I'm not in the lab
You know I'm trying to grab a
Couple G's chick please, what are you getting mad for
In the morning
When I hook up with Killa Mike, Lil' Jon and them
All of my calls, I'm gonna forward them
To the answer machine, please call again I'm busy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
I'm Still in Luv wit my money
I'm still infatuated wit my cash
Ain't no need for relaxin' and chillin
I'm Stackin, and Killin' on a grind I mash
But I still make time for my lil' mama
But I ain't got no time for a little drama
I'm tryna pull out in drop top
Throw 22's on a lil' somethin' foreign for the summer
You can call me but I ain't gone answer
All this stress gone cause me cancer
Imma call up whodi in the club on and throw a couple dollars on a Dancer
So don't hastle me, just leave me alone, quit callin my phone
You say you an independent woman, then stand on ya own
Baby girl I'm gone, holla at me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: 50/50 Twin]
Get Mad, I chase cash
Do you contribute to fillin my stash
Smellin your piss bitch, go buy glass
Never deposit, but withdraw fast
Co-Dependant trash
Act with class but poor doin bad
Got a senada, can't afford a jag
I'm the best thing that you done had
Stumbled upon a gold mine thought you
Stuntin' with that dolce I bought you
An additional time gon cost you
Speakin gibberish are you
Who gave you permission to trip
You gon trip,take a trip
Car, plane take a ship
Music grind stand right here
Ten mill you might get recruited
The world don't twirl around beauty and booty
It twirl around cash and music
Cheer people up and help them through shit

Don't know about you, but I'm true-I'm true

Forget what these boys is talking bout, we wipe boys down
In South Park on MLK, on Sunday we clown
From the streets of Antoine, to the Homestead hoods
From Mo City to Studewood, it's all good
I'm riding on platinum grey, with Z-Ro and Trae
Gon let the top down, it's a beautiful day
Haters jealous on the sidelines, running they mouth
'Cause I roll with T.I.P., the king of the South
Boys know I'm Paid In Full, so they clocking my dollas
Me, Poppy, Joe and Fox all riding Impalas
I'm breaking bread with Mike Jones, and Slim Thug the Boss
It's Paul Wall, still representing Swishahouse
I'm with my boy Big Kaila, I don't bar no hater
I'm on the grind for paper, I'll holla at ya later

If she's a dime tell her I'm fine, and she'll say true-true
Turn up the bang if you into, something color changing the rims do
Sound like a train cause when I stop, they be like choo-choo-choo
And I'm thugging too homie, the heater kinda like Al Bundy's hand
Believe me every time you see me, it's gon be in her pants
If I do a crime and you snitch, homie the heater will snitch too
'Cause if the police come around, it'll be pointing at you
Somebody give mouth to mouth to this mic, after it melt
'Cause the only rapper out rapping me is me, after myself
I hope you internet thugs, that will swear that I ain't the tightest
Have cyber sex with Cita, until you catch a virus
Why is he saying this, to piss boys off
I officially claim myself, the rap King of the South
The say I'm the greatest of all time, and I say who and they say you
And I say naw, give that title to the late great DJ Screw, rest in peace

I love to speed on dubs and Spre's, bitches leave the club with me
Snitches mean mugging me, don't make me bust my fucking heat
We popping trunks and smoking blunts, that sticky-ickie (ooh-wee)
Last year I did a mill, now I'm bout to do (three)
I bring the heat on every track, it's five G's for every bar
Just because I'm in a Porsche box, don't mean I like the spa
That don't mean I like the car, you know I'm down to break your jaw
Just because I burn rubber, that don't mean I like the tar

What you been sippin? on? What you been hittin' on?
It be them chicks in bikinis we bought ?em Cris's on

Call me Diddy, let's ride that out, stop that talk outside your mouth
I'll put guys outside your house, we the hottest in the South
Bad Boy, Dipset, baby girl, get ya lips wet
Maybach like that chauffeur, money ain't too far from Oprah's

You should've seen what I paid my chauffeur
It's enough to buy you a roster
This toaster supposed to take you on a roller coaster
You ain't poppin' like Diddy, baby, I'm rockin' with Diddy, baby
The Drops is terrific, kid, them wrists? to 80

What you been sippin? on? Who you been smokin' with?
What got you actin' all silly doin' stupid shit?
'Cause you ain't drunk, nigga, you little fuck, nigga
You ain't bad, you's a fag, you ain't tough, nigga
What you been drinkin' on?

y'all know the deal
Long John shirt don't show the steal
Ski mask when we gone to kill
We blast and you know we will

We don't mash in this olds-mobiles
Ride to ya block slow as hell
Look for you fucks, unload the shells
A nigga get caught, then please post bail

Eastside to the homies in jail
Know how it be that lonely S.L.
Full of turf is Smokey?s cell
You cookin' it up, then goin' to hell

I'm with a bitch in the front seat holdin' the steal
God, I'm so for real
Move the candy ring to get the candy paint
For them pretty Range Rover wheels

What you been sippin' on? What's in that white cup?
It's that Memphis-in', codeine, not purple tub
?Cause you ain't leanin', bitch, you ain't codeine-in' bitch
That cup and money, you ain't high, you ain't sleepy, bitch
I see what you been drinkin? on

Cock the 4, hold the deuce
Mixed with sprite maybe juice
Prepare to lean off that codeine
Prescription call it syrup, gets me loose

White cup that's full of that oil
Texas T, we call it drank
Sittin' sideways on them 4's
Lavish drippin' wet candy paint

Who's the man, who's the G?
Houston, Texas 713
I'm on the block that we call South Lee
Sippin' oil with the thugs and G's

Paul Wall, what you know about me?
I'm on the grind and I'm slangin' leash
When I mix the Sprite wit this sizzurp
I'll show you how to make a Sprite remix

Dipset, Bad Boy, Jim Jones, Jha Jha, Paul Wall
They call me Diddy, Harlem, stand up
Dirty South, stand up, Midwest, stand up

I'm on the grind all day until the sun go down, 
Puttin' paper in my pockets grindin' all year round' 
I'm on the block with the gangstas stayin' two toes down I'm on the grind.
I'm on the grind all night until the sun come up, 
Countin' cash up in the cut tryin' to make me a buck, 
I'm making moves stacking paper cause I'm handelin' ya, I'm on my grind.

Check it out baby.
I got money on my mind, big frank on my brain, 
Intoxicated by visions of chains and diamond rings, 
One thing here to obtain is fortune forget the fame 
Been ballin' since back in the game been changin the strings, 
These lames tend to complain its a goddamn shame 
You think you flier than a plain but you washed up in the drain, 
Baby paint the picture frame its all work no play, 
My hustle schedule is simpley all night all day, 
I'm snapping like paparazzi I'm plotting on Maserati 
Been grinding since lotty dotty 
Trying to earn that pay collecting that green paper 
I'm scheming and pulling capers 
I'm giving these brouds the vapers 
From the fold to the tray.
I'm on the grind

[Chorus]

My hustle is Godzilla, my muscle is king kong,
My mind is Einstein, my flow is off the dome, 
My grind is dope feen addicted to counting green, 
My money is bill gates my ballin' is yow ming, 
I'm not impressed with bling I'm more conserned with ching, 
Grinding since I was a teen, money over everything, 
See I'm all about that paper stacks and bank rolls 
The lack on fo's with drank cold and dank roll.
Hustle is my hobby inspired by johnny gotti call me, 
Give me the wallet because its time to collect, 
V-S up in the johnny watch shining so clear 
The face look like a mirror call it time to reflect.
I'm on the grind

Paul Wall,"Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

My homie Marley used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls a lotta flirtin' involved, but dawg
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryna get in some drawers, so
Put me on with these hoes homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow homie

Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

What it do? I'm posted up in the parkin' lot, my trunk wavin'
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazin'
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neon's lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fo's crawlin', you see them screens fallin'
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leanin' on the switch, sittin' crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hardhitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' somethin' candy coated, crawlin' like a caterpillar
I'm tippin' on them four's, I'm jammin' on that Screw
I'm lookin' for them hoes baby what it do, drive slow homie

Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes (drive slow homie)
If you ridin' around the city with nowhere to go (drive slow homie)
Live today cause tomorrow man, you never know

You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow homie

My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TV's in here than where I live

And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's somethin' serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics baby it's evident
You see a player flickin', and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, ""Just a Lil' Bit"" (just a lil' bit)
I got my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin', through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil' homie drive slow

Drive slow homie, drive slow homie
You never know homie, might meet some hoes homie

Hold up a minute, I'm the King of the Ghetto
Holding the rap game, like wood grain can't let go
You niggas'll never see me, I'm on another level
Stay ready to dig a grave, keep a gun and a shovel
And pouring gas too, if there evidence
Saw me in the rear view, now you wonder where I went
I'm a get you if I owe ya, visit ya residence
Lay the merk game down, and then I'ma hit the fence
Better keep my mouth closed, so they can't see the shining
They think it was Z-Ro, cause all they seen was diamonds
I'm cold as a deep freeze, with bags of ice in it
My 3-57 pretty, but ain't nothing nice in it
Too many bitches, and not enough rubbers
Got so many, all my real niggaz under the gutter
Watch a nigga full of life, light close like shutters

Platinum teeth and princess cuts, my mouth is similar to a disco ball
I'm Paul Wall my smile is blinding, my ice is shining like a chandelier
I tend to brush my teeth with Windex, just so the glass house mouth shine clear
I got mo' karats invested with soup, I'm a Texas icon a People's Champ
Put on your shades when I commits to approach, my mouth is eliminating like a lamp
It got gold grills and platinum and ice, cause that's how it is in the Lone Star State
With a cup full of bar in a candy car, and we jamming on a Robert Davis Grey Tape

Cause you embarrassing Texas, nigga you ain't trill
Nigga you been on my dick, way befo' you got your deal
These rappers finally get some fame, and think they got it locked
After your album flop, nigga you gon be on Koch

Shining down South, brighter than all y'all
When it's time to get your jewelry done who do y'all call
Cause you fellas ain't shining at all, check me out

Even with a suspended license, still finna flip
Ain't no limit to this cash, ain't nothing I can't get
Five deuce Hoover cause, ain't nothing like a Crip

Or could it be my Cadillac wit 20-inch Vogues
Can it be my mansion in Memphis jacuzzi
Or could it be my crib in Florida on the beach

Or can it be the first one that ever go gold

I used to always wonder why my girls have fits
When I walk up out the mall they be lookin at me pissed
Maybe just becuz I ball ridin eight or nine whips
And my name is Juicy J and I ain't payin no bitch

I fell in love wit stackin' change I'm addicted to countin' cash
I ain't worried bout naan ho I ain't concerned wit naan ass

If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on the rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white gold, traditional gold
I'm changing girlls everyday, like Jay change clothes
I might be grilled out nicely (oh) In my white tee (oh)
Or on South Beach (oh) in my wife B
VVS studded, you can tell when they cut it
You see my grandmama hate it, but my lil' mama love it
Cause when I

Open up ya mouth, ya grill gleamin' (say what)
Eyes stay low from the cheifin' (cheifin')

I got a grill they call penny candy, you know what that means
It look like Now and Laters, gum drops, jelly beans

My teeth gleaming like I'm chewing on aluminum foil
Smiling showing off my diamonds sipping on some potent oil
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carats thirty stacks let 'em know I'm so for real
My motivation is from thirty pointers, VVS
The furniture my mouth piece simply symbolize success
I got the wrist wear and neck wear that's captivating
But its what smile that's got these onlookers spectating
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see more carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowing giving everybody chills
Call me George Foreman cause I'm selling everybody grills

Lights gon' hit and make you woozy in your head
You can catch me in my 2 short drop
Mouth got colors like a Fruit Loop box

It's what it do, in the Lou'
Ice grill, country grammar
Where the hustlers move bricks
And the gangsters bang hammers
Where I got 'em you can spot 'em
On the top, on the bottom
Gotta bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham

I ain't dissing nobody but lets bring it to the light
Gipp was the first with my mouth bright white
Yeah these hoes can't focus cause they eyesight blurry

One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
And the other set the same got my name in the mold

Yeah man, me and Paul just goin' 2 different direction man
Know what I'm sayin', he decided to go back to the Swishahouse
And I decided not to ya know what I'm sayin'?
I'm just tryin' to do my thing right now
And hopefully we'll turn this into a major label debut
when ""Controversy"" sells ya feel me?
But uh, uh we both are with Paid In Full
I'm not on Paid In Full Records no more, no longer on contract
I'm doin' my own thing, Chamillitary Entertainment
and ya already know in this man
A lil somethin' for the fans
I'ma let you hear the first song we did off of ""Get Ya Mind Correct""
Ya ain't know I had this did ya?
---A lil somethin' for the fans
I'ma let why'all hear the first song we actually did on ""Get Ya Mind Correct""
It's called ""Weatherman"", why'all ain't know I still had this did why'all-haha

[Chorus - Paul Wall]
I'm the weatherman ain't nobody stoppin' my reign
a lot of watered down rappers still hot 'cause I came
I'ma forest fire ain't nobody stoppin' my flame
Can't nobody stop me from stockin' my change
(repeat)

[Paul Wall]
I'm the weatherman ain't nobody stoppin' my reign
On top of my game, decapitate the top show and bang
They knockin' my fame and biz' 'cause of rocks in my watch
If you was smart you'd watch the golds that's on top of my crotch
The rocks in my watch, is more then a Rocky Sandlot
You jealous 'cause you bought diamonds from diamond shamrock
Look, all recruiters should be checkin' my stats
I cross competition over shake em' dead in they tracks
I pack an axe by my way, bodyguard by my biscuit
Make money, lose money never afraid to risk it
I don't get writers block, I block other writers
Spittin' fire like if I had a mouth full of lighters
I'm countin' so much money that I caught a hand-cramp
I date models you date girls that went to band camp
I'ma hurricane, you just a gust of wind
I'm on fire, you just ashes and dust my friend

[Chamillionaire]
Uh, it's just the lil bad weatherman, raindrops drop on ya pours
They sick of them boys, pullin' up in ridiculous cars
Ain't no ones, sicker then are's the wizard of oz
Couldn't give you a bigger brain and make you rich as them boys
Young Koopa the weatherman, he lelay his weatherband
With drank in a metal can, want to stop him get a better plan
That one you got, that ain't really workin' pat'na
Ya shirt is prada, how come ya flow ain't worth a dollar, holla
Chamillion's insane niggaz gonna complain
Can't explain why ya girl want to give me brain and run a train
Niggaz runnin' in shame, tellin' them to run in train
The Lizard stepped in the game and started runnin' thangs
If ya can't sleep anymore while the raindrops pour
And you look our your window and hear footsteps on the floor
If you saw a crooked smile and a glistenin' jaw
Don't open the door fa' sure time for bad weather why'all, let it reign

[Paul Wall]
Bad weather's ruin about, if you travel my route
It's time to flood the market, 'cause there's been a drought
Review the resume, my team is undefeatable
You fabricate ya life with stories unbelievable
I'ma ballin' star, you a fallin' star
All used up like no minutes on a callin' card
I'm the bank you ain't nothin' but a dollar or two
You just sand on a beach, and I'm the wave that swallows you
Nobody follows you, your like bad directions
Ya life needs an eraser, there's to many corrections
Ever since I was born, I've been far from the norm
I'm the one that kept ya girl warm when you was gone
Now you and ya born needin' ya palm
Watchin' thorn or outside a dorm, humpin' ya horn ya heart torn
You get warned down the scarecrow and a crop full of corn
Grab an umbrella 'cause them boys bringin' the storm

Paul Wall,"I'm ballin' baby (""big ballin'"")
Gridiron on the beat
Big house, big car
Hoes everywhere, ice everywhere, money everywhere
I'm ballin' man, I ain't braggin'
I'm just tellin' you what it is like, I'm ballin
Know'm talkin' bout? What up ?
I see you on the beat mo' betta

I'm comin' down, candy paint, sprayed by that Eddie
12 coats of that clear lookin' like some grape jelly
My paint's drippin' wet, my slab is superb
Park the truck and catchin' boppers down here in this dirty third
I hold it down for the block bleeders workin' overtime
Not concerned at all with petty shit, I'm occupied on the grind
I keep my mind on breakin' bread, makin' chess moevs, thinkin' ahead
I soaked up game at a early age, I'm built for this, I'ma seasoned vet
Swangers symbolize respect, cain't just anybody tip on Vogues
They'll catch you slippin' in the turnin' lane, and leave ya ass naked walkin home
Candy on chrome is how I drive, with screens fallin' in the back of the ride
My music screwed and my drank is purple, go and take a sip I'd be obliged
I'm comin straight from the land of the fry, the city of syrup and the home of Screw
I'm on the block with my potnah Gooch, stashin' cash in my Reebok shoe
What that do I can't complain, the candy gloss drippin' off the frame
Ball in the mix I'm off the chain, it's goin' down H-Town

[Chorus: x4]
I'm big ballin' baby, yeah, and I'm spendin' cheese
I'm on my grind all day makin' money with ease

I'm grippin' on that wood grain, I'm sippin' on that good drank
I'm showin' love to every side and every neighborhood man
I got them neon lights glowin', representin' my block
I'm on that 59 South, ridin' with my trunk popped
From that Homestead to that Spice Lane, I'm on Scott, in the turning lane
I'm headed straight to that Timmy Chan's, order up and let's get some wings
New Hawk on that channel, I'm on that dolly right
On the way to my gran-ty house, I'm navigated by bubble lights
I'm teded by that junior, I'm cut up by White Mike
Busted up by that Mr. Davis, sluggin' me is a beautiful night
That chrome is quite atrocious, complimented by candy gloss
I'm tiptoein on fo' swangers, eighty-fo's like Randy Moss
Open mouth and show platinum grill, it's like a disco ball
I got expensive tastes, courtesy of expensive jaws
They see me comin' grill and woman, truck bumpin
Knockin' pictures off the wall is nothin' cause I'm a baller

[Chorus]

When the speakers start bumpin' and that fifth relax
I make the trunk dance around like it's doin jumpin' jacks
I'm ridin' on them Spyders, them eighty-fo's tiptoein'
And that trunk is exalted with them neon lights glowin
The candy paint's immaculate, drippin' wet up off the fender
Beat the block up like a boxer, chop the street up like a blender
I got the flat screens fallin' down from the ceiling
And the platinum mouthpiece with diamonds in the filling
I'm big ballin', grippin' grain, breakin' bread, I'm stackin' change
Gettin' money I'm havin' things with two commas, I can't complain
Drippin' candy paint, off the frame, switchin' lanes
In the turning lane leavin' stains, cause I'm a baller

Paul Wall,"Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Oh

It started off, we were two peas in the pod
Motivated by love with the blessings of God
We were head over heels in this love thing
Funny ain't it thinkin' back, our friends thought it was just a fling
I used to call you on the phone, late night tip
Mackin' to you in your ear, conversation well equipped
I used to make you laugh, I used to make you smile
But all the while your roommates were in denial
We felt a lot of jealousy from the very start
Your so-called friends kept tryin to tear us apart
They used to tell you all kinda lies
Just like a wolf in sheep's clothing, the devil came in disguise
They transformed all your smiles into tears
To sabotage your happiness and blamed it on my busy career
I gave you e'rythang, aimin' to please
But I guess it wasn't enough, cause now you ready to leave
But don't go baby

Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Oh

Lil' momma been down with me for a while
When you tryin' to smile I'm the one you like to dial
But lately I've been on a mission for commission
So while you at home wishin' you was with me I've been missin'
But listen I'm tryin' to lace you up with diamonds that glisten
I got a vision so baby you need to kill all the fiction
Don't listen to what your friends sayin', they just jealous
'Cause they on the sidelines watchin' while you in the game playin'
I'm just sayin' you should be stayin', but I ain't trippin'
I'm in love with my money baby that's how I'm livin'
You know I got you on my mind like an edge up
And all of your naggin' me and whinin' it got me fed up
I'm on the grind hustlin', stackin' my cash
But you just thank I'm in the streets chasin' after some ass
Tryin' to break that bread, I'm tryin' to get that cake
But you complainin' talkin' 'bout you fin' to skate, baby what it do

Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Oh

I'm tryin' to tell you 'bout your friends hatin'
While they be over there complainin' I'm just on my grind paper chasin'
You got them insecure thoughts in your mind
But instead of chasin' hoes I be overtime on my grind
You steady listenin' to the gossip in the beauty shop
But all them jealous single females want what you got
They would do anything to take yo' place
'Cause every time I come around they be givin' me that sex face
You ridin' shotgun in the James Bond Benz
With the frog-eyed lens on them 20 inch do rims
So why you worried about your jealous so-called friends
I'm just on my grind tryin' to stack me up some ends baby
I used to make you laugh, I used to make you smile
And all the while your jealous friends been in denial
I ain't askin' much, lil' momma just keep it real
Either you're down with me or not, baby what's the deal

Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how

Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Oh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
'Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how

Hit ya jaw and play 32 pick up
Catch a cut when the AK hiccup

Bend the corner bitch move around

Seen ya straight to Ben Taub, emergency room, ICU
And have you layin' up for a month
Eatin' ya dinner food through a tube

It's the new me, new me, new me, new me,
True, a lot of struggles I done been through and still goin' through
Let me show you what it's like to be me (Paul Wall, Paul Wall baby)

I'm not your average guy, I'm more than meets the eye
I know I'm friendly and fly, but let me tell you why
I was abandoned at an early age
My daddy was a dope fiend, I ain't seen him since the second grade
I sing the same song, deadbeat dad, single mom
I was always in the crawl, yet and still I was alone
I kept my faith in God, even in my younger days
I gave my life to Christ, got down on my knees and prayed
And God answered our prayers and momma remarried
All the burdens she carried, I must admit that it was scary
Somehow I got a real man as my father figure
Thangs started gettin better for my momma and my sister
Pain took me from a boy to a man
I knew I'd make it to the end if I could stick to the plan
People judge me off my music but they never even met me
But I'd introduce myself if you'd let me - Paul Wall baby

[Chorus]
See I've been doin this here for a while
Eventually y'all boys gon' respect me dog
I'm Paul Wall - until it's over I'ma ball 'til I fall
I'm the greatest in a minute ch'all
Let me tell you if you knew me (knew me) yeah the true me (true me)
Not the glamour and glitz that y'all do see (do see)
I'm just a regular G, I gotta do me (do me)
I'm 'bout to introduce y'all boys to the new me, c'mon

It's more to me than all this glamor and glitz
I spent my whole life broke, I'm just tryin' to get rich
I kept it real all my life, I never stepped on toes
But somehow my friends keep turnin' into my foes
My ex keep callin' me, but I don't wanna talk to her
So then she call the laws on me like I'm the one stalkin' her
My new girl say I don't love her enough
But all the hatin' friends jealous cause I love her too much
I'm drinkin' bottles of Patron tryin' to drink away my troubles
But bein' an alcoholic only make things double
People judge me off my music but they never even met me
But I'd introduce myself if you'd let me, Paul Wall baby

[Chorus]

You think you know me man? But you don't know me mayne
Just because you shake my hand don't mean that you my homey mayne
It's people prayin' on my downfall
And I can't understand why, cause I show love to alla y'all
People are grateful for the favors you show 'em
But when they need you for another one they still act like you owe 'em
Everybody be takin' credit for somethin' they ain't do
But you need to quit reachin' and stand on your own two
I always stayed humble, I never once changed
I never got a ego or a big head cause of fame
People judge me off my music but they never even met me
But I'd introduce myself if you'd let me, Paul Wall baby

[Chorus]

I'm Paul Wall, I'm the People's Champ
But it ain't easy bein' me
I done put in my fair share of work, blood, sweat, and tears, for real
Passin' out flowers at the club
Doin' freestyles that don't go on mixtapes
I ain't understand it then but, now I understand it
It's a bigger picture than just what you think
You gotta think outside the box and try to make it
It's chess moves, not checkers baby",Just Paul Wall,2005

That's a pair of semi-automatic shooting everywhere
I don't care if authority come by here
They get it just like them niggaz who ain't from by here

See the chains bump ends
Me and a couple lady friends blowing piff in the wind
I got the wrist ware, smooth and sleek
Nothing but ?
You ain't never saw a watch like this so go ahead and take a peek

And I'm hustlin, on the grind, seventy-two, I was straight
No time to eat or sleep, I'm stackin' licks that just won't wait
I'm campaignin' for a Benz, on the rims with bubble lens
So I'm stackin' every dollar I see, hundreds, fifties, twenties and tens

I'm tryin' to maintain this wealth that I been calculatin'
Gettin' money that's all I know, on my toes never off my note
Wood grain and hundred spokes, I weigh the trunk just like a pro
I grind it's off to work I go, I hustle hard it's non-stop
And if I flop I switch the hustle, I learn the game and then set-up shop
I'm strivin' to make it to the top, it's all or nothin' no turnin' back
I'm with them boys out on the block, accumulatin' them paper stacks

Right now we got the fifth wheel reclinin'

I got the candy paint sprayed by Eddie
And I'm ridin' on that glassy chrome, all courtesy of my hustle game,
Be a hustler's in my bloodline, I don't complain or whine
I just get on my grind, puttin' in work overtime
I learned overtime, many hustles of every kind
Whatever it takes to make a dime, I keep that paper on my mind
I was born blind, but now I see the road to riches
It's a long road, full of hurdles potholes and ditches
Benard Freeman taught me to keep it movin' when you take a loss
And Chad Butler taught me to keep it trill at all cost
I peeped game from the best, and since then I been playin' chess
I put in work with no rest, to get that paper that's my quest
I'm on a slow grind towards success, one of the best cause I keep it fresh
I'm one hundred and nothin' less and I'm still ridin' dirty pimpin'

Sippin' tha barre
Grippin' tha grain 
I got 17 karats in my piece and chain [repeat 4x]
[Verse 1:]
Now open a map and take a trip down south
Come on over to Houston Texas welcome to the Swisha House
It's the land of the trill
I'm coming live from the block
I got my mind on my hustle
I'm tyrna make it to the top
So I put in work and stack at night
Determination is all I got
On the grind I scheme and plot
Whatever it takes to raise my stock
I'm breaking bread out here trying to survive
I'm under water with these sharks praying that I stay alive
I'm putting up numbers like Garnet on that 610 south
Ain't nothing soft about my block except the packs of the south
This here's that Peoples Champ talk
It's the expressions of a G
And I'ma be chasing after them g's until I R.I.P.
Its Paul Wall baby 
What it do? Been banging Screw since '92
Fat Pat n Lil Kee Kee, Phunky Hawk and the rest of the crew
So who's next with the plex?
I'm flipping slab and waving hood
With screens hanging down from the roof 
I'm ballin' like a true playa should, I'mâ?¦
[Chorus x4]
[Verse 2:]
They got you thinking Houston Texas the home of David Carr
But really its candy paint playas sippin' on barre
Come take a ride wit a star straight outta that lone star state
Where Michael Watts trained and told me I gotta hold my weight
That motivation is the key when you moving them keys
Entrepreneurs up in the game outta the 713
See one of the keys to my success 
I switched up like Greg Mattix
While maintaining my composure to become one of the baddest
I stick to the G-code in my Algiers clothes
While I'm tippin' on 4 4 's with these suicide doors
I buy dro and pour a 4 for my dogs that died in the past
Praying to God I stay afloat just to make this hustle last
Its prime time I'm obeying the laws
While my life is on trial
I'm tryna knockout piece and chain and throw some ice on my smile
Its all work and no play I'm out here punching that clock
Its hustle mania out here grinding on the block I'm tryna ball baby
[Chorus x4]
[Verse 3:]
From the third coast trenches where the killers don't think
Where them boys be slugged up and tatted up with that ink
These lil cowards tryna assassinate the character of a G
But I'm squashing all of that chatter keeping it real and being me
Its G's up and marks down when I'm making my round
I'm up in NYC with Dipset and we shutting it down
Shouts out to King and Martin holding it down in the low post
While I'm on the block grinding tryna hold my post
I'm glass house on the grill my necklace glow like toxic waste
I'm iced out like frozen food
Sippin' on the ski taste
I'm over time on that grind
It ain't no time for playing games
That's why I hustle 25/8 accumulating this change
I got them diamonds up against that wood grippin' grain and sippin' good
Hustle Time that's my hood getting money is understood
I'm on the hustle baby all night and all day
100 thee up in my safe
It's safe to say that boy is paid

Trunk bump like chicken pox, turn the bass up just a notch
You see them blades choppin', you see that trunk poppin'
Ho's that diss me in the club, the same ho's in the parking lot boppin'
They see me in the Jag, acting bad with T Ferris
Open mouth and showcase ice, and you gon' see about 20 karats
I'm what they do, you on 5-9 double O
In the Tahoe on 24's, I'm the truth, I got that glow
I'm out that Swisha House with Archie Lee and Couda Bang
Sittin' sideways on swang, the candy paint dripping off the frame
You see me acting bad, I'm showing out and pulling stunts
Say cheese and show my fronts, it's more carrots/karats than Bugs Bunny's lunch

Slanging licks on the grind, putting money in my socks
A legend in the hood for gold grills and poppin' seals
A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills

Still flipping the old school candy Cadillac on swangers
I got a Styrofoam white cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank
Big bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint
Trying to find some ""Honey Love"" my macking game is top rank
These ho's peeping me, ill hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation, trying to figure which car I drive
I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping
Hit the corner you hear me bumping
Look at that cold grill and woman

From messing 'round with some cat that ain't got it together

It's the Swishahouse state prop chain gang
.45 cal big Glock bang bang
I keep the Tupperware tucked in my underwear
Rain down thunder on these suckers make the clutter clear
Let's get one thing clear I run with grizzly bears
Bite you in your back and make you straighten out your chest hair
I'm 100 baby no time for playing games
I got a garden full of carats hanging in my chain
I keep a player bought my paper fuck a hater
Cause the real turn fake switching over like a cross fader
I'm squashing chatter climbing up the ladder
Cause my goal is to make my pockets fatter baby Paul Wall

[Chorus]",State to State,2005
Paul Wall,"[Chorus]
Trill is when you're hustlin', trill is when you're grindin'
Trill is when you punch in that clock overtimin'
Trill is when you keep it real one hundred percent
And hold it down for your team run your game full sprint
Trill is when you never fake, trill is when you real
Chasin' after dollar bills, gotta get it how you live
Trill is when you hustle so you go out there and get it
Doin' whatever you gotta do to make a meal ticket

Yeah, I'm all about the cheese baby, all about the cheddar
When it come to ghetto grindin' can't nobody do it better
A real go-getter, never hesitate to hit a lick
I don't have to even make a phone cal to get a brick
Ya find lieutenant on ya Sidewalk Two
At code fo'-twenty-'fo, he know just what to do
Bring me two turkeys back like it's Thanksgiving
That's how we do in Texas my nigga, so how you livin'
Up in the game since the early 90's
Never sleep to keep them haters one step behind me
Ain't nothin' changed but the time that they hand out
But even without the cars and the ice, we stand out
Cause everybody know us in the streets, we like royalty
Commandin' respect and demandin' click loyalty
If you ain't down with freein' Pimp C then fuck all y'all
You wanna know what trill is? Tell 'em Paul Wall

[Chorus]

I'm a survivor of the struggle, I live by the code
In the city where greed and envy make ya heart turn cold
At 17 years old I was ahead of my time
I had to roll with the punches and keep my ducks in a line
I keep my mind on my money, I keep my mind on my paper
I keep a glock inside my pocket for all these jealous haters
I trained for chess moves, I'm five steaps ahead
I keep my mind focused, make money, break bread
I'm rollin' 5 9, it's the home of the crack sales
That South Lee block got more cookies than Snackwells
I snatch you up like eatin shrimp, don't contest do not attempt
You crossed the line no turnin' back, we'll leave you naked like Larry Flynt
With young ghetto stars, certified with ghetto scars
Intoxicated by weed cigars, we eat stress by sippin' barre
Fancy cars and diamond ice, I'm intrigued by fancy things
We always keep it trill, in the hood we look like kings

[Chorus]

Look, look, if you know me then you know I'm a G
If you know me then you know I'm gon' run through a hundred bricks a week
If you know me then you know I'm a dawg
If you know me then you know I get a package and I fly 'til it's gone
If you know me then you know I'm a fool
If you know me then you know I'll punish you if you fuck with the dude
If you know me then you know I'm a man
If you know me then you know I keep a plan to keep some money in my hand
If you know me then you know I'll bleed
You don't know me ask somebody they'll tell you wodie mean what he said
If I huff it, ain't no doubt I'm a spread
I'm a cock and bust, since 13 I been droppin' my nuts
I'm online for new artists in Florida
Got a bitch that'll drive with a package from Atlanta to Dallas
You ain't know, better ask your bitch
Paul Wall, Bun B, B.G. is as trill as it get

Paul Wall,"Drive slow homey
Drive slow homey
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey

My homey Mali used to stay one 29th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street form Calumet a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
Walk around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Dayton's in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Alesis he had dreams of Caprice's
Drove by the teachers even more by police's
How he get that cash today his father passed away
Left him with a little somthin' 16 he was stuntin'
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit lake shore girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway go at least bout 80
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
See back back then then if you had a car
You were the Chi town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cracked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had the Lincoln's and Aurora's we were hurting them all
And there was a lot of flirting involved
But dawg fuck all that flirting I'm trying to get in some draws
So put me on with these hoes homey's
He said don't rush to get grown drive slow homey
Drive slow homie
Drive slow
Ya never know homey about these hoes homey
Ya need to pump your breaks and drive slow homey

What It do
I'm posted up in the parking lot my trunk wavin'
The candy gloss is immaculate and is simply amazing
Them elbows poking wide on that Candy-lac
Trunnk open screens on neon's lit with
I'm on a mission for dime piece's and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them 4's crawlin', you see them screens fallin'
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leanin' on a switch sittin' crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boopas if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
Riding some candy coated crawlin' like a caterlippar
I'm tippin' on those 4's I'm jamming off this screw
I'm lookin' for them hoes baby what it do?

Drive slow homey
Turn your hard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow homey
If you ridin' around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow homey
Live today 'cause tomorrow you never know
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey

My cars like the movies my cars like the crib
I got more TV's in here then where I live

And it don't make no sense but bay I'm the shit
And everything I flip you know is something serious
I got the custom grill I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics baby that's evident
You see a player flicking and you ain't convinced
That you should go and kiss it just a little bit
I wear my custom kicks I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleaming though my angle wings
They see me hoes acting like they seen a king
With that mean lean smoking on the finest Cali green
My wood grain oak I'm riding on vogues
My cylinder quiet like tip toes
I sold O's and this I know
When you see them hoes little homey drive slow

Chopped and Screwed
Yeah
Drive slow homey
Drive slow homey
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey

Rap 84 of the 83, ain't rhyme them and they end with me, 
How you pay to get in the club, and then hate on the pressure y'all pay to see
Now we got mob block live again
Look at these whips we're riding in
Making ball and look easy baby, we don't practice like... 
Sliding in I'm never super post when
I'm getting closer I'm just... the face
All the sinners star calling God, 
All the rappers start calling Mace, 
Drop sounding like an earthquake, 
Trunk bound to make an earth shake
Every day is a movie for me, you like the destination on the first day
Telling me it's a birthday, new shoes and her persuade, 
You should go appreciate the quire, I ain't the one you persuade, 
She ain't worried of the hotel, I wouldn't even get to motel, 
Mess around and take your girl from you then sell it to for the...

Told Brad to send me a track, 
He send me a track to sound like a trap, 
I don't know normally do this, 
But hey when I do it sound like the trap, 
Competition left me in flat, I'm just hoping that you trap, 
I'm just hoping you try to try me, 
Get drag around by your suit tie, 
You can catch me in the forn city, 
They don't even know I rap, 
First album when platinum so they ain't many places on my map, 
Going golf in Iraq, going shopping in Dubai
She'll be asking the man forgives and gives me the gift form Dubai
Bottle water with a mouse trap, no rat can get to my cheese
Her... get no scraps get no bad like her ratches
Wanna book me for five G's, 
Read the sign and say stop please, 
Can't knock me, my trunk knocking, 
My making woman looking knock me, 
Call me but I'm unreachable, too trill to be speaker too
God loss in my own garage and they couldn't find me for a week or two, 
My trunk are open like pickable, 
Me I'm... to be sipping through, 
Came to blue, all my speakers blue, but I turn em up and my speakers do.

Chew up cheese then throw up grants,

One four, one dime, you already know which one is mine, 
Tripping like Jessy Jay, see love and got me in the... day

Might as well, I might as well, passing up dough is a major feel, 
Take the trip to South Africa, but can't lead the the paper like... pill, 
Realest rapper you have ever meet, she want n autograph on her fake breast, 
Too young is just too dumb, girl slow it down and take a break twist, 
Check it out when my lack is out, 
Don't worry bout it, I ain't stressed, 
Hot chocolate on my hallo tips they might mess around and get a taste test.

Paul Wall,"I'm in town, girl, for just one night
You're so fine, girl, you're just my type
You just might make me miss my flight
Lemme lay your body down tonight

We gonna spend time, you name your price
I don't trip but for you, I might
Tryna get deep, girl, don't make me fight
Lemme lay your body down tonight

Open up ya eyes and ya see quite clear
No more crying, no more tears 'cause ya champion is here
I'm the superman you seek, I sweep ya off ya feet
From the moment our eyes meet, girl, you in for a treat

The attraction is so unique, the conversation is sweet
Love making under the sheets, it'll make the mission complete
Your body language is loud, girl, you speaking it well
But maybe I do the fool, put you under my spell

I'm suave and debonair, you sexy with long hair
This chemistry's so rare, just kick back and chill
Let the moment take control, ya Prada goes my gold?
But baby, let's take it slow, lemme show ya I'm real

If them looks could kill, ya be wanted in every state
Ya body shape is great, collaboratin' is fake
When you open up the gates, be ready to love make
I'm ready to back break, girl, you wet as a lake, I can't wait

I'm in town, girl, for just one night
You're so fine, girl, you're just my type
You just might make me miss my flight
Lemme lay your body down tonight

We gonna spend time, you name your price
I don't trip but for you, I might
Tryna get deep, girl, don't make me fight
Lemme lay your body down tonight

Go on and let ya hair down, you in the midst of a playa
I'm the answer to ya prayers, we make a perfect pair
I handle with great care, I'm packing, girl, beware
Go on, come back to my lair and I'll make you believe

Some slow jams and candle light, make the mood right
I do it just like ya like it, sweat ya out of ya weave
From the second you arrived to the moment you leave
I'll have you huffin' and puffin' but please don't forget to breathe

Ain't no tricks up my sleeve but I know you still debatin'
But baby, no more waitin', it's time for Mr. Slayton
Them other clowns been fakin' but I'm here for the takin'
No worries of baby makin' 'cause I pack a Gary Payton

Me and you layin' naked in them birthday suits
Is reserved in body rockin', baby, knockin' them boots
Now you know you lookin' cute but it's time to decide
All playing games aside, you gon' ride, baby

I'm in town, girl, for just one night
You're so fine, girl, you're just my type
You just might make me miss my flight
Lemme lay your body down tonight

We gonna spend time, you name your price
I don't trip but for you, I might
Tryna get deep, girl, don't make me fight
Lemme lay your body down tonight

Get closer, baby, tonight, I'll give you what you need
From the moment that our eyes met
Girl, I knew that you were meant for me
You and me and chemistry

So what you wanna do tonight?
I'm tryna be with you tonight
'Cause you're lookin' so nice
So nice

A bowl of strawberries and some ol' wet rose
Some ya sweet talkin' in ya ear, make ya come out them clothes
When the moon light reflect off the sweat of your skin
I'ma demonstrate, then separate the boys from the men

Lemme swim inside ya ocean, ya body is smooth as lotion
Let's get full of that potion and leave ya head full of grouse
Baby, it ain't no jokin' when I tell ya it's real
So baby, tell me how ya feel, what's the deal, baby?

We gonna spend time, you name your price
I don't trip but for you, I might
Tryna get deep, girl, don't make me fight
And lay your body down tonight
Down tonight

All the ballers is bouncin', they love the way I be leanin'
They love the way I be leanin', they love the way I be leanin'

This is the year of the you, watch how I get on track
A young black Peyton manning in the rap gettin' his snaps
And also, he only rides in the year that he's in
'Cause he don't feel the year's bigger than him, so, let the boy be

He off the meter with tennis shoes and a white tee
Bitches watchin' him thinkin', ""What if he wife me?""
And it's a certain kind of swagger you get
Especially when you're used to bein' the shit, that's if you're older right

All of my boss bitches know the type
When a nigga hug all on ya and he be smellin' like a motorbike
A nice fit and video on the TV'll
Get her to come out of them B.B.'s, believe me

I'm a thug and I'ma stay on pub
And I don't hug 'cause I carry the strap in the club
I see ya peepin' tryin' to figure out what's happenin' with us
They love the way I be leanin', that's why they baggin' it up

You know that purple drank I be leanin', my diamonds shinin' and gleamin'
I'm in that dropper with Juve the groupies boppin' and fiendin'
I'm from the home of the candy paint, 84's and purple drank
Ladies know when I hit they corner my slabs'll make 'em faint

Ice Age and U.T.P., ball-ballin' as you can see
Crawl-crawlin' on 23's, with candy on my HumVee
Honies love the way I talk, love the way I walk
Love the way I lean, they say that I'm so clean

I got a lot of money, I got a lot of ice
I got a lot of cars, many colors and lots of types
I got that paper 'cause I'm caked up like Betty Crocker
Comin' down on choppers single file with all the trunk poppers

Gettin' money's my only task, stack up paper and count cash
I'm ridin' on that pull over silver, the same color as a bad rash
Gettin' full of that puff, puff, pass, it's Paul Wall, man, what that do
Swishahouse baby, that's my crew, comin' down jammin' on the Screw

Drove over two dogs, sittin' on two fogs
My rims be talkin' too, they love to seduce hogs
They're dressed in cute clothes, manicured with cute toes
I'm big paper; Wacko never stop for group hoes

Oh no, I don't scoop those, fly bitches salute those
Fatties with benefits, you know I recruit those
This a Soulja Slim T-shirt, this ain't no suit hoe
I got Pradas up under these, not no Timberland boots hoe

I'm sick dog and there ain't no antidote
Bust your motherfuckin' head like a cantaloupe
Like Hannibal, woof, I'm an animal
Just cold dickin' the money down, huh, ain't it though?

I'ma do my damn thing 'til I can't no mo'
Don't make me pull this damn trigger 'til it ain't no mo'

Paul Wall,"When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast
I ain't never came through
Got a mouth full of diamonds
You can hardly hear me speak
Especially when it shine like dis (dis)
It's that H-Town, baby, and you know what is
I'm throwed
Got Styrofoam cup full of bar
I'm throwed
Four deep in my old school car
I'm throwed
Show Cali why I'm bangin' this crew
Ice Ice Man, baby, and you know what it do
I'm throwed

Fresher than a fruit bowl
Leanin' like a gas gauge
Straight up off the doors, freestylin' like hair braids

Fresher than a fruit bowl
Leanin' like a gas gauge
Straight up off the doors, freestylin' like hair braids

Fresher than a fruit bowl
Leanin' like a gas gauge
Straight up off the doors, freestylin' like hair braids

Makin' that candy dance, I'm throwed off the Cali plants
I'm pressin' on his knee, crawlin' down like fire ants
I'm higher than a trance, I'm sharper than a star's pants
Stackin' Franklin and Grants from south bank to spring grass
I'm posted like a stamp with my mind on cash
I'm wheel grippin' and still tippin' Brandi wine on glass
I got a screen and a dash, a quarter tank full of gas
Smokin' that puff puff pass, throwed; I hope I don't crash
Rippin' the Swisha glass, so I'm flyer than a mockingbird
Rippin' the Swisha glass, so I'm flyer than a mockingbird
Rippin' the Swisha glass, so I'm flyer than a mockingbird

Now, to broads I'm a sharp-shooter like Steve Kerr
Flash the wrists, 'cause a blur
Fox fur and flyin' spur
Undisputed for sure
So I'm collectin' these dimes
Name and number lil' momma 'cause it's checkout time
I'm slidin' on glass threes, inhalin' the chronic trees
Pack protection 'cause player hatin' spread like STD's
Pack protection 'cause player hatin' spread like STD's
Pack protection 'cause player hatin' spread like STD's
I'm cool as a ocean breeze; like Chester, I'm chasin' cheese
I'm stingin' like buzzin' bees, on softly with cheese
Screens fall like all them leaves, makes the TV's rain
Take a picture if you please; yeah, my wrist is insane
Dirty can, diamond chain, so fallin' is off the chain
Mind frame, I'm stackin' change
I'm so throwed in the game

I'm pourin' that purple sprite, and I'm searchin' for broads
Paper stackin' so my money stretch like extension chords
I'm a wide bod rocker in a four on them choppers
I'm on the grind stackin' up my mail like the post office
Movin' at slow pace with T Fair as my ace
Cup full of expensive taste, open mouth and showcase
I'm throwed up with screens hangin', swangin', breakin' his trust
We pourin' up in them cups; that stuff got me leanin' tough
Hold up
I'm caked up so all the boppers attract
I got 'em like a softer pal out there runnin' the track
Pullin' capers, makin' paper stacks fly as a dove
A bread breaker, taste maker, baby
Holla at ya love, I'm throwed

Paul Wall,"Yea I'm gettin' money is my exclamation
The Lambo's milked out, no expiration
And I ain't ask for a estimation
I just pass the cake off, no hesitation
Ya see I'm nothin' like y'all guys
I just do the stuntin', y'all niggas fall guys
And everyday I get the benny washed
It's deja vu like denny wash
Budget too big, billionaire a hurt a label
Play it tight, spray the creed on the purple label
Pie vay settings, Jacob got me linked up
The Bentley wag bulletproof like a brinks truck
C.b.l, we don't care what ya homies sell
Rubberband around the stacks like a ponytail
I could meet a hoe sweeter than Damita Joe
She act conceited tho and I'm a get deleted yo
I'm not a musician, but I play a instrument
The ragin' bull handle any kind of incident
The black latex, D's can't get the print
The flyin' spur so fly, I had to get the bent
Got initials on the door scrap, initials on the floor mat
I ain't braggin' homeboy, dis my format
The 22's look like they ridin' on four flats
Young octopus, I carry arms
I draw to challengers, with Cavali carry-ons
Freck billionaire, I'm the 1 with the bling
Got canaries on the wrist, not the ones with the wings
A real hood nigga, I got a lavage flow
I could push you into theaters like magic tho
You don't want beef, you just want raps
I get ya lil' ass smoked like a blunt wrap
C.B.L spray, what da fuck did you thought
I tote the cig, but I don't mean Newport
I wash my money up the laundry way
I stay Gucci'd down even on my laundry day
The linen clean, splash ya ?
Double blue 62 smash ya limousine
You could set trip, but I get the ammo near
Like a bad alibi, switch up the lambo gear
These other rap niggas, they could'nt hold a candle near
They got it all screwed up, like chandeliers

I'm gettin' money is my quotation
Family man, so I need the lambo station
Slick talk, I'll put a chamber into rotation
Director style, I shoot em on location
My hoe's haitian, trenny and croatian
Ass clap louder than an oprah ovation
Double d's on her chest like daredevil
I shoot dames at a 900 a pair level
I'm in perotta, the color of ricotta
Cheese, please you can't tell me not a
I don't share keys, nor do I give her codes
I set run through records down on river road
Then I switched up, posted on palleysay
The denali stay, smellin' like cali grade
I come through bar, numba 9 squirts
Osama rich, that's the hard to find shirt
Ya rocks keep 2 they selves, well mines flirt
They 2 clean, board of health couldn't find dirt
I'm rich bitch, and I'm screamnin' it like ashy larry
They call me brinks boy, maybe it's the cash I carry
Rubberbands pop, you gon' need a scrungee for me
She a jump off, bet the chick a bungee for me
I came a long way, and I still stroll the avenues
Move and style, louis v roll and travel
Local nigga, you never been to poland have you,
So you couldn't judge me if you was holdon gavels
And I used to get the raw from olivia
That was back when raven symone was olivia
I did the take-out, meanin' that I ran orders
I had the transporter sittin' by the land borders
The rocafella a make you rather do a manslaughter
They goin' in June, it's comin' back with grand-daughters
So homie if you got a weapon tote it
You can't jump ship, niggas won't accept you boated
When I was doin' it 4 t.v, I kept it loaded
Cause these hatin' niggas try 2 find it and webisode it
A half of clip in ya hip, a make ya elvis shake
You'll more then moan when ya bones and ya pelvis break

Paul Wall,"[Chorus]
I'm in town girl for just one night
You so fine girl you're just my type
You just might make me miss my flight
Lemme lay your body down, tonight
We gone spend time, you name your price
I don't trick, but for you I might
Tryin' a get deep girl, don't make me fight
Lemme lay your body down, tonight

Open up ya eyes and ya see quite clear
No mo crying, no mo tears, cause ya champion is here
I'm the superman you seek, I sweep ya off of ya feet
From the moment our eyes meet, girl you in for a treat
The attraction is so unique, the conversation is sweet
Love making under the sheets, It'll make the misson complete
Your body language is loud, girl you speaking it well
But baby I do the fool, put you under my spell
I'm suave and debonair,You sexy wit long hair
This chemistry's so rare, just kick back and chill
Let the moment take control, Your pot of gold is my goal
But baby let's take it slow, lemme show ya im real
If them looks could kill, ya be wanted in every state
Ya body shape is great, Collaboratin is fate
When you open up the gates, be ready to love make
I'm ready to back break, girl you wet as a lake
I can't wait

[Chorus]

Go on and let ya hair down, you in the mist of a player
I'm the answer to ya prayers, we make a perfect pair
I handle with great care, I'm packing girl beware
Go one come back to my lair, and I'll make you believe
Some slow jams and candle light, make the mood right
I do it just like ya like it, sweat ya out of ya weave
From the second you arrive, to the moment you leave
I'll have you huffin' and puffin, but please don't forget to breathe
Ain't no tricks up my sleeve, but I know you still debatin'
But baby no more waitin', it's time for Mr. Slayton
Them other clowns been fakin', but I'm here for the takin'
No worries of baby makin, Cause I pack a Gary Payton
Me and you layin' naked, in them birthday suits
Is a result of body rockin', baby knockin' them boots
Now you know you lookin' cute, but it's time to decide
All playing games aside
You gone ride baby

[Chorus]

Get closer baby, tonight I'll give you what you need
From the moment that our eyes met, I knew that you're the one for me
I knew that we had chemistry
So tell me what it do tonight, I tryna leave wit you tonight
Cause your looking so nice

A bowl of strawberries, and some moet rose
Some ya sweet talkin' in ya ear, make ya come out them clothes
When the moon light reflect off the sweat of skin, 
I'm a demonstrate, what separate the boys from the men
Lemme swim inside ya ocean, ya body is smooth as lotion
Let's get full of that potion, and leave ya the broken
Baby it ain't no jokin', when I tell ya it's real
So baby tell me how ya feel, whats the deal baby

Fly, hey,hey
I Got dat trunk craked windows tinted,trunk craked windows tinted
Slowly rollin' I'm banging screw
Slowly rollin' I'm banging screw
Comin' down so fly-y-y-y
Smokin' leaf so high-I-I-I
Slowly rollin' I'm banging screw,
Slowly rollin' I'm banging screw.

What it do it's paul to the wall,
Chunk up tall, let the 4 screens fall,
Spider's crawl gon turn up that dial 
And make they heads all nod like a bobble head doll,
Bendin' corners up and down wayside,
From greens road to that Antoine drive,
Crew on da side playin' N-B-A live,
I'm too cool for school ridin' on buckhide,
Turnin' heads when I'm on dat scott
Hit that french's for a quick pit stop,
Boys in the mail talkin bout they on top,
8 Months later all them boys flop.
Like it or not I'm the game and 
I'm showin' up, keke got dat oil and we pourin' up,
Hit the club wit captain jack 
And big Steve representin' my hood still throwin' up.
Big money in the gang as the bread grow,
Candy old school drop top for the low,
Boys used to be sleepin on me but the champ 
Is here I guarantee that they ass woke,
Ridin' on spoke, dats the elbow, still rockin' in da ice white shell toe,
Dis for my boys by dat kelso and you already know.

[Chorus]

Yeah, I'm still on that five-9,
But might see me on that five-8 comin' down,
All over the town I like to get around,
Jammin' my fat pat screwed up underground,
Comin' down in the lime green eighty eight,
While them boys on the sideline wanna hate,
Bump a kid for fuckin' up the state plate,
I Must admit my life's great,
T-Farris wit me in the snow bunny Benz,
Lookin' through a louey lens and we stackin' up ends,
Bros over hoes yea I'm talkin' bout friends,
Got freedom on my arm for my dog lil' twin,
Dubs on the rim that's t.i.s,
Just like pretty Todd I'm g-boy fresh,
Got oil comin' in and it's strait from da west,
And grill throwin' mesh on the cadillac crest,
Head of the best I ain't messin' wit da rest,
Santa clause sled that's pomegranate red,
Sippin' that taste I take it straight to da head,
And that swisha house is what I rep till I'm dead.

[Chorus]

I'm tippin' fo's and I'm sippin' fo's and I'm flippin' hos with my partner clue,
Posted up at that TSU or that Prarie View wit my patna Lew-
Hawk, boys get outlined in chalk,
Tryin' to run up and jack my slab,
This one here for my boy lil kee I'm throwin' deuce up and gettin' boys dab,
Pourin' da juice up and grippin' that ab,
Wavein' hoods so the base showcase
Settin' the trends steady choppin' up wind with a diamond ice grin, that paper I chase,
Taper fade by that bad boy shop,
Tippin' slow I'm screwed up and chopped,
Listening to some of that bobby merl, them choppaholics, maybe that Michael Watts,
Choppin' the block up, holdin' a full cup,
Breakin' a strut, now I'm on them swangs,
Grill and woman popped trunk full of bang,
I'm third coast raised and I'm drippin' stains,
I'm hittin' stank tryin to break that bread,
Slowed and throwed till the day I'm diseased,
Leaning tuff, I got cup full of stuff with a starched crease and a johnny dang piece.

Uh huh, come on
Correct me if I'm wrong but God damn I'm fly
In my famous stars and straps, no suit, no tie
I got the heavy starch crease, so I'm sharp as an ice pick
I'm swangin' and bangin' and holdin' grain like a vice grip
I'm high as a ceiling fan, I'm flier than Superman
I'm hot as a frying pan, 'cause baby I'm the man
And I'm leanin' like a kick stand, stackin' up them grands
From T Wet to Batan, that wood grain up in my hand
Roll it up and pass it, as I cruise through traffic
Slow motion candy ocean on this antique classic
I'm super seedin' my quota, out collectin' these dimes
My speech slurred 'cause I'm leanin' like a half passed nine
I'm tippin' down on them craigers, I'm skatin' like Darren Harper
With a trunk full of speakers beatin' hard like Travis Barker
The money in the stash, paid for make stack
I'm swangin' till the fo's clack, drinkin' codeine extract

With the screw tape playin' in the deck, so I drive slowly (slow)
Got them swangers pokin', yeah the slab hold me (hey)

It's Paul Wall baby, Swishahouse Spokesman
I'm crushing all competition like a coke can
I'm with that Damon Jones Mix-O and Black Lac
In that Lac with the trunk cracked, I'm swingin'
Until the swingers collapse, I'm back, I'm stuntin'
Comin' down on gold tires, I'm on the block, holdin' it down
Like some ? I keep the swingers pokin' I got the
Windows open, white cup with somethin' potent, wood wheel
Still what I'm chokin', I'm on that Antwan with Lou, Hawk, and

[Chorus]

I'm on the block holdin' posts like Jermaine O' Neal
No ice grill, just cold steel, that's a gangsta grill
I'm down for that drama so I'm known to pack a cannon
A sharp seein' hittin' targets like Peyton Manning
And you can catch me in the hood like a liquor store
Roll those dice, let's get that dough, I'm 6-8, I'm 10-4
I got that Tish from black, that tip got my back
I put them elbows under the Lac, and know they plottin' ta jack
Boppers don't know how to act, I'm leanin' back and countin' stacks
Postin' up on big wheels, still sippin' ? don't get distressed
I'm out here chasin' banks, breakin' bread and sippin' drank, accumulating
My Benz taste, my mind straight, and my paper chase

My vision's nocturnal so I'm grindin' all night
I gotta cup that's rather purple, so it's oil and it's Spirte
I got some partnas in the cage, I be shootin' them kites, them other
Guys is all hype, tell them suckas take a hike baby, you see them
? you see them hundred spokes, I'm holdin' spokes just wood
Deep, ya get it, coast to coast, I'm slabbin' candy drops, punchin' clocks
And slammin' broads, I got money like Reggie Bush, my billboard got a lotta
Yards, I'm with that Poppa Joe, I got dro on da low, I keep the lean for a month
Or so, but I'm back on it, I can't let go, I'm down with T.Farris and G.Dat, we

Blowin' kush in the wind, I'm blowed (I'm blowed).

From my head to my feet, I'm cold (I'm cold). 
New shoes on my ride, bad bitch on my side, 
Man that's how gangstas roll (that's how gangstas roll).

I'm higher than a top flight, throwed like a splitter, 
My pockets keep gettin' bigga, cause I'm one bad figga. 
Boppas n gold diggas on the track at work, 
I'm hurtin' feelins in that Bens wit a deuce and a Squirt. 
I'm a fillibuster for hustlas, invadin' dem mark bustas. 
Leanin' like I'm on crutches as I ski taste slurp. 
Swangin' and woodworkin' convertin' this closed curtains, 
For certain, I betta not spill no purple drank on my shirt. 
I'm hustle for occupation, I'm grindin' paper chasin, 
These boys is steady hatin' so this pistol I'm embracin'. 
That lac is so amasin' and da elbows is skatin'. 
Cranker wires n vogue tires, one hell of collaboration.

Rumor is that them jackas on da sideline schemin' and plottin'. 
But my mind on dem boppas if I spot'em I got 'em. 
I got slabs I got foreigns wit da seats all plush, 
I got brandy wine gloss, baby please don't touch. 
I got 20's I got 4's I got screens and such. 
Boppas yappin' cause they say I tend to cap too much. 
I got starch in my jeans and da crease so sharp. 
Headlights on my ear when the night get dark, 
White ones on my toes brand new out the box. 
Interior decoratin' the watch I'm connectin' the dots. 
I got stocks I got money that's a fat billfold,

Killa kush smoke I blow as the lungs inhale, 
Gangsta leanin' on dat oil I got a story to tell.

Raw fed exed me some x pills we call it e mail.

And a bag a sticky icky green limes

I got that paper in them rubber bands stacked up
And I got somethin' hidden in the stash wrapped up
If you see purple in my cup that mean I'm leanin' tough
I got them haters on my back so I be strapped up
I'm in a league of my own while them haters throw stones
But my mind on cash I'm in the zone I'm grippin' wood and tippin' chrome
I'm well known my wrist is rocky like Stallone
Southlea is where I Rome
The champ is here and there is no clone
Off top I'm well respected on many blocks
So I'm pullin' hundreds and smashin' cocks
Knockin' these broads up out they socks
I'm in the hood like wig shops
Look close I ain't hard to spot
I'm right there at that gamblin' spot
Stackin' up a fat not

Revisin' the game like king James

I'm bangin' hooks like sugar Shane
I'm thowed off like Major Payne
Talkin' shit like brother lane
These boys talkin' down on the name

But they all washed up like Eddie Kane
The slab roof like David Blaine it disappear like magic
Glock nineteen made a plastic might stretch ya out jus' like elastic
I stay up on my toes till the day that my casket close
Bankrolls and fine hoes fancy cars and starch clothes
Weed cigars and Moet rolls pints a bar and kushy dro
Dime collector outside the club in candy toy with tha trunk exposed
Swishahouse baby that's my crew roll wit us or you'll get ran through
We loved by few and still true let me tell yall jus wat it do

And I been hustlin' since hulk hogan body slammed the iron sheek
My flo is outta sight but them boys is all hype
They cant see me up on tha mic
So they be hatin' me outta spite
Some potent purple sprite I done paid my dues
I hear the strong survive but the weak end up on fox news
Sleepless nights wit burna in hand cause now a days them jackas plot
Jealousy turn friends ta foes im packin' glocks around tha clock
Stackin' nots and mackin' hoes

Get that dough wit out tha po's

Hatin' cause they broke suckers, fake as a 30 spoke.

But these clowns be actin' funny, like a knock knock joke,
They cramp on my style, cause I got money and power,
My paper long as the nile, so how them hatas like me now?

Them bustas on the prow so I'm ten tokes down,

Some tattoos and a ice grill don't make you real,

So you gotta have dough to make bread where I'm From,

Real nigga yes, all about the hustle,
Till I get that call from god sayin,""I want you""
I been trough it, I past struggle, thats right,
Every day I in the street trying to complete a mad puzzle

Big money like I work downtown.

I'm one hundred, but them other boys frontin',
They just sideline commentating, we call it dumb fuckin',
They sweet as apple pie, as they spreadin' them lies,

You swear they so cool, but they turn like doorknobs,
They say they hardcore, but they friendlier than spongebob,
I'm tryin' to stay afloat, stayin' up on my note,
So that Highness is what I tote, affordin' the overcoat.

I roll with a platoon that'll put you in your tomb,
And then mark up your body like Mr. Cartoon,
Its real in these streets when you chasin' that guap,
Cause that hatin' around the clock, will it ever stop,
Probably not.

Like this ain't what it was (was) or we ain't what you say (say)
I'll make a high cappa or court fraud light in tha day
Cause in the middle of the street in height of tha traffic
Watch what you say when we meet cause they know might get yo ass kicked
End up in a pickle like a Vlasic, UGK nigga
We cost like a foreign but get respect like a classic motherfucker

[Chorus]

This Paul Wall, baby, Swishahouse spokesperson
Choppin' up tha slab, spokes turnin', bobbies searchin'
Shoppers splergin, Caked up cause my pockets swoll
I'm callin' plays, pullin broads, I just think and roll
I'm from that lone star, tippin' dime dat candy car
Get it shined on 59, Lean and tuck I'll cut some more
Hoes wanna who we are, Fathers wanna know what we get
Hatas wanna talk down a knot, but they just mad cause they ain't hot
They ain't got the cash that I got,
They don't know what my hood 'bout
They don't know about trunks that pop on Lambo's that blaze tha chop
Countin' cash and stackin' not, South victory back to Scott
Crawlin' like big crocodile, I'm diamond smile and Johnny watch
I'm with my partner, box, you and you and not with 'cho
Rick boy, yeah that's fo' sho', breakin em off, you already know
Drive slow like Kanye West, and Branyan Wayans, and Manny Mesh
A swishahouse chain on my chest, I keep it fresh, We are the best

Uh
I was down on my last down with my stomach touching my back
Instead of my partner's helping me I was what they were laughing at
Can't approach the girl of your dreams with pro-wiens and wragger jeans
So wife five-four shirt with the collar, plus no dollar
It's been a long time since I slept outside, next door to my daddy house
Back then Darrell Louis would smack they Junior in my daddy house
I'm not trippin' I'm actually glad that they turned there backs on me
Fuck family and fuck friends too, It's just me and my strap homie
Yeah I was that nerd nigga yesterday the day I rapped homie
A pocket full of pencils but came a pistol in my lap homie
I was voted most likely to become a teacher
Everybody class is in session put'cha ears up and a mirror speaker
And the day's lesser than simple if you don't work, you don't eat
And the lowest level of a man is when he is living on the street
Whatever you put in the game, the game goin give back to you playa
That's why my mind ain't on these bitches, I keep my mind on paper
I got to keep my hands on swoll

Keep my mind on that paper
Keep my eyes on my paper
Keep my mind on my paper (I got to keep my hands on swoll)
Keep my eyes on my paper

I got my mind on that paper, mayn
I'm thinking bout them stacks
My motivation is being solds in Cadillac's
My decoration is candy coats and super posts
My worst nightmare's waking up and being broke
My mind frame is go get it with no excuse
If all that crying though help me, then tell me what's the use?
My hustle schedule is all night and all day
If there some paper to be made, then I'm on the way
My daily routine is stacking chains and hitting licks
I use my with stick go get it and stack them chips
The haters bumping they lips to try to throw me off
But my eyes on the green like I was playing golf
I'll never ease up mashing until the day I croak
I'll be eighty selling med's to old folks
I keep my mind on bread just like a baker
My eyes on that paper till I meet my

I got to keep my hands on swoll [x2]

See I might beat a chick up or should I'da and take the hoe home
When you meet a chick you fuckin' the next day, her homies go home
But in my crib the type of shenanigans just don't go on
Thinking I'm goin pay to see your pussy, bitch you got me so wrong
I might spend a little here, spend a little there
Never spend any of it on pussy, I'm a real player
Early birds get the worm, I'm up when the cock crows
I'm a slip in the baker read cause I promise I got doe
This ain't pay rent money, this play with money
When my friends stop playing with me, I started to play with money
My nigga my ass, ain't not one of y'all my nigga no mo'
Except for Jimbo, one night he caught me creepin' up out of da bibyo
Even though I was down on my luck so he threw me a bone
Put money in my pocket, put me in a room and then my nigga was gone
Ever since then I been tasting paper like paper murder
One of my people have money ain't grown in love of it is evil

Ya
I'ma spitter, you other cats be on littler
That's probably why you just penny pushing and I'm bigger
So you hate on me 'cuz you like paper and I'm gritter
With two Biancas up on my arms like John Ritter

Oh my goodness, is they talking shit again
When I been player on the day I become U.S. citizen
Haters keep wishen, I'ma take a lost but I'm finishin'
Killer but squirer just like Percy Miller no limits then
I aim for digits, 100% of my people came to get it
He used to be bigger but became a midget
Taken out of the game, livin' lame he lived it
So he gotta hate on the next man, 'cuz he don't got the money 
We left him on the bottom, now he the ex tech fan
Get the fuck outta my face, its you mistake I'm getting hotter sit and watch me expand
You take falls I take her and take drawls
And give you the which stall
They give me the mate call ( oh baby )
You yank tall
Love is me, but hates y'all
That's why I'ma take all, what pops in the great wall

A veteran stands here a rookie niggas at his knees
Grab these shove middle fingers in the sky
Tell it like it is, when I rap so y'all identify
Start from the ground formulate an enterprise
Get outta here before u get punished and penalized
Ive been in fires to stay in this lane hommie
I swear when I rap, I say it ain't a thang phony
I'm icy, I'm shiny tho' I dont' got a chain hommie
Even when inside this booth I keep my thang on me
And when it rains homie, I don't complain hommie
Eliminate the cops so I don't have to strain hommie
I talks a bunch of shit the haters wanna flamethrow me
Rapper ain't got the balls or got a place they aims on me
Get the fuck outta here, tell em wall told ya
Popper a done deal, every one of your soft soldiers

[Chorus:]

I do this for my partner standing out there on the block
And do this for haters on the sideline at night
Despite what they saying I just cant seem to stop
Gettin' this guap, I gotta a lot, partner I'm almost to the top
I gotta cop new watch, fresh grill and new cloths
I'm trying to come back candy low, side ways on fours
I gotta that bread, it be the money ova these hoes
'Cuz my friends be turning to foes, and harsh words lead to blows
They be mad at me 'cuz I'm the shit, while they just shit
And I gotta off my ass and get it while they just sit
They upset 'cuz im getting bread while they layin' in bed
Even tho I started at the bottom I'm a hundred miles ahead
They still be talkin' dime on me try to slander my name
'Cuz I'm the main man, but they wanna watch it change
They hate me 'cuz they hate but please make no mistake
They know me but can't stop me 'cuz I'm Paul Wall the great

Oh so sexy you got that natural
The way you moving ooh that's crazy
So amazing I'm getting faded
Off you so intoxicating

Pretty feet with open toes
Scent of your neck is like a fresh red rose
X-ray vision passing through your clothes
But I really cant wait to see you naked though
The way your body move and you dip it slow
I try to play it cool but I gotta let you know
The way you looking I can tell you wanna go
Skip the preview and lets get to the show

My baby she kick it, she cool with all the fellas, she hood
Like taking chances but classy like Cinderella
She down like four flats, my baby girl is real, 
She done weathered the storm and baby down with you still

[Chorus]

Now we at home and were all alone
With no interruptions just turn off you phone
Daddy's little girl but now that your all grown
Birthday suit is all you got on
Got the radio on and its playing your song
Touching on your body all night long
Feels so right that it cant be wrong
Sexual healing coming on strong

Them curves like a coke bottle cant be beat
Pedicure every week on them cute little feet
She a freak under the covers but she keep it discrete
She's my midnight treat baby for real that's why I remain

[Chorus]

She shaped like an hour glass
Flier than a mockingbird
Baby got that smooth skin softer than some fox fur
We go together like sweaters in cold weather
Nobody can do it better baby down for whatever
She gangsta like lil' Kim sexy like Alicia Keys
Funny like smoore baby cooler than a summer breeze
Man I swear my baby cuter than a teddy bear, nobody compares
Lil' mama baby that's why I am your man

Pop that thang baby, shake watcha got
Yeah, you workin' with a lot, baby, please don't stop
Gotcha body lookin' hot, don't mind if I watch
Ya head is top notch, ya skin is butterscotch

Into the club, all eyes on you
Baby you look good, you're thicker than stew
You got friends, boo? Well, I got mine, too
The club closed at two, can I roll with you?

You hip like MK, hood like Mary J, pretty as Lisa Raye
Baby, can we play?
I call you lemon drop 'cause you look so sweet
Gon' pop what you got baby, be my freak, come on

Keep the bottle pourin' 'til we need a submarine
When she off caffeine, baby girl you're so active
Strong as a mattress, grab on my package

Go-go boots from the stage to the cage
California wild fire, hot in a rage
Check her Facebook page, video upload
My number one hina, so damn throw, so damn cold

Candy-coated like Skittles
I'm a pop that like I pop two thizzles
Girl, get your smash on, sweet and low so tender

Paul Wall,"(Intro)
Take a look at me.
Take a look at me now.
Take a look.


(Verse 1)
Once upon a time, not too long ago
Down in the great state of Texas where we live life slow
I was born amongst poverty, I had no dough
Motivated by a dream with some hustle and flow
My paper was never long but my ambition was strong
Followin Gods path, I could never go wrong
I took a road less traveled and I got a few scrapes
But the journey was all worth it just to get that cake
Mama told me I would make it, some fools just laughed
But I remembered how The Bible say ""The first shall be last.""
And even thought all the teams skipped over me in the draft
I ignored all the haters and perfected my craft
Times change, and nowadays to me it seem funny
The same people hatin, callin me up to borrow money
But I hold no grudge, I just forgave and forgot
I guess that's the reason I made it to the top
Take a look at me now...

(Hook)
Haters said that I would never get this paper
But Ima see my money regardless
Got the soul of a hustla
When it comes to gettin my bread...
...Im heartless
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now


(verse 2)
",Look at Me Now,2009
Paul Wall,"(Paul Wall 1st Verse)
When you up, you up
And when you down, you down
But when you fall off
Just peep out who still come around
And ain't too many gon' hold you down
When you down and not on ya luck
But ima be right by your side
Even when that road get rough
I keep it cool when the streetz iz hott
And all your friends that soon forgot
They leavin you all alone to rott
But I'll be there till you back on top
I'm down wit ya wit no strings
No matter what, one hundred I'm willin to feed
I'm gettin that paper to feed my krew
And no matter what you goin through
I'm stayin true...

(Chorus)
(Z-Ro)
I know you been searchin for someone
To keep it one hundred
So tired of mixed love and bullshit
And keep keepin it comin
Damn right he came up from nothin
But now he's got money
And he's feedin his people
And now ain't one of 'em gon' ever go hungry

(Z-ro 2nd Verse)
Uhh...
I represent Mo' City until the day I die
I speak the truth even when I say a lie
Even lil babys know better than to play with I
Would be to lost and never found to say bye bye
Ya'll already know I got a lot of evil in me
But I got a lot of that love shit too
'cause I promise I'm in love with my ride
And I'm in love with what its sittin on
Bitch and my paints so blue
Thanks to Paul Wall
You already know I got love for ya bro
My cup empty yo cup
If you less pour some mo
My nigga T-faris and J-dawg
And even my old school nigga Fuck
When they show us hate
We gon' show 'em back love
Now but last year would've been a different scene
But ima let you make it 
'cause I'm really tryna keep it one hundred
So stay the fuck away from me please!

(Chorus)
I know you been searchin for someone
To keep it one hundred
So tired of mixed love and bullshit
And keep keepin it comin
Damn right he came up from nothin
But now he's got money
And he's feedin his people
And now ain't one of 'em gon' ever go hungry

(Yung Redd Verse 3)
Homie I'm different like a alien
Driven in that mothership
Its black its midnight
I'm sittin high up on that numbers list
Went from all this paper rain but now I'm never drowsy
They talk but I can't even hear the way 
They wisper 'bout me
Even if they doubt me haters I'm off limits
Blowin cake
Ohh yea I make desert for a livin
So many times I swear I spare my last one hundred
Like a grade in the class
Now that's extra credit

(Chorus)
I know you been searchin for someone
To keep it one hundred
So tired of mixed love and bullshit
And keep keepin it comin
Damn right he came up from nothin
But now he's got money
And he's feedin his people
And now ain't one of 'em gon' ever go hungry

Cologne Kush and henny, I'm gone in that hemi

When I grow up I wanna be like t-pain a hit man
But do yourself a favor partna don't be talkin shit man

Stacking my chips I got a bank full of doritos
I'm too cool for school so I'm teaching a class
Chiefin on that purple rain partna puff puff pass
See I'm higher than the price of gas gone off vanilla cream
Rolling off of mac dre leaning like a triple beam
I got my wrist froze up like computer screens
So fresh so clean exhale sticky green
I got the top steady droppin like record sales
Paint changing colors like Tyra bank's finger nails
Choose the fast life I'm the flashy type
Diamonds in my mouth sparkle look like sprite

Somewhere in the club with my clothes smelling loud
And never will I smile 'cause I be biting down
Rollin off a p probably muggin with a frown
But naw ain't nothing wrong how could he be on rich
Bitch looked at my whip bitch looked at my wrist
My wrist is tricked in ice my neck is dripped in ice
Bitch look at my life don't you wanna be my wife?
Would you like to be my girl? don't you wanna change your life?
I can change your life grab the credit card and swipe, like see?

In my life, a lot of haters talking shit
And I might, expose you hoes you out this bitch
And I ride, with the nine I won't fall or slip
If I die, they still will not get off my dick
But I try, to survive like Destiny's Child
And I smile, cause they been trying to test me a while
But I cry, cause not all my partnas alive
But I smile, cause I know all my partnas with God
In my life, a lot of haters baller blocking my shine
I stay calm, even though I ought to drop em a nine
In my life, I make cash using hoes
And my Sprite, is purple so I'm moving slow
On my side, my dogs moving rocks and hay
And I slide, by how I'm chopping blades
When I drive, I got a big cup of syrup
When I glide, I ride with a couple birds
In my life, I feel like I stand alone
But you still wouldn't leave, out of San Anton'
When I die, don't cry get high for me
So you can feel, like you flying in the sky with me

In my life, I went from a straw hat to a crown
I been through a few up's, and a whole lot of downs
I take the good with the bad, however the ball bounce
And lately, I've been walking on dangerous ground
It feels like my own partnas, don't want me around
Cause everybody in my crew, be trying to argue me down
They telling me I changed, and I'm not the same
But for the past three years, I've been saying the same thang
I've done a lot of dirt, but I don't brag about it
And since I don't rap about it, you don't know jack about it
People see me being friendly, and they think they know me
But just cause I shake your hand, don't mean you my homie
I got a personality complex, man I'm so complex
But if you come with plex, this ain't fun plex
I'm walking straight, but my mind's in a maze
The only thing that I'm afraid of, is being afraid
I done stared death in the face, I ain't budge one inch
He here beating up myself, and I still don't flinch
Somebody pinch me, I hope I'm dreaming
I'm searching inside my heart, trying to find the meaning of my life

[Chorus]

Y'all don't know shit, about my life
It ain't all about the hoes, gold and ice
I go from down to up, up to down
In a blink of an eye, smiles turn to frowns
Kings get crowned, the rich get rich
Where everybody live, screaming life is a bitch
I ball in the mix, and keep to myself
I don't just wanna be, another book on the shelf
A lot of y'all fakers, faking the game
I'm one of the real niggaz, that's bringing the pain
I've seen hard times, so I spit hard rhymes
I've been around, different people of all kinds
And to this day, I got a few riddle friends
Too many of y'all, that's so fake and pretend
To be what you not, that's why you get got
Don't fuck with my life, that's all that I got

My life-my life-my life-my life, is all I got
Fuck with my life-my life-my life-my life, and you will get dropped

The mind of a g
I'm out here gettin' my paper
So don't fuck wit me

I wake up in the morning when the sun rise
I got my mind on paper chasing them dollar signs
It ain't no time for resting or taking naps
I got to have something so I'm counting all paper stacks
I got dreams and aspirations of ballin' big
I want a crib in the hills out there where kobe live
And I can get it if I put my grind to it
Quit making excuses up and get out there and do it
Ain't no time for games when your chasing after change
But you can face some cause that paper and close range
My mind on a range fly chains and diamonds rings
My skills are making bills with profit and high game
Ridin' the fast lane that paper in my vision
My mind on a mil ticket I'm chasing that commission
Money is my mission give me all I can get
Until they put me in a grave man I just cant quit

I got the heart of a hustler

So don't fuck wit me

Don't fuck around man

That's right doin' and moving
White linen on my tuff tails
Not an illusion three sheets to the wind
I ain't gotta be boozen go bad on a bitch
Til I got her improvment no I'm not wit the loosing
I'm dying to win I'm goin' try it again I'm goin' cry for my sins
I live the fast life yeah and I'm not stoppin'
For shit bitch half a tank of crank and a plot to get rich
I got money out my mind likes its a price out my hat

Still smokin' even though my lung twice to collapse
I'm right back with the sack then I'm burning the shern
You know
Better learn still yernin' to earn
And really I don't listen when I talk to myself
So how the fuck you think that I'mma listen to somebody else
Its a fast life ho you know like pushin' and shit and when I run up out of gas then I'm pushin this bitch

I got heart of a hustler
I got the mind of a g
I'm out here gettin' my paper
So don't fuck wit me

I grind hard from the second I awake
When you play wit high stakes you profit at high rate
No more top roman I'm tryin' to eat steaks
So I get up off my bump and go get that cake
It ain't no time for sleep
If you snooze you loose if you broke it mean your lazy
That's the choice you choose
If you grind and you complaining and you wastin' your time
Better correct your mind suck it up and go grind
Its money to be made when my phone ring ring
I'm not to impressed wit all the bling bling
I'm much more motivated by all the ching ching
Been grindin' since kidagarden back then it was a dream
Its money over everything family first
They goin' to bury me a g and boast swangas on the hurst
I'm on the block posted making money disperse I thirst for dollar bills bein' broke is the worst

Beans and corn bread just bought around another damn grand

Who the hell been puttin' they lips on my drink

Maybe some red bull will help me sober up
Matter fact mix it wit this grey goose in my cup

Paul Wall,"I deserve to play, it's been a few days, ain't showed it all
I go outside and breathe, roll down my sleeves and have a ball
Still got these bills to pay and a family, I'm workin' hard
But I got a life too, so I throw on my shoes and I live it y'all

I'm fresher than a peppermint and cold as a cough
When I pull up in that foreign and I break boys off
Super ballin' is a product of a hard knock life
No more Ramen noodle spread, no more struggle and strife
From a Buick to a Beamer, ambitions of a dreamer
Motivated by Mob Figgaz and Andre Nickatina
I'm gettin' paper while you're in the shade drinkin Zima
I'm a schemer, you just waitin' on your check from FEMA
Been evadin' the subpoena to appear in court
Different hustle every season like I'm playin' a sport
""Life is too short, wouldn't you agree?""
See, the best time I ever had in my life was free
My best friend wasn't real, he came with a fee
Reduced time for your sentence come with a plea
Livin' in the free world and I'm blessed
Paper chasin' is my quest, I grind with no rest

I deserve to play, it's been a few days, ain't showed it all

Still got these bills to pay and a family, I'm workin' hard
But I got a life too, so I throw on my shoes and I live it y'all

I'm not a actor, a role model with soul or clapper
I work hard, a good gangsta nigga, blow a stack up
Time still movin' and shit, stay on the grind, it's just excuses
Girls lookin' at you, you useless (word?)
When everything is wrong, it look like it'll fall
I'm on the job, feet first with direction and all
I like coca and then gotta come home and stroke her
Take time, clean my rims and go lock' her
Just wanna lay up, damn
I need two minutes to rest, go 'head and take the Lex' out, scram
Then it's beef in the jump off, 'cause I needed one off
It's like you drew your gun on me in a gun off
Shit won't change, so move with it (move with it)
This is my life, I'm only livin' it, so don't go and ruin it
Words from a legend, keep your dome up in the sky

Dear Mr. President, have you seen FEMA?
Have you seen the lower 9th Ward, post Katrina?
Niggas scufflin' tryin' to find something tangible
The MP's is treatin' all the youth like animals
Then wonder why the cops gettin rocked like Mosley
Why niggas on the TV in the spot like cozy
Now Houston got a problem, Atlanta got a problem
Dallas, Alabama and Miami got a problem
Niggas wildin' out, livin' free, yellin' sovereign
.38 revolvin', crack rock ballin'
Tats on they face that say Uptown New Orleans
Blastin' on sight, fuck fightin', fuck arguin'
Meanwhile boat loads of cash go to Israel
Soldiers in Iraq pray to God for a miracle
Sam Cooke said that change was comin'
If not, you can bet your ass, danger's comin'

I deserve to play, it's been a few days, ain't showed it all

See im higher than the price of gas gone off vanilla cream
Rolling off of mac Dre leaning like a triple beam
I got my wrist froze up like computer screens
So fresh so clean exhale sticky green
I got the top steady droppin' like record sales
Paint changing colors like Tyra bank's finger nails
Choose the fast life I'm the flashy type
Diamonds in my mouth sparkle look like sprite
I'm so high

Someones sleeping on the scene
That's a hell of a dream I'm a hell of a guy
That's a hell of a blunt fire it up lets get high
You can call me g5 cause I be in the clouds
Somewhere in the club with my clothes smelling loud
And never will I smile cuz I be biting down
Rollin off a p probably muggin' with a frown
But naw ain't nothing wrong how could he be on rich
Bitch looked at my whip bitch looked at my wrist
My wrist is tricked in ice my neck is dripped in ice
Bitch look at my life don't you wanna be my wife?
Would you like to be my girl? dont you wanna change your life?
I can change your life grab the credit card and swipe, like see?

It's the Houston Hard Hitter out the 713, 
It's ""The People's Champ,"" Paul Wall, yeah that's me.
Come take a ride with a playa out the 'Lone Star State'.
I'm just a hustler on the grind known for gettin' that cake.
I came up from the bottom, now I reside at the top.
I used to run away from cops, but now it's benzes I cop.
I used to post up on the block like Yao Ming in the paint,
But now I pimp the parkin' lot, drivin' slow n sippin' drank.
With Ashanti on my side as I glide like Clyde, 
And nothin' less than 24 inches of chrome on my ride.
It's just somethin' bout the way I tip 4's 
And grip grain and got these boppers on the sidelines goin insane.
I got 'em moanin', my mackin' game is outta
Control, but I don't know if it's my looks or my big bank roll.
I'm 24 years old with my mouth all gold, 
My games cold and now the stories been told.
It's Paul Wall, baby (baby).

See I don't know why (why)
I'm feelin' just the way I do (do)
It's been a long time (time)
I thought that I was over you, but now you're coming around again
I'll be remembering what you said
I just can't take it, and I don't wanna go back, oh no.

What is a girl to do, if she's still on it, yes
If she done been there before with you, and now she don't want it, yeah
We've spent time and time again.
I just wish this thing would end.
Tell me, what is a girl to do, if she's still on it.

Whenever we talk (talk)
It feels like we had somethin' strong (strong)
And knowin' it's wrong, we tried to do this thing before,

I'm 59/50 authenic.
Tilted with that NY on it.
There's money to be made, and I want it.
See, my palm been itchin' for the longest, so scratch that, paper like NASDAQ.
We laughed that life, roll the dice, get the cash back, I'm nice.
Plus, I got the juice, so I goes well with ice.

So I'm not only the boss, but homie I'm also the one that own it
I own it, in A-T-L with that bonus, I gotta a super broad that will blow me
And I'm not about to wait for not a dollar if you owe me
The double cup is lonely, so pour some of that juice
I'm leanin' tough, that ain't enough, I need at least a deuce
These tricks about to get loose, get loose
A bad bitch to the roots, I'm papered up she tatted down, my waistline to her boots
I'm on one or two, but I'm a need me a few
I'm gone off in bananas like gorillas in the zoo
Don't worry if I run out, I keep something in my shoe
And the broad riding with me, ready to blow some

I need drugs in my life like right now
Some oil in my cup like right now
I need kush in my blunt, like right now
A bad bitch that could f-ck, like right now
Right now, right now, right now
I don't want a later, give it to me right now! 
I'm on it and I know it, I ain't afraid to show it

You about that shit, then take that off
Fake ass niggas gotta lay down
Reppin' H-Town, now a nigga can't play that off
Niggas came down to the city, stole from the city
Hoes from the city like ""play that song""
These rap niggas know I'm the new nigga
But no nigga gotta put Kirko on
Bitches know I'm 'bout it, man
Love the way that I swang that chrome
I be all in her body man
Every bitch that I fuck, I own
Uh, while you be tryna marry the bitch
Ain't tryna burn, but this money I'm tryna bury quick

Ooh, I'm sippin' on that purple stuff
Ho, I ain't 'bout to pour you up
Ooh, I'm sippin' on that purple stuff
Nigga, I ain't 'bout to pour you up

When I hold my cup up, it's just like lifting weights
Look like I'm chewin' instead of sippin' because this is an 8
I don't want no soda, homie, I'd rather sip it straight
I'm an OG out that screwed up clique
King of the Ghetto, this is my name
I be rollin' on swangers with candy black paint on 'em
If it rain, still ain't gon' get a stain on 'em
I'm from Texas, you can tell how I talk
I'm from Texas, you can tell how I walk
Six-piece wing dinner from Frenchy's
King of the ghetto, ain't never been friendly
Just put eleven more ounces in me
Whenever you see me, my cup ain't empty
So many fifteens, so many twelves, so many 6-5-9s
I'm bangin' so hard, everybody else bangin'
But I don't give a fuck if they park by mine
I've got a thunder trunk
I keep coughin' cause I smoke thunder skunk
I've got the lightning dick, I need thunder cunt
And I dare any one of y'all niggas to mess with Texas
Texas gon' fuck you up

Say shout out to them Texas niggas, Texas niggas
I do this shit for Texas, nigga

First they steal your lighter, then they steal your style
Fat Pat is my idol, I've got twenty bands on my smile
Forgot to pay they homage, they just reuse and recycle
Man, they lie so much that they don't know the truth
But they'll swear to God on the Bible
I don't know where they do that at
But it damn sure ain't in Texas
Ridin' in the 'Lac down 45, I-10 is my exit
I do this shit for the city, swangin'
I've got wood grain in my Leffries
Pimp C is the greatest
Motherfucker, talkin' down is a death wish
Codeine is my fetish, pourin' up is a way of life
Legend stealer, Jerome Bettis
You punk sipper ain't drakin' it right
8 or all, that's a day in the life
Open trunk, and array of lights
They used to say this was local shit
Now everywhere drinkin' muddy Sprite
Pour up

And everywhere I look they pourin' up now
Say shout out to them Texas niggas, Texas niggas

I rep for Texas, nigga
You gon' respect us, nigga
We got ya sippin' out them white cups like Texas niggas
Got ya shinin' diamond grills like them Texas niggas
Rappers screwed up and chopped like them Texas niggas
You get the message, nigga? So chop some checks up with us
Them broads be tryna get us, cause they know we them niggas
She love my Texas swag, and how I keep it G
Let her roll in the slab, she wanna be seen with me
I tell her pay that fee, it's pimpin' with me, mane

Paul Wall,"[Chorus]
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby

March 11, 1981
My momma gave birth to a hell raising heavenly son
And my daddy was a fool addicted to brown
So he wasn't ever around, but my momma held me down

When me and big sister had nothing to eat
My momma gave up her last trying to make ends meet
She was a school teacher, working to provide for her fam'
Struggling in AA, to submit to gods plan

Them long twelve's steps of hardway are all on your own
No family, few friends, my momma was all alone
She did it for her children, struggling to make a living
And some how we still had food on thanksgiving

When I can barely talk momma taught me to pray
And right then I knew that we'd have a better life some day
She still give up her last just to see me smile
That's the definition of love for you child, I love my momma

[Chorus]

My momma was my role model, I had no father figure
Just a bunch of pipe dreams of being richer
But as times got tougher my life just got rougher
It hurts so bad to see me watch my momma suffer

Its so hard to cope when you so dead broke
So momma used to make me memorize the song quotes
In the middle of a session momma gave god praise
I knew what it meant to struggle at such an early age

Remember them days she barely earned minimum wage
But made sure I had new cloths to start the seventh grade
She met my step father, and walked down the aisle
I praised he sent somebody that would make my momma smile

He raised me as his own, he taught me to be a man
Adopted me and Anne, and gave momma a hand
I just love to see that beautiful smile on momma face
My momma could never be replaced, I love my momma

[Chorus]

20 years of struggling, done came to a close
No more old, torn up, and hand me down cloths
She deserve the best, and never nothing less
No stress, give my momma that Gucci dress

The times were hard but we done made it out the rain
The storm was severe but we overcame the hurricane
Them rainy days seem to last so long
When them times got hard my momma told me be strong

My number 1 supporter ever since day one
And still till this day momma would die for her son
No more slumz, all them rainy days are done
No a days we taking trips to Disney world just for fun

I put you in a Benz take you out that nova
Its been a long rough road, but that bumpy rides over
You raise me from a baby, my number 1 lady
And until the day I'm in my grave, ima stay mommas baby

[Chorus]",25 Lighta's,2014

So clean top off, looking good
Still comin' down tippin' fours through the hood
Whipping on the wood in that cocaine Mulsanne
Could buy another Mulsanne if I sold my chain
Old school Y-frame seven coats of the gloss
Thugga been the boss since I left Swisha House
Break 'em off, talk Texas, dry slabs reckless
Wake up everyday to bad bitches and breakfast
Boss Life, better get your money right
Me and RiFF RaFF pouring fours in the Sprite
With your bitch, burning bowls after light

Roll though your city smelling like a thunderstorm
Teleport to Prom, python on my arm

Call like inform, I'm crawling like a baby
Pop trunk on Antoine, I let it down in Katy
The candy grey Mercedes, I sold it at an auction
Rap Game Sadie Hawkins, got a ticket for jay-walking
If I had a option, I'd pick all of the above
Oriental rugs and I'm flier than a dove
You could show me love, or you can get lost
Four-story houses, I recline on Prada couch
Shark grill in mouth, better watch your language
Paul Wall and Johnny got me frozen like a penguin
Colder than a polar, Jody Husky sandals
Slide down 45 in the black licorice Lambo

Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss

Show you how to be the man, show you how to be the man

I show you how to get muddy on sunny day
Drop a soma in your soda if you want to play
Pour a four in a twenty like a shot clock
48 for the watch, hundred dollar socks
Getting money is an understatement
I pay the Corvette for the matching bracelet
Half a million worth of jewelry, it's high maintenance
Even full of more meds than a cancer patient
I could show you how to grind like a brake pad
I got a hundred acre island with a helipad
No key, start the car with an iPad
Drink stains on my shirt is the new fad
Shit don't stink, underwear made of mink
Big Moe, purple soda, ain't never pink
Have you ever mixed a two-liter with the pint?
I could show you how to drink 'till you faint

Show you how to be the man, how to be the boss
How to come through with seven coats of the gloss

Dimepiece wanna rub my nut
Strapped with a rubber, no glove, no love

Pour codeine all over your chest

Tell these hoes that I ain't really 'bout that drama

Paul Weller,"A hazy mist hung down the street
The length of it's mile,
As far as my eye could see
The sky so wide, the houses tall
Or so they seemed to be,
So they seemed to me so small,
And it gleamed in the distance
And it shone like the sun,
Like silver and gold, it went on and on.

The summer nights that seemed so long
Always call me back to return,
As I re-write this song

The ghosts of night, the dreams of day
Make me swirl and fall and hold me in their sway,
And it's still in the distance
And it shines like the sun,
Like silver and gold, it goes on and on.

Amber lights flashing 'cross the street
And on the corner a dream to meet,
Going on and on.

Paul Weller,"Autumn blew its leaves at me,
Threatening winter as I walked
Summer always goes so quick, barely stopping like my thoughts
Which dip and spin and change so fast
I have to wonder, will I last

Through the windows of the train,
I caught reflections of a paper cup,
Hanging small in a pale blue sky,
Never knowing which way's up

Above the clouds, what's to be found,
I have to wonder, will I be around
As my anger shouts, at my own self doubt,
So a sadness creeps, into my dreams
When you're scared of living but afraid to die
I get scared of giving and I must find the faith to beat it

I must be me that's rushing by,
Time just lingers on the wind.
Bristlin' through my open fears,
I wonder what it's going to bring

Above the clouds, what's to be found,
I have to wonder, will I be around

Run and hide, run and hide
I catch the sail at evening's tide",Above the Clouds,

Beauty must have power over man, war

After the end of the war I want to devote myself
To my thoughts for five to ten years and to writing them down
War has caused unrest among the younger generation
Induction then destruction, who wants to die?
Wars come and go what remains are only the values of culture

Then of course there is revolutionary love
Love of comrades fighting for the people and love of people
Not an abstract people but people one meets and works with
When Che Guevara taught of love being
At the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both

For people like Che or George Jackson or Malcolm X
Love was the prime mover of their struggle
That love cost them their lives, love coupled with a man's pride
Love coupled with a man's pride
Give it to you on top, now

War, means tears to thousands of mothers how
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives

Paul Weller,"It's no good praying to the powers that be
'cause they won't shake the roots of the money tree
No good praying to the pristine alters
Waiting for the blessing with holy water
They like the same old wealth in the same old hands
Means the same old people stay old people stay in command
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
They got it wrapped up tight, they got it safe and sound
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
As you fall from grace and hit the ground

Too much money in too few places
Only puts a smile on particular faces
Said too much power in not enough hands
Makes me think ""get rich quick; take all I can""
They're too busy spending on the means of destruction
To ever spend a penny on some real construction

Watch the money-go-round; watch the money-go-round
They amuse themselves as they fool around
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
Do like they say, make them vulnerable

No good looking to the empire corners,
""civilization"" built on slaughter
Carrying hopes and carrying maps
The spineless ones fall in their laps
The brave and the bold are the ones to be fooled
With a diet of lies by the Kipling school

Watch your money-go-round, watch your money-go-round
But I just can't help being cynical
Watch your money-go-round, watch your money-go-round
Do like I say, make me wonderful

Their morals are clean and their clear
They bend your arm and they bend your ear
Said they bend your mind as you talk in circles
Bend over forwards, this won't hurt you
Till there's blood in your lap, blood on your hands
Watch the money-go-round, watch the money-go-round
Come spend a penny, go out with a pound
Watch the money-go-round, watch the money-go-round
As you fall from grace and hit the ground

(on the money-go-round, you wanna get on but it won't slow down)

The need your votes and you know where to send 'em
Be we don't get the choice of a public referendum
On all the real issues that affect our lives
Like the usa base to which we play midwife
Take a cruise and forget this scene
Said come back later when the slates wiped clean

Watch your money-go-round, watch your money-go-round
Born of woman, killed by man
Watch the money-go-round, watch your money-go-round
Do like they pray, make it wonderful

The good and righteous sing their hymns
The crimpoline dresses who have no sins
Christians by day, killers in war
The hypocrites who know what they're fighting for
Killing for peace, freedom and truth
But they're too old to go so they send the youth

Paul Weller,"Daylight turns to moonlight, and Im at my best
Praising the way it all works, gazing upon the rest
The cool before the warm
The calm after the storm
I wish to stay forever, letting this be my food
But Im caught up in a whirlwind and my ever changing moods
Bitter turns to sugar, some call a passive tune
But the day things turn sweet, for me wont be too soon
The hush before the silence
The winds after the blast
I wish wed move together, this time the bosses sued
But were caught up in the wilderness and an ever changing mood
Teardrops turn to children, who've never had the time
To commit the sins they pay for through, anothers evil mind
The love after the hate
The love we leave too late
I wish wed wake up one day, an everyone feel moved
But were caught up in the dailies and an ever changing mood

Evil turns to statues, and masses form a line
But I know which way Id run to if the choice was mine
The past is knowledge, the present our mistake
And the future we always leave too late
I wish wed come to our senses and see there is no truth
In those who promote the confusion for this ever changing mood",My Ever Changing Moods,1995

Like you always said you would
Or has time re-written everything
Like you never dreamt it could

On a magic carpet ride
Well forever seems a long time
Cutting us down in size
No matter how hard we try

And I could see all I had done
Just chasing dreams across the fields
In the shadow of the sun

I plan to have it all while I'm still young
And chase the fields across my dreams
In the shadow of the sun
In the shadow of the sun

Once upon a time I might have told you
But now nothing seems that plain
However much we're changing
There are some things the same

We have no future - we have no past
I write this now while I'm in control
I'll choose the words and how the melody goes -

Along winding streets, we walked hand in hand
And how I long for that sharp wind
To take my breath away again
I'd run my fingers through your hair
Hair like a wheat field, I'd run through
That I'd run through 

And I miss you so I miss you so
No you're gone, I feel so alone
I miss you so

I'd send you a flower a sunflower bright
While you cloud my days, messing up my nights

And all the way up to the top of your head
Sunshower kisses, I felt we had

And I miss you so I miss you so
All I gotta do, is think of you and I miss you so

Baby I'm afraid to say why I miss you so",Sunflower,1995
Paul Weller,"A police car and a screaming siren,
A pneumatic drill and ripped up concrete,
A baby wailing and stray dog howling,
The screech of brakes and lamplight's blinking

That's entertainment.

That's entertainment.

A smash of glass and the rumble of boots,
An electric train and a ripped up 'phone booth,
Paint spattered walls and the cry of a tomcat,
Lights going out and a kick in the balls

I say that's entertainment.

That's entertainment.

Days of speed and slow time Mondays,
Pissing down with rain on a boring Wednesday,
Watching the news and not eating your tea,
A freezing cold flat and damp on the walls

I say that's entertainment.

That's entertainment.

Waking up at 6 a.m. on a cool warm morning,
Opening the windows and breathing in petrol,
An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard,
Watching the tele and thinking about your holidays, 

That's entertainment.

That's entertainment.

Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes,
Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume,
A hot summers' day and sticky black tarmac,
Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were faraway

That's entertainment.

That's entertainment.

Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude,
Getting a cab and traveling on buses,
Reading the graffiti about slashed seat affairs

Paul Weller,"Better stop dreaming of the quiet life,
Cause it's one you'll never know
And quit running for that runaway bus,
Cos their rosey days are few
And, stop apologizing for the things you've never done;
Cause time is short and life is cruel,
But it's up to us to change
This town called malice.

Rows and rows of disused milk
Stand dying in the dairy yard
And a hundred lonely housewives clutch empty milk
Bottles to their hearts
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
It's enough to make you stop believing when tears come
Fast and furious
In a town called malice.

Struggle after struggle, year after year
That atmosphere's a fine blend of ice,
I'm almost stone cold dead
In a town called malice

A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef
Gets dashed against the co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kid's new gear
It's a big decision in a town called malice

The ghost of a steam train, echoes down my track
It's at the moment bound for nowhere,
Just going round and round
Playground kids and creaking swings,
Lost laughter in the breeze
I could go on for hours and I probably will,
But I'd sooner put some joy back
In this town called malice.",Town Called Malice,1995
Paul Weller,"I took a trip down boundary lane
Try an' find myself again
At least a part I left somewhere
Buried under a hedgerow near

A lazy bridge on a hot afternoon
Water glistening while it plays a tune
Cloudburst on a rainy day
Wiping all my sleep away

Uh huh oh yeah, uh huh oh yeah
Always there to confuse and fool you

And in my mind I saw the place
As each memory returned to trace
Dear Reminders of who I am
The very roots upon which I stand

And there they were for all to see
My long, lost, used-to-be's
And all the dreams I had to dream
Were really something, not make believe

Over our heads but far enough to see
A bomb exploding in another town
Children choking on a poison cloud
While on the streets, where lovers once walked, 
Side by side in idle talk
Bullets fall like unholy rain
People change as the panic sets in,
A frightened baby by her dead mother's side
In a brutal world where there's nowhere 
To run, hide or cry

Now nothing feels the same way,
Feels like it's changing again,
Upon a street with no name
It's hard to find it again

I ran as fast as my feet could fly
Down country lanes where I took my time-
Time like a hound snapping at my heels
I got past thinking so I could feel,
Feels like a film playing in my head
And I kept rolling down green Surrey hills,
In Spring

Now nothing feels the same way 
Feels like I'm changing again

To bow down forth and face their fate.
Oh it's easy. So, so easy.

All righteousness they build thy arrow,
To shoot it straight into their lies.
Who would expect the might sparrow
Could rid the world of all their kind?
Rising up and taking back
The property of ev'ry man.
It's so easy.
So, so easy.

As each memory returned to trace
Dear reminders of who I am

With nothing but liars and thieves

His rusty armour so undervalued

Written there in steam
In the heat of the moment
At the birth of a dream

In the fleeting minutes after

Come and go, you know, where the wind blows

An' though I couldn't define
I can only tell you that I
Got a heavy soul
Tuesdays dressed in shearling
Anchored on belief
In the sunlight on the water
Or rain upon a leaf
And I'm touched by its' beauty
And I hope to touch you too
'cause I still seek the same things
That I once sought to be true
And you know, that where the wind blows
Tho' I wouldn't be lying, when I tell you that I
Got a heavy soul

I've got a heavy soul

Paul Weller,"You got your magic touch
And you know so much
It must be easy for you
To turn me into gold

You got a pretty strong hand
Backed up with your talisman
That hangs from your neck
You mind that, you don't show

You got the keys to the city
But you'll find no place to stay
'Cause for all your talk
You still got nothing to say

And your talisman
Like the wind blows sand
Must fly away

Here's a turn to move
And half the world will give you too
Oh, caught up in your gravity issues

Just to leave us with
Ridin' to the fields we shared
Ah, takin' us closer, closer
To our groove

As you look to the skies
With empty eyes and say
I've got the gift of the world
But I still don't understand

And my talisman
Like the wind blows sand
Must fly away

As you look to the skies
With empty eyes and say
I've got the gift of the world
And I still don't understand

He's got the light of the world
But still can't see his way
As he's ready to fight
But there's nothing left to slay

And your talisman
Like the wind blows sand
Must fly away

Who am i, to justify
All the evil in our eye
When I myself, feel the high
From all that I despise
Behind the jail or in the grave
I have to lay, in this bed I made
If I die, before I wake
Hope the Lord don't hesitate

Get 2 heaven, went through hell
Tell my peeps, all is well
All them fools, whose soul's 4 sale
Sitting next to the Jezebel
Demons screaming, in my ear
All my anger, all my fear
If I holler, let them hear

Apocalypse, ain't no doubt
Everybody's ho'ing out, all the loot all the clout

Do or die
Only the vengeance, will pacify
Watch your back

It's just us
Ashes 2 ashes
Dust 2 dust

2 choose in which, God we trust

With eighty five, dumb and blind
There can be no compromise

When there’s so much to see
So much to be

Day up and the grasses hiss
Get up! Like sweet lips they kiss
See now that you’re part of it
I forget sometimes
That’s always been here

And these leafy mysteries
Have always been and always will
And in the shady trees I swing
And in the dappled orchard’s heat
Where I lie and wait
Wait for the breeze
To hunger me
Wait for the trees
To breathe in to me",Leafy Mysteries [DVD],2004

While all the women came and went

A wild cat did growl
Two riders were approachin

In the early morning rain
With a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home
Lord, I miss my loved ones so
In the early morning rain
With no place to go

Out on runway number nine
Seven-O-seven set to go
But I'm stuck here on the ground
Where the cold wind blows
Now the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
She'll be rolling down at last

Hear the mighty engines roar

See the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound
Far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home
In about three hours time

So the airports got me down
It's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground
Bored and drunk as I can be
You can't jump a jet plane
Like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way

Safe yet curious

When you bring back the funk y'all

Some magic too

Just how high the moon
It was something bright and fine
And in time
Became the world
It would shed stars and bars
All kinds of hearts
Were together again

When you bring back the funk y'all

When you bring back the funk y'all

When you learn to cry

And a flag to fly to hide behind

Cos it's the one we'll never know
And quit running for that runaway bus 
'Cause those Rosey days are few
And stop apologizing for the things you've never done
'Cause time is short and life is cruel, but it's up to us to change 
This town called malice. 

Rows and rows of disused milk floats stand dying in the dairy yard
And a hundred lonely housewives clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
It's enough to make you stop believing when tears come fast and furious
In a town called malice. 

Struggle after struggle, year after year
The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice, I'm almost stone cold dead
In a town called malice. 

A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef gets dashed against the Co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kids new gear
It's a big decision in a town called malice. 

The ghost of a steam train, echoes down my track
It's at the moment bound for nowhere, just going round and round
Playground kids and creaking swings, lost laughter in the breeze
I could go on for hours and I probably will, but I'd sooner put some joy back

There was a time, there was
When the brightest half of the sky
Let us know we were loved
And there was a feeling old and gold

And beautiful

Safe yet curious

Slip up and slide
When you bring back the funk y'all
With no place left to hide
No place left to hide

When not only the wind in our sails
Some magic too
Sometimes we forget
Just how high the moon
It was something bright and fine
And in time
Became the world
It would shed stars and bars
All kinds of hearts
Were together again

Slip up and slide
When you bring back the funk y'all
With no place left to hide
When you bring back the funk y'all
Slip up and slide
When you bring back the funk y'all
With no place left to hide
No place left to hide

When you learn to speak
Whenever you want or need
When you learn to cry
When it passes you by

It is something, something to me now
It is something, something to me now
Give me something, something to me now

Once upon a dream
In the midnight hour
There was nothing like scene
And we thank the crowd
Now its a feeling tame and small
And though it all
I'll look for word
Just one more night exists
Just what if
We dreamt for all

I'm the changing man, waiting for the bang,

Etched forever as a moment we'd remember
And we'd remember

The empty woods where we played
Every hour of every day
The holidays went on forever

And in the woods was a soldier's tomb
The ghost of which looked over you
And God was there amongst the trees

And every night and every day

The noise flows me along, as I catch falling cans
Of baked beans on toast, technology is the most

And everyone seems just like me,
They struggle hard to set themselves free
And their waiting for the change

When I'm in the crowd, I can't remember my name
And my only link is a pint of walls ice cream
When I'm in the crowd - I don't see anything

Sometimes I think that its a plot
An equilibrium melting pot
The government sponsors underhand
When I'm in the crowd
When I'm in the crowd
When I'm in the crowd

And everyone seems that they're acting a dream
Cause they're just not thinking about each other
And they're taking orders, which are media spawned
And they should know better, now you have been warned

And don't forget you saw it here first
When I'm in the crowd
When I'm in the crowd
When I'm in the crowd

And life just simply moves along
In simple houses, simple jobs
And no ones wanting for the change

When I'm in the crowd
When I'm in the crowd

Pitching lips to nowhere, hung up on the paper sun 

Standing in the cool of my room 
Fresh cut flowers give me sweet perfume 
Too much sun will burn! 

When you're feeling tired and lonely 
You see people going home 
You can't make the train fare 
Or the six pence for the phone 
And icicles your crying 
From your cheek have just begun 
Don't be sad, good times are had 
Beneath the paper sun 

Daylight breaks while you sleep on the sand 
A seagull is stealing the ring from your hand 
The boy who had given you so much fun 
Has left you so cold in the paper sun",Paper Sun,2007
Paul Weller,"I bought a sequined suit from a pearly queen
And she could drink more wine than I'd ever seen
She had some gypsies' blood flowing through her feet
And when the time was right she said that I would meet
My destiny

I traveled round the world to find the sun
I couldn't stop myself from having fun
And then one day I met an Indian girl
And she made me forget this troubled world
We're living in

I had a strange dream. In my hair
I saw a pearly queen lying there
And all around her feet flowers bloomed
But they were made of silk and sequins two by two",Pearly Queen,2007
Paul Weller,"In echoed steps I walked across an empty dream
I looked across this world, there was no one to be seen
This empty feeling turned and quietly walked away
I saw no warmth in life, no love was in my eyes
I stared a century thinking this will never change
As I hesitated, time rushed onwards without me
Too scared to break the spell, too small to take a fall
But the absolute luck is, love is in our hearts!

I lost some hours thinking of it
I need the strength to go and get what I want
I lost a lifetime thinking of it
An' I lost an era daydreaming like I do

I stared a century thinking this will never change
As I hesitated, time rushed onwards without me
Too scared to break the spell, too small to take a fall
But the absolute luck is, love is in our hearts!
In echoed steps you walk across an empty dream
But look around this world, there's millions to be seen
Come see the tyrants panic, see their crumbling empires fall
Then tell 'em we don't fight for fools 'cause love is in our hearts!

I lost some hours thinking of it
I need the strength to go and get what I want
I lost a lifetime thinking of it

You can lose a lifetime thinking of it

You look the picture of contented new wealth
But from the onlooking fool who believed your lies
I wish this grave would open up and swallow me alive
For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad-colored, mocking shadows, yeah

When the wheel of fortune broke, you fell to me
Out of grey skies to change my misery
The vacant spot, your beating heart took its place
Now I watch smoke leave my lips and fill an empty room

For the bitterest pill is hard to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad-colored, mocking shadows

The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took if for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more hate
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took if for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more hate

Now autumn's breeze blows summer's leaves through my life
Twisted and broken-down, no days with sunlight
The dying spark, you left your mark on me
The promise of your kiss, but with someone else

For the bitterest pill is mine to swallow
The love I gave hangs in sad-colored, mocking shadows
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took if for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore ill
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took if for a hundred years, I couldn't feel any more hate

With cataclysmic overtones
Fear and hate linger in the air
A strictly no-go deadly zone
And I don't know what I'm doing here
'Cause it's not my scene at all
There's an 'A' bomb in Wardour Street
They've called in the Army, they've called in the police to

I'm stranded on the vortex floor
My head's been kicked in and blood's started to pour
Through the haze, I can see my girl
Fifteen geezers got her pinned to the door
I try to reach her but fall back to the floor

'A' bomb off in Wardour Street
It's blown up the West End, now it's spreading through the City

'A' bomb in Wardour Street, it's blown up the City
Now it's spreading through the country

Law and order takes a turn for the worst
In the shape of a size-ten boot
Rape and murder throughout the land
And they tell you that you're still a free man
If this is freedom I don't understand
'Cause it seems like madness to me
'A' bomb in Wardour Street
Hate bomb, hate bomb, hate bomb, hate bomb

Paul Weller,"The distant echo
Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains
To take them home to
The ones that they love and who love them forever
The glazed, dirty steps, repeat my own and reflect my thoughts
Cold and uninviting, partially naked
Except for toffee wrappers and this morning's paper
Mr. Jones got run down
Headlines of death and sorrow, they tell of tomorrow
Madmen on the rampage
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I fumble for change, and pull out the Queen
Smiling, beguiling
I put in the money and pull out a plum
Behind me
Whispers in the shadows, gruff blazing voices
Hating, waiting
""Hey boy"" they shout, ""have you got any money?""
And I said, ""I've a little money and a takeaway curry
I'm on my way home to my wife
She'll be lining up the cutlery, you know she's expecting me
Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork""
I'm down in the tube station at midnight

I first felt a fist, and then a kick
I could now smell their breath
They smelt of pubs and wormwood scrubs
And too many right wing meetings
My life swam around me
It took a look and drowned me in its own existence
The smell of brown leather
It blended in with the weather
Filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth, it blocked all my senses
Couldn't see, hear, speak any longer
I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I said I was down in the tube station at midnight

The last thing that I saw as I lay there on the floor
Was ""Jesus saves"" painted by an atheist nutter
And a British rail poster read ""have an away day, a cheap holiday
Do it today""
I glanced back on my life, and thought about my wife
'Cause they took the keys, and she'll think it's me
I'm down in the tube station at midnight
The wine will be flat and the curry's gone cold
I'm down in the tube station at midnight

Weeping willows and tall dark building, and
I've caught a fashion from the dreams of children
But woke up sweating to this modern nightmare, and
I was alone, no one was there
I was alone, no one was there

I caught a glimpse from the dreams of children
I got a feeling of optimism
But woke up to a grey and lonely picture
The streets below left me feeling dirty, and
I was alone, no one was there
I was alone, no one was there

Books will burn, people laugh and cry in their turmoil
(Turmoil turns rejoiceful)
Shed your fears and lose your guilt
Tonight we burn responsibility in the fire
We'll watch the flames grow higher
But if you get too burnt, you can't come back home
And as I was standing by the edge
I could see the faces of those who led pissing themselves laughing
(And the flames grew)
Their mad eyes bulged, their flushed faces said
The weak get crushed as the strong grow stronger

We feast on flesh and drink on blood
Live by fear and despise love in a crises
(What with today's high prices)
Bring some paper and bring some wood
Bring what's left of all your love for the fire
We'll watch the flames grow higher!
But if you get too burnt, you can't come back home
And as I was standing by the edge
I could see the faces of those who led pissing themselves laughing
(And the flames grew)
Their mad eyes bulged their flushed faces said
The weak get crushed as the strong grow stronger

We'll watch the flames grow higher
But if you get too burnt, you can't come back home

We'll watch the flames grow higher

On a boat that's bound for hope - but left you in the queue
With your shouting, waving, taunting, flaunting friends as crew
Telling you that every lie you ever heard was true
Have you stood upon that deck - have you ever had it blue.
Have you ever woke to find the morning didn't come
Undelivered with the papers - stolen by someone
Found the milkman bound and gagged and shackles ' round the sun
And the holder of the keys turns out to be the one
The girl you had your heart set on - have you ever had it blue.

Have you ever watched the day, passing by your door
Powerless to change its course, your feet fixed to the floor
When all the people you thought you knew are changing more and more
Even the girl you thought would see, seems only to ignore
The only love worth fighting for - have you ever had it blue",Have You Ever Had It Blue [Cut/ Single Version],2007

Freedoms never cheap
But all the things she needed in life, she had no need to keep.
Of all the things she asked of me
None were ever fun
And I'm no good at acting while, the cameras on the run.

Don't you know, she threw it all away
I wonder how she feels today.
She threw it all away
I wonder if she's there to stay.

I tried, a bit, to change into, something that I'm not
But trying to mold with dynamite is like giving lions spots.

Guess you knew, she threw it all away
Don't shed a tear there's no need to cry.
She threw it all away
I played both parts in the fool and I.

Yes, I know your hurting inside
But I can't stop those tears in your eyes, falling from your face

It was the start of the end for us.

I didn't want you to think I was like the rest
Who think they own you just because you've laid with them

It didn't matter now we are together

There are crystal hearts just waiting to be smashed
And out to break them are the ones who never last
To soon today and gone tomorrow
And taking with them just another little piece of you

There are those who think its smart
Thinking that they've stole your love and broke your heart
Too much too soon and gone tomorrow
Well my love doesn't need to lend or steal or borrow",It Didn't Matter [Single Edit],2007

It's no good praying to the powers that be
'Cause they won't shake the roots of the money tree
No good praying to the pristine alters
Waiting for the blessing with Holy water
They like the same old wealth in the same old hands
Means the same old people stay old people stay in command

They got it wrapped up tight, they got it safe and sound

Too much money in too few places
Only puts a smile on particular faces
Said too much power in not enough hands
Makes me think ""get rich quick; take all I can""
They're too busy spending on the means of destruction
To ever spend a penny on some real construction

Watch the money-go-round; watch the money-go-round
They amuse themselves as they fool around
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
Do like they say, make them vulnerable

No good looking to the Empire corners,
""Civilization"" built on slaughter
Carrying hopes and carrying maps
The spinless ones fall in their laps
The brave and the bold are the ones to be fooled
With a diet of lies by the Kipling school

Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
But I just can't help being cynical
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
Do like I say, make me wonderful

Their morals are clean and their clear
They bend your arm and they bend your ear
Said they bend your mind as you talk in circles
Bend over forwards, this won't hurt you
Till there's blood in your lap; blood on your hands
Watch the money-go-round; watch the money-go-round
Come spend a penny, go out with a pound
Watch the money-go-round; watch the money-go-round
As you fall from grace and hit the ground

(On the money-go-round, you wanna get on but it won't slow down)

The need your votes and you know where to send 'em
Be we don't get the choice of a public referendum
On all the real issues that affect our lives
Like the USA base to which we play midwife
Take a cruise and forget this scene
Said come back later when the slates wiped clean

Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
Born of woman, killed by man
Watch the money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
Do like they pray, make it wonderful

The good and righteous sing their hymns
The crimpoline dresses who have no sins
Christians by day, killers in war
The hypocrites who know what they're fighting for
Killing for peace, freedom and truth
But they're too old to go so they send the youth

Watch the money-go-round, watch the money-go-round
I don't think he was an astronaut
Watch the money-go-round, watch the money-go-round
I must insist - he was a Socialist!

Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
They got it wrapped up tight, they got it safe and sound

of faraway voices boarding faraway trains
To take them home to
the ones that they love and who love them forever
The glazed, dirty steps, repeat my own and reflect my thoughts
Cold and uninviting, partially naked
Except for toffee wrappers and this morning's papers
Mr. Jones got run down
Headlines of death and sorrow, they tell of tomorrow
Madmen on the rampage
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I fumble for change, and pull out the Queen
Smiling, beguiling
I put in the money and pull out a plum
Behind me
Whispers in the shadows, gruff blazing voices
Hating, waiting
""Hey boy"" they shout, ""have you got any money?""
And I said, ""I've a little money and a take away curry,
I'm on my way home to my wife.
She'll be lining up the cutlery,
You know she's expecting me
Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork""

I could now smell their breath
They smelt of pubs and Wormwood Scrubs
And too many right wing meetings

It took a look and drowned me in its own existence
The smell of brown leather
It blended in with the weather
It filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth
It blocked all my senses
Couldn't see, hear, speak any longer
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I said I was down in the tube station at midnight

The last thing that I saw
As I lay there on the floor
Was ""Jesus Saves"" painted by an atheist nutter
And a British Rail poster read ""Have an Awayday, a cheap holiday,
Do it today!""

I glanced back on my life
And thought about my wife
'cause they took the keys and she'll think its me

Where hope is started and dreams can be borne

Go mad together in Community

Boys 'round the green looking for some slaughter

We used to chase dreams, now we chase the dragon

In our paradise lost we'll be finding our sanity
In this paradise found we'll be losing our way

Covered in shit and aches and pains
Too knackered to think so give me time to come round
Just gimme the living room beat to the TV sound -

My hard earned dough goes in bills and the larder
And that Prince Philip tells us we gotta work harder!
It seems a constant struggle just to exist
Scrimping and saving and crossing of lists -

From this window I've seen the whole world pass
From dawn to dusk I've heard the last laugh laughed
I've seen enough tears to wash away this street
I've heard wedding bells chime and a funeral march

When as one life finishes another one starts -
Alright then love so I'll be off now

As he brought his friendly truncheon down with
with a God Almighty clout.
Mothers playing bingo, she's hoping for a big win
She buys the daily papers to see how 10% live
My cousins' greatest wish, is to one day buy a farm
And turn it into a health club with top people charm
""Any evening, any day"" - I'm singing to myself
I'll pack up all my clothes and dough and piss off somewhere else.

My ol' man was a dust person until he got the shove
Now the iron heel he talked about is backed by the iron glove
Brothers bought new glasses, shaped like Leon Trotsky's
They look very nice on the mantlepiece, next to the Royal family
I'm laying back with the radio on, in time to hear the Archer's
An everyday tale of country folk mixed up in prostitution.

Like all good stories with a happy end, which I'll now give to you

Til he had enough money, to chair his own board

Of faraway voices boarding faraway trains
To take them home to
The ones that they love and who love them forever
The glazed, dirty steps, repeat my own and reflect my thoughts

Cold and uninviting, partially naked
Except for toffee wrapers and this morning's papers
Mr. Jones got run down
Headlines of death and sorrow, they tell of tomorrow
Madmen on the rampage
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I fumble for change, and pull out the Queen

Smiling, beguiling
I put in the money and pull out a plum
Behind me
Whispers in the shadows, gruff blazing voices
Hating, waiting
""Hey boy"" they shout, ""have you got any money?""

And I said, ""I've a little money and a take away curry,
I'm on my way home to my wife.
She'll be lining up the cutlery,
You know she's expecting me
Polishing the glasses and pulling out the cork""

I first felt a fist, and then a kick
I could now smell their breath
They smelt of pubs and Wormwood Scrubs
And too many right wing meetings
My life swam around me
It took a look and drowned me in its own existence
The smell of brown leather
It blended in with the weather
It filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouth
It blocked all my senses
Couldn't see, hear, speak any longer
And I'm down in the tube station at midnight
I said I was down in the tube station at midnight

The last thing that I saw
As I lay there on the floor
Was ""Jesus Saves"" painted by an atheist nutter
And a British Rail poster read ""Have an Awayday, a cheap holiday,
Do it today!""

I glanced back on my life
And thought about my wife
'cause they took the keys and she'll think its me

I lose control and I'm in that place

I had 45 films to watch
But only one I could take
The mysteries of a secret smile
It was so dull a place

Pull me over with a loving kiss
I remember all the things I missed
You mean so much with the darkness gone
I fell in love with the morning sun
I had 22 dreams last night

You pick me up with a loving kiss
I remembered all the things I missed

And the times I do are in your despair that you created and not I
And still you look up at me in such pleading terms

Don't look at me look at you

And every night I pray to God
Please save the lives of those I love and take me instead
If you really need someone to keep you company
On that golden chair in the glare

Bring your guns to the table and recite your prayer
Lose all your hatred if you are to pray in there

Because the message you're giving is doing nothing for those

There's nothing to stop my own free fall

You're there to save my life for our obvious goal
We've got a headstart for happiness
For our part, guess we must be blessed
For this feeling to be so strong
Tell me is that so wrong?
The space between us for days has been so far;
I've spent a lonely week
Now I wanna be where you are
We've got a head start for happiness, for our part
Guess we must be kissed by this force I feel inside
Now I'm not gonna hide.

All the roads that lead to struggles
Bring you back to where you need
Some reassurance in your own depth,
Only you can see, but let others feel
Peace in my mind I'm so happy to find
As I get on my trek with a head start back to you.

When I find you waiting hours, oh
It's my heart, not my head that takes control
And you've got to lead where your heart says go
And this hope that it turns out so
And that's all that you can hope for
Can you expect much more?

Naive and wise with no sense of time
As I set my clock with a heart beat, tick tock
Violent and mild, common sense says I'm wild

As you attempt to ascend into the high,

Take a ride into the soon,
Be the first one on the moon,
Take a slide - come back to earth,

Praising the way it all works, gazing upon the rest
The cool before the warm
The calm after the storm

Bitter turns to sugar, some call a passive tune
But the day things turn sweet, for me won't be too soon
The hush before the silence
The winds after the blast

I wish we'd move together, this time the bosses sued
But we're caught up in the wilderness and an ever changing mood
Teardrops turn to children, who've never had the time
To commit the sins they pay for through, another's evil mind
The love after the hate
The love we leave too late

I wish we'd wake up one day, an' everyone feel moved
But we're caught up in the dailies and an ever changing mood

Evil turns to statues, and masses form a line
But I know which way I'd run to if the choice was mine
The past is knowledge, the present our mistake
And the future we always leave too late

And it shone like the sun
Like silver and gold

It went on and on it went on and on

Always call me back to return as I rewrite this song
The ghosts of night, the dreams of day
Make me swirl and fall and hold me in this way

Joined in the race to the rainbow's end

Catching cold in the pouring rain 
Won't you come & take me to your door 
So I can take myself home again

We could have the best time if you lighten up your life 

When I'm waiting standing on the corner 
And the soda light begins to flicker 
And it's getting fourty past the hour 
And I think I won't see what I figure 
Well I'm waiting freezing on the inside 
Staring up at your window pane 
If you won't come see me this evening 
I can see myself here again

We could have the best days if you lighten up your life 
We could have the best time if you lighten up your life",40 Past Midnight [Live on Later With Jools Holland],2010
