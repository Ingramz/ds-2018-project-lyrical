Redman,"Ah! Look out, it's the Funkadelic Funk for chumps
Who don't be knowin' my name, I tear the frame out ya punks
I make ya slide, make ya slip, make ya wanna back flip
I get biz with the skit, I DJ like Quik
The topnotch of the block, cause I carry a Glock
Holy hot rocks I'm hot, so give up the props
My style is hummin' cummin' atcha! Duck or get backed up
Dispatcher: 'Red, get freaky to the rapture'
So come on light the Buddha check your honey while I scoop her
The Superfly, Jimmy Fly Snuka rips the roof off
Then hook off on your crew, to the check of one to two
It's you, who? Redman with the Kung-Fu
Come on and get down and boogie oogie with the rough neck
Hit women like Madonna all the way down to Smurfette
But first get your tables I roast your whole record label kids
Yo E (Whats up G?) Bridge!

""Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind""
""Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind"" 

I do the hustle like Russell, Rush the stage with Simmons
Deadly venom, makes me Poison like Michael Bivins
Or a cobra, pop more pop than Coca-Cola
Next to Yoda I'm a Star at War, plus roller coaster
I got my mind made up girl, come on and get it if you widdit troop
Krush groovin' smooth as the lightning loops
The kind of loops I sample from a James Brown group
I give credit, cause I'm cautious, about lawsuits
PsychoBetaP-Funk, got styles hard as tree trunks
For real punk, you got a blunt, light it cause I need one
And get down with the irrelevant funk to make ya jump
With the fly human being, watch me freak it in Korean

Chu ri ka pi kyura mulla kara
Nu gu nya nada na na nun Redman
Na bo da challan nom hana do upda'
Nah Duke, forget it

I rip shop in hip-hop I get props my lip rocks
The rap stuff's more spooky than movies from Hitchcock
Sit back relax let me rip to the funk track
And press rewind if I haven't blown your mind (re-wind!)

""Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind""
""Press rewind if I""

Ha, let me get busy with the funky fly stuff
Cause I cut your freakin' eyes, fuck Bruce Willis because I die rough
It's the Funkadelic Redman and I hit ya with the
Funkadelic level, the P-Funk, the devil
The spectacular, Blackula, bust holes like Dracula
Loaded of course, more Legend than Acura
I'm swift, I like big spliffs so I tisk tisk a tasket
Plus keep the Glock in my basket
I cough up a lung cause I freak it with the tongue
Cause I can 'Wax on! Wax off!' like Daniel-son
Do the yea yea, boogey say up jump the boogey
To the boogey to the boogey thanks to E cause he hooked me
So fuck what ya heard, word to herb, cause I mac-
A-frama-lama, plus I kick the grammar, straight from, New Jers'
It's the renegade rap Redman, really who rip rhymes in rough mode
Yo, hold your breath while I explode!

You washed up niggaz should be thrown in the dryer
And in due time I'll pull your cover
And then you'll suffer, you foul motherfucker
You baldheaded sucker, your body full of blubber
You only got here 'cause moms popped the rubber
I got your number, and I don't care who you get
My click is sick, y'all can all lay under
And nigga you old, I don't wanna go
To a all-time low with your kids screamin' (NO!)
You a liar, you're stingy and phony too
That's why your people in your own hood hate you

Check his vocabulary, listen to his flow
He sayin' things that I said seven years ago
And it ain't about how many niggaz you got
It's about who drove first and who get popped
I'm a chip off the old block, hip off the old hop
Clip out the gold glock, pimp out the whole spot
Sell out the whole stock - stop sleepin' on me
Motherfuckers, wake up, last stop
And I don't play games, y'all dudes is Tetris
I'll kill MC's over Instant Message
I got it, I'll front it, you want it, come and get it

More Fresh than the Prince in Bel-Air nigga
Like O.D.B. I take welfare nigga
Rob the mailman, shit, hell yeah nigga
The strong move silent, laws to adopt to
But in Brick City, the silent get shot too
You gonna stop who? It's Redman
I plan to stick around like a Spiderman costume

Keep that heat and the John Lennon
Boy you won't catch me arguin'
Brick City, that's right! Hood down, hands up!
Red ""Lord of the Ring"" (clean?), lookin' for that Precious
I'm talking weed and women, when the trouble come I'm 'bout it
Shit I'd rather get caught with my gun then get caught without it
It's Gilla House nigga, you know we here to smoke
DJ keep it cool, Reggie let me UH-HAH clear my throat
When I'm in yo' town man', you better act a fool
Turn your college dorm to Rodney Dangerfield- Back to School!

'Round here we blow treez (blow treez)

Started with a quarter then slowly smoked up a O-Z
Ready keep it raw like a nigga ordered a whole ki'
""Nigga let me hit ya blunt"" Nah, you don't know me
Gilla! Gilla House and Gotti click
Bang like karate flicks
Duck when the shotty spit
Or land in a pile of shit
Known to make you cowards bleed
Smokin' on that Sour Dies'
That cali weed's
So funky we call it cottage cheese
I'm in the powered V-12
Look at all these females
Jockin' me 'cause of all the records that we sell
Got them pounds for retail
Hit me on my email
And drop bombs dot com, yo who need L's?

[Hook]

Yo, yo my bud'll do ya
Method Man constant drug abuser
Occasional boozer
And I'm slick as Rick the Ruler
I piss in the sewer
Underground man, I spits manure
Plus make maneuvers
With Doc/ That sixteen shot/ Ruger
Is back on your block/ blastin' a shot/ like screw ya
Fuck everybody that knew ya
My dogs are Oogka-Dupa
They Bark and they bite
I Darken your life
Muthafuckas slippin' like wearing Gators Walking on ice
This is New Edition, I'm Hot Tonite

[Verse 1: Redman]
Yo, When I D-I-P, I V-I-P
I'm Doctor, I rush niggas to emergency
Open heart, filled with darts

When I throw it in park
Pop the trunk, sellin' CD's $15's for chumps
'Cause I'm like Noah's Ark from the slums
Holla' at cha frog, I'm getting them (Bud)
Like them frogs on the log
I'm balls to the wall
When I do anything, nothing's hard
I make it easy and talk greasy to broads
GILLA! Say my name 5 times in the mirror!
I'm jumpin' out - whoa!
You can hear the
Sounds of the motherfuckin' men
Tryin' to get your chain
Tryin' to get cha chay-e-ain!
Flush this down the drain
I'm the new raw on the streets
You can get 10 years per each song
Catch a contact, what I write from the arm
Now little white kids bring pipes to the prom
I was supposed to quit, be an influence
But, the weed is like (Nike) -- I JUST DO IT!
I'm ET zooted, way out there
You got weed?
Then, roll with the Sonny and Cher
Suffering succotash, I leave you suckers sufferin'
Huffin' and puffin', at last!

This is Brick City! [gun shots]
Hear the gunshots, where they hate cops [sirens]
On every block, there's a weed spot
This is Brick City! [gun jams]
Hear the gun jam, if you don't run fam-I-ly with a suntan
This is Brick City! [rapid-fire gunshots]
Hear the gun spit, niggas jump ship
Where we spit, 'cause we run shit
Play pussy wit' us
And get fucked quick
Who got the duchess?

[Verse 2: Redman]
Yo, I keep the ghetto in me
I love the sweet taste of revenge
I'm focused, my soul's been cleansed
Now I know who the enemy, and who to friend
But still, with my eyes closed, they both blend
I'm not a follower, I start the trend
Y'all can follow that dummy
I'mma follow this money
Now I'm at the age, where I need to get paid
If a nickel bag gets sold in the park - heyyyyyyy!
Did I stu-stutter?
I got the guns and butter
My craftwork be movin' the numbers
I keep a (Roscoe) like Kurupt, brother
Hang out my window - BLAOW!
What up, fucker?
Violence sells, but I ain't a violent male
But if you violate, I'll play the violin well
From Bricks to Park Hill
Don't be like Zoolander, waitin' for that Blue Steel
To be shown on your grill

Pull up a Coupe a color niggaz can't find

I overdo it strong, got chicks that buck ya down

from Vietnam that look like Nia Long

I'm hot, my collar stand up like The Fonz

To hold my guns you need wet and karma bombs

You got chubby? I got chubby too

Me starve in the park, nigga you on ComicView

You funny, I flood the area tsunami

Wash out the weak niggaz, then I tag 'em _Dry Me_

I'm married to the game, the brass my music

When Brick's in the house, there's a problem Houston!

I guzzle Crunk Juice to the neck

So when I walk in the party ain't nobody gon' do shurrr

Redman is shurrr, it's the principality

Oven like wurrrm for the lyrics I burrrn

Nigga wait your turrrn, we can battle in a second

So I can bankrupt ya like, Chapter 11

I'm the shit like Janet Jackson undressin

Believe it, when I quarterback you receive it

Same crib on MTV Cribs mine

I ain't lyin cause my eyes redder than iodine

I'm back muh'fucker, so up your chain

I'ma leave the same way I came, that's thorough

I run up in your hood like 80 deep

Have it sound like _Drumlines_ at A&T, muh'fucker

I'm worldwide fool, I don't care about a buzz

Dawn of the Red, goin for the bread

I got pitbulls hooked on to a sled

My block'll riot like they shot Cornbread

The Pres'll find a missile with a foreign head

KABOOM! Guess who stepped in the room?

Streetsweeper out, ready to vacumn

Then all of a sudden, you get it in the end

Like Kane from Marlena cousin, I'm a menace

I was broke as hell, first time I made it

Now e'rything I own is voice activated

Boy I'm lyin, I'm just tryin to make cheddar

Cause my doorbell is rubbin two wires together

Get high, get drunk, grab a hoe and chill
Eat a meal, then back to the hood for more action
Promotin' Red Gone Wild with no backin
Doc get five on the mic like Joe Jackson
Foreign bitches feelin' me for my accent
Talk like a boss, I can't complain
When I do it, it's big like Fulton in St. James

That's hard to harpoon, I need more room
The hood love me, so I keep it real gully
I got handsome, but my flow is still ugly
Turn the treble out the track and I'll jet
I lines in my rhyme are longer than Ikea
I stay on my grind, but when I come up with an Idea
The year, is party over here

Yeah niggaz, I'm back
And the weather outside is hot than a motherfucker
But we cold chillin’ in the Brick City

So kick back, light some blunts
Put your hands on a big fat greasy ass
And turn the music up
As we take yo' ass on a ride as Redman goes wild on W K Y A

Gilla house, yo, yo
Come see the sideshow, nigga how it go?
With my eyes closed I can hit nine folks
You want the beef nigga? Here the prime roast

My mic's the gun, the bullet's the 9 volt
Fuck the convo, here go the pyro
G.I. Joe mixed with Desperado
I ride low with a bomb in the armrest

Prepare to snipe a fucker like John F.
Connect ya like Nynex, nigga holla
I'm on the corner like Hollywood with a Starbuck
Bring it to ya like the Japs in Pearl Harbor

Red is to blunt like redneck is to Marlboro
This is our world, join the effect
Clean your ears for Doc Donald Goines with a pen
What more can I say, Doc billin’

Gilla general, Def Squad lieutenant
Ill at will, thought you knew
I'm in the hood, you most wanted up in Malibu

Out for the crumbs
Shotgun warrior with a Wu-Tang tongue, gilla

How ya like that, tell me how ya like that?
How ya like that, tell me how ya like that?
Don't fuck around or walk around with an icepack
I test your gangsta, didn't wanna fight back

This for niggaz, Jews and white trash
I deliver them punch lines with a nice jab
Smokin’ weed on a go-cart at Bo Craft
BC-4, straight out of low cash
Low cash, low cash, W K Y A, Low cash, yeah

The new Brick City, low down, gritty
Fo' pound semi, minds I leave 'em empty
Keep the fo' pound round the 9 milli with me
So when the Feds run up, they likely not to hit me

Like J-Kwon everybody, in the club tipsy
You be on the mixtapes soundin’ like 50
But this is Brick City, gilla house we comin’ through
Smokin’ blunts, sippin’ Henny too

Girls is bouncin’, niggaz bouncin’ too
On the blocks, new whips we drivin’ through

Call me that nigga that got the bounce
And I'll pull up to the party witta half a ounce
I got them niggas in the back and they yellin' ""HO!""
Punk niggas start runnin' like panty hose
Got the Sour Dies' waving up high in the sky
They're saying, ""Redman roll up and let's get high""

You know how Bricks flow

Hang out the sunroof and I'm yellin' out ""YO!
What happened to my weed and what happened to my dough?""
My motion real slow

And I get the party bubblin' like Alka Seltzer Plus
You niggas smoke dust
If my flow ain't tight
Cause I'm tight like a jewish wife
I'm that nice
Nigga you know Red, I be at the party
Like drinking Bacardi
With somebody
Had to smack a chick for touching my face
I'm like, ""Bitch don't you know there's a gun in my waist?""

[Hook]

Now you don't have to ask nigga who got the bomb
I shotgun like the arm
Or Roger moms
When I pull it ya ask, ""What's Happening?""
We ain't talking, we doin' the gavelin'
It's Reggie Noble on the scene
Call me Mr Green
I got my P.O. thinking that my system clean
Before I seen her, I gargle with the Listerine
So she can turn my felony to a misdemean'
I'm like, ""Bitch don't you know who I be?""
I could go cash a check without no ID
I'm a East Coast legend, you should know 'bout me
This is for my 'hood bitches and real OG's
If you're really unaware
That we insane then tell us
I'm in my underwear
Like Damon Wayans in Colors
White tee, Air Force got 'em different colors
550 S Benz make a nigga jealous

Johnny struck through the Shaolin slum

Type of chemistry for a live MC
Hands in the air like you just don't care
You all get a share, there's a party over here
Year 2000, keep bouncing
T-minus, thirty seconds and counting
New York's finest, still wilding, Shaolin
At the full moon howling
Get 'til it's gone, Killa Bee kills
Only time will reveal like the words in the song
Cause love's what I feel for my crew, bust steel
Niggas don't got to pay my bills
P.l.o. Pack the slingshot flow
Plant the seed, let the garden grow
And stick that rhyme where the sun don't shine
Darts pierce your heart like a Valentine
This my Tale From the Crypt that's sick
Bloodbath, body bags and shit
Ufc fighting championships
G.i. Joes with the Kung-Fu Grip
Now you don't dare, to step in the square
Kids ain't playing over here, playa
Only one way, and that's my way

Redman,"Attention, all you niggaz, all you bitches
Time to put down the cristal, time to take off the ice for a minute
Time to throw a little mud

Turn me up some, yo

Yo, yo, gimme some room, I'm throwin' elbows
Timberland boots, Air Force and shell-toes, who the fuck is them
If I gotta pay to get in the club
I'ma go pop the trunk and turn the street volume up to ten
I ain't on the guest list, I ain't V.I.P.
I snuck in the exit, learned to D-I-P
My dress code is all black when I'm makin' the moves
Similar to the new PlayStation 2

I can't help it if the club only packin' a G
And the fire marshal wanna shut it down in 3
And you ballin' ass niggaz whose dressed to kill
For the hoes showin' the toes with extra heels
I gotta get in, I drove here
With a carload of bitches charged on Belvedere
My niggaz hit the cells if the line is thick
So I drive the 500 through the door of the bitch

If you pumpin' this one in your truck

Yo, security pattin' my legs and waist
But if I vacate the place, it'll be ""stay down""
All my niggaz in the huddle on the count of three
We gonna bum rush The Tunnel with a pound of weed
Cut the light on, you see it's Brick City in here
Blazin' like Biggie passed us a semi in here
Don't sleep, stay wide awoke
You dialed Doc, not dial-a-joke
Crawl or you'll die in smoke

I keep it heated when the hawk is out
Seated low Tahoe, beat it when the dark is out
I'm outside of the line and I'm actin' a fool
Like a three o'clock bully, waitin' after school
Punks, I've been in this line for hours
I even killed the time by helpin' my man pass out fliers
Now all I wanna do is get in where I fit in
Shake my ass with the baddest pigeon with her wig in

Jump, move, crash, drink
Shake that ass stank, the fuck you think?
Poppa Bear at the table and the porridge is pourin'
Since Def is the label, I belong in a morgue
I'm walkin' half-dead, actin' senile
With bigga niggaz from jail than the one on ""Green Mile""
I'll huff and puff, blow the club down
I'll snuff a duck, I'm headed Uptown

Yeah, that's right! We up in this joint now
Aiyyo, we gettin' ready to take over
Freddie, you grab the mic, I'ma grab the turntables
We gon' rock this joint, baby

But you don't know shit, uh-huh
What's your definition of a real emcee
From what you dedicated, hey it must be me

I go on to the break of dawn, and just don't stop
Give me the green light, and the sign one way

Those who test it, respect it, the method
You know I can't be messed with, I'm hectic, accept it
I'll break it down, I get down for my crown
Filthy, dirty like a worm underground
Tryin' to avoid the early bird, that's my word
Before I kick the bucket I'm a kick 'em to the curb
Check out the cloud, smoked out from the mouth
Other brothers got mad fly, flew south for the (winter)
Hey, enter the square if you dare
Without a flaw, I'm so raw that I'm rare

On land, air, or sea, I don't need No I.D
Once again, let's get under their skins like I.V.'s

I got a shoe in the door, nothin' new anymore
Ya'll got love for me? I got love for you and yours

I'm what's crackin', like your mamma smokin' again

Rubbin' her thighs like Aladdin rub the Genie bottle
Back for another swallow, Method, you know my motto:
""Ya'll might just win today, but I'll be back tomorrow""

Ya'll tryin' to get me started
Who on the short yellow bus tryin' to get retarded?
Kid don't be the artist, formerly known as artist
Jump off a skyscraper, the roof who hit the hardest
Where the bastards at and where they habitats?
I send they asses back to foldin' sweaters at the Gap
I like Nikes, food spicy, I'm a Pisces
That's why women love me and any nigga that's like me
Thoroughbread, I'm with gettin' this dough instead
Need a ho, like I need another hole in the head
Lord help me, I'm crackin' the safe, pocket like 'Face

Smokin' it, jumpin' off the dick, like he mental

Mic check, I walk around the streets with a black tech nine
by the waistline, kickin the hype shit
I never claim to be the best type of rapper
But hafta, show them motherfuckers what I'm after
I'm after the gold, then after that the platinum
Beef after that, Hurricane G packs the gat son
Trigger, bang, bang, yo bust the slang, whut my name?
It's the Redman on the funk thang
Psyche, you're motherfuckin right, tonight's the night
To do what I want to do, to do it like dynamite
The work perfected, when the funk been ejected
I roughen up the rough draft to like make your head split
Punk! Pass the 40 and the blunt and don't front
on the block, cause when you do front, brothers are gettin stomped
I'm not a addict, more like Puff than Magic
Then pass it when I'm through cause my crew gots to have it
I don't claim to be a big rap star
cause no matter who you are, you'll still catch a bullet scar
So listen up and take heed to what I'm sayin
Cause tonight's the night and me and my niggaz ain't playin

Fat black bitch! Nasty..
bush bear, booga breath bitch
Nasty, talk to your tits bitch
with them nasty Africans, Mr. Bojangles
Turned up shoes havin ass..
Lemming leprechaun haircut motherfucker!

You want to see me get cool, please, save it for the breeze
cause the lyrics and tracks, make me funky like cottage cheese
Fuck the smoov shit, I get down wit the boom bip
like Q-Tip, I kick more styles than Bruce shoe's kick
But tonight's the night what I write tonight
This type of funk with the flavor like Mike'n'Ike's
Hanging out wit my niggaz, my niggaz
The {Pack Pistol Posse} keep they fingers on the triggers
I keep the 40 between my lap, coolin, rollin down the highway
Blunt system pumps cause it's Friday
Roll over to pick my boys up, we raise a lot of noise
cause, we can do that black, so get the bozack jack
Remember, I do the type of evil that men do
Like cursin out my window at a bitch and her friend too
So turn the volume up a notch
and watch the ba-BUMP, ba-BUMP, make ya speakers pop
That's the funk, when it pumps it makes your rump
jump, jump, jump.. jump, jump, jump
But if you want to see a fly but frantic
cool romantic, more Slick=er than my man Rick
You better check the Yellow Pages under smoov shit
cause Red ain't down for the bullshit
Niggaz fucked up by letting me make an album (How come rude bwoy?)
To get on the mic and let my fuckin style run

I tryna walk before I crawl and move this package in my draws
That's why I push the pedal to the muh'fuckin floor
With ten per cent method, only plug something poor
And still I keep it funky like four plus one more
Get this money like ""In God We Trust"", trust your boy
It's a given, living this life it was written
Especially for me, I'm what the recipe is missing
Blow my piff in the air, key the ignition
Then get to lane switching, plucking ashes off the clip and
Mammy wanna ride and play the Bonnie to my Clyde
If anybody try to (Kill Bill), it'll probably be the bride
Like all jokes aside, I'm serious with mine
And now I'm on this grind like Method Man in his prime

Hoping my album make me another Bill Gates
Around my crib, look how I live
I'm a slob but crip niggas say I get biz
Anywhere I did a show women saying that I'm
""So aaaaaa-ma-zing""

Yeah, another mic, another night and the day's end
Another heist, another kite in the state pen
My state business shit, y'all dudes just break wind
New York nigga, either you're made mice or made men
I do the dirt that keep my hand on the work
I got the other hand up Mona Lisa's skirt
My aim one since day one stop

Seven six five four three two one
My mon' Meth-Tical come and get some

Playin' my position, hot Nixon
This one, for all the sick ones, confliction
Poisonous darts sickening, best believe
Finger itchin with two broke legs, now I'm trippin'
On MC's cliche, shot that ricochets
Start trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, G-O-D no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly, tap your jaw
From my Punch Buggy sunnin' you
Got you shittin' in your last Huggie, runnin' who?
Fuckin' punk, get a speed bump comin' through
A single shot make your knees knock, respect Wu

Ayo I put it on a nigga, shit it on a nigga
Turnin' Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got set up I was hittin' your ex hoe
Shit I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chicken heads gobblin'
Shit I'm drivin' in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the chin see
When I approach rappers be takin' notes
I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolut, I love to burn to the roots
I keep comin' til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic

I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown witcha head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beatin' niggas to death and beatin' dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?"" I think I'll go on
For more Millenniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run ta, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who want to see Canibus get wild, who want to act fly and
Get shot down with a surface-to-air missile
I take em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred
When I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it

Stay out the dark, cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you dog, believe that
Where we at, do your value your life, as much as your possessions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put your somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
You'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on front teeth, you think I'm sweet?
Want heat? One deep, leave him behind, front seat

Come on Mr. Smith, come get some!

When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed (yeah, word up)
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin' on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'm a do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis (""LL Cool J is hard"")
Every little boy want to pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like pickin' up a ball, playin' with Mike
Swingin' at Ken Griffey or challengin' Roy to a fight
Snappin', you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin' overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin a tiger cub to his knees (uh)
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't want to borrow that, you want to idolize
And you don't want to make me mad nigga you want to socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line

I pause, flick the ash from my L
I (Pause) like Run and Jason Mizell
The emcee is me, host for the night
Papa Doc, only thing I don't choke on the mic
I choke a bitch out if my gwap ain't correct
Then with my giant hancock, I'll get the cheque
I love trucks but drop-tops is the best
From the Beemers, Benz, now Rolex, watch me

Roll with Gs and we'll show you how to get dough
Third degree, let it burn with my kinfolk

Who these corner store rappers slinging cracks in my hall?
Mama's in the kitchen cooking cat, rat and dog
Me, I want a little something, y'all could have it all
I tryna walk before I crawl and move this package in my draws
That's why I push the pedal to the muh'fuckin floor
With ten per cent method, only plug something poor
And still I keep it funky like four plus one more
Get this money like ""In God We Trust"", trust your boy
It's a given, living this life it was written
Especially for me, I'm what the recipe is missing
Blow my piff in the air, key the ignition
Then get to lane switching, plucking ashes off the clip and
Mammy wanna ride and play the Bonnie to my Clyde
If anybody try to (Kill Bill), it'll probably be the bride
Like all jokes aside, I'm serious with mine
And now I'm on this grind like Method Man in his prime

Yo, I got my swagger on and I feel great
Funk Doc be in the hood like Enfamil cases
I network on MySpace real late
Hoping my album make me another Bill Gates
Around my crib, look how I live
I'm a slob but crip niggas say I get biz
Anywhere I did a show women saying that I'm
""So aah-ma-zing""

Yeah, another mic, another night and the day's end
Another heist, another kite in the state pen
My state business shit, y'all dudes just break wind
New York nigga, either you're made mice or made men

But these niggas want the juice, now they fucking up the jooks
Jimmy Crack Corn, and I don't muthafucking care
Cause the green is the only thing puffin' over here
So be clear, put this bug up in your ear
Meth and Doc put it down, yo, put it in the air

[Chorus]

A dude like me, keep a boom boom in the truck
So you hear Doc rolling up
Middle finger in the air, to my haters, yo, what's up?
You can tell Doc fuck shit up
Hey, nigga, I'm so hood
My hand on the pump, niggas understood
Bitch, I'm no good, I swear
Light shit up like Times Square, put it in the air

I got a bottle of Patron, I'm the only one that spent that cash
But everybody try to get they glass
Now we can all have a drink, if you trying to put some dough in the bank
But if not, ya'll can kiss my ass
I need a, Cinderella that can give me the loot
Better yet, a French vanilla that can give me the scoop
Oh yeah, just so we clear, put this bug up in your ear
Meth and Doc put it down, yo, put it in the air

[Chorus]",Hey Zulu,2009
Redman,"Yo, I hit the 'freeway' after I 'rock the mic'
Light up like Showtime when they about to fight
How bout dat, boy, when that truck ride 38's
Your middle finger up at the light, I'm nice
Doc ride or die, I bubble up when the pouring peroxide
It's dirty, lookie here
Still sharp like I'm back in school
It's like Wonder Blade, cut a nigga smooth
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo, who let the dog loose?
Whips and chains, I don't wanna argue
The big whale that's writing fishscale
Like me, better believe, I'm too hard to harpoon
My goons, think like Chris Wallace
'Give me the loot' and I don't wanna talk about it
When my niggas 'get 'em', that's when I
Crush the building, how about that?

Look at my shoes, how about that, nigga?
(My car, how about that, nigga?)
Getting money, how about that, nigga?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

How about it, any nigga realer than me? I doubt it
Catch Ready hop out of v, low mileage
You see the way I play with money, I'm so childish
And, so stylish, looking like Gucci my sponsor
Kicks crazy, jewelry is bonkers
Whether in the club or you see me in concert
I go hard, who created a monster?
Me, Gilla be the click that I ride with
Talk slick, get flipped like a Sidekick
You wonder why your bitch is on my dick
'cause the boy flow doper than five bricks
The MC wishing I simply
Be remembered like Big Pun, Biggie or Pimp see
And when my niggas say 'get 'em', that's when I
Blocka blocka, how about that, nigga?

Look at my house, how about that, nigga?
(Sour dies', how about that, nigga?
Big paper, how about that, nigga?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

How bout that, ten years plus in the rap game
And still getting cream like a fat cat
Plus, I'm grossing money off of ASCAP
Plus, my publishing, yea I owns that
First of all, my royalty come quarterly
My hoes, my niggas, all move accordingly
Streetlife, I'm so international
My foreign exchange, but always in the capitol
Straight cash advances, while you be calling
Your label all day, hoping someone answers
I flow with no auto-tone, just me and my bitch
My blunt, my beat, my microphone
I shine with no jewelry on, another star is born
Watch me perform, beyond the norm
And when my niggas 'get 'em', that's when I
Brr stick 'em, haha, stick 'em, how about that, nigga?

Fuck what it cost, how about that, nigga?
(I'm a boss, how about that, nigga?)
Straight pimping, how about that, nigga?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Pimp game, soak it up, you dig?
Hope your haters want beef, 'cause I don't touch the pig
How about that, boy, I'm a G, ain't another MC
Or pedophile that can touch the kid, I do it big
Like Chris Wallace, big bank, big wallet
Got a flow that go straight to the pros, forget college
I still got it, if I got an issue, I flow the pistol
And I'm official, just like them niggas that low the whistle
Word, man, I shoot to kill 'em, you heard?
If you nasty, I shoot 'em with penicilen, you heard?
I'm like Cali, so carry, when I'm flipping the words
Flip the script on your bitch ass while I'm flipping the bird
Meth sick with the pen, stick a few in your men
Then again, stick with my pen through the thick and the thin
Look, when my niggas 'get 'em', I send 'em to hell
And ride with 'em, how about that, nigga?

Look at my crew, how about that, nigga?
(Gun bigger than you, how abotu that, nigga?
Pop bottles, how about that, nigga?

(feat. Melanie Rutherford)

[Chorus: Melanie Rutherford]
If you like it (a lil' bit) I will give you a (a lil' bit)
If you want it (a lil' bit) you can have some more
Now that you spent it (a lil' bit) you can taste it a (a lil' bit)
If you like it (a lil' bit) you can have some more

[Method Man]
Somebody tell honey I'm good, just like a licorice
Meth got 'em stuck in the hood just like a clitoris
Something like this track from Roc', ya'll, ridiculous
Don't touch her if I'm getting my rocks off, she ticklish
Now if I turn it up, shorty if you got a Dutch then we can burn it up
I ain't the type that need to drink to get his courage up
Half ya'll get a drink and think you murderers

[Redman]
Yo, I know you heard of us, Red & Meth, here take a photo
Walk in serious like Miguel Coto
Pimp in my mojo, swing in my logo
Def Squad, Wu-Tang, that's how I do things
Hit my blunt, baby I see your pussy a lil' bit
That's when I know it's on, it's time to head home
And we kick bitches out, around six in the morning

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
O.G. bubblegum, kush burn a bush
See you pussies like to eat out, need to learn to cook
Look, Meth wasn't eating 'em til I learned to juks
Tried to catch something, everytime I work a hook
Now if I crank it up, if I put it in the cup would you drink it up
Ever get caught up in a lie and try to change it up
You got a pocket full of lime, try and blaze it up

[Redman]
When I bust, I sip on that sir, fly to Miami and act up a lil' bit
I know eyes on me, when I count to three
Make believe you was indeed a copied MC
You can smell me a lil' bit, boy, my connect just mailed me a lil' bit
I got that block out of drought, now everybody love me
It's like Beetlejuice, shit gon' get ugly

[Chorus]

[Method Man]
I got to be out, at the club door with the key out
Bouncer at the door trynna tell me put the weed out
Honey got her feet out, the dudes coked up looking skied out
Tapped her on the shoulder like let's be out
Now should I speed it up, you know whisper in her ear, skeet skeet it up
Or should I take it to the crib and try to beat it up
A little candlelight and dinner when we need it up

[Redman]
Yo, another one light the dutch, it's Redman, holla bitch
Fuck you, that means she swallowed it
I do double on the turn, you must learn
Like K-are, the A-are, I grip it firm
If they brought hip hop back, sucker MC's be eating a lil' bit
Redman is on fire, so call him quick
You can reach me at 1-800 Eat-A-Dick

And bitches grab my mic give me feedback
Reggie you a asshole baby I'll be back
I get cocky when the beat pumping
You know you doing it when your tire lip rubbing
I keep a freak and I call her chicken meat
Cause this Superbad nigga, she McLovin

Fiends get killed in my hallways we parle
My feet been killing me all day
Your boy down for life like them killers in Rahway
It's all work and no play
Cause this block is nothing like Broadway
Revenge is sweeter that sorbet
You all become believers when this heaters in your face
Just a part of my function
Y'all don't want no part of the gun spray
I would hate to pull it in one stray
That's where the innocence by stand
We're trapped inside these tenements like damn
Why mama try'na feed us this spiced ham
Connects try'na cheat us with light grams
Co-defendents try to lighten they sentence snitching to white man
Turn states evidence fam we ain't gelling
Felons ain't felons no more they straight telling
Ain't nothing worst than a rat you can't smellin'
And ain't nothing worst than a trap you can't sell in

Study how it all began and see the part
Study how Kool Herc became King of Bronx
Learn, how to rock Wallabees and Clarks

Let's get ready to rumble

In this corner we have the funk body snatcher
P Funkadelic and I gotcha hard enough
That I can chew a whole bag of rocks
Chew an Avenue, chew an off street and off block

Then turn around and do the same damn thing to a soloist
'Cause Reggie Noble's pissed
I crush your whole brain frame
'Cause you couldn't maintain the funk

That have your rap style for lunch, chump
'Cause 92, I take a whole crew
Give them a punch of the funk
Knock all of their gold tooth loose

To show you what type of stuff I'm on
You can't puff or sniff it
Because I was born with it
The Funkadelic Devil, hit you with the rap level of 10

Then 1, 2, 3, you're pinned
I get action, so everybody jump with your rump
If you like the way it sounds punk
Pump it in your back trunk

And let loose with the Juice when I do rock
I'm too hot, some say I got more Juice then Tupac
(Straight outta Jersey)
You heard me, my brother I'm laughin'

Time 4 sum aksion
Time 4 sum aksion
Time 4 sum aksion

Lights, camera, cock back the hammer
Straight from the land of the lost
I'ma hit you with the funk force
That makes you run your rap style back to the crack vile brotha

Then strike a pose like Madonna
My mom's kicked me out because I did what I want to
The original P-Funk stroke a trunk of funk
Then you saw caps 'cause my jaw snaps with the raw raps

So color me bad, plus color me black
For the funk that I pack, Red freak it to the funk track
The funky fly stuff
Come on and let me kick, the funky fly stuff

Just to show you where the hell I come from
I get dumb with the 112
Check my rep, I'm a hit when I have sex like this
Make you twist to the list

Of a funky brain cell when it's puffed on a spliff
And all that, the hi hat, go buy that
Listen, look, oops, brother where your eyes at?
There on the floor, pick 'em up

While I pour a lil' funk down your brain punk
Listen to my name chump
Redman ready to rock, I got a glock
Then, pow, your body is all over the block

Tryin to step to ths, the Exorcist, kick it
I git mad wicked when the twin cocks the biscuit
And blow your head off, just for askin'

Rednex,"- The McKenzie brothers just reached their limits. It's now mid-August and two months have passed since the new marshall Mike Monroe came to town. He'd already put Joe and Jeramiha six feet under. 
They were drunk as the skunks, they were on their way back from the saloon. They passed Steve Harlow's range to wrestle some cattle. The marshall and his deputies showed up and shot 'em in the neck. The most bloody fireworks Dog Head City had ever seen. Jim, the oldest brother and head of the clan since father Judas got his head blown of in a gunfight, saddled up his horse and went in to town, just to set things straight with the marshall. On his way to town he rode past his uncle Jock's to fill him in about Joe and Jeramiha. 
""Looks like the marshall wants a war and he's gonna get one"", Jock said. ""I'll send a message out for brother James, your uncle. Remember him? You met at the wedding when he stole your cousin Julia from the groom."" Meanwhile, in town, marshall Monroe and his deputies were drinking their heads off and shootin' run away chickens to celebrate the passing of the McKenzies. 
Next morning, the McKenzie clan were ready to set things straight with the marshall and his men. They sent little John into town to lure 'em out and into a trap, so they can shoot 'em dead. 
John came to town, walked into the saloon, saw the marshall eatin' lunch. Baked beans, sollie belly and a tun of brew. He saw his chance to be a man, he'd always been a little boy in the clan. He wiped his sweat of his hands and said: ""Hey scumbag, this town ain't big enough for the two of us. You killed my two brothers and now, it's your time to kiss the dust. Get ready to slap leather."" 
But before John even cleared his holster, the marshall had filled him with so much lead, it took six strong men to carry him out. Mike Monroe finished his meal, reloaded his gun, gathered his men and said: ""It's time to finish the McKenzies, once and for all.""

After the final battle, 
two miles north of Dog Head City, 
just where the river breaks up 
in to thoose beautiful cascades 
before it melts in to Rickies Lake, 
the McKenzie Brothers just 
captured the town. 

They went to a saloon near the court, 
several pigs and chickens 
where occupeing the floor, 
and what some dirty men did....
well, I'll leave that for others to tell. 

Gouvernant Brunte and his wife Labradora-Beth
placed on stools hanging on the bar 
trying to avoid the brothers 
by looking in another direction. 

Among the other places they took care of 
- to say the least, were the bank, 
the library which was burned down, 
and the jailhouse was left in ruins. 

The very next day 
a telegram reaches the lokal post office. 
It said: the U.S Cavalery is moving south 
to solve the problem with the McKenzie klan.
Bountyhunters where now seen all over the town.
After having read the telegram 
Jack gathered the McKenzie klan. 

Next destination: The cathouse in El Paso, 
we better split town immediately. 
They got to cross the Mexican border. 
That is their only chance to survive.

Tried to rob a train with cattle
He laid in ambush above the hills
Early Sunday morning
He blew the tracks to smithereens
With the biggest blast you've ever seen
And the cattle ran all over the place
And there was Bob with the longest face

And I will come to.""

(K-OS)
My method is wild, original style
Acoustic, some'll refuse it
Cause they don't know the real
The Seventh Seal, is broken so I be smokin'
On these whack rappers, cause they never knew the time
Easy to find, out the way things are
But how it's supposed to be is to far
For your mind to grasp so you follow the mass
Playin' the role of a mack, but deep inside the mack knows
The spirit is under attack, and I lead the war
With my battalion, lyrical stallion, riding
Dividing the sheep from the golden lyrical quote
If not you could get smoked, by the mind is sore genius
I mean this I guarantee you never seen this before
Rappin' over guitars and finger snaps
My rapid raps, open a whole fire bun
He told me son, so check it out

[Chorus]

(Red 1)
Yo, my war's against the foundation
Of a global united nation
When humans rule the world
By the codes of free mason
Hallucinated, by the quest for domination
An equation, which equals the battle station
Ready to bust, capture and crush
Move a nine of us, stealth style rebellious
Prefer profile, cause the beast is hideous
So move agile, seek the facts and compile
More wisdom, smokin' isms
That your knowledge and your children
Give thanks and it has nothin' to do
With the fuckin' Pilgrims
Startin' the curriculum, the Devil wants to be Ichiban
Interception is how this is done
But by the locks of the dreaded don aka Red one
We'll emerge the champion cause the war is on
So grab your Teflon, your muskets and your swords
And peace love and unity will be your reward

Else take a closer look you'll see she's in a world of
Loneliness and in the club everybody knows her well'
But deep inside she knows she can't call them friends

Offering she bring them home, next morning she's alone
Again she swear to the mirror never to do coke again

Her beauty cannot be measured with standards of a colonized mind
Darker than blue darker than her blackness 
Unblemished her features broad and striking 
She cradles his body with her large hands 
Her fingers stretch endlessly into his world of pain 
Her caresses warm and penetrating she loves the black boy 
His existence predestined to be one of no remorse compassion 
Or the delusion of equality 
But the love he gives (a doxology for her) 
He praises and cares for what he can never be

Surely you understand
Just what I'm feeling
You said yourself before
It's time for you to get more

I'm on my way to somewhere
I don't know and I don't care
I just can't wait to get there

You miss out on all you've
Been waiting for
Find that there's so much more

True love and just making it
Instead of wasting time
I'm gonna get mine

Time for make a change
Think I better let it go
Time for me to break the rules

On tons of foolish fears
And I'm no use to me

Time for me to make a move
Think I better let it go
Time for me to break the rules

I've given everything to you
Everything I had to give
It's time for me to start anew
Time for me to live

I gotta let it go, I gotta make my move
It's time for me to break the rules
You said it yourself, you gotta give yours
Well, I gotta give mine
And I ain't wasting no more time",Let It Go,1998

Lookin' in windows at things I couldn't want 
There's johnson's hardware and morgans jewelry
And the ol' Lee king's apothecary
They ware the little man
The little man

I go back now and the stores are all empty
Except for an old coke sign from 1950
Boarded up like they never existed
Or renovated and called historic districts
There goes the little man
There goes the little man

Now the court square's just a set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
Bout the little man that built this town
Before the big money shut em down
And killed the little man
Oh the little man

He pumped your gas and he cleaned your glass
And one cold rainy night he fixed your flat
The new stores came where you do it yourself
You buy a lotto ticket and food off the shelf
Forget about the little man
Forget about that little man

He hung on there for a few more years
But he couldn't sell slurpees
And he wouldn't sell beer
Now the bank rents the station
To a down the road
And sell velvet Elvis and
Second-hand clothes
There goes little man
There goes another little man

Now the are lined up in a concrete strip
You can buy the world with just one trip
And save a penny cause it's jumbo size
They don't even realize
They'er killin' the little man
Oh the little man

It wasn't long when I was a child
An old black man came with his plow
He broke the ground where we grew our garden
Back before we'd all forgot about the little man

And it's impossible to erase
Still it scares me when I hear what I hear

They gamble on the time and the date it will end

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Bundled up and setting down
Catching snow flakes on the ends of their tongues
Standing up on the top would be
The prettiest girl he's ever seen
Whispering a quiet prayer for everyone.

But he's just a dad
Who's trying to protect the most precious thing he has
Some day he'll be home again
His world will be right

Buck buck pow it's the sound of the shallow streets of my hood
And it's makin' me frown
Steadily standin' me, feelin' me, backin' me, bring it on to the top

Get your groove on, put your strap on

Couldn't keep me asleep gotta sleep till dawn

Might get rid of the heat so I sit on
My seat 'fore I slip or get prick on my feet makes me sick
As I peeped out the street, got a tip for the treat
Better hit down the beat start to lead on this song
Couldn't keep me home
Close up the wind blow
Get in the car and close up the window lookin' in far and
Ya'll better be holler me for battle as I rebel against the devil
Friends form the past

Reefer Madness Cast,"Good morning, Worm, your Honor
The Crown will plainly show
The prisoner who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed showing feelings

Showing feelings of an almost human nature
This will not do
Call the schoolmaster

I always said he'd come to no good
In the end, your Honor
If they'd let me have my way
I could have flayed him into shape

But my hands were tied
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder
Let me hammer him today

I am crazy truly gone fishing
They must have taken my marbles away
Crazy toys in the attic, he is crazy

You little shit, you're in it now
I hope they throw away the key
You should've talked to me more often than you did

But, no, you had to go your own way
Have you broken any homes up lately?
Just five minutes, Worm, your Honor
Him and me alone

Babe, come to Mother, baby
Let me hold you in my arms
M'Lord, I never wanted him to get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me?
Worm, your Honor, let me take him home

Crazy, over the rainbow
I am crazy bars in the window
There must have been a door
There in the wall when I came in
Crazy over the rainbow, he is crazy

The evidence before the court is incontrovertible
There's no need for the jury to retire
In all the years of judging I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving the full penalty of law

The way you made 'em suffer
Your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate

Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers

Woo
Woo

All my niggas gone bust they guns
Real mother fuckers never trust niggas, but we trust our guns
Get money is the code of the streets
Live by it, and they say the hotter the bullets, the colder the streets
Like the older the hammer, the older the beef
You holding the can and you busting or you die with your heat
Me and my niggas gone survive in the street
For one reason, we ain't living to kill niggas, just dieing to sleep
I'm in the hood and I ain't wear a vest
Push a stock GTO, with a pump in the seat and a desert eagle in the head rest
Live and I took 5, get respect cause I wont die
So its a bet that I'm gone ride

[Chorus: x2]
I'm riding dog, you riding with me? (ride with me)
If I'm frying dog, you frying with me? (fry with me)
If I'm dieing dog, you dieing with me? (die with me)
Just know when the beef come, we all busting our guns (what?)

We can beef, I don't give a fuck, any street, stoop or block
Compton, New York City of Rocks
You ain't never been out the hood? don't go to far
12 gauge shotty, with a pump like Joe Dumar's
Shells the size of Sprewell lugs, go through cars
Rip apart your new Bentley nigga, like Dre sent me
The haze in me make me wanna kick back
Your man work out at bally's, put the 38 to a 6 pack
And beef keep the E.R full til the shit packed
No more rooms? let em die in the streets
Im from the CPT, where niggas dieing to eat
Them niggas with scars under they left eye and they cheek
Park a 745 on your street
Like mother fucker if you don't ride with me, you can die with the enemy
Or die like the Kennedy's nigga
I empty desert clips out like a bottle of Hennessy nigga

[Chorus: x2]

I got niggas that'll beef for the game
Run up on your man, splat his brain then bring you his chain
So if you owe my hood, you better pay up
I roll with killas, that'll put you in a hole like a lay up
Ain't no sleep on the block, my niggas stay up
Cause they ain't trying to miss sales
They trying to tip over fish scales
Be in the XXL, and its only 6 street rappers if you wanna be real
That go for the whole industry you bitch ass niggas
Say my name in a verse if you ready to die
I call up my Harlem niggas on the i95
10 minutes later you dead on the I95
Aftermath mother fucker, we ain't playing this shit

Never telling one another leave tht in the house

Look who's on TV, look who just got famous
Don't you know it should have been me

I'm not really bitter, I'm not really mad

Everything I ever wanted to have

Well I don't really care, how big they get

I hate you, fuck you leave me alone
I hate you, fuck you leave me alone
I hate you, fuck you leave me alone

Why can't I be cool like them?

I used to have a girlfriend
I treated her so bad, she went out
And found another lead singer
Maybe she just likes guys in bands

I give up on everything
All my dreams are dead
Maybe I'll get a shotgun
And try to blow her right out of my head

Well everybody says, ""How come you ain't made it yet?""

I hate you, fuck you leave me alone
I hate you, fuck you leave me alone
I hate you, fuck you leave me alone

Why can't I get my girl back?

I knew you wouldn't understand
Just what I'm tryin' to do
'Cause you're not fuckin' me
And I'm so glad that I am not fuckin' you
1, 2, 3, 4

I know it's my problem, there's nothing I can do
I don't think there is no reason
I don't think there's no excuse for you

Well I've learned my lesson
I hope you've learned it too
And if they're gonna go and do it to me
Well I guess I'm gonna have to go and do it to you

This one a tribute
Jump and shout
Jump with joy
We close our eyes 
(C'mon baby)
We close our eyes and dream and the world has turned around again
Oh
When everybody is runnin' in the big race
And having a good time
Who am I to cast a shadow
Who am I?
I looked Death in the face last night
I saw him in a mirror
And he simply smiled
He told me not to worry
He told me just to take my time
Chorus:
We close our eyes and the world has turned around again
We close our eyes and dream and another year has come and gone
We close our eyes and the world has turned around again
We close our eyes and dream
And if you come to me
And if you touch my hand
I might just slip away
I might just disappear
Who am I?
And if you think I'm worth it
And if you think it's not too late
We might start falling
If we don't try to hard
We might start falling in love

(Chorus)
We're on the healing path
We're on a roller coaster ride
That could never turn back
And if you love me
And if you really try
To make the seconds count

Reel Tight,"Got a little something for the summertime
While you on the grind
Getting yours
Hell yeah! I'm getting mine
I take trips and dips just to recline
I blaze up the orange weed 
To relax my mind
Spend time with my kids on the weekdays
And I holla at my momma and my 
Grandma on the threeway
She say, If you do right 
Baby boy I promise you live 
A long life
I can't argue
I try hard to
Not blast niggas
I walk past niggas
With my head up to the skedai
Nigga tried to pull a fast one 
On Snoop Dogg
To get some shut eye
What I do to him I can't speak
You know the episode
And the code on the street
I keep it all the scriffin' y'all
But real street for y'all
Cause you never know
When you're gonna go, no

You never know where this road's gonna take you
Got to be strong
You got to hold on
Cause you never know, where
This life's gonna lead you 
Just Hold on
You never know

From the killing 
The robbing
The squabbing
And jacking
Car jacks to kidnaps
What? Niggas be acting a fool
Trying to set me up at the park
But I'm cool
Act a fool
My daddy said throw them thangs
And stay strong
My momma got sick
So I'ma keep it strong
As long as I got my feet in the game
And make this beats
And bring heat to the game
Fuck the fame
I got a little boy to see through
And him without me 
Is like me without you
Keep it true
And stay down for your grips
Homies and licks staying tight
Like this 
You never know

You never know where this road's gonna take you
Got to be strong
You got to hold on
Cause you never know, where
This life's gonna lead you 
Just Hold on
You never know

You niggas never know
Which man are blasted for
Never know which man to kill
Just to settle the score
It wasn't long ago
I had this partner of mine
Knew him just a short time
But he's stuck in my mind
My nigga lived perfect
Said the streets wasn't worth it
If you don't die rich in the game
Then what's the purpose for this struggle?
We stay piece to puzzle 
Invest half the wealth
And pray to god it double
We just in this
Trying to get rich at the interest
Keep it pimping
Stay with niggas that's relentless
Smoke dough
Just because I say so
Money pronto
And niggas never would know 
They never know nigga

You never know where this road's gonna take you
Got to be strong
You got to hold on
Cause you never know, where
This life's gonna lead you 
Just Hold on
You never know

Ricky got shot in the face,
I saw Abrahams brain split on the pave,
He jumped off the block, right where the kids play,
We used to sit everyday,
Chattin' sh*t, We all strayed,
I guess its deep-seeded urban decay,
From my angle I can see the ghetto burning away,
I wanna cry, I find myself turning away,
This kid 16, Burning the yay,
Mislearning the game,
I send a prayer for the pain

To come in the way, Is it supposed to be like this?

U can't tell what's round the corner,
Going to jail, Or fail,
Getting f**ked up,
Like them little black kids from Bronxtale,
Well, As long as we're living in hell,
In the streets violence will always swell,
I can tell u a thousand tales,
Documented and detailed,
And most niggas can relate around the world,
My nigga Kurt got found,
With bullet rounds in his chest,
Up in the ATL,
And the papers hate me well,
I'm trying to revoke the violence,
Not promote the violence,
This is my broken silence,
And u can hear my screams louder than police sirens,
I'm tryna fight back,
Like my n*gga little Byron,
Just as long as I love and stay vibrant,
I shall provail,
And I shall not betrayal,
I shall put my hands up at the end and say I done wrong,
Only time I tell, fo' real

I guess we need more stability,
It's like we're imprisoned in the ghetto and it's getting to me,
To the point where I'm feeling institutionalized,
Look in my eyes,
U'll see pain in it,
But who can decide?
Whether I stay entrapped in,
Packed in,
Or fly from the restraining of thoughts packed in,
Inside my brain but,
I proclaim that I will withstand the rain in,
In order to get out this game, plus,
The media, Government,
Tried to blow us,
But they can't out the flame,
Or doubt the name,
Sh*t and ur evolution's about to change,
Trust me,
Sitting round tables with the ties and shirts,
With the lust to discuss me,
You disgust me,
So I must be,
As level headed as I can,
To neva back pedal on the plan,
So we can all hold hands together,
Unite so we can live as one

Reena Bhardwaj,"I have lived life until now to the height of enjoyment
My physical body accompanied by a conscious mind
Endless desires swirl outside of me
HE is also taking me along his cosmic path giving me experience of seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling and feeling
I feel content while sleeping, crying, laughing, eating and drinking
Day and night I think that there must be some purpose to this life
I have come to understand joy and sorrow due to lust, anger, greed, attachment and ego
I have started to think about what is the characteristic won't of life and about what is the uncharacteristic won't of life,
About what is benevolent use of mind and words and what is harmful use of mind and words
And about what is sin and what is virtue
Thus no more desire or expectation for past, present or future remains with me
My mind has gone beyond past, present and future and beyond the rational intellect of imagination
I see that I am beyond birth and death and am enjoying mind in a state of samadhi

An Indian friend of mine recently translated Chetan Jeevan (Conscious Life) for me and I thought I would share this in case other people are interested. My friend doesn't speak very good English so I've had to piece this together quite a bit. I'm sure it's more eloquent in its' original form and if anyone can help with a truer translation then please feel free!
I use the definitions given by Shrii Shrii Anandamurti-ji for Dharma and Satya but realise that Hindu and Buddhist definitions are various and differ.

Reese Crenshaw,"John Henry was about three days old,
Sittin' on his papa's knee.
He picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel;
Said, ""Hammer's gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord.
Hammer's gonna be the death of me.""
The captain said to John Henry
""Gonna bring that steam drill 'round.
Gonna bring that steam drill out on the job.
Gonna whop that steel on down. Down,
Down.
Whop that steel on down.""
John Henry told his captain,
""A man ain't nothin' but a man,
But before I let your steam drill beat me
Down,
I'd die with a hammer in my hand. Lord,
Lord.
I'd dies with a hammer in my hand.""
John Henry said to his shaker,
""Shaker, why don't you sing?
I'm throwin' thirty pounds from my hips on
Down.
Just listen to that cold steel ring. Lord, Lord.
Listen to that cold steel ring.""
The man that invented the stream drill
Thought he was mighty fine,
But John Henry made fifteen feet;
The steam drill only made nine. Lord, Lord.
The steam drill only made nine.
John Henry hammered in the mountain
His hammer was striking fire.
But he worked so hard, he broke his poor
Heart.
He laid down his hammer and he died. Lord,
Lord.
He laid down his hammer and he died.
John Henry had a little woman.
Her name was Polly Ann.
John Henry took sick and went to his bed.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man. Lord,
Lord.
Polly Ann drove steel like a man.
John Henry had a little baby.
You could hold him in the palm of your
Hand.
The last words I heard that poor boy say,
""My daddy was steel-driving man. Lord,
Lord.
My daddy was a steel-driving.""
Well, every Monday morning
When the bluebirds begin to sing.
You can hear John Henry a mile or more.
You can hear John Henry's hammer ring.
Lord, Lord.
You can hear John Henry's hammer ring.",John Henry,2001

And a feller on an old banjo, and the man of the fiddle
He wasn't no slouch he could really drag that bow
Well, the man on the fiddle he must have got tired

And I don't want to take the wrong way
But sometimes that gets hard to say
If you were willing to let it be

You were hurt once, but that's not me
I will never let you down
I could never let you
Go, scream it out at the top of your lungs

Let em know those days are done
And you won't be turning back
To the one who left you nowhere
It's not enough to ignore it

So I floor it
Get away for today
Give myself to devotion and yer motion
All is well, you can tell

And I don't want to take the wrong way
But always I get in the way
He stole you right away from you (and from me)
Aimless (clueless)

Knowing you would leave him all along
And I'd come back for you
Leaving was a mistake all along
And I was wrong

Elizabeth you are an angel
But that only gets you so far
So who would leave you in the backseat
Baby you can drive my car

And I wish you could hear
But you disappear
Floating in between
Daylight and a dream
We could crash and burn
And I never learn
I'm still young
And I'm dumb
I don't mind
And when you're here I'm alright
I am fine
Leave me out

Not a trace, of doubt in my mind

Reflection Eternal,"Yeah Hi Tech 
Whom do we aspire to reflect on peoples death 
Who's entertainment shall we sing our agony 
of our hopes 
That the destroyers aspiring to extinguish us will suddenly 
suffer remorse at the sight of their own fantastic success? 

The last imbecile to dream that dream is dead 
He was killed by the saviors of his own dream 
Our movement 

Verse One 
I'm not a human being into no spirtual shit 
Spiritual remanifested as a human that's it 

When i spit i spray thoughts that's representing my life 
Yo i step into the spot leave niggas open like mics 
Take on em on a tour 
Explore psychologies of war 
Things you can't imagine if you've never seen em before 
Shorties come back raw 
Straight out the see- 74 
I welcome them back to the world they think is run by laws 
The world is run by men who use laws for tools 
I come through war tactics like Shaka Zulu 
Mcs is soft like play-doh 
I shape 'em 
smash em to pieces 
(?) 
Slaves crave the words i'm painting 
The masterpieces 
You hear em on the radio babbling 
But the truth is traveling with the word 
As they're flying through the air like a javelin 
Unraveling like a verdict 
Pound it in your chest like a gavel in the highest court 
In Bablyon, let's travel on 
If the world is foul, and you think foul is how you got to live 
Then from the get your ass was foul 
And foul just is how you is 
No excuses see, life's dilemnas are set up like a mirror 
Just to show you all your faces 
Now your clearer understanding is clearer 
You had your chance for revolution. 

You let it pass you by 
That's why 
I'm dissing wack mc's till the day that I die 
Reflection getting you high 
We stand our ground with the believers 
The leaning tower of Pisa and the Pyramids of Giza 
No comparison 
The way I flip it is embarrassing 
Tis the season 
Ain't no caroling 

verse 2 
All knowing 
Flowing like spring water in the desert 
Balling through the barren land 
Where niggas take a stand, like castles made of sand 
Free falling 
For anything 
Nothing but a plan to fail for they selves 
No sense of delf, needed daily affirmations of self help 
Yo it's right in front of yo grill stop looking everywhere else 
Speaking of planning, 
Hustling and scheming 
Looking for hookups 
Took up too much time 
Like a fiend for rocks that got cooked up 
God bless the child that got his own shit 
I got my team's 
So the fiends now become opponents 
They the opposition 
Stronger from competition 
Shining like a golden shower, your face i'm pissing in 
Completing a genocide mission like 
The Warren commission 
Like fathers was supposed to be missing 
While our sisters were supposed to be whoring 
Save it for a rainy day, money is pouring 
Under grey clouds, black butterflys still be soaring 
Flying in frienldy skies 
We classifying the highs 
Blood be flowing in the streets like crimson tide in my eyes 
Tye be having me drowsy 
But I get mellow with the chronic 
Intellectuals embarrassed cause we discussing ebonics 
I'm on a roll like sonic 
In an age that the plague got bubonic proportions 
Yo I call it reparations, but they call it extortion 
Whatever 
Just give me mine 
But caution 
You've been warned for the very last time 
I'm not telling you again 
So relay it to your crew 
You gotta actually to do 
Forget the drive in, driveby and drive through 
You've got to 
Get out the car 
Humble yourself 
Tilt your head back, and look at the stars 
Shining over someplace very far, from where you standing 
When the night is clear 
You understanding just who put them there 
What you know about the space you get lost in 
Your peoples can't hear you in the distortion 
The desert is absorption 
And you sucked and you stuck off american freezing for like 
2000 seasons 
Upon your return from raping and crossbreeding 
Your own people accuse you of deceiving and misleading 
Causing mass confusion. Drug abusing 
Now you all caught up in institutions 
At this time you've got to break it down and be showing and proving 
An A&R told me that i use to many catch phrases 
true I'm trying to catch all my people in all different stages all 
different phases 

it's like that y'all...",2000 Seasons,1997

Yo Hi Tek they still sleepin' 
As a right we still peakin' 
They still weakin' we adventurous thrill seekin' 
We will begin new ways of freakin' it 
It's the dawn of the MC who think before he spit 
On Mission we intercept your transmission 
Bringin exactly what the fans missin' 
You, bare witness to, the transition like 
Give me that microphone, man listen 

Yo, I literally 
Obliterate MC's who rhymin' pitifully 
Let's get it straight like degrees of longitude and latitude 
Adjust your position like your attitude 
Even cats frontin' had to move 
Now let's begin, while you testin' these better men 
You get fucked up like it's your first Friday as freshman 
Letter man on the varsity team, I pipe dream 
Make they cream freeze like reindeer caught up in high beams 
Yo it seems that they sedative like open wounds and I'm lyrically salty 
All your shit is faulty, watch me turn jams into revolutionary parties 
Stoppin' your heart piece, while we write soliloquies wit Sharpies 
We stay in the air like aerosol to carry y'all 
?Over crept in? MC's like Jerotol 
We men in the mirror y'all, your career is like a metaphor for suffering 
When we rush in, beat these niggas like percussion 
You ain't touchin' nuttin' 
I give instructions and move on your weak production 
Drop that African king shit and the royal flushing 
Respect the queen, from straight from BK

[Chorus]
 
""Talib Kweli it's the Reflection"" ""Hi-Tek"" 
""When we livin this shit"" ""Out of the 7-18 we meet the 51-3"" 

I blast through your illusions 
Shatterin' your shadow as I snatch the light from you 
When I want to, confusion is the conclusion you come to 
That's the best you could come up wit 
When your brain pattern is scattered and that's why you dropped that dumb shit 
Click first when we hit next when I'm dispersing 
Cursing me like ham 'cause I'm original when you're like the King James version 
You need a surgeon to put you back together 
When your parts is missin' like aquarian gospels 
We can get more hostile without peace 
Believe we balance positivity wit negative 
Legal and illegal 'cause it's relative 
If the law prevent me from being a man, then what's the deal? 
In the Hour of Chaos, my microphone's my Black Steel 
I grip it wit that sure shot feel 
Drivin' through your mind, Hi-Tek be on the wheels 
We ride up on your heels, talkin' back now 
You pop more junk than a thane or bird? 
Fallin' flat on your face, you got caught trippin' off your words 
Explain that simunicy? 
You oxy-moron, pimpled faced dummy goin' through puberty 
Flippin' late night through cable channels lookin' for nudity 
You're junior-high, what could you do to me 
Nuttin' is new to me but I'm still learnin', what 

Hip-hop is in our hearts and we On Mission from the start 
To leave our mark up on this rock 
Too many people is just livin' 
Hip-hop is in our hearts and we On Mission from the start 
To leave our mark up on this rock 
Too many people is just livin' 

[Chorus]

Listen listen, huh man listen 
We intercept the transmission 
Bringin' exactly what you fans missin' 
Hi-Tek 
Uh uh, Talib Kweli yo 
Exactly what it's supposed to be yo 
None of y'all niggas is close to me, yo 
Step back before you get your head cracked 
Yo steppin' in through set back, I never sweat that 
Aiyyo my man see Smith is jet-black 
That's okay though, aiyyo 
I build these niggas up and then I smash em to the ground like Play-Dough 
And then I lay low",On Mission,1999

I cater to these markets first, cause they gravitate to me
And appreciate the vision of what I do musically

Mmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmm!!
I walked in and they stared, see how they screwin me
Break you down, til you ain't the man you used to be
Domination of my jurisdiction, people's addiction to lies
It blurs the lines between the fact and fiction
Now we back omission, I fix your face for you, keep yappin
You start to hate the man in the mirror like Michael Jackson

Majors they try to hold me captive but mine are figure factions
But the foundation of hip-hop hold my braincells for ransom
I chance none, fuck them spots on charts and number one
If it's meant, then I'll accept it gracious when the time comes

Inject some substance deep inside of rap's core

Money it's classic these bastards try to treat us like cattle
So life has been a constant battle, battle
Rising above the crabs in the barrel
Way too used to living in death's shadow
We stay on point like the best arrow, arrow
We hit the target accurate
Star shit, back it up
When we hit town, why'all niggas pack it up
That's how we get down, straight smash it up
Like a whip, hydroplaning
Hydro on the brain and maintaining
Game changing into subtle shit, we remain blatant

You get replaced in this game, by Kweli
Place the face with the name

Like slaves on a ship talking about who got the flyest chain

You fakin the part of gangster, til niggaz break in your spot
You straight bitch whether I say it or not
Shit is hot, spittin flames on the track
Put our town's names on the map
From now until we fadin to black
Where we at? thug rebels love metal clubs ghetto
When the slugs let go like frankie beverly
Forever we stack notes like the treasury, flow heavenly
Get you high on speech laced with obscenity
Niggaz be gassed like cipher sounds, and need rescue remedy
Then fall the fuck off like limbs affected with leprosy

[all] one, two, three, four
[x2z] why the fuck can't mc's mc no more?
Hardcore til somebody put me under the ground
With a dick in your ear, still couldn't fuck with my sound
[all] one, two, three, four
[x2z] takin me straight to the weed spot, then to the liquor sto'
""gimme some mo'"" like busta bus', who do you trust?
Swingin through, your favorite neighborhood lush

[xzibit]
I'm I-rate, usin your body for live bait
Xzibit rockin them heavy gems you can't take
Dilate, cock back the weight, spread hate
Heavy metal we settle and set shit straight
Hit gates in my younger days, from the policeman
Me and my clan used to dance thicker than quicksand
Supply and demand the hand is quicker than the eye
Find some chickens to fry, while you find it hard to stick to your lie
I see through the tricks, destroy the facade
Your little lungs is too weak to hotbox with god
Rah digga, first lady of the flipmode squad
Gotta be hard like a young nigga walkin the yard
For the first time, we ain't the niggaz you let shine
Expect mines to blow lines like coke everytime
I'm an alkaholik nigga so I finish the fifth
You at the front door bitchin because you ain't on the list

The system thats based on trying to stop you from shinning your light
We dying in spite of getting rich
That's why I rhyme like a battle emcee
Battling the tragedies and fallacies
That be killing niggas quicker than infant mortality
They acting like whats going on now is distant reality
Behaving so casually that they become a casualty
Plus they don't wanna battle me anyway
They try to walk away but they stumble like Macy Gray

Reflection Eternal,"These niggas ain't thugs, the real thugs is the government
Don't matter if you independent, democrat or republican
Niggas politickin the street, get into beef
Start blastin, now a new cat is executive chief
With a, passion for heat you get, blast in yo' seat
Die before you crash in yo' Jeep, never passion in your sleep
Like an old man, you ain't a fool you got a whole plan
To conquer territories like Europeans who stole land
The future of your whole fam' hang in the balance
You the king, and your block is the palace
Y'all niggas is the parliament, untouchable, spot unrushable
Keep your weight wet, call in collect to save a buck or two
Get mad, who the fuck are you? What you gonna do?
Exactly what I thought, NOTHIN, in the sport of frontin
You the undisputed champion, I'm in a class you can't be in
My words is flesh like Jesus, the aquarian

It's just a chapter of the night, in the ghetto afterlife
Where you just seen or heard about or gonna have to fight
Where they sacrifice the life and niggas see flashes of light
When you trapped up in the heights but clappers aimin at the wife

Yeah, dudes gettin money is still thuggin
Chicks gettin money is still ghetto
Still livin the whole thuggish stilleto
Your team let the metal burst before you take an L
You raised in hell, let the dust settle first
Then you ask the question, snatchin the life of the innocent
Shit happens huh, a man's respected by his actions
It's the karma of the street, you try to meet the karma
While the karma sleep, yo it's deep, but the karma can't be beat
You don't know your enemy, so you fightin with yourself
Relate to rap niggas cause they writin what you felt
You got top shelf connects you gettin seasoned like a veteran
We suck the venom out the snake bite, without the medicine
We benefit from niggas in tenements, dyin for benjamins
So bad that they know they own coffin measurements
Ghetto eloquence, in the moment of truth, don't be hesistant
Or fall victim to the element, word is bond

Just another chapter of the night, in the ghetto afterlife
Where you just seen or heard about or gonna have to fight
Where they sacrifice the life and niggas see flashes of light
When you trapped up in the heights but clappers aimin at the wife

Niggas get caught up in the struggle
End up in court in trouble, sportin a bubble
Ford azure bubble, importer smuggle, forcin a rumble
Hit the blocks with a portion to double
Flip and get tossed in the huddle
Police with one piece short of the puzzle
It's a hustle, peep the street life, they movin muscle
And the G's'll make your knees buckle
Tussle with heat until your feet stand in a pee puddle
Cheese double but all the speedy niggas bleed puddles
Make the headlines; some try to escape the fed time
Phone taps on direct lines - tec-9's with the red shine
Jake climbin through the bedroom blinds
Tryin to bring you to your deadline, it's slippery when wet signs
Red time, wipe the sweat around your neck time
One shot spill out your red wine, rock shots to deafen your prime
Pieces of hot lead left in your mind
One slug to the left of your spine
Forever late to rest on the shrine",Ghetto Afterlife,2000
Reflection Eternal,"What's the meanin of ghetto fabulous
Not ridin the back of the bus
I'm a revolutionary antagonist
Some playas is mad at us for just doin our music out of love
Some underground heads is hatin cause we have fun at clubs
I'm probably on some government list for my rhymin
You a fool if you don't think they already tapped your line
Medicine is big business so my remedies is herbal
It's music is for the people so we Reflection Eternal
Listen, you hear the difference between science and science fiction
We blow it out like if you leave on every appliance in the kitchen
at once, still rolling kind bud in Cuban blunts
On the corner watchin how kids comin to Brooklyn for they fronts
Niggas run past what they need chasing after what they want
Fuckin chumps, you walk down the street and get jumped
Brooklyn cats like to bubble out of town no lookin back
When you a ghetto chef you mastered the art of cookin crack
Some get caught sleepin on the Mother City so when they go
They come back as tales of niggas we used to know
Never looked up to see the stars in all they heavenly glory
Just straight ahead cause the peripheral is buildings with mad stories
Not floors but dramas is played out, shorties get laid out
like respect and fade out like TV sets
into the banks of our memories (let it be) we'll never forget you
Lyin on your deathbed askin for God to bless you

Good mourning, good afternoon, good night
What have you done with your life?
Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light
You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man
I'm puttin up a hellafied fight

I need you all to be clear on exactly what I'm sayin
With your attention span I understand that I ain't playin
You mistaken if you somehow think it's just me you facin
Starin me down while your enemy is standin adjacent
My heart is racin but I know just what I stand for
We chasin death carelessly like +Jessica+, I +Care Moore+
Who said, ""Just because no one can understand how you speak
don't necessarily mean that what you be sayin is deep""
In case you die in your sleep you ask the Lord for a blessin
Sometimes they sneak up so quiet that the silence is deafenin
You'll never know who the assassin is until it's your time to go
Your life is flashin, askin for forgiveness but you move too slow
Now the people that you love bear the pain that you once harbored
You was livin for yourself so you could never be a martyr
Life is hard, death is harder; you somebody baby father
Someone's lover, son of your mother, somebody brother
Somebody nigga, now your spirit in the air like a whisper
Hearin your name mentioned when we pourin out some liquor
The days go by quicker and the nights don't seem to differ
It's gettin cold, so I shivered and asked my soul to be delivered

Good mourning, good afternoon, good night
What have you done with your life?
Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light
You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man
I'm puttin up a hellafied fight

Reflection Eternal,"Yo, we're going to have the word love
In many different languages translated all through the track
So, whenever you hear the word love
Know that, it's going to be in a different language
The language of love cannot be translated, yo

Love is blind, you just see bright light
You up in the club feelin' the night life, lookin' for the right type
Blood rushing to your heart making it beat
When she swept you off your feet and made it complete
You know the plan you had to conquer the world
Thinking you Scarface, looking for that perfect girl
And now you found her
Started with romantic, then got to frantic
Then things that's normally small become gigantic
Now y'all sinkin' like the Titanic here come the panic
Bein' with you like a habit without you I can't stand it
It's tragic when you wonder when you lost that magic
Without understanding that you never had it try to grab it
In the bed gettin' a nut off, communication cut off
Getting mad cause you turned or wondering where she shut off
Constantly comparing you to someone in my past
We don't smile anymore, and we argue over cash
Advance to that physical shit
See what happens if you keep talkin'
See what happens if you lay a finger on me motherf
Yo, see what I'm sayin'
It's like one big mind game that everybody playin and
Niggas say bitches is trife, bitches say niggas is
We just don't understand our fundamental differences
I'm still learning though, actually
I just do what come naturally, naturally, naturally

Women thrive on emotions, men refuse to acknowledge
So when we arguin nobody win
Words get in the way time and again
Sticks and stones break your bones words break your heart
Whether you in touch with that part or not say ""word""
Words are weapons for the revolutionary
Used for evil make the situation very scary
Word up, but love is brave
It flies in the face of fear
Yo, wherever you want to go love'll take you there
Let's go, you know a flower that grow in the ghetto
Know more about survival than the one from fresh meadows
It got love for the sun, that's where I'm comin' from
Spit in this fashion cause I love rockin' over drums
Word (te quiero) I put my love into my music
If you with me then you love how I do it
If my heart you're livin' in your ocean I'm swimmin' in
Never drowning got me floatin' watching you in slow motion
Love potion overdosin' approachin'
The explosion of my senses everyday without your heart
Is like a sentence in jail
Trust I'll always be mentally free
You got the key to let it out I'll show you how it could be
Love {*different language*} it ain't nuttin' but a word
A chicken ain't nuttin' but a bird

Some of y'all in love with that material but
Love enter my life like a miracle and
It reciprocal that's why I'm feeling you love
We exibit our natural behavior
Like making love under the moon in Jamaica
Get you so hot you call the name of the creata
The morning we hop back into action again
Up on the wall lovin' how the sun blacken your skin
Remember when we explored the beach
Swam in the ocean and saw beneith
How the colors of the coral reef looked like the illest floral peice
That's what your beauty remind me of
It's hard to find a love like ours, taking it high above
Them other duns try to spit game but, I dont sweat it though
Know in my heart that we connected so I let it go
Now if they call you out your name and that's a different thing
Anything but Queen I'll go to war like a King
Your friends sweat you cause you ain't got a band
But they don't understand
Some things is meant to stay between a woman and man
And they ain't privy to it so they try to get into it
Both you and me see through it so the way we flow is fluid
We speak the love language, they speak from pain and anguish
Some don't love theyselves so they perception is tainted
Out they joint like ""Shit, he payin for your rent"" missin' the point
When you rub me into your skin just like an ointment
It's more than pillow talk, it can't be translated
Learn how to speak it, and become emancipated
It's a language

Get a collection of all the music and everything we've ever done

Bringing back sweet memories

Life, living in flatbush and going to house parties
Red lights, bumping, life is what you make it, then sorry
In my lifetime, ain't done too many things
Better than watching your first son put his sentences together
Yo, it kinda make me think of way back when
I was the portrait of the artist as a young man
All them teenage dreams of rapping
Writing rhymes on napkins
Was really visualization
Making this shit actually happen
It's like something come through me
That truly just consume me
Speaking through the voices of the spirits speaking to me
I think back in the day, I absorbed everything like a sponge
Took a plunge into my past to share with my son

Bringing back sweet memories

Like thoughts out the back of my mind
Going back in some time
Like when you used to cut and had to go to the back of the line
Look back and you find
Tracks that make you relax and recline
Now cats rap about packing a nine
When they lacking divine
Inspiration
Running out of topics of conversation
Well I drop it in the pocket because rocking's my occupation
I do it remarkably, spark up a leaf
And possibly you could follow me
Tap into your chi
Utilize your memory
To help you see clearly, then get back to me
Actually, nothing's new under the sun
So when life be stressing me
My remedy is 'bringing back sweet memories'
Like the faces that are woven in the fabric of my consciousness
From cities where making 21's a big accomplishment
Like when my people understood their prominence
And my past life visions of the continent
Like the first time I saw krs live, rockin' it
I heard resurrection by common sense
Dominant in my psyche
I chose my direction like spike lee
To speak my life through mics, and I never take it lightly
It might be something you did to bring you down when you were high
But that karma's a bitch, you steady asking god why
Like when my parents first split up
Yo, I was illin'
Seems like some years they was together for the sake of the children
And I love them for that
I don't know if they saw that
So I'mma say it, and convey it when the world play it (3x)

Bringing back sweet memories

Like black is beautiful, names from the seventies
Let me tap into your energy
Fields of dreams become my property
When I reach my destiny like a prophecy
Especially when I 'm 'bringing back sweet memories'
I got deep into my mind, see I got a treasury
That float through my head like a sweet melody
What you telling me
Reflection is a collection of memories
Definitely this is how hiphop was meant to be
Eventually, I knew I'd run into hi-teknology
It was only a matter of time like centuries
Check the recipe or technique to how it sound so sweet
I freak with word power, my man speak with beats
If I could make it in new york, I figured anywhere I'd make it
Came to cincinnati linked with mood, and we did sacred
Hi-tek beats became my favorite
Hustle on the side was the cut
We started to put songs together like 'what!'
Traveled the world, came back to the crib
And hit the motherland
Yeah, this year we put in work and got some other plans
In fact, that's where I'll take the fam
When the reflection joint is done
By the time you hear this, I'll be basking in african sun

Make me run up in your venue like What!
I snatch the mic and ask the crowd what are y'all waitin' for?
They say nothin' but that fat shit
I got you, say no more i laid the law and all them
Crab rappers played the floor I called them out
A couple of them steeped up and I ate 'em raw
Some more wack niggas tried to spray the door but had no aim
Later for them corn balls
On the way out smacked them in they face with a methaphor
For better or for worse you better call the nurse

Reflection Eternal,"We don't live for Hip-Hop, It lives for us

It's the eternalist, y'all burn to this, blaze da dro'
Soul rebels trap up, we got a long way to go
Before this here blow like a volcano
We get eternal, this is what you waitin' for
You try to front and play the role
When you more like a pimp who pay the ho
With my name up in your mouth like fellatio
I lace the flow on purpose even up the ratio
Of Hip-Hop to that shit they drop on the radio
Underground classics is what they used to say before
Now we break the surface quiet like an alligator nose
They hate it, cuz they know if they don't get it, then they may be slow
We still gonna blow like the horn played by Horatio
The stakes is three feet high and risin' like De La Soul
So I got Wonder Why, my man Dave and Maseo
We all got babies so we embrace the taste of dough
But y'all already know so I ain't gotta say no mo'

(De La) is whatcha need, (Reflection) is whatcha need
We got the masters of the ceremonies
Blessin' emcees (lip professin' emcees)
From LI to Brooklyn to Cinncinnati, Hi-Tek and Kweli got this on lock D
(Let me hear you scream out loud) if you're somebody
Party to party, body to body
When we come into the jam we do it wildstyle

Yo! I'm homegrown for the bain, once I rock the mic plain
It's the extravaganza we glad you came
Made only for them heads, it's infra-red Aim
For such a world figure, we got figures to gain
(don't sleep on a nigga)
I ain't Icabod Crane get that ass cooked hard cuz we raw like Kane
Been known to mic spit, infinite per frame
While these girls throw me plenty like jenny to jane
Ain't some old school G poppin' memory lane, been on it future robotic
Since the day I came
If you don't know Plug Wonder Why is my name
Most recognized leo with my size in mane
Matter a fact track is simple and Plain
Cuz the complexities I freeze is too deep to detain
Reflect, Kwa-Tone Tek eternally in the game (and De La) oh fo' sho'
We be shinin' the same

From LI to Brooklyn to Cinncinnati, Hi-Tek and Kweli got this on lock D
(Let me hear you scream out loud) if you're somebody
Party to party, body to body
When we come into the jam we do it wildstyle

Y'all think these challengers is here to make a man fold
Shoot I've been holdin' these joints since I was day old
Came to confirm the fact that I've been on the payroll
Stay cold til one day make it hot and fade old
Continue til I'm dyin, rottin' out gray and old
I told them fool before they pass they have to pay toll
While I've been sittin' at the table eatin' steak whole, side of greens
Baby yams you know it stay soul, pre-natal
But they want to come spit your way so
So was I supposed to go and say no
Right emcees some walking straight, some take the gay stroll
I get my man to clamp they asses like they staples
I'm from LI we take it far as out as naples
And scrape hoes who'll be willing to take clothes off (off)
See once you bet it all against reflects eternal
You lose every rapper on a dept

Or just V.I., to handle my B.I
When with my A-Alikes we see with three eyes

Yo Kweli I agree I, was thinkin the same thing myself
Smog in the city ain't no good for your health
Things changed in New York, type strange in New York
Forty-Deuce don't look the same in New York
Just politics, tricks and big games in New York
Switched trains a writer can't get fame in New York
Internet and Wall Street got paid in New York
Poor folks and workin class got slayed in New York
Even still, everyday they make weight in New York
Flashlights lookin for a brighter day in New York
In New York they say it's - red hot
Will the temperature ease up? Black I guess not
It's multi-lane traffic, no sign for rest stops
No corner breaks, put on your gloves and just box
No dance school to teach you to wop and bus stop
Better get up in the booth, hop up and just rock
If you think it's like that, it's not so just stop
All mankind time runnin down on one watch, just watch

If, you, are, just, coming, in, I, will

This is the ballad of the black gold
They call it Texas tea
But it's bigger than a cowboy with a lasso
It's deeper than a black hole
Create monopolies
Except they collect a fee when you pass go

Crisis' international
The government de facto
We got no control in this fiasco
Darker than the back roads
Bubble hotter than Tabasco
More than what you bargained for or asked for

You never see happy, hungry people; that ain't rational
They blasting through the gates and they attack you at the capital
Run up in your palace, find the head of the states and crack a few
Get a taste of power; then they become fascists too
The fiscal conservatives don't know what they purpose is
Money on the war; then they cut the goods and services
Murderous, corporate monsters is breaking records
Exxon is at forty billion a year--they raking in record profits, stop it
How they banking while the auto industry is tanking?
Leadership is sinking; oil pollution in the water stanking
Loyalty to petroleum; royalty spoiled the economy
We won't get it poppin' till we're oil-free
If you're oil-rich, then we invade it
They call it occupation, but we're losing jobs across the nation
Drill, baby, drill, while they make our soldiers kill
Baby, still, the desert where the blood and oil spill

Nigeria is celebrating fifty years of independence
They still feel the colonial effects of Great Britain's presence
Dictators quick to imitate the West
Got in bed with oil companies and now the place is a mess
Take a guess which ones came and violated
They oiled up the soil; the Ogoni people was almost annihilated
But still they never stayed silent
They was activists and poets using non-violent tactics
That was catalyst for soldiers to break into they crib
Take it from the kids and try to break 'em like a twig
And make examples of the leaders, executed Saro-Wiwa
Threw Fela's mom out the window right after they beat her
In an effort to defeat hope; now the people's feet soaked in oil (?)
So the youth is doing drive-bys through speed boats (?)
They kidnap the workers, they blowing up the pipelines
You see the fires glowing in the nighttime

[Chorus]

History, a slippery creature
It's full of plot twists and surprise endings like a mystery feature
This oil shit is slicker than preachers
It make the problems in the region amplify like victory speeches
Poison the water and lead the boys to the slaughter
Go in somebody country and rearrange the order and destroy the borders
You see them dancing through the fields of fire
World domination their real desire
The devil is still a liar

Ay, go ahead and kick it on in
Kick it in! Kick it In!

Everything, is gonna be alright, oh yeah

Strong arm robbery
Ponzi scheme, our foreign policy
War in the name of democracy
A lottery, a plot to run up in your private property
Cop a key, break it down, and call it the ricotta
Or the fetti, that’s a lotta cheese
Enough to make the innocent cop a plea
And stabilize economies, shopping spree
Copped a V, we stay driven by a lotta greed
The saddest sight is when the parasites bottom feed
The game of Monopoly, a terrorist bombing spree
Planes falling out the sky, like we was a Lockerbie
Look into the heart of a thief
You might go on vacation, become a patient
Somebody taking your artery
My lyrics merely taking a picture, this is photography
Obviously for some the poverty really hard to see
Honestly, I’ve come to the stage rock properly
I like my pockets fat, not flat
Word

Spending up all my time making ends
For all the money
It’s the only thing on my mind, right now
That matters
Tried to change my mind

Gotta check? Let me underwrite it
Spendin’ money on the flesh, attention undivided
The promise of funds got ‘em strip to their undergarments
For the skrilla, they willin’ to diss your mama
Like the show with Wilmer Valderamma
I grind harder cause I gotta live
My ancestors swung from the ropes
Now my knot is thick
This is Apocalypse Now, rising to prominence
Never go against the family, it’s Godfather shit
My hypothesis, stop your breath like an octopus
Gettin’ hold of your esophagus
Try to rob, I’ll pop you quick
Promise you will not evict
On a reconnaissance mission for where the profit is
No I’m not the office type, quite the opposite
Despite accomplishments, I’m hungry as a starving artist is
The knowledge from this metropolitan perspective
More effective than scholarships to the best colleges

Spending up all my time making ends
(Kick it In! Kick it In!)
For all the money
It’s the only thing on my mind, right now
(Ay man, gimme my money!)
That matters
Tried to change my mind

So basically, the moral of the story is:
Go get it, man
It’s the only thing right now that matters
I heard somebody say, “Money is the root of all evil”
Don’t believe that man
It’s the love of money, the pursuit of money
That’s the root of all kinds of evil, man..
So, Yo, somebody owe you money and they ain’t pay up
Tell ‘em you got five seconds,
You got five seconds, gimme my shit!

Aiyyo call the fire department cause the blaze has started
You ain't hot cause you flame retardant
I'm 'bout to hang up like a famous artist, in the Kweli museum
E'rybody feel him, can't nobody see him
Can't nobody be him, try as they might
But now it's dead, I defy afterlife
I spit in the face of the reaper as I address my wounds
Frontin for the chicks like Judy Blume
The dudes soon follow, they all sound recycled like bottles, cans
That's why I see through 'em like Hollow Man
They softer than model hands, no competition
Cause they flow not sufficient, they get thrown out the kitchen
Cause they can't take the heat, my throat is a flamethrower
Kweli and Tone ain't playin, it's game over
You could write it up, in the history books (look it up)
Or how they light it up, set it on fire, what? Fire it up!

We came here tonight to get loose
So before we leave we got to lift you
Higher than you ever been before, forget roof
Cause the world on fire, the girl on fire
Get loose, get loose, get loose, c'mon 
Get loose, get loose, get loose, c'mon 
Get loose, get loose, get loose, c'mon 
Get loose, get loose, get loose, c'mon 

When you're on the cross you against the wall
A-waitin' for more
Won't give a single dance
I seen it all before
But one day you'll find you should lose your mind
You can wait in self-control
Intoxicate yourself
Now get out on the floor
Get loose

Oh word, once again like
Let's get a peek like a booth for 40 deuce
Knew the D make her freeze, she lookin' for an excuse
To get loose, match the purse with the shoes, c'mon
You spit game, think she leavin' wit'chu, yeah right
They sip Goose with the juice, spit the truth, c'mon
And get loose, get loose, get loose, c'mon
Now you might have a shot in the dark, if you play your cards right
If not it's a long hard night
Now, what can you say to get her to leave wit'chu? (let's go!)
Got her in your sight, you a heat-seekin' missile (let's go!)
Spot her in the light, you wish you could be alone
Music in the back act like your theme song
You hate how it all sound like a ringtone
But when it come on in the club you sing along
She got one or two friends, bring 'em along
Un-less they wanted to mess, leave 'em alone

When you're on the cross you against the wall
A-waitin' for more
Won't give a single dance
I seen it all before
But one day you'll find you should lose your mind
You can wait in self-control
Intoxicate yourself
Now get out on the floor
Get loose

Ignore the amateurs
You're rolling with the glamorous
See all the clamor for the lights and the cameras?
They get scared when the glances turn amorous
Exposed to the heat, they go yellow like an amethyst
Used to be purple like the cannabis from welts and the bruises
Used to scream ""help""; it was useless
Escaped into the night with her life intact
A betrayal she described as a knife in the back
Stone-cold killer--you'd probably shudder
At the amount of blood flowing through the Hollywood gutter
All because of the appetite for dreams that will eat you up inside
She on your mind, probably keep you up at night
Fifteen minutes--that's all she really need
Director yell ""cut"" and we see how you really bleed
Stay in the game, stay in the frame, say her name: Fame, Fame

She's so fleeting, she's so deceiving, she's so misleading
She cut 'em open and bleeding; she got 'em overeating
She's so hot, soda pop; she's overheating
Her gun--American; her favorite rum--Puerto Rican
She's like a monkey on your back 'till you start to crack
She'll make you famous like the stars of ""Strapped""
The heart of the fact, to swallow that, she got a target on your back
Follow you until you drown in the sea of your sorrow
You overdose, she got you over, she got the potion
It's not a joke how she got 'em hoping--they should've tried the coke (?)
And everything designer from the kind of drugs she do
To the attitude when she get tired of loving you
I hear them swear they don't need her and throw dirt on her name
I'm out for the fortune; fuck Fame
I hear them swear they don't need her and throw dirt on her name
I'm out for the fortune; fuck Fame

[Chorus]

The mother cried the butterfly was a caterpillar
Before he fell in love with Fame 'cause he had to feel her
The model--hot; she swallowed shots, straight Tequila
The bottles pop; she love you, but can't wait to kill you
She lurking in the bushes--she the paparazzi
Her sex drive--way faster than a Maserati
Every relationship is work; this is not a hobby
She make you famous like Beyonce; then she got your body
How she grimy like a project lobby
But still snooty, pack Louis Vuitton and act bourgey
She like a ghost 'cause I shudder when she pass through me
She yell ""cut"" and you stop acting; it's your last movie
She got you in the gym, she got you in the spa
Staring at the man in the mirror wondering who you are
You're a superstar till she pass on you
Take a picture; it will last longer (word)

Welcome to my longitude and latitude
My attitude is shaping my surroundings
Skyscrapers, public housing

'Cause you ain't got no avenues
When it come to rapping, who's the baddest dude?

This a recession--what recession?

Shit been a mess and we been dealing with this depression

Oh, yes, indeed, I like this, I like this
Hey, yo, Hi-Tek, do me a favor, man
Speed it up a little bit

From the intro you know I'm so influential 'cause I'm glowing like a candle
The focus is so essential, dog; what you tryna get into?
I steady the flow, ready to blow like snotty tissue
They snitching like Donnie Brasco, I'm counting like Monte Cristo
The ghetto full of betrayal like Iago and Othello
Your fellow neighbor will slay you; they'll smoke you like cigarillos
Police want that info--they'll grill 'em like Portabellos
I'm murdering instrumentals 'cause I rap with the conscience
Of felons, killers, and monsters, so revealing and honest
We're still feeling the promise; some nights I kill 'em with kindness
Hitting like Muhammad Ali; you more like Tatyana
All this is probably Karma: you dishonored the father
Whether it's God almighty or the almighty dollar
We follow the prophets like Islamics or the Dalai Lama
Your bullet points so hollow they could probably pierce body armor
Look in the scope; my people still a target

Smile on my face, tears of a sad clown
Feeling out of place as I whistle a cab down
If I tip extra, can I huff a cig'?
Blow my smoke out the window, dropping ashes on the bridge
Uh, I'm in New York now like Akeem and Semi was
Tryna get the lobby door open from a semi-buzz
I just wanna go to the slum
And throw my money on the floor like the Notorious B-U-M, uh
Build a home, teach a class, start a revolution
Free the mind, heal the body, talking evolution
This that black Elohim, Anunnaki rap
That Farrakhan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Qaddafi rap
I dedicate this to my niggas in New Orleans
Rocking black and gold stocking caps and fleur-de-lis Shockey hats
I'm in the coatroom, screaming ""who that?"" on the double
Serving gumbo with a shovel, dog, I'm on another level
Me and Kweli come together like two pieces of metal
We magnetizing the ghetto

Yeah, now here's the memo
I'm a rebel without a cause, a bezel without no flaws
And, shorty, you straight; bet you look way better without no drawers
Let's sweat out this alcohol; bet I'm about to ball
And never let up; look how I just crept up without applause
Fed up with all the frauds and left y'all without a job
The center of attention; this is clever; I'm Pau Gasol
Really though I'm LeBron, really don't got my mind
On this new school of rappers I will really go Columbine
And throw up the diamond sign; boy, you know I'm-a shine
Flow is in Ramadan 'cause couple years ago the game had they pajamas on
But now they on my dick; man, I should throw a condom on
'Cause a nigga coming raw like I ain't got one on
And I ain't stopping nor copping no pleas; I just lock and load, squeeze
Dog, I'm on a higher level; I'm on top of nosebleeds
Niggas say they sick, but when they rock, they don't sneeze
Like the nigga on the block waving his glock, but won't squeeze
Please

Hold your applause until the ceremony end
Yours truly, truly blessed, yet again a noble planted
Super magic, abracadabra kid
Mysterious master Jim, blacker pen, arrowhead
With the long-barrel stem and his apparel fresh
Harbor lights shining out the black power grid
With the Black Power grip, and pure power don't power trip
Push the cellar ceiling up and make the tower tip
The Gladwell point and Babylon polish
All about nothing where it's all about the dollar
And mansions on the fault line of a shaky market
The Devil at the dance hall thirsty for a partner
Get off him; there is not a parcel or a portion
Or a measure of a fortune more awesome
Gorgeous, the funky Four Horsemen and one more
With Hi-Tek on the score, once more, of course

Summer nights there's water in the air; wish it would storm already

Hips barely fit through the door
Imagine that--she bought a dutch and a lemonade out the Escalade
Bumping ""Renegade"" by Em and Jay
Symmetrical braids, incredible edible legs
Just to track her down I went on a ghetto crusade
Serenade this angel like Cyrano de Bergerac
The lightness of her being was unbearable
So here I am at her apartment building, apart from feeling
""Heartless"" like Kanye with a talk-box
I walked four blocks out my way 'cause her walk had me focused
Her scent had me open, and since we had a moment
What I'm-a say? ""Hey, I seen you in the store""?
She went into a building and I had to guess the floor
Knocking on every door; that took 'bout a half an hour
Till she answered ""whoa""; was still soaked from the shower
I seen some sour diesel broken up on my CD
She introduced me to her roommates
This Vanilla Dutch and this is Swisha Sweety
I got you open yet?
It ain't over yet; I love you when you're soaking wet
Been looking for you like the bounty hunter Boba Fett
I'm the one, but you don't know it yet
The wettest skin--what a better beginning; she let me in
Let us begin; perfect weather for sinning, my Seraphim

The people miserable and try to place they burdens on him
He revealing the truth, like he a portal
A vampire sucked his blood, now he immortal
First he ignored, then he worked the applause
He thirsty for more cause they loving how he perfectly flawed
Most of these rappers softer than Velour Juicy Couture
And from the start he put his heart in every verse he record
Cursed to perform for the corporation
He made a profit with Satan
Then got with the Beat Konducta for his ""Liberation""
And for free at last
Till everybody started selling it but him

Every lie we ingest and consume
Is guaranteed to make us vegetables soon

He should love his life, he got a loving wife at home
But still find himself roaming through the club at night
Kiss his children and they hug him tight
Gotta prove his love in family court tomorrow
Cause he and they mother fight
These other artists really don't know what to make of him
So they afraid of him, but they ain't breaking him
It's been over ten years since he gave you ""The Blast""
The ones that counted him out, they didn't do the math
The fans tell him he under-appreciated
Underrated and hated, but he thankful they debated
Thankful that he made it to glory while some faded
Thankful that he keep it so real while some fake it
Thankful for the skills that's keeping the family stable
Thankful for the meals he put on the family table
He pay the bills when he able and spend for pleasure when he can
This the true measure of a man
Some things he'll never understand, that's okay though
He know we're moulded in the image of God like Play-Doh
But still he wax philosophical like Aristotle
Maybe one day they'll come up with a better model
But until then, he the best there is

Revolutions per minute refers to the unity of frequency of rotations

No boundaries, no borders, we're crossing many waters
Them haters can't ignore us, the government record us
They used to take our sons and think it's fun to rape our daughters
No our health care system pitiful, that's how hospitals profitable
They try to put the drugs inside of you
Lie to you, say that you gonna die tomorrow
So why pay? That's not logical, see the bullshit that they try to pull?
They tapping laptops like a bad plot out of a bad movie
Obama say it ain't so
In a perfect world correlation of the willing is coalition of the rainbow
Who the enemy? Who the friend in need?
How do you choose your target, who you aim for, what you aim for?
Damn, still running with the race but I'm running out of pace
So fast just the last guy to let it go
Wondering if my concentration on the race misplaced
Take your marks, set, ready, go
Evolutionary flow, ever-luminary glow
When they show but the revolution never know

About to face some danger, I just misplace my anger

Bun B is a product of the ghetto
Good or bad man I just can't let go
No I ain't a rich man but it's been set though
And I'm still on the grind trying to get dough
Why the government wanna keep me in debt for?
They wanna keep me in debt for?
Look at A-I-G and the bailouts
Stepping on the fish just so you can help the whale out
Got his ass out or should I say tail out
Need another job like a paper or a mail route
We the fresh, best in take the stale out
Make it rain, they see it I'm a put a pail out
Man I'm a put a pail out know what I'm saying?
Cause I'm stuck in the mud like a tractor
I ain't gotta lie plus I'm not a good actor
Bullshit laws that they enact to keep us locked out the big game in the back bru'
I got sacked, now I gotta get a sack ta
Make ends meet cause the money is a factor, oh yeah the money is a factor
Damn now I'm back on the block for the hustle
Used to be hot, now your boy just cold
Gotta build my bread up and my muscle
Haters talk down, sometimes it's a tussle
But the smoke gonna clear and the dust don't settle
Now it's like def jam wit no Russell

We'll be alright though

The other half of my heart

Isn't quite who I thought I was

Telling yourself you’ll be here
When you’re not anywhere to be found

How can you just close your eyes
And pretend I’m a ghost
When I am haunted by the thought of you
To be honest, I wish I was like you

I wish I could forget these memories
Did you not see me falling down
Into endless shades of grey
You watched without taking a step

Cold hearted woman, you're bringing me down in flames
Runnin' 'round all over town, runnin' down my name
Gonna get me a loaded pistol, hey, was that out loud
Cold hearted woman, I'm gonna put you in the ground

When that river stops flowin', she's burning up the telephone
By the time that I find you, my money's all down the drain

Reflections of Worship,"Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl 
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana) 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind

Pack my bag
Get on a plane

Lock the house
And give up the pain

Gonna sail away

The life you live you leave
Can't conceive
An extra mortal sleeve
From near times far
We come and here we are, we stay
To play a while upon this earthly stage and leave
To half-remembered tales
And half-forgotten lies
To sing a while
A song in praising style
And then forget the words

I believe in midnight madness
And ships that pass in the night
And I believe in love
Like a child in Santa Claus
The king who wore no clothes
Wasn't the only one exposed
The queue forms beside me
As I sing my credo to a lost cause

I believe in constant pauses
Like a Roman holiday
And I often stop for air
As I climb the Spanish stairs
And the king whose touch was gold
Was surprised as he grew old
The queue forms up behind him
As he sang his credo to a lost cause

I believe, and you believe, and we believe we're free
And the air don't cost a thing
To a bird with a broken wing
The wisest king of all
Left his wisdom on the wall
The queue forms beside me
As I sing my credo to a lost cause

I believe, and you believe, and we believe we're free
And the air don't cost a thing
But then, that's only to a bird with a broken wing
Yet the wisest king of all
Had to leave his wisdom on the wall
The queue forms up beside me
As I sing my credo to a lost cause

I believe
The life you live you leave
Can't conceive
The extra mortal weave

From near the stars
You are seen from here, they're yours
To gaze awhile
Down to the universe and smile
As we down here
We chase the wind and jump the moon
And play a while
The game in echoed style
And disregard the rules",Credo,1991

Cause when its time to go
All I gotta press is turbo
Heard it on his walkie, road block on 280 west
Things got serious, that's when I bust a left
U-Turn, tires burned
My concern was a truck coming
Head on collision within a changed position
Close one, I almost went up in a blaze
Running from what appears to be a masquerade
Least that what I thought, it was all in my mind
Reality stuck when I got to the borderline

A rookie shoots a boy over mistaken identity

Hey kids, gather around, it's Wyclef and Melky Sedeck
I got a story to tell, here we go

Sit right back and hear a tale of a hustler 'round my way
He used to clock around the block from where my grandma stayed
Black BMW with rims to match, windows bulletproof
One night, he jumped out the car
And caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
He caught a bullet in his bubblegoose
You can be at the party gettin' loose
But you can catch a bullet in your bubblegoose

Hey yo, hey yo, my pen's in my hand, OK, what should I write next?
Oh yeah, and if you don't know, success brings stress
I'm vexed, my phone rings, collect caller from Jeff
The operator say, ""If you accept, say yes""
""Yes, what's the deal, son?""
""Yo, I got bad news""
Yo, by the tone of his voice, I heard the I'll street blues
""The friends will make you, them too can break you
They plan an execution like Fu Manchu""
""Who?""
""You know the character from channel 5 kung-fu (wahoo)""
""Slow down, man, Jeff, I'm losin' you""
""Hey yo, your cousin Rohann...""
""Uh-huh""
""Who used to sell bang""
""Uh-huh""
""DT's found his hand in the back of Bennigans""
""What?""
""In a plastic bag with a note attached""
""Saying what?""
""A million and a half or he won't be back""
""So meet me by the Brooklyn Bridge, 12:00 sharp""
""If not, at the funeral, you gotta play the harp""
Yo, why they wanna start and make me play my part?
Don't they know like Sting, I can turn this murder into art?
I jumped into my car, there's gotta be a joke
Traffic's backed up, who's in town, the Pope?
S-s-s-s-someone blew the horn, I turned and looked left
To my surprise, it was my sis, Melky Sedeck

But you can catch a bullet in your bubblegoose

You're shootin' in the opposite position
I'm thinkin', ""Should I fire or hold back on ammunition
On your wig transition?""
My mission, like Take 6, is to spread love
But all you screwed mugs got me wearin' black gloves
You up in my face, I see the fear in your eyes
You gonna feel the pain like a grown man gettin' circumcised
Shalom, shalom, pardon my left
But my right hand's on your throat, massaging you to death
You provoke the cycle, call Michael
You're lookin' in the mirror, well, I'm in your window, oh oh
You hear me Urkel, your blood will turn purple
Like the color, you holler, bawlin' for your mother
No-one hears you even though you knock
You used to walk around the block with the daily rock
Things done changed since your spark got hot
Now you got your knot wocked with your very own Glock

Mom moved to Jers' so we could get a better life
But little did she know a ghetto is a ghetto
Good times found myself like Jimmie Walker sayin' ""Cello""

Yellow cheese bus gettin' beatings if I cuss
Lay away another day in stripped Lees and Le Tigres
But the lyrical bomber momma tried to stop
Paranoid cause this boy around my neighborhood got shot
Name plait hair, straight metal braces on my teeth
Fat laces on my feet when crack first hits the streets

I use to push up on a girl Salt 'N' Peppa Push It Push It
D's in school cause the music was my focus
Jokes in class but when I learned I didn't pass
I knew it was my ass with my mothers leather lash
Belt buckle said Nelly Nel similar to Melle Mel
Hits the third rail Beat Street made Gazzels sells

As the tale gets poetic watch the streets turn magnetic
Tawana Brawley's rape is alleged
Hang out in hooky places watch streets corners turn to oasis
Young men aspire to be Scarfaces

In the year of the dragon lots of men disappear
Quiet as it's kept they won't be back next year

He told me Joe had a dream in jail he got steamed
His wife became a fiend fuckin' little Raheem
Damn, drugs will make you do terrible things
He told me when he get out he's murdering by any means
The day came I saw him on the train
He pulled his gun and aimed and started firing like the son of Kane
I saw civilians runnin' for their life
Like the devil on judgement night running from Christ
Ice and Amaretto please as I fell to my knees
Being shot by Ferguson the vigilante

In the year of the dragon lots of men disappear
Quiet as it's kept they won't be back next year

Clef it kind of remind me of this chick I once knew
Use to be a dime now she's strung out in Bellevue
See the serpent played tricks run game like the Knicks
Build you up just to lose the championship
I seen her reminisce over Wu-Tang could It Be that Simple
She lost her Prince cause there were Thieves In the Temple
Tragic depression made her lose all her teeth
Lost and turned out gave her body to the streets

Still waters run deep
So be careful of the company you keep

Was like the kiss on the collarbone
Soft caress of happiness
The way you walk your style of dress
I wish I didn't get so weak
Ooo baby just to hear you speak
Makes me argue just to see
How much you're in love with me
See like a queen a queen upon her throne

It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know

I get mad when you walk away (don't walk away)
So I tell you leave, when I mean stay
Warm as the sun dipped in black
Fingertips on the small of my back
More valuable than all I own
Like your precious, precious, precious, precious dark skin tone

It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know

It was the, ah
I tried to explain
Ah, but baby, it's in vain

Speaking on my mother's phone
The touching makes me think I'm grown, (you ain't grown)
Sweet prince of the ghetto
Your kisses taste like amaretto
Intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating
How sad, how sad that all things come to an end
But then again, I'm, I'm not alone

(Don't do it, don't do it)
To all the girls I loved before
To all the girls I cheated on before
To all the girls I loved before

To all the girls I cheated on before, I tip my hat like Willie Nelson
You got pressure, take a sip of this Molson
Here's what happened, it wasn't my intentions
To fall into seduction while playing a temptation
I thought I had it figured out, but games don't last
The hourglass ran out, I got sprayed with the tear gas
Big men don't cry, hold my feelings inside
Stress brings me pain, I gotta hold my pride
When I see you with another guy, jealous thoughts of homicide
Call me selfish when I say Abraham has many wives
You say this is the 90's, either it's gonna be me or her
I found myself in a blur
Lookin' into the clouds thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

Second verse is gonna hurt, based on a true life story
I got married at 24 in New Jersey
You know the feelings start nature take it's course
Two years later 'Clef gets a divorce
When I had the cold feet, I shouldn't've walked the altar
With Dionne Warwick, she could predict my future
Went with my feelings even though it wasn't right
Creepin' with my secret lover in the middle of the night
Back home, break of dawn, dinner's at the table
Thin Line Between Love And Hate is on cable
I'm lookin' at myself thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh
To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive, but you still think that I'm a ho

Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though)
And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you take her friend
Hotel, (I'm not a) motel, Holiday Inn (you don't believe me though)
And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you snatch her friend

Break it down right here

One love, you're lucky to have one love
It sounds bugged, drinking wine from the same jug
One heart, one mind, one soul
She ain't a gold digger, she don't care about your bank-roll
Keep your money, she make her own cheddar
All she want from me is respect like Aretha
Cooked me lasagne, stayed in for the winter
Chilled to the summer, now I'm gone 'til November
Have you seen her?
I think I did
But what I did wrong was take a love for granted
Cause first comes trust, don't rush into lust
Easier said than done, I lust and I must
Passion is a must, but then we start to cuss
We was just makin' love, now we tearing up each other's guts
Like species, she called me an animal
So feel the tongue of the warm-blooded mammal

I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared
You forgive but never forget, so the past reappears, uh huh

I know you're diggin' this

Part Mexican, pure sweet, dimes fell to her feet
She like Movado, and shook her hips like Delgado
And broke niggaz down from the grounds to Apollo
And then some, she took her act sent it to dim sum
And waited patiently while the businessmen come
Call late on purpose, got even politicians nervous
And made plans to infiltrate the street secret service

We wouldn't recognize the truth if it laid before our eyes

We're drowning in our own incompetence, we're drowning
Somewhere, somehow there's a bigger scar
An infection of inconfidence, already gone too far

How does understanding begin, how can we help?

Of our system to fear

ReGenesis,"No-one seems to take up the chase, and with the familiar faces fresh in his mind he moves into a reconstruction of his old life, above ground - Too much time was one thing he didn't need, so he used to cut through it with a little speed. He was better off dead, than slow in the head. His momma and poppa had taken a ride on his back, so he left very quickly to join The Pack. 

I see faces and traces of home back in New York City -
So you think I'm a tough kid? Is that what you heard?
Well I like to see some action and it gets into my blood.
The call me the trail blazer - Rael - electric razor
I'm the pitcher in the chain gang, we don't believe in pain
''cause we're only as strong, yes we're only as strong,
As the weakest link in the chain.

Only after a spell in Pontiac reformatory was he given any respect in the gang. 

Let me out of Pontiac when I was just seventeen,
I had to get it out of me, if you know what I mean, what I mean.

You say I must be crazy, 'Cause I don't care who I hit, who I hit.
But I know it's me that's hitting out and I'm, I'm not full of shit.
I don't care who I hurt, I don't care who I do wrong.
This is your mess I'm stuck in, I really don't belong.
When I take out my bottle, filled up high with gasoline,
You can tell by the night fires where Rael has been, has been.

Now, walking back home after a raid, he was cuddling a sleeping porcupine.
That night he pictured the removal of his hairy heart and to the accompaniment of very romantic Music he watched it being shaved smooth by an anonymous stainless steel razor. 

As I cuddled the porcupine
He said I had none to blame, but me.
Held my heart, deep in hair,
Time to shave, shave it off, it off.
No time for romantic escape,
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No!
Off we go...

Your sitting in your comfort you don't believe I'm real,
You cannot buy protection from the way that I feel.
Your progressive hypocrites hand out their trash,
But it was mine in the first place, so I'll burn it to ash.
And I've tasted all the strongest meats,
And laid them down in coloured sheets (laid them down in colored sheets).
Who needs illusion of love and affection
When you're out walking the streets with your mainline connection?

Like a cancer growth is removed by skill.

An inland sea, his symphony.

Till lured by sirens cry.

Sitting beside you, I look into your eyes. 
As the sound of motor cars fades in the night time, 
I swear I saw your face change, it didn't seem quite right. 
...And it's hello babe with your guardian eyes so blue 
Hey my baby don't you know our love is true. 

Coming closer with our eyes, a distance falls around our bodies. 
Out in the garden, the moon seems very bright, 
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly. 
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand. 
...And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you. 
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true.

Far from your warm arms.

With water clear, he cares for all his harvest. 
I know a fireman who looks after the fire.

Share his peace, 
Sign the lease.

He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man.

gland in gland 
With a spoonful of miracle,

We will rock you, rock you little snake, 
We will keep you snug and warm. 

Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest, 
We walked across the fields to see the children of the West, 
But we saw a host of dark skinned warriors 
standing still below the ground, 
Waiting for battle. 

The fight's begun, they've been released. 
Killing foe for peace...bang, bang, bang. Bang, bang, bang... 
And they're giving me a wonderful potion, 
'cause I cannot contain my emotion. 
And even though I'm feeling good, 
Something tells me I'd better activate my prayer capsule. 

Today's a day to celebrate, the foe have met their fate. 
The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord. 

Wandering through the chaos the battle has left,

He's been stamped ""Human Bacon"" by some butchery tool.

In blood, he's writing the lyrics of a brand new tune.

I've been so far from here, 
Far from your loving arms, 
Now I'm back again, and babe it's gonna work out fine.

She was a red hot hoochie coocher,
She was the roughest, toughest frail,
but Minnie had a heart as big as a whale.

Hi-dee hi-dee hi-dee hi

She messed around with a bloke named Smokey.
She loved him though was cokie,
he took her down to Chinatown
and he showed her how to kick the gong around.

She had a dream about the King of Sweden,
He gave her things that she was needin',
He gave her a home built of gold and steel,
a diamond car with the platinum wheel.

Hi-dee hi-dee hi-dee hi-dee hi
Hi-dee hi-dee hi-dee hi-dee hi
Hey-dee hey-dee hey-dee hey-dee hey
Hey-dee hey-dee hey-dee hey-dee hey

He gave her his townhouse and his racing horses,
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses,
She had a million dollars worth of nickels and dimes,
She sat around and counted them all a million times.

On that line stands an old rugged cross 
On that cross, a battle is raging 
To gain a man's soul or it's loss 

On one side, march the forces of evil
 All the demons, all the devils of hell 
On the other, the angels of glory 
And they meet on Golgotha's hill 

The earth shakes with the force of the conflict 
And the sun refuses to shine 
For there hangs God's son, in the balance 
And then through the darkness he cries

It is finished, the battle is over 
It is finished, there'll be no more war 
It is finished, the end of the conflict 
It is finished and Jesus is Lord

Yet in my heart, the battle was still raging 
Not all prisoners of war had come home 
These were battlefields of my own making 
I didn't know that the war had been won 

Oh, but then I heard the king of the ages 
Had fought all the battles for me 
And that victory was mine for the claiming

Reggie McBride,"I used to visit all the very gay places

Those come-what-may places
I used to visit all the very gay places
Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
To get the feel of life
From jazz and cocktails.

The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
With distinguish traces
That used to be there
You could see where they'd been washed away
By too many through the day
Twelve o'clock tales

Then you came along with your siren song
To tempt me to madness

I thought for a while that your poignant smile
Was tinged with the sadness

Of a great love for me.
Ah yes, I was wrong.
Again, I was wrong.

Life is lonely again,
And only last year, everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A trough full of hearts could only be a bore.

A week in Paris will ease the bite of it
All I care is to smile in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
While yet you are still
Burning inside my brain
Romance is mush
Stifling those who strive
I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And there I'll be, while I rot with the rest
Of those whose lives are lonely too.",Lush Life,2010

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
