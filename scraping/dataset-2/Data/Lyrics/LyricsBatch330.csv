Gregg Bissonette,"Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa we believe
She'd been drinking too much eggnog
And we begged her not to go
But she forgot her medication
And she staggered out the door into the snow
When we found her Christmas morning
At the scene of the attack
She had hoof-prints on her forehead
And incriminating Claus marks on her back

Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa we believe

Now we're all so proud of grandpa
He's been taking this so well
See him in there watching football
Drinking beer and playing cards with cousin Mel
It's not Christmas without Grandma
All the family's dressed in black
And we just can't help but wonder
Should we open up her gifts
Or send them back (send them back)

Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa we believe

Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig
And the blue and silver candles
That would just have matched the hair on grandma's wig
I've warned all my friends and neighbors
Better watch out for yourselves
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh
And plays with elves

Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa we believe

Singin' grandpa
Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa we believe
Merry Christmas",Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer,2008
Gregg Burge,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,1981
Gregg Diamond,"A faded photograph I mailed to you 
With feelings I don't want to face 
And a long song of surrender in blue 
I remember when you took my breath away 

Chanson papillon, we were very young 
Like butterflies, like hot butterfly 
Chanson papillon, we had just begun 
We let it slide on by 
We didn't realize 

All our memories are burning in time 
Like a bittersweet perfume 
Can you tell me how a love that's so fine 
Could have climaxed in a single afternoon 

Chanson papillon, we were very young 
Like butterflies, like hot butterfly 
Chanson papillon, we had just begun 
We let it slide on by 
We didn't realize

Gone are the days of instant romance 
And the nights of slow goodbyes 
That was a time of life when foxy was the dance 
But then you got wise to all my lies

Like butterflies, like hot butterfly 
Chanson papillon, we had just begun 
Let it slide on by

Gregg Edelman,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When,1990
Gregg Edelman,"Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas bells are ringing
Christmas bells are ringing

How time flies
When compassion dies
No stocking, no candy canes
No gingerbread, no safety net

No loose change, no change, no
Santa Claus is coming
'Cause Santa Claus ain't coming
No room at the Holiday Inn again
Well, maybe next year or when

December twenty-fourth, ten p.m.
Eastern standard time
I can't believe a year went by so fast
Time to see, what we have time to see

Turn the projector on first shot roger
With the fender guitar he just got out of hock
When he sold the car
That took him away and back

I found my song
He found his song
If he could just find Mimi
I tried you know I tried

Fade in on mark
Who's still in the dark
But he's got great footage
Which he's cut together

To screen tonight
In honor of Benny's wife
Muffy, Alison
Pulling Benny out of the east village location

Then again, maybe we won't screen it tonight
I wonder how Alison found out about Mimi?
Maybe a bird told her or an angel
I had a little hunch you could use, a little 'flow

Tutoring again? Negative
Back at you? No, no you, no
I rewired the ATM at the food emporium
To provide an honorarium to anyone with the code

The code, well
A N G E L

Yet robin hooding isn't the solution
The powers that be must be undermined
Where they dwell in a small exclusive
Gourmet institution

Where we overcharge the wealthy, clientÃ¨le
Let's open up a restaurant in Santa Fe
With a private corner banquette in the back
We'll make it yet, we'll somehow get to Santa Fe

But you'd miss New York before you could unpack
Mark, Roger, anyone? Help
Maureen?
It's Mimi, I can't get her up the stairs

No, she was huddled in the park in the dark
And she was freezing and begged to come here
Over here, oh, god
Got a light, I know you, you're shivering

She's been living on the street
We need some heat
I'm shivering
We can buy some wood and something to eat

I'm afraid she needs more than heat
I heard that
Collins will call for a doctor, honey
Don't waste your money on mimi, me, me

Hello-911? I'm on hold
Cold, cold, would you light my candle
Yes, we'll, oh God, find a candle

I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you

I should tell you
Benny wasn't any
Shh, I know
I should tell you why I left
It wasn't, 'cause I didn't

I know, I should tell you
I should tell you
I should tell you, I love you

Who do you think you are?
Leaving me alone with my guitar
Hold on there's something you
Should here
It isn't much but it took all year",Finale,1994
Gregg Edelman,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1996
Gregg Edelman,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,
Yes, and if I were a bell,
Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell,1996

Hey, why don't ya look where you're goin'.
You'd think it was your first time in New York!

It is!

New York, New York!
It's a helluva town!

We've got one day here and not another minute

Not counting MacDougal Alley the heart of Green-Witch Village,
A charming thoroughfare filled with""

Here we go again!

The famous places to visit are so many,
Or so the guidebooks say.
I promised Daddy I wouldn't miss on any.
And we have just one day.
Got to see the whole town
From Yonkers on down to the Bay.

In just one day!

New York, New York, a visitor's place,
Where no one lives on account of the pace,
But seven millions are screaming for space.
New York, New York, it's a visitor's place!

Hey! Look who's comin' back! It's Tom and Andy!

Hey, Tom, Andy! Hey, fellas, how are the New York dames?

Wonderful, I don't remember a thing!

Awful! I remember everything!

Manhattan women are dressed in silk and satin,
Or so the fellas say;
There's just one thing that's important in Manhattan,
When you have just one day;
Gotta pick up a date

Maybe seven

Or eight
On your way.

Start spreading the news
You're leaving today (tell him friend)
I want to be a part of it, New York, New York
Your vagabond shoes, they are longing to stray
And steps around the heart of it, New York, New York

I wanna wake up in a city, that doesn't sleep
And find your king of the hill, top of the heap

Your small town blues, they're melting away
Don't make a brand new start of it, in Old New York
You always make it there, you make it anywhere
Its up to you, New York, New York

And you'll always be lonely

He'll put you on a pedestal
That's right before he puts you
Through the mill
Whatever you do, stay away from Bill

If you're wonderin' if there's any good in him
When it comes to Bill, the answer's no
He'll lie and deceive you
He'll love you and leave you and oh, you'll be miserable

So stay away from Bill
'Cause he's bad, and he's nothin' but trouble

Stay away from Bill and be glad
(Stay away from Bill)
And you're gonna be fine

He'll have you and hurt you
And then he will desert you
He'll shock you and shake you
He'll rock you and he'll break you

He'll chill you and thrill you
He'll kill you, then he'll bill you

That boy is mine

That boy is mine, that boy is mine
Did you hear me, girlfriend? That boy is mine
I heard you loud and clear
But that boy is mine

Gregg Field,"The concert was over in Carnagie Hall
The maestro took bow after bow
He said, “My dear friends I have given my all. 
I'm sorry, it's all over now.”
When from the balcony way up high
There suddenly came a mournful cry

Oh, Mr. Paganini 
Please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it won't you sing it?
And if you can't sing you simply have to
Scat

Listen Paganini, 
We breathlessly await your masterful détente
Go on and sling it
And if you can't sling it you simply have to
Scat

We heard your repertoire 
And at the final bar
We greeted you with wild applause
But what a great ovation
Your interpretation of:
‘I never cared much for moonlight skies
I never blinked back at fireflies'
Would do

So, Paganini don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve?
Come on and spring it
And if you can't spring it, you simply have to
Scat

Listen Paganini, please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it, wont you sing it?
If the boys is bopping
Aint no need in stopping

But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

That luck keeps passing me by, that's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

Think we're mad
Heaven knows

To rack and to ruin

They think is odd and Sodom and Gomorrah-ble

But the fact is
Everything today is thoroughly modern
Check your personality
Everything today makes yesterday slow

Better face reality
It's not insanity
Says vanity fair
In fact, it's stylish

To raise your skirts and bob your hair.

Everything today is starting to go

What they're forgetting is, this is 1922
Have you seen the way they kiss in the movies

Isn't it delectable?
Painting lips and pencil-lining your brow

I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die

Donne moi une chance,
Dans la foule infidèle, accorde moi une danse,
Donne moi une chance.

On s'évite, ça excite,
Bien sûr l'indifférence attise les envies,
Tes regards qui s'égarent,
On a beau le vouloir, l'autre nous l'interdit,
Et l'on part,
Mais dis moi où peut-on se revoir.

Donne moi une chance, donne moi
Au moins un concours de circonstances,
Donne moi une chance, donne moi
Au moins un doute, une coïncidence.
J'ai le corps qui t'appelle et le cœur qui te pense,
Donne moi une chance,
Dans la foule infidèle, accorde moi une danse,
Donne moi une chance.

Laisser aller nos êtres,
Apprendre à se connaître, un jour, un soir,
Et si nos âmes s'attirent,
Ne plus rien s'interdire
Et puis voir, ce qu'on peut devenir.

Comment faire, pour te plaire.
On est de la même terre mais pas du même monde.
Quel enfer de se taire,
Mais comment se parler ne serait-ce qu'une seconde,
Rien ne sert,
Des préjugés, des codes, des barrières.

Donne moi une chance, donne moi
Au moins un concours de circonstances,
Donne moi une chance, donne moi
Au moins un doute, une coïncidence.
J'ai le corps qui t'appelle et le cœur qui te pense,
Donne moi une chance,
Dans la foule infidèle, accorde moi une danse,
Donne toi une chance. (Donne moi)

Relégué au rang de bannie
Il se relève et règne en maître
C'est vous qui l'avait fait renaître

De ces matins, pauvres réveils,
Ces matins qui gardent en otage,
Nos envies au fond d'un sommeil
Sortir la tête de ce potage,
Plier les rêves que l'on bégaye.

J'ai l'horizon dans mes bagages,
Des aventures à t'inventer,
Pas de frontières, autres péages,
Pas de limite à s'en aller,
Au-delà de nos marécages

Où jamais rien ne nous soulage

Où la vie n'est jamais pareille,
On se perdra sur des rivages,
Dans des océans de merveilles,
On fera peut-être naufrage,
Je crois qu'il faut que l'on essaye,
Atteindre d'autres paysages,
Des galaxies inexplorées.
Ne plus sentir geindre la rage,
Ni l'entendre se lamenter,
Oublier les sombres ravages,
De leurs principes et leurs idées
En trouvant un pont, un passage,
N'importe quoi pour s'évader.

Si tu me suis,
Si seulement et seulement,

Et puis t'embrasser

Un jour tu as eu dix-sept ans
Tes cheveux volaient dans le vent
Et souvent tu chantais
Oh, yesterday!
Les jeudis après-midi
On allait au cinéma gris
Voir les films, de Marilyn
Michèle, un soir en décembre
La neige tombait sur les toits
Nous étions toi et moi
Endormis ensemble
Pour la première fois.

Le temps a passé doucement
Et déchu le Prince Charmant
Qui t'offrait des voyages
Dans ses nuages
On m'a dit que tu t'es mariée
En avril au printemps dernier
Que tu vis, à Paris.

Michèle, c'est bien loin tout ça
Les rues, les cafés joyeux
Même les trains de banlieue
Se moquent de toi, se moquent de moi

Grégoire,"Comment faire, pour se plaire.
On est de la même terre mais pas du même monde.
Quel enfer de se taire,
Mais comment se parler ne serait-ce qu'une seconde,
Rien ne sert,
Des préjugés, des codes, des barrières.

Donne moi une chance, donne moi
Au moins un concours de circonstances,
Donne moi une chance, donne moi
Au moins un doute, une coïncidence.
J'ai le corps qui t'appelle et le cœur qui te pense,
Donne moi une chance,
Dans la foule infidèle, accorde moi une danse,
Donne moi une chance.

On s'évite, ça excite,
Bien sûr l'indifférence attise les envies,
Tes regards qui s'égarent,
On a beau le vouloir, l'autre nous l'interdit,
Et l'on part,
Mais dis moi où peut-on se revoir.

Donne moi une chance, donne moi
Au moins un concours de circonstances,
Donne moi une chance, donne moi
Au moins un doute, une coïncidence.
J'ai le corps qui t'appelle et le cœur qui te pense,
Donne moi une chance,
Dans la foule infidèle, accorde moi une danse,
Donne moi une chance.

Laisser aller nos êtres,
Apprendre à se connaître, un jour, un soir,
Et si nos âmes s'attirent,
Ne plus rien s'interdire
Et puis voir, ce qu'on peut devenir.

Comment faire, pour te plaire.
On est de la même terre mais pas du même monde.
Quel enfer de se taire,
Mais comment se parler ne serait-ce qu'une seconde,

Gregor Beck,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1994
Gregor Beck,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

And then it had to be with you

In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way

Ich hab schon ziemlich viel erreicht 
Bin schon ganz schön weit gereist

Ich hass es undankbar zu sein

Für alles andre bin ich bereit

Gregor Meyle,"Die Chance 
Mitten in der Nacht verließ er sein zu haus 
Er gab seiner Frau den letzten Kuss 
Er wusste, dass er stark sein muss
Die Kinder schliefen fest
Er nahm sich ein Stück Brot
Sie sahen seine Tränen nicht
Er schloss die Tür fest hinter sich
Zum Treffpunkt war‘s noch weit
Jeder Schritt war hart für ihn
Es tat ihm so leid
Die Zweifel fraßen ihn fast auf
Er wünscht sich die Zeit
Als es für ihn noch Arbeit gab
Sorglosigkeit

Alles was er brauchte war ne Chance
Alles was er wollte war ne Chance
Alles was er brauchte war ne Chance
Alles was er wollte war ne Chance

Im LKW versteckt
Gab‘s kein Weg mehr zurück
3 Tage durch das ganze Land
Hungri, durstig, angespannt
Sah das Meer zum ersten Mal
Es hat ihn seltsam fasziniert
Wasser bis zum Horizont
Seine Angst hatte ihn bis jetzt verschont
Es war nass kalt und eng
Er gehörte nicht an diesen Ort
Was wäre wenn
Er niemals mehr nach Hause käm
Die Männer waren streng
Keiner sprach ein einziges Wort
Er dachte nur

Alles was ich brauche is ne Chance
Alles was ich will ist eine Chance
Alles was ich brauche is ne Chance
Alles was ich will ist eine Chance

Jeder Mensch ist ebenbürtig
Jeder ist der Liebe würdig

Wie sie lachen, wie sie gehen?
Manche Wesen sind so schön.
Innen wie aussehen.
Sie verwöhnen
Deine Sinne und gewöhnen
Dich wieder an Liebe, die du kennst,
Zu der du immer wieder rennst.
Diese Liebe ist real,
So real wie Höllenqualen.
Doch Höllenqualen sind egal,
Wenn sich die Liebe dir entfacht.

Doch es ist gut wie es ist.
Der Mensch lernt nur, wenn er Scheiße frisst,
Sonst reift er nicht.
Er weiß doch nichts.
Ich weiß noch nicht,
Wann verstreicht die Frist?

Das hat die Welt noch nicht gesehen.
Trotzdem ist Liebe wunderschön,
Ist unsichtbar und trotzdem da.
Freude und Leid das ganze Jahr,
Man nimmt das Leben sonst nicht wahr.

Denn mit dem Herz sind wir meist blind.
Wer von uns ist schon wie ein Kind?
Offen für alles wie der Wind,
Der doch dem Meer den Regen bringt
Er ist so frei und doch gewillt.

Gib mir einen Koffer für mein Herz,
Der ist unendlich viel mehr wert,
Wenn du ihn mitnimmst, wenn du gehst,
Ihn bei dir trägst von früh bis spät,
Ihn dann zurück bringst unversehrt.

Ich lauf des öfteren Gefahr,
Zu vergessen wie schön das Leben bisher war.
Mit dir von Anfang an verflochten bis ans Ende meiner
Zeit.
Wir lieben das Leben und sind dafür bereit.

Denn wir alle werfen Schatten auf des Nächsten Licht.
Lass dich nicht zerbrechen und fürchte dich nicht

Vor dem, was da kommt,
Vor dem, was du fühlst,
Vor dem, was du liebst.

There's no ""tell me lies""

Making love to you
Everything is new
You know you're my Once in A Lifetime

I burn inside
Cold shiver down my spine
When you take me

I've come to talk with you again, 
Because a vision softly creeping, 
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,

Still remains 
Within the sound of silence. 
In restless dreams I walked alone 
Narrow streets of cobblestone, 
'Neath the halo of a street lamp, 
I turned my collar to the cold and damp 
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light 
That split the night 
And touched the sound of silence. 

And in the naked light I saw 
Ten thousand people, maybe more. 
People talking without speaking, 
People hearing without listening, 
People writing songs that voices never share 
And no one dare 
Disturb the sound of silence. 

'Fools' said I, 'You do not know 
Silence like a cancer grows. 
Hear my words that I might teach you, 
Take my arms that I might reach you.' 
But my words like silent raindrops fell, 
And echoed 
In the wells of silence 

And the people bowed and prayed 
To the neon god they made. 
And the sign flashed out its warning, 
In the words that it was forming. 
And the sign said, 'The words of the prophets 

are written on the subway walls 
And tenement halls.'

Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well now pride's gone out the window cross the rooftops, run away,
Left me in the vacuum of my heart.

What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say,
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world,
Somehow I have to find.
And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive.

Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Feared today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here besides the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

And I don't
But I won't cry for yesterday, there's an ordinary world,
Somehow I have to find.
And as I try to make my way, to the ordinary world
I will learn to survive.

To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly, you hear and see

I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night

Record it in the present tense
Put it into a permanent form

You can achieve dream control

The walls you built within
Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin

If you've been telling all the tall tales end to end
Since the day that we met and became good friends
Then I've been lied to, is it really you?

Say hey, what's the big deal?
Oh, where'd all the fun go since we got serious?
I've been such a mess

Blame the stars or a bleeding heart
What a tragedy, what a tragedy
What a tragedy, you and me",Blame-Qui,2007
Gregory & the Hawk,"I had a dream, it was lasting
It lasted the whole next day
I dreamt you had left me
And when I woke the mirror said to me
Maybe it's true, it could be true

You were caring, you had honest eyes
You were perfect, the perfect surprise
Till your hands crept up my chest
And gained a stronghold on my neck
You said baby it's true, I'm leaving you

I had a dream, it was lasting
It lasted the whole next day
I dreamt you had left me
And when I woke the mirror said to me
Maybe it's true, it could be true

",Memory and Honesty,2007
Gregory & the Hawk,"Baby come save me
I'm going crazy without you
Steal me away
These nights just ain't the same

And you can watch me wisely but I'll turn on a dime
You can try and surprise me but I've made up my mind
And you've known the whole time
I want you beside me

Or we can weight our lines here
Let it drown us, drag us down
Tangled in fear that it won't come around
That we've lost what we'd found
Neither of us freer

",Neither Freer,2007
Gregory & the Hawk,"I've been the wild one
I've run through the streets and I've suffered
I've been the quiet one
Sequestered and smothered

But I won't mind no time spent to save me
Just trying to be good to the people who raised me

It's been a strong year
With a bright, bright sun
And from here the past looks cold
And the future seems a promising one

But I won't mind no time spent to save me
Just trying to be good to the people who raised me
And glide through life without a meaning

On trails torn up between clouds and turf
I've wished for you for what it's worth
And I want to visit on the wind
And I want to visit on the wind

",The People Who Raised Me,2007
Gregory & the Hawk,"One by one the days fall beside us
Like yellow leaves we have no conscience
Oh, what we're becoming?

Month by month the rings on our tree trunks
Like old wise eyes grow wider
And winter lends them a dead disguise

Now time like an ocean knows tide like a notion
To toss about the house and lose inside the couch
And piles of our thoughts run miles in the dark
Just tryin' to get home

Age by age we rhyme with our seasons
Rehearsed routines still turning and returning

Now time like an ocean knows tide like a notion
To toss about the house and lose inside the couch
And piles of our thoughts run miles in the dark
Just tryin' to get home

Now I'm wide as the ocean, now I bleed roses
And you are just a mark on the map of my past
And I am a road, I wind along alone all day until the coast",Season Poem,2007
Gregory & the Hawk,"Today is a slow day and I'll play guitar
Till the day goes away
Trying to write a song that says I love you
Trying to let you know I do

The dawn is bowing out in the afternoon
Dawns on me now
Trying to write a song that says I'm tired
Of trying to get you

The night is a dark night when it finally sets
And I'll make it out
To seem like I wanted it a little bit
The better to see you with

To the fall, to the fall, to the fall we blow
Goodbye kisses, bid winter hello
Feel the pine needles give way below
Winter, sweet winter hello
Steal my sun, I'll be your only one

In the times, in the times, in the times we know
Life takes money and money makes woes
Like your lovely heart lets it grow

Keep an eye on the silent sky
See the splendor in a short ride
Be the slow falling snow

And I must confess that I tortured the dress
That you wore for the world to look through

And I showed my heart to the doctor
He said, 'you just have to quit'
Then he wrote himself a prescription
And your name was mentioned in it

Then he locked himself in a library shelf
With the details of our honeymoon
And I hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse
And his practice is all in a ruin

I once knew a saint who had loved you
I studied all night in his school
He taught that the duty of lovers
Was to tarnish the golden rule

His body is gone, but out here on the lawn
His spirit continues to drool

Couldn’t hide my shame

Yeah she pulls on this heart like she pulls on the sea

And you came on strong like some running wave
And your beauty left me broke and hungry
Left me begging to the birds for a bone or an offering
Left me saying nothin', nothin', like I always say

And ahh that full bellied moon she’s a shinin' on me
Yeah she pulls on this heart like she pulls on the sea

They got nothing on me",That Moon Song,2009

Night comes fixing on the day
And the universe reigned again
While the wheels roll, it all glows a flickering light

While you were sleeping I was the turning the dials
And I walled up your kingdom with radio wires
And the bells of the choir came in low and rumbling
Aw you should a heard them

Living here in this city on fire, well i’ve been fine
Just dancing drunk above the street
Me the ghost of caroline

And that was me, ya know, calling up above
From the steeples in the church yard

Well I heard it from the radio man
He’s been locked up in the belfry
Listening close, to a string upon a can

That love can be so beautiful
Love that's meant to be
Love that's meant to be

'Cause love has found its way
In our hearts today
Love has found its way
In our hearts today
In our hearts today

Oh lady, oh lady
You bring me up, you bring me up
I'm never, I'm never gonna let you
Slip through my fingers
No way, no, no, no, no, no, no

Oh lady, let me stay
Let me stay in your heart
Love is so hard to resist
And most, and most of all, love, love is real

Quit 
Suppressed yes 
Crazy no 
Not insane 
I smoothie through the menu then I make my order 
I got that dominate gene 
So if ya 'noid hide yo daughter 
The love ya givin is based on what I do for you 
For the right amount of money you probably let me ??? you 
I like to glide up in it, but I got my pride

Don't second guess yo man 'cause he got more.

There's no way,
You're changing,
'Cause some things will just never be mine,
You're in not love this time, but it's alright.

J'aurai voulu t'offrir le meilleur de tout mon être
Au lieu de partir, entre nous tout faire renaître
Plutôt que de mentir,
Aborder nos différences
T'aimer autrement qu'à contre sens

And it makes no difference who is right or wrong
I deserve much more than this
'Cause there's only one thing I want
If it's not what you're made of
You're not what I'm looking for
You were willing but unable to give me anymore

Et ce dont je suis fait
Tout entier je saurai te le rendre
Même s'il faut tout apprendre, tout apprendre
What's your definition of the one?

Comment définir l'amour sans toi?
Mais prêt à tous les sacrifices je refuse celui là
J'aurai voulu t'offrir le meilleur de tout mon être
'Cause these are the waters that I'm in

Même si l'amour s'enfuit

Gregory Martin,"Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Look within your heart then ask,
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
Cause I love such elementary things,
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me.
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my childhood",Childhood [Theme From Free Willy 2],2008
Gregory Martin,"He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fires deep in his eyes

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Don't let no one get you down
Keep movin' on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing...

Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy

Every child should sing together in harmony

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers

I'm looking for you 
Drifting on a memory 
Ain't no place I'd rather be 
Than with you, loving you 
Day will make a way for night 
All we'll need is candlelight 
And a song soft and long, well 
Glad to be here alone 
With a lover unlike no other 
Safe to see a new horizon 
Slowly coming into view 

I wanna be living for the love of you 
All that I'm giving is for the love of you 

Lovely as a ray of sun 
That touches me when the morning comes 
Feels good to me, my love and me 
Smoother than a gentle breeze 
Flowing through my mind with ease 
Soft as can be well when you're loving me 
Love to be Riding the waves of your love 
Enchanted with your touch It seems to me 
We can sail together in and out of mystery 

I wanna be living for the love of you 
All that I'm giving is for the love of you 

Paradise I have within 
Can't feel insecure again 
You're the key and this I see 
Now and then I lose my way 
Using words to try and say 
What I feel yeah love is real 
Ooh I might as well 
Sign my name on a card 
Which could say it better

It's not her smile but it's such a lovely smile

Is another girl better than me

Gregory Phillips,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
And you left me here on the wild side of life",The Wild Side of Life,1992

Sweeping dust and memories beneath the carpet that we purchased
Somewhere on some cool retreat
Somewhere in Africa somewhere

I've been trying to catch my breath 
From the illusion that I lost it
When you left me

I've been checking for the weather and the time
I'm like a bag that's dropped 
And drifting in the wind that blows from hurricanes 
That comes just after grey clouds fill my eyes

I've been trying to find my footing 
On the slopes of the illusion that I lost it
When you left me

Like bare feet on hot concrete, we have come to some division
Based on pain from bad decisions
Just like clothespins snapped by wild winds
Sometimes you can't hold on to love that never dies

I've been planting all the flowers that you like
With the hope that will take root and smell the blossoms
When the wind blows as we sit deep in the garden sipping tea
As I watch you looking at me 

I've been trying to find reality
A grip on the illusion that I lost you
When you left me",Illusion,2010

Can you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Is there any valley green with spring
Where my heart can go a-journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane?

The music in the night?

Sad as a gypsy

Love was the rule of the day.
Nothing more nothing less
Than to give your friend your best.
There's much more story that I could tell
To make the hardest hearts swell.

This is the story when love was king.

When love was king, do you remember?
When love was king, when love was king
I remember when love was king

He ruled the land, with his fist unfurled
With open arms for the world
Of hungry children, first he'd think
To pull their lives from the brink
When love was king
He rescued souls lost in the sea
In drifting vessel he would hear their plea
When love was king
He threw a line before they'd sink
And gave the thirsty ones a drink

He told the meek that they should try
To use the sword to smite the lie
That being king is for the weak
When love was king
I pray the lord these words we seek

When love was king
He showed respect for every man
Regardless of their skin or clan
Beside him stood his mighty queen
and equal force wise and keen
He lifted up the underneath
And all his wealth he did bequeath
To those who toiled with out a gain
SO they would remember his reign

So seek someplace to call your own
Right next to this mighty shinning throne

Gregory Porter,"He's satisfied to dream his whole life away
Candy-coated castles, life of play
Broomsticks are his magic cars
Climb aboard and you'll ride the stars
Can you remember? It seems like yesterday

Getting older
Growing taller
Getting smarter
He'll find his way

Rocket ships that never leave his hand
But he's in space 'cause he's a rocket-ship man
Got to fight in some galaxy wars
Climb aboard and you'll ride the stars
Got to get home to kiss his mama goodnight

Getting older
Growing taller
Getting smarter
He'll find his way

Can't go too far 'cause silly grown-up life is straight ahead

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

But I can still recall
A summer sky

Goodbye to summer
To all romantic things
The memories that it brings
Will never die

I shall always remember
The night you went away
I shall always remember
The night I had to say

Goodbye to summer
And now goodbye to you
My summer dream is through
And so goodbye

I shall always remember
The night you went away
I shall always remember
The night I had to say

Goodbye to summer
And now goodbye to you
My dream is through
And so goodbye
Goodbye to summer and you

Along with your dainty exquisite guest
Across mountain land and serpentining seas
These two have been on quite an odyssey

But you're a fool to think this princess
Could ever really love a couple of poor boys like us
She requires riches recherc
Riding with rodomontading rou's

Casanovas have charmed with chiffons
So Chichi chased her with their conceited coteries
Maharajahs have magniloquently mouthed
Their love for me through their menageries

She's been propositioned
Propounded by every pompous prince
Given panniers of peerless pears
And plums, polished

I've been seduced with shimmering, sparkling stones
Squired by suitors to sizable chateaus
And oh, I'm the one she chose

I understand how you can love a man of truth
So why don't you just ask him where he spent his youth?
Oh, look at her face, she really doesn't see
That you are from the dark and you've been lying through your teeth

Anhura, please listen, I really can explain
I meant to tell you sooner, it's been gnawing at my brain
Now you know the truth but that knowledge shouldn't change
The nature of our love, we've broken through the chains

I'm sure that she would care to hear your acumen
As to how your presence is the reason she is sick
But I suppose it's in vain, since her life is ending
When I thrust this blade into her heart-a-thumping

Brother, no

Brother, what have I done?
My blade has pierced your side
This was never my intent
O, God, please stay alive

Dear Pallis, you're my brother
You've tried to protect me
But your dagger's edge finding my flesh
It truly was my destiny

Brother, I was shortsighted
I ignored your cries
You really are the chosen one
The calculated sacrifice

Please listen to my last words
Before I fade away
This is my gift to you
Live for your love every day

Please don't let your tired heart stop beating
You're bleeding, just keep breathing
You will take care of this spinning sphere
I'll disappear and see you in the mirror

Place your hand on mine one last time and kiss me goodbye
Take the love inside my mind before I die
Place your hand on mine one last time and kiss me goodbye
Take the love inside my mind before I die
Before I die, please don't cry

The mountains seceded
The Light and Dark depleted
We lost Adakias but regained our science
Our world was finally reunited
So this is my cue of where to leave you

Now it's your story to retell and pass on
Because an idea is only relevant if it's being thought upon
So remember, never surrender
'Cause the unrelenting constancy of love and hope
Will rescue and restore you from any scope

Yet we curb our speech because words are not enough

I can't let her learn about my past.
If she found out where I came from, she'd turn so fast.
And not look back, I can't go back, I just won't go back!

I can't slow down, I'm scared I'm falling too fast.

You can hold onto my hand, cause I have found my man.

Daughter, my dear, please open both your ears. 
There is something not right here. 
I can't place my finger on it, 
But this young man is filled with darkness.
Did you think I'd just sit back and let this slide? (You are mistaken!)

Denied by the king and his greed, 
The pair would indeed be married in secrecy. 
But before they had agreed when and where to meet, 
The princess felt queasy and weak, could barely speak. 
Adakias knew instantly why she was so green 
And what had caused the disease. It was his proximity. 
She was ill from his company. Evils ubiquity. 
You can't run from your history. 
Your past will seek you endlessly. 
He knew the only remedy to her viral malady resided 
And abided on the opposite side of the petrous 
Levy and its harsh, barbed, concrete peak. 
So while avoiding the leak of his true identity, 
Adakias convinced the princess of their leave. 
They would meet with a specialist and rid her blood of this. 
He kissed her on the lips and assured her a life-long live.",Meet the King,2008

Gretchen Peters,"Joseph walked to Bethlehem
Found no room there at the inn
And knowing not what was to be
He lay beside her patiently
Waitin' on Mary

The shepherds watched, the stars grew bright
The angels said, ""It's gonna be alright
Just have some faith, just wait and see
A miracle will come to be""
Waitin' on Mary

And after all these centuries
The world still has its refugees
The losers in the human race
But with the most amazing grace
They're waitin' on Mary

Faraway on some dark hill
There are faithful waiting still
Who have no hope but still believe
Maybe tonight is Christmas eve
And they're waitin' on Mary

",Waitin' on Mary,2008
Gretchen Peters,"There are ghosts out in the rain tonight
High up in those ancient trees
Lord, I've given up without a fight
Another blind fool on his knees
And all the Gods that I've abandoned

Begin to speak in simple tongues
Lord, suddenly I've come to know
There are no roads left to run
Now it's the hour of dogs a-barking

That's what the old ones used to say
It's first light or it's sundown
Before the children cease their play
When the mountains glow like mission wine

And turn gray like a Spanish roan
Ten thousand eyes will stop to worship
And turn away and head on home
She is reaching out her arms tonight

Lord, my poverty is real
I pray roses shall rain down on me
From Guadalupe on her hill
But who am I to doubt these mysteries
Cured in centuries of blood and candle smoke
I am the least of all your pilgrims here

I am most in need of hope
She appeared to Juan Diego
She left her image on his cape
Five hundred years of sorrow

Have not destroyed their deepest faith
But here I am your ragged disbeliever
Old doubting Thomas drowns in tears
As I watched your church sink through the earth

Like a heart worn down through fear
She is reaching out her arms tonight
Lord, my poverty is real
I pray roses shall rain down on me
From Guadalupe on her hill

But who am I to doubt these mysteries
Cured in centuries of blood and candle smoke
I am the least of all your pilgrims here
But I am most in need of hope
I am the least of all your pilgrims here
But I am most in need of hope",Guadalupe,2008
Gretchen Phillips,"Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end

The key to my heart
You hold in your hand
And nothing else matters
We're together again

Together again
The gray skies are gone
Your back in my arms
Now where you belong

The love that I knew
Is living again
And nothing else matters
We're together again

And nothing else matters
We're together again
",Together Again,1999
Gretchen Phillips,"Why must I meet you in a secret rendezvous?
Why must we steal away to steal a kiss or two?
Why must we wait to do the things we want to do?
Why, oh, why, oh, why, oh, why, oh why?

Wish we didn't have to meet secretly
Wish we didn't have to kiss secretly
Wish we didn't have to be afraid
To show the world that we're in love

Till we have the right to meet openly
Till we have the right to kiss openly
We'll just have to be content to be in love secretly

Why, oh, why, oh, why, oh, why, oh why?

Wish we didn't have to meet secretly
Wish we didn't have to kiss secretly
Wish we didn't have to be afraid
To show the world that we're in love

Till we have the right to meet openly
Till we have the right to kiss openly
We'll just have to be content to be in love secretly

Why must we wait until we're dancing cheek to cheek?
To whisper all the words of love we long to speak?
Why must our love be like a game of hide-and-seek?

Gretchen Wilson,"I've never done anything 
That would bring a tear to your eye
I've never crossed the line
Or needed an alibi to cover up a lie
But darling I'll admit
They're been times when I could have
The thing that kept me strong
Is the one thing that is always on My mind

[Chorus]

When I think about cheatin'
I just think about you leavin'
And how my world would fall to pieces
If I tossed your love away
Even when I'm tempted by some stranger
Oh there's never any danger
I just think about you leavin'
When I think about cheatin'

There was a time in Abilene
When he said all the things I wanted to hear
It was hard to turn him down 
Between the champaigne and the sound of whispers in my ear
But it just took one two-step with someone and I was missing you
He never had the chance cause I broke up the dance 
Before the song was through

[Repeat Chorus]",When I Think About cheating,
Gretchen Wilson,"On his side of the bed
He's sleeping like a baby
Dreams are dancing in his head
Lying with his lady
It's a peaceful night
And everything's just fine
On his side of the bed

But on her side of the bed
Those big brown eyes are cryin
From the things he never says
Deep inside she's dyin
As she turns to face the wall
There's no love at all 
On her side of the bed

If he'd just reach out
She'd forget about 
All the times that he let her down
Oh but in his mind
Everything's alright
When the lights go out

Now on his side of the bed
He never even noticed
Her negligee of red
The very same one that she wore 
The night that they were wed
But he never turned his head
To her side of the bed

If he'd just reach out
She'd forget about 
All the times that he let her down
Oh but in his mind 
Everything's alright
When the lights go out

Now on his side of the bed
He wakes up and turns to say I love you
But instead 
All he finds are pages 
Full of words she never said
And that's all she left

Gretchen Wilson,"When it's all over but the shoutin'
When God the Father's done his final accounting 
And I find out that I made the cut
Boys I'm gonna get me a chariot
Yeah a big gold eagle on the hood
Trans Am chariot

Gonna find my great granddaddy
That peace pipe smokin' Cherokee
Gonna get him all schooled 
In them mags and struts
Then we gonna drag us a chariot

Sure hope Samson ain't no law dog
Redneck you better out run him
Damn sure don't want to get caught
Crime what crime
We was all hopped up on new wine
And mama's gonna kill me if I get 
Kicked out of the choir
But you just gotta run them chariots

Now here's a little story happened long ago
One day Ezekiel went out for a stroll
Walkin' by the river low and behold
Down came 4 angels in a Cadillac gold 
He said ""swing down sweet chariot come on and give me a ride""
So they scooped em up, the rig was souped up, man it had TV's inside
Ol' Zeke was surprised cause his eyes had seen beyond
His wildest dreams, He'd go on to see a thousand things

We'll paint that number eight on the driver's side 
That's how old I was when I gave Jesus my life
I stepped right up and got washed in the blood
Just a little kid singin' 'bout a chariot

And I ain't leaving till they throw me out
Gonna have a little fun gonna get me some
You know I'm here, I'm here for the party

I may not be a ten but the boys say I clean up good
And if I give 'em half a chance
For some rowdy romance you know they would
I've been waiting all week just to have a good time
So bring on them cowboys and their pick-up lines

You know I'm here for the party
And I ain't leaving till they throw me out
Gonna have a little fun gonna get me some

Or some old umbrella to hold off the rain
Don't have to cross over a river of tears
All that I need is right here

Holding you holds me together
When holding on gets just a little too hard
When this tight rope I travel
Begins to unravel and I feel like
I'm falling apart

A runaway track

I'm sure you waited for a long.long time
To find a man like mine
But honey you're too late
So before you go and make your move
Maybe me and you should get a few things straight

Gretchen Wilson,"I was raised in Pocahontas Illinois
Everybody thought of me as one of the boys
Because I'd run with the crowd that was tough
At 15 I was tendin' Big O's Bar
Singing till two a.m. for a half full tip jar
Spent my youth singing truth payin' dues

I'm the biggest thing that ever came from my hometown,
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let 'em down
If it's the last thing I do before they lay me in the ground
You know I'm gonna make Pocahontas proud

I knocked on every door on music row
They looked down at me and said girl go back home you ain't got what we need in this town
They couldn't whup the fightin' side of me
You know where I come from we don't give up easily
Over night it took all my life to be found

I'm the biggest thing that ever came from my hometown,
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let 'em down
If it's the last thing I do before they lay me in the ground
You know I'm gonna make Pocahontas proud

At 27 I had baby Grace
I was born again when I saw her sweet face
And I knew she was the greatest thing I'd ever do

We bought in New Mexico
I was wearin' the chain that old Indian made
That we practically stole

Little shells in a jar
We found Hanalei Bay
Got those matchin' tattoos 
And those ten dollar shoes
To remember our stay

If it hadn't been so good I wouldn't feel so sad
If we hadn't been so happy baby,
It wouldn't hurt this bad,
If you had told me this last summer
I'd be on the floor laughin'
Instead of standing round breakin' down
Wonderin' what happened

What am I supposed to do
Without my very best friend
Boy you left me in shock and tied up in knots
Then it hits me again

If it hadn't been so good I wouldn't feel so sad

Gretchen Wilson,"Hey

Well, five of the PM rolls around
There's a little old joint outside of town
I only got time for a couple of beers
And a jukebox song ringing in my ears
The next you know the bartender's pouring
Shots are flowing, got me stoning
All I really know is that I should be going
But I'm soaking up the moment

I'm all jacked up, all jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Time sure flies when you're all jacked up

It was getting mighty close to nine o'clock
What the hell I'll have one more shot
Then I winked at a boy at the end of the bar
Guess I might of must of gone a little too far
'Cause a big ol' girl walked outta the blue
Ten foot two with a bad attitude
Stepped right up and knocked out my tooth
I guess I had it coming I deserved the due

'Cause I was all jacked up, all jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff when you're all jacked up

Don't have to go home but you can't stay here
That's what they said when I got my last beer
Oh my God, it's two o'clock,
I can't find my keys and my truck's locked

So I grabbed a tire tool and I broke my window
Hurt my elbow, got me in though
Two foot later backed into the light pole
All the town folk got a good show

All jacked up, all jacked up
Don't believe I've ever had this much
One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't drive your truck when you're all jacked up

Jacked up
(All jacked up, all jacked up)
Who

One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't start no stuff when you're all jacked up

One thing I've learned when you get tore up
Don't drive your car
Don't start no stuff in no bar
Hell I wouldn't tell anybody where you are

You're flying high but one day you'll blink and
That cloud your're on will just start sinkin'
Don't wait till it's too late
Whoa oh rebel child

I know you can't learn from my mistakes
You've got your own road you've gotta take
And it might look like it's paved in gold
Just remember that you'll have to reap
All the seeds you sew

Keep your feet on the ground
And one eye one heaven do
Do a lot of forgivin'
But not much forgettin'
And remember life is one big lesson

Gretchen Wilson,"Don't need no diamond ring
Don't want a bunch of bling bling
The only thin I really need
Is a man with a skoal ring
Don't have to be wined and dined
We can stay home every night
I can do without anything
Except a man with a skoal ring

He works a ten hour shift and comes home right on time
He don't complain a bit when I get out of line
He ain't richand he might have a little dirt on his hands
But that worn-out circle on his jeans makes him my kind of man

Don't need no diamond ring
Don't want a bunch of bling bling
The only thin I really need
Is a man with a skoal ring

Somehow we still get along with different colored can's
When that boy comes home from work smellin' like the farm
That berry blend on his lips still turns me on

Don't have to whisper my name the tender way she used to
Oh, I've got a new love to fill my emptiness
But from the lips of a bottle I'll steal one more kiss

Gretchen Wilson,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound

Gretchen Wilson,"If I could do it all again I'd look more in the mirror
Instead of finding someone else to blame
If I could do it all again I'd do a lot more praying
Less cussing about the things that I can't change

I'd laugh a little louder
Sing more in the shower
Care a little less if I'm in tune
Concentrate on who I am
Not who I might have been
If I could do it all again

If I could do it all again I'd take it a little slower
Make a few more memories I could keep
Crawl in bed beside my child, just lay down and watch her
Soaking up the beauty while she sleeps

I'd work less hours
Buy more flowers
Make more love on rainy afternoons
I might make less money
But I'd make a better friend
If I could do it all again

I've made mistakes
Along the way
But I thank God
It's not too late

And talk a little smaller

""You feel those chills?"" 
Â 
I remember when we 
Were out there alone, 
And there we knew we had to stay 
Something shifted 
Before the snow could subside 
And everything that mattered 
Turned slowly around 
(And did you see it then?) 
Â 
I'm flyin ' down the freeway 
On an empty, narrow bypass 
And reflected far beneath me 
The lights flash just like cameras 
And you, now I remember 
Caught beyond the simple splendor 
So we covered up the embers 
And left what we'd been given on the way 
Past the mountains and the storms 
Â 
Here I am 
Trapped within this moment again 
Holding firm, on this aerial I send 
And now I know 
Like I've never really known before 
Come what may 
To remember it and soar 
Â 
Here I am 
Trapped within this moment again 
Holding firm, on this aerial I send 
And now I know 
Like I've never really known before 
Come what may 
To remember it and soar 
You turn to me once more

It's early Tuesday morning 
And you're gently, calmly sleeping 
I can hear the water turning 
And the heaviness is overwhelming",Chills,1997
Grey Eye Glances,"What's the point of your lies 
To believe in something new 
And though I know it's not 
You say it's fine, sure it's fine 
Just a game played out by you 
And the fools you've brought along 
But when they meet the me you see 
Sooner or later, it just won't matter 
 
When the me you say you see 
Is a stranger to you, keeping her own distance 
Sure indeed, she's a part of me 
And a small part, too, making my own substance 
Like the lights that light the night 
We can turn them off, and I can breathe in shadows 
When the me that's really me 
Is alive and well, I wouldn't tell a thing 
 
So show me what you know I need 
I've been dying to come down 
I do not blame you or tame you 
Turn from me, count to three 
Your hide and seek will not reveal 
The sorrow that I feel 
But should you find the me you see 
Sooner or later, you just might feel it 
 
When the me you say you see 
Is a stranger to you, keeping her own distance 
Sure indeed, she's a part of me 
And a small part, too, making my own substance 
Like the lights that light the night 
We can turn them off, and I can breathe in shadows 
When the me that's really me 
Is alive and well, I wouldn't tell it 
 
Do you really have to leave so soon 
There's a call that you should take 
You know the house you built 
It's burning now, burning now 
So sorry I wished it all away 
You should have told me what to say 
But when there's little left for me 
Sooner or later, oh well, whatever 
 
When the me you say you see 
Is a stranger to you, keeping her own distance 
Sure indeed, she's a part of me 
And a small part, too, making my own substance 
Like the lights that light the night 
We can turn them off, and I can breathe in shadows 
When the me I know as me 
Is alive and well, I wouldn't 
I wouldn't tell it 
I wouldn't tell a thing 
 
When the me you say you see 
Is a stranger to you, keeping her own distance 
So ok, it's a part you say, 
I'm supposed to play, never mind the substance 
But like the lights that light the night 
We can turn them off 
And I can breathe in shadows 
I can breathe in shadows",The Me You See,1997
Grey Eye Glances,"Seagulls on posts 
Perched on a bridge 
That stretches farther than most 
Something reminds me 
How I think of you now 
When I'm alone 
 
But loneliness hides 
Within all the craziness 
I need to survive 
Despite the retracing 
Of a past I can't find 
In words I write 
 
And now as I recall them 
The parts I wish I had forgotten 
If only I could draw them 
Be sure it wouldn't be 
The way it is now 
 
Can you hear me out there 
Have you noticed there's a presence in the air 
How's it feel to be there? 
 
Walking through town 
Little surprises me 
I look to the ground 
This place holds nothing for me 
Still I hold on 
To what I feel 
 
And strangers come to greet me 
They only mean the best for me 
I keep them at a distance 
It's not the time for me 
To let them inside

While chimes unknowingly move 
But stop before they start to sound 
Echoes forming 
From words returning again

I'll do what I can

Have you noticed there's a presence everywhere

We made just to live

Grey Eye Glances,"Hey you 
Been some time but still it feels like yesterday last thing 
I remember you were on your way off to find what we had forgotten 
Crazy 
Can't recall a moment when you left my mind never looking forward or too far behind 
Never gave a thought to stopping 
 
And the words you said they carried my days and now here you are and still I'm amazed 
 
That there's a kind of love 
That makes you want to stay 
There's a kind of love 
That makes you want to stay awake all night 
 
Hey you 
Feeling like a stranger in the circumstance feeling like you need to close your eyes and dance giving up your heart to the voices 
Some said 
We had all been blinded by the run-around lost amid the chaos in a way we found 
There were patterns deep in our choices 
 
And I never saw how once I was here 
I could ever see myself in that fear 
 
But there's a kind of love 
That makes your vision clear, so clear 
And there's a kind of love 
That makes you want to stay awake all night 
 
In the middle of the night 
In a place we call our own, 
When there's time to settle back 
When we're alone 
 
So stop me when 
More or less I find it always feels the same chasing off illusions in my circle game 
At the times when I lose my balance 
 
And I go real deep to find what I can 
And I go real deep to find where I am 
 
But there's a kind of love 
That makes you understand this life 
And there's a kind of love 
That makes your vision clear, so clear 
And there's a kind of love 
That makes you want to stay awake all night",Kind of Love,1998

And as for the words 
I fear I never said enough 
I watched as the night moved fast 
And years simply changed 
And endings let a calm begin

Try to remember this 
We were taught to be amazed 
And now we're on our own

To find a place, to stop and be alone

Looking out on the park, last night 
The snow in the street lamps 
Fell for hours but left no trace 
I turned down the lights 
I turned down the blinds

When your world soon comes undone 
Try to remember this 
With each setting of the sun

We'll drive an hour just north of town 
Where you and I can stop and be alone 
Where you can I can stop

You left on the table 
""Please come to find me, when you're able""

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning

To things like dreams that never seem to die
And I'm not so strong to lay them down
And say my goodbyes
How do you say goodbye?

If there's a remedy
A break from all my vanity
Then I'm gonna need your help

If there's hope for me
Pull me down to my knees
Where I'm begging for your help

To let go
(To let go, to let go, to let go)
To let go

To let all that I've planned just slip away
But I would be a fool
To tighten up my hands and be afraid
What I need is faith

If there's hope for me
Pull me down to my knees
Where I'm begging for your help

I'm bringing everything that's left of me
I throw myself into your love

It?s been here all along
So come back to the start
And you?ll find in your heart
That you always belonged

Just take the rope
I won?t let it go
Give in
We can start again
I?m life, I?m hope
And I?m ready to explode
With how bad I want you back home

So come back to the light
To the love, you will find
It?s been here all along
So come back to the start
And you?ll find in your heart
That you always belonged

You?re my daughter, you?re my son
You?re the one I long to love
And you?ve heard I chose to die
Do you know you?re the reason why?

It’s only fate some things are meant to be
Who needs to know
Looking for reasons when life casts a stone
Leaving me screaming inside

So much for love
Lost you in over again
Covered in blood
You had the sense to stay calm and contained
There's no sense in crying my blues for my brain
Leaving me standing outside

Show me a sign
Something that’s shining, like
Tears in your eyes
You can surprise me
Because I want to be
The one you return to
You just believe you’re not alone in the world

It’s only fate
It’s everything you bargained for
It’s only fate
It’s everything you bargained for
It’s only fate
It’s everything you bargained for
It’s only fate
