Roxette,"I don't know much about you, but I pretty sure I want to be with you
I haven't got a clue what is wrong, what is right, what is left to do
I read a magazine
I watch a TV-screen
I dive into a dream only to find me in love with you

I wish you'll never stop to make my head go pop
You make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop 
every time you're around

It's a pleasant valley Sunday and everything seems to be beautiful
People go to church, but I'm found contemplating by the swimmingpool
I'm gazing at the sun
I watch him bringing joy to everyone
I feed the ducks with a ban only to find me in love with you

I wish you'll never stop to make my head go pop
You make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop

You make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop 
every time you're around
Press to play and never stop to make my head go pop
Yea, you make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop every time you're around

Make my head go pop pop pop
Make my head go pop pop
Go pop pop
I feed the ducks with a ban only to find me in love with you",Make My Head Go Pop,2001
Roxette,"Milk and toast and honey make it sunny
On a rainy Saturday, he-he-hey
Milk and toast, some coffee take the stuffiness
Out of days you hate, you really hate
Slow morning news pass me by I try
Not to analyze but didn't he blow my
Mind this time
Didn't he blow my mind?

(here he comes)
To bring a little lovin' honey
To take away the hurt
Inside is everything that matters to me
Is everything I want in life

Milk and
Toast and honey

To bring a little lovin', honey
To take away the pain inside is everything
That matters to me
Is everything
I want from life
(here he comes)
Oh lay
A little lovin', baby
To feel you're gettin'
Close to me is everything that matters to me
Is everything I want to be

Ain't it funny how things sometimes look so
Clear and feel so near
The dreams I dream,
My favorite wishful thinkin'
Oh he's
Bookmarked everywhere, everywhere
True
Love might fall from the sky
You never know
What to find but didn't he blow my mind this time
Didn't he blow my mind?

(here he comes)",Milk and Toast and Honey,2001
Roxette,"Some days are covered in rain
while other days are made for glory
And you are the summer sun
The only one who knows the story

Do you want to talk about it? - I don't know
Do you want to say some words? - Oh, I can't let go
I'm talking about my world, my love, my life
Everytime I try to close my eyes
you just enter my mind
and you lay yourself down beside me... oh why?

Some streets are covered with sweat
there are no regrets just new connections... oh why?
You are the Summer Son and i'm the one who wants affection

Do you want to talk about it? - I don't know
Do you want to speak some words? - Oh, I can't let go
I'm talking about my world, my love, my life
Everytime I try to close my eyes
you just run through my head
and you lay yourself down, beside me... oh why?

My world, my life...

I'm talking about my world, my love, my life
Everytime... I try to close my eyes
You just enter my mind
and you lay yourself down, beside me... oh why...
You just run through my head
and you lay yourself down, beside me... oh why...

My world, my life...","My World, My Love, My Life",2001
Roxette,"Right at the front door I recognized the perfume
The scent was perfect in the dusk by the moon
There must be many ways to ask her to my room
Why didn't I dare?

Well, every hour I try to get somethin' done
Out on the weekend when I'm just havin' some fun
I'm windin' up with none, just zeros, no one's, just space with no air

I get: ""bye-bye baby-baby bye baby-baby bye-bye
Real sugar, I don't want to climb no walls
Real sugar, that's what I want or none at all
Real sugar, sweet as a sweet can be
Real sugar, that's what I want and what I need
That's what I need

Yeh, every Friday I'm gattin' ready to roll
I want her blue eyes start sayin' ""hi"" and ""hello""
But I can always tell she'd rather be alone with some other guy

I get: ""bye-bye baby-baby bye baby-baby bye-bye
Real sugar, I don't want to climb no walls
Real sugar, that's what I want or none at all
Real sugar, sweet as a sweet can be
Real sugar, that's what I want and what I need
Real sugar, I don't want to climb no walls
Real sugar, that's what I want or none at all
Real sugar, sweet as a sweet can be
Real sugar, that's what you've got so what's for me? Hey, what's for me?

I turn myself in, turn turn turn
I turn myself out. outside and in
Gimme gimme real sugar
I don't want to climb no walls",Real Sugar,2001
Roxette,"I left and wrote down this song 'cause my life looked so shatterd
I thank the Lord I'm still strong like before
I picked myself up from the floor and tried

I tried just a little bit harder, oh yea
If someone wants you to bleed and it feels like your're dying
Don't make the moves you don't need, don't cry, just say ba-ba-bye-bye and try, try

Try just a little bit harder, you'll survive
Try just a little bit harder, go ahead and try

Mondays and rainy days were in my pocket
I don't want to send them on to you
Bring them home to you",Try (Just a Little Bit Harder),2001
Roxette,"[Chorus:]
What am I gonna do when I get a little excited
A little in pain, tell me
What am I gonna say when I find
The center of my heart is a suburb to the brain

You wear them so well
Those innocent eyes
You're putting on a wonderful disguise
I want you so bad
I'm pushing my luck
It feels like being hit by a truck
This is no place special
Don't know why I came
If someone has a minute
Won't you explain

Dealing with fire
I want you come around

Come out

And play

Within these walls
This is no place special
Nothing for the same

Roxette,"I came in crawling
With an absent-minded smile
I had so many things un-tied that summer night
When I decided it was worth another try
Entering your heart.. ohh yeah

Close your eyes
Don't say a word
All your thoughts must go un-heard
And i......
Have failed so many times....
Entering your mind....
Entering your mind....

I'm not the most important one under the sun
I don't have any power connections to the pentagon
But I've got something of my own, that must get done

Entering you heart
Ohhh... entering your heart
Close your eyes
Don't tell a soul....
All you dreams must be told....

Roxette,"When the day gets dark 
Over a thousand streets 
And you feel your heart 
Is a living beat 

When you're all alone 
And you close your eyes 
Naked to the bone 
The dream comes alive 

Do you get excited 
When I touch you in the night? 
My oh my... 
Do you get excited 
When I meet you every night? 
You won't let the night pass you by 

When your body's hot 
The window's open wide 
This moment's all you got 
In this race of life 

When you feel the fire 
Is getting close to you 
Hey baby, you know 
I'm lonely too 

Do you get excited 
When I touch you in the night? 
My oh my...

Roxette,"You promised me it would last forever
You said there's no way it could die

Every truth, everything I believed in
Has turned out wrong

Roxette,"Breathe your life.

I've got to come down
I've been awake for far too long
My eyes look torn, they were so strong
I wore the crown, I wrote the song
Now it's fading
My heart was open
Like a window to a summer breeze

I breathed your love,
I filled my lungs and veins
And I breathed your love
Until I felt the pain
And like rain it slipped away

I tried to find out
What love was really all about
Behind the curtain waits the sky
It's rare I feel enough to cry
I'm drying up inside
My life was open
Like a window to the summer breeze

I breathed your love,
I filled my lungs and veins
And I breathed your love 
Until I met the pain and like rain
It slipped away, just like a little rain.

I breathed your love 
And nothing stayed the same.
Yes, I breathed your love 
And filled my heart in vain 'cause like rain 
It slipped away, just like rain it swept away.",Breathe,2003
Roxette,"Every day I see him coming
Every day he walks on by
Life used to be so plain and simple
Before he came into my life

Every night I keep on dreaming
Every night I take him home
We always go to bed together
I always wake up all alone

[Chorus]
Oh it's strange, so strange
What he's doing to me
Oh it's strange so strange
Did this ever happen to you
The way it has happened to me
The way it just happened to me

Every day outside my window
Always minutes close to eight
I wish he stayed a little longer
But his bus is never late

Every night we're dancing slowly
I play the music he adores
Like Sinatra then we're talking
All important things for sure

[Chorus]

Oh it's strange so strange
What he's doing to me
Oh so strange real strange
Did this ever happen to you

When it's never ending?
Can you tell me where to go
When no one's home?

Chorus:
And I know, you know
It hurts
It hurts to be alone

You're wrong, you're wrong
On the one-way train going down
Can you tell me what to say
When there's no one listening?
Can you show me what to do
When all is done?

[Chorus:]

The plan has gone wrong
Like a one-way train going down
Going down, down, down
Going down
Going down, down, down

It hurts
It hurts to be alone
You're wrong, oh you're wrong

He's arriving 
And I don't know what I'd do without him 
I got life suddenly 

See, see me 
I've got nothing to hide 
See me 
I've got nothing to hide 
See me 

I'm leaving my heart in the palm of his hand 
So gently 
I know he knows that I love him 
Though I've never said is there an easy way

Seems it's already morning
I see the sky, it's so beautiful and blue
The TV's on but the only thing showing
Is a picture of you

Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too

Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you are missing me too

Time will make sure I'll get over you
This silly game of love you play, you win only to lose

She turned her head much better off on her own.

I died, shoelace untied she looked in my eyes, small and surprised.
And God closed every gaze the moon fell into the lake.
Boy, she's gone, a drift she's better off on her own.
She closed, then she left much better off on her own.
Sitting naked by the windowsill watching cars upon the hill.
Am I sleeping?

To sell a plastic prayer

I saw somethin' in my mirror comin up on the right
A fire red roadster pulled next to my ride
It was too dark to see the driver inside
I heard a voice though I couldn't see the face
And it asked me if I wanted to race
Then he lit a cigarette and by the light I could see
I was talkin' to the Devil, he was talkin' to me 

Race with the Devil, if you lose
You gotta pay the Devil his dues
Race with the Devil, live to tell
One foot on the gas and the other in Hell! 

The Devil looked at me with an evil smile
He said, ""We're racin' for your soul this next quarter mile""
I said, ""Listen Old Nick, I'll take that bet""
I said, ""I take all comers and I haven't lost yet!""
He said, ""If you win, you can choose your game
But if you lose, boy, I've got your name!""
I revved my engine and dropped into gear
My rod was runnin' on nitro, I was runnin' on fear

You gotta pay the Devil his dues
Race with the Devil, live to tell
One foot on the gas and the other in Hell!

I'm racin', racin' with the Devil
I got my pedal to the metal
One slip now could be fatal
'Cause I'm racin', racin' with the Devil 

The smell of burning rubber filled the air
I was racin' for my life without a second to spare
I gripped that stick and my knuckles turned white
He's not takin' my soul, not without a fight
I got a bad, bad motor sitting under my wheels
So to hell with the Devil and his deals
I put the pedal to the metal and I blew right by

Slide on rainbows
In furs or blue jeans

The madison and cheap thrills
Bored with the Beguine
The samba isn't your scene
They're playing our tune
By the pale moon
We're incognito

Down the Lido
And we like the Strand
Arabs at oasis
Eskimos and Chinese

Look through who's who
See La Goulue
And Nijinsky
Do the Strandsky
Weary of the Waltz
And mashed potato schmaltz

I'll wait for His sign

Hush now don't you cry
His quiet waters
Will never, never run dry
Nearing death's vale
He's here by my side
He leads me to paradise
A mountain so high

Just treasure His word
Singing His praises
I know that I'll be heard
He's gonna take you by the hand
He's gonna make you feel so good
Open up your eyes

Forget all your troubles

Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it,
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin',
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin',
I saw a white ladder all covered with water,
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken,
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin',
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world,
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin',
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin',
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin',
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter,
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony,
I met a white man who walked a black dog,
I met a young woman whose body was burning,
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow,
I met one man who was wounded in love,
I met another man who was wounded with hatred,
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard,
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin',
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest,
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty,
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters,
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison,
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden,
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten,
Where black is the color, where none is the number,
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it,
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it,
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin',
But I'll know my song well before I start singin',

No I can´t help it i´m love

And hold her in my arms, but then
What if she got real mad and told him so
I could never face either once again

Will my aching heart ever mend
Or will I always be in love

Where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
Walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
Stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
Been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in a mouth of a graveyard

I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a bleedin'
A white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

And it's a hard rain's a gonna fall

And what did you hear, my blue eyed son?
What did you hear, my darling young one
I heard the sound of thunder that roared out a warning
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a blazin'
Heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
Heard one person starve, many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young girl whose body was burning

Another man who was wounded with hatred

What'll you do now, my darling young one?
I'm goin' back out 'fore the rain starts fallin'
Walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
Where people are many and their hands are all empty
Where pellets of poison are flooding the waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, and none is the number

And reflect it from the mountains so all souls can see it

But I'll know my song well before I start singing

When she passes that Nashville Tower you can hear that whistle whine
Stick your hand right out the window and feel that southern breeze
You're on that Pan American on her way to New Orleans

The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk
Kaw-Liga too stubborn to ever show a sign
Because his heart was made of knotty pine

Poor ol' Kaw-Liga, he don't know what he missed
Is it any wonder that his face is red?

His heart was set on the Indian maiden with the coal black hair
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show
So she could never answer yes or no

Roy Acuff,"How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I would do things my way?
But little they know that's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind

Once I was willing in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
But suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind

I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

Buried deep in her grave lies the one that I love
She was called from this earth, a jewel for Heaven
More precious than diamonds, more precious than gold

A jewel here on earth, a jewel in Heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

When a girl of sixteen, we courted each other
She promised someday to become my sweet wife
I bought her the ring to wear on her finger
But the angels they called her to Heaven one night

A jewel here on earth, a jewel in Heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

This world has it wealth, its trials and troubles
Mother Earth holds her treasures of diamonds and gold

Did you hear anyone pray?

I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brother
I didn't hear nobody pray
I heard the crash on the highway
But, I didn't hear nobody pray.

When I heard the crash on the highway
I knew what it was from the start
I went to the scene of destruction
And a picture was stamped on my heart.

There was whiskey and blood all together
Mixed with glass where they lay
Death played her hand in destruction
But I didn't hear nobody pray.

I wish I could change this sad story
That I am now telling you
But there is no way I can change it
For somebody's life is now through.

Their soul has been called by the Master
They died in a crash on the way
And I heard the groans of the dying
But, I didn't hear nobody pray.

Is one with the great church of God.

They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name.

4. Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake.

5. She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky.

6. In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is o'er.

7. I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look.

On the cloud that He writes in His Word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him

Roy Acuff,"There were no loved one to weep over her
Not a tear did I see shed
For the lady they pulled from that muddy old river
No one ever came to claim their dead

She lay on the cold marble slab at the marque
Thousands viewed her but none knew her name
They will lay her to rest in Potter's Field tomorrow
She will lay there unloved and unclaimed

As I looked in her faced I couldn't help but think
What a poor wicked place this world can be",Unloved and Unclaimed,2001
Roy Acuff,"Some people are just like an automobile
They'll run fine when every thing is right
When the roads are all clear and the weather is fine
And there's plenty of sunshine and light

And then get stuck and have to detour
Maybe a break in the casting will prove
They never were built to endure

Get plenty of water and plenty of oil
And the best gasoline you can find
Have the engine tuned up and look out for your breaks
You'll have some hard places to climb

Look out for the tires for the blowouts will come
On a dangerous curve deep and neigh
But if you'll let Jesus take hold of the wheel
You'll make it to heaven on high

Some auto's are painted and polished so bright
They sell for more than they are worth
And some people think their profession
Will do stop short of the bibles new birth

Just start up your engine and then
You can tell if the thing is hitting on six
For if you depend on the looks of the car
You'll be in a terrible fix

Now all our profession's of powder and paint
Though lovely upon the outside
Won't answer to God for He looks on the heart
It matters not how hard we've tried

So if you are stuck in the quicksand of sin
And wondering and floundering about

Buried deep in her grave lies the one that I love

More precious than diamonds, more precious than gold

A jewel here on earth, a jewel in Heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

When a girl of sixteen, we courted each other
She promised someday to become my sweet wife
I bought her the ring to wear on her finger
But the angels they called her to Heaven one night

A jewel here on earth, a jewel in Heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

This world has it wealth, its trials and troubles
Mother Earth holds her treasures of diamonds and gold
But it can't hold the soul of one precious jewel
She's resting in peace with the Heavenly fold

May the angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

Praise the lord I saw the light.

Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that god gave back his sight
Praise the lord I saw the light.

Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right

Roy Acuff & His Smokey Mountain Boys,"From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
From the queen of flowing mountain to the south bell by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome and know quite well by all
She’s the combination on the Wabash Cannonball

She came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she rolled in the station you could hear all the people say
There's a girl from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball

Our estern states are dandies so the people always say
From New York to St. Louis and Chicago by the way
From the hills of Minnesota where the rippling waters fall
No changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball

Here’s to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And always be remembered 'round the courts of Alabama
His earthly race is over and the curtains 'round him fall
We'll carry home to victory on the Wabash Cannonball

Listen to the jingle the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear the lonesome hobos call
You’re traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball",Wabash Cannonball,1995

Who was it fell by the way?

Did you hear anyone pray?

I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brother
I didn't hear nobody pray
I heard the crash on the highway
But, I didn't hear nobody pray.

When I heard the crash on the highway
I knew what it was from the start
I went to the scene of destruction
And a picture was stamped on my heart.

There was whiskey and blood all together
Mixed with glass where they lay
Death played her hand in destruction
But I didn't hear nobody pray.

I wish I could change this sad story
That I am now telling you
But there is no way I can change it
For somebody's life is now through.

Buried deep in her grave lies the one that I love
She was called from this earth, a jewel for Heaven
More precious than diamonds, more precious than gold

A jewel here on earth, a jewel in Heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

She promised someday to become my sweet wife
I bought her the ring to wear on her finger
But the angels they called her to Heaven one night

A jewel here on earth, a jewel in Heaven
She'll brighten the kingdom around God's great throne
May the angels have peace, God bless her in Heaven
They've broken my heart and they left me to roam

This world has it wealth, its trials and troubles
Mother Earth holds her treasures of diamonds and gold
But it can't hold the soul of one precious jewel

They'll run fine when every thing is right
When the roads are all clear and the weather is fine

Have the engine tuned up and look out for your breaks

They sell for more than they are worth
And some people think their profession
Will do stop short of the bibles new birth

For if you depend on the looks of the car
You'll be in a terrible fix

Though lovely upon the outside
Won't answer to God for He looks on the heart

And wondering and floundering about
Just let God's great engine of glory and grace

As I opened up her door
I knew I would regret it

Is set off with a kiss
And it's so tough when the satisfaction
Is greater than the risk

This time you can't resist

Hey, Mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades.
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin';
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just hung her head and said, ""Son,
Papa was a rollin' stone.

Roy Ayers,"Through early morning fog I see
Visions of the things to be
The pains that are withheld for me
I realize and I can see

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card of some delay
So this is all I have to say

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skin
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works it's way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it burn

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied, ""Oh why ask me?""

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And you can do the same thing if you please

Roy Ayers,"Now my room has got two windows but the sunshine never comes through,
You know it's always dark and dreary since I broke off, baby, with
you!
CHORUS:
I live on a lonely avenue,
My little girl wouldn't say, ""I do"".
Well, I feel so sad and blue
and it's all because of you.
I could cry, I could cry, i could cry,
I could die, I could die, I could die,
because I live on a lonely avenue, lonely avenue.
2. (Now my) covers they feel like lead and my pillow it feels like
stone,
Well, I've tossed and turned so ev'ry night,
I'm not used to being alone!

3. Now I've been so sad and lonesome since you've left this town,
If I could beg or borrow the money, child, I would be a highway
bound!

Yes, I'm in love, who looks at you the way I do?

How can I show you that I'm glad I got to know you?

Cause I've heard some talk, they say you think I'm fine
This girl's in love and what I'd do to make you mine?

Roy Ayers,"Talib Kweli:
Yes, welcome to the wonderful sounds of Talib Kweli

Ladies...

I got you in the mood, for an interlude,
Raw like in the nude, I hope this ain't considered rude,
But let's stop talkin, cause it's feelin like an interview,
I know you into me, so, let me get into you,
I'm always in the mood for laughin and lovin and rappin and *fcukin*, And passin the dutch and Relaxin and puffin and hittin and duckin,
The rippin production, these kittens ain't muffins,
Just because we stuff 'em in the oven,
My words drippin off the tongue like the wax from a candle wick,
Ill the way I lay down the rap, they can't handle it,
Cats all sappy like romantic flicks, dude, get a clue,
Like Colonel Mustard in the study with a candlestick,
They holdin hands with these dudes like they goin steady,
But, one glimpse and I know they ready, you already know,
Slipped her a note like, 'you ready to go?'
We make a getaway plan and we head for the do'!

[Chorus] x 2
I wear the night like a cloak 'cause I move with the stars,
Navigate through the truly bizarre,
Who we are, who we is, it's the kids that stay true to this life,
And if the mood is right, we gon' do it tonight,

Kanye:
You messin up my mo', my whole mood, told y'all, oh,
Lose, eat crews like crews like soulfood,
The only producer that feel like ""fuck rappers!""
Only backpacker with a chip like hackers,
Only Michael Richardson, only much blacker,
So if he say nigga, then I'ma say *cracker*,
Is this the Ritz? Carlton? Dress like, fresh, like, just like..
I'm the shit (Uggh)
You ain't figured out what I'm about yet,
Always rockin that 'this ain't out yet',
But this ain't 'bout that,
From a city where niggas plug like outlets,
Far as music go yo, it ain't no outlets, so,
When I go out, niggas always out to get me in the studio,
And I ain't in the mood to flow,
I'm with my girl and I'm tryin to hit the movies yo,
And they tryna act stupid, oh!
In the club with Silicone Suzie,
What happened to real girls like Rudy?
With real titties like Tooty,
This girl got a silicone booty!
And got the nerve to act moody!
Now I ain't tryin to judge like Judy,
But bitch you a man, you can't fool me!
Act like Fifty, throw her in a pool G...

[Chorus] x 2

Talib: Break it down

Bringin the drum, keep it funky like a stink in a slum,
'Cause see they wanna breed cursin for the things that don't come
The speakers wrong that we rap dudes speakin in tongues
Christmas time choice for what? No we keepin our guns
Smokin a piff to cause a leak in your lungs,
You ain't got shit to do like Friday when the weekend begun,
Completely done with rap dudes - don't compete with the dumb,
I spill my blood for the people, see how deep it can run?
I'm in the mood like Dante and Main Flow,
Never comin with the same flow, got it's change, yo
It's strange yo, to make yo chain glow, that's yo main goal
That's a facade like I'm somewhere over the rainbow
Really these cats sweeter than mangoes, Mr Bonjangles-ass dudes,
Dancin around the club, doin the tango,
Go hard like Iverson playin with hurt ankles,
Plus, wrestle the topic from a different Kurt Angle!

Visions of the things to be
The pains that are withheld for me
I realize and I can see

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card of some delay
So this is all I have to say

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

The sword of time will pierce our skin
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works it's way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it burn

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please

A brave man once requested me
To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied, ""Oh why ask me?""

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And you can do the same thing if you please

Laá die Finger weg, er taugt nicht viel!
Aber sie hat ihm allein vertraut
Und für ihn war alles nur ein Spiel.
Als er sie dann sitzen lieá
Traf sie's wie ein Schlag
Sie tat mir schon lange leid
Und ich hab' ihr gesagt:
Es war nur Sand in deinen Augen
Das wird vergehen
Und do wirst sehen
Wie gut ich's meine.
Es war nur Sand in deinen Augen
Erst gibt es Tränen
Dann ist dein Blick wieder klar und frei.
Viele Tage lang verkroch sie sich
Nicht mal Freunde durften bei ihr sein.
Sie ging nicht einmal ans Telefon
Und sie sperrte sich I'm Zimmer ein.
Doch ich klopfte an der Tür
Meine Angst war so groá
Ganz verzweifelt kam sie 'raus
Und ich sagte ihr bloá:
Es war nur Sand in deinen Augen
. . .
Da nahm ich sie mit zu mir nach Haus
Und war Tag und Nacht für sie nur da
Immer wieder sprachen wir uns aus
Und wir kamen uns einander nah.
Und an unserm schönsten Tag

Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears
Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
If you just make 'em roar
Watch your Mounte bank account soar

Wear a painted mustache
And you're sure to make a big splash
A college education I should never propose
A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Give 'em quips, give 'em fun
And they'll happy to say you're A-1
If you become a farmer you've the weather to buck
If you become a gambler you'll be stuck with your luck
But Jack you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck

She said ""I suppose you've heard
About Alice.""
So, I rushed to the window, and I looked outside,
And I could hardly believe my eyes,
This big limousine pulled slowly into Alice's drive. 
I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go,
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know,
'Cause for 24 years I've been living next door to Alice.

""Say man, your hour has come""
From underneath her silk kimono
She drew a forty-four gun
Oh, it was bear, 'twas quite a large affair
Johnny he dashed down the stairway
Cryin' ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot""
Frankie took aim with her forty-four

Evening shadows find,
There 'neath the stars a maiden so fair divine.

The moon on high seemed to see her there,
In her eyes was a light shining ever so bright,
As she whisper'd a silent pray'r.

Ev'ry word revealed an empty, broken heart;
Broken by fate that holds them so far apart.

Lonely there she kneels, and tells the stars above,
In her arms he belongs, then her pray'r is a song,
Her unending song of love.",A Maiden's Prayer,1963

Has always been the most destructive kind

I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame

I always built to last on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day

So many happy songs were waiting to be sung
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out

And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all

And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond

And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play

Has always been the most destructive kind
I guess that's why now 
I feel so old
Before my time

Yesterday, when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built to last on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
And only now I see how the years ran away

Yesterday, when I was young
So many happy songs were waiting to be sung
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at all

Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play

There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue

Roy Clark,"Kaw-Liga was a wooden indian standing by the door 
He fell in love with an indian maid over in the antique store 
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show 
So she could never answer yes or no 

He always wore his sunday feathers and held a tomahawk 
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk 
Kaw-Liga, too stubborn to ever show a sign 
Because his heart was made of knotty pine 

Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss 
Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed 
Is it any wonder that his face is red? 
Kaw-Liga,that poor old wooden head 

Kaw-Liga was a lonely indian, never went nowhere 
His heart was set on the indian maid with the coal black hair 
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show 
So she could never answer yes or no 

Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss 
Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed 
Is it any wonder that his face is red? 
Kaw-Liga,that poor old wooden head 

Then one day a wealthy customer bought the indian maid 
And took her oh so far away, but old kaw-liga stayed 
Kaw-Liga just stands there as lonely as can be 
And wishes he was still an old pine tree 

Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss

making spirits bright,

A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way!

In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago,
I thought I'd take a ride,

Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upsot.

the story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh,

I sprawling lie,
But quickly drove away.

Jingle all the way!

Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

Way back up in the woods among the evergreens...
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood,
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode...

But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell.

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.
Oh, the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade,
Playing to the rhythm that the drivers made.
People passing by would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play

And he would be the leader of a big old band.

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O holy night, O night divine!
O night, O holy night, O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!",O Holy Night,2000

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Roy Drusky,"Don't look so sad I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that were burning
Lay your head upon my pillow hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time for the good times
I'll get along you'll find another and I'll be here if you should find you ever need me

Lay your head upon my pillow",For the Good Times,
Roy Drusky,"Sometimes I want to throw my arms around you
And I tremble at the thought of giving in
Because I know how much it cost to love you and I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you revives the sorrow that wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow but I'm so afraid of losing you again

If heaven were to hear my heart's confession wanting you would be my greatest sin
But I'm glad that you're no longer my possession
Cause I'm so afraid of losing you again

I can't go on the way you make me live
You make me cry and every time expect me to forgive
Someday you'll wake up to a cold and lonely dawn
Lock stock and teardrops I'll be gone

Someday I'll find myself another town
With a pool of sympathy to let my sorrows bound
Someday you'll wake up find my strength and move along

Now so much has changed in all the price the years have caused
Somewhere between then and now so much got lost
We want the world lost each other but what good is one without the other
We threw love to the wind and let it be tossed
And in the calm after the storm so much got lost
So much gets lost when you try to gain and what has gone won't come back again

I feel about you
anymore. Mm hm.
I can't hold the hurt inside,
keep the pain out of my eyes
anymore. Mm hm.

My tears no longer waiting.
My resistance ain't that strong.
My mind keeps recreating
a love with you alone
And I'm tired of pretending
I don't love you anymore.

Let me make one last appeal
to show you how I feel
about you.  Mm hm.
'Cause there's no one else I swear
holds a candle anywhere
next to you.  Mm hm

My heart can't take the beating
not having you to hold.
A small voice keeps repeating
deep inside my soul.
It says I can't keep pretending
I don't love you anymore.

I've got to take the chance
or let it pass by
if I expect to get on with my life.

Who think I thought I walk in fields of clover
When your sweet love was never really mine

I try to forget you but I don't have that much time
I know I can't get over you before I lose my mind

When that time comes if I could just remember

So I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife
She walks these hills in a long black veil

She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows love nobody sees nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high and eternity near she stands in the crowd and shedes not a tear

I haven't got a nickel not a penny can I show
He said get off you railroad bum and slammed the boxcar door

He put me off in Texas a place I truly love
Wide open spaces round me the moon and stars above
Nobody seems to want me or to lend me a helping hand

And after so many years well I find that I just wasted my life here all alone

My friend I'll say it clear I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full I've traveled each and every highway
And more much more than this I did it my way
Regrets I've had a few but then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption

I've planned each chartered course each careful step along the byway
And more much more than this I did it my way
I've loved I've laughed and cried I've had my fill my share of losing
And now as tears subside I find it all so amusing

Roy Drusky,"Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way.

Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way

For we were young and sure to have our way.

Those were the days, oh yes those were the days

Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me

Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose

And thinks of the young man that she almost married
What would he think if he saw her this way
She holds up her apron in little girl fashion as something comes into her mind

Then slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line
Ah such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see everywhere anytime of the day
Like the everyday housewife that gave up the good time for me

The photograph album she takes from the closet and slowly turns the first page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her now withered with age
She closes her eyes and touches the housedress that suddenly disappears

There's a six lane highway down by the creek where I went skinny dippin' as a child
And the driving show where the meadow used to grow
And the strawberries used to grow wild

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday

With her feet already dusty from the pathway to the levee

But I couldn't keep from smiling when I'd hear somebody saying
Looky yonder there goes Jody and the kid
Even after we grew older we could still be seen together
As we walked along the levee holding hands
For as surely as the seasons she was changing to a woman
And I'd lived enough to call myself a man

Yes I let it slip right through my hands

My eyes had a vision of sweet lips yeelding beneath my command

Roy Drusky,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee,2002

Are dreams that just fell by the way.
And the good life he promised
Ain't what she's living today.
But she never complains
Of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord.
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come.

She's a good-hearted woman
In love with a good-timin' man.
She loves him in spite of his ways
That she don't understand.
Through teardrops and laughter,
They'll pass through this world hand in hand,
A good-hearted woman
Lovin' her good-timin' man.

He likes the night life,
The bright lights, and good-timin' friends.
When the party's all over,
She'll welcome him back home again.
Lord knows she don't understand him,
But she does the best that she can.
'Cause she's a good-hearted woman;
She loves her good-timin' man.

Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:

Why should I cry,

Gave congratulations,
How can you face them?
What can you say?
 
Let's make up sweetheart,
We can't stay apart,
Don't let foolish pride,
Keep you from my side,
How can love like ours be ended?
It's the talk of the town

Roy Eldridge,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love

This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be
You came at last
Love had its day

That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me

When I remember every little thing
You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along

I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue
The night is cold

The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here

This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing
You used to do

I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old

And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me",1991
Roy Eldridge,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good",1991
Roy Eldridge,"You're a black butterfly
With your wings frayed and torn,
Laughter's your's so is scorn
As they point to you in shame. 
You're a black butterfly
With your wings near fire,
But confess when your tire,
Is the candle worth the flame?
Your Queen of the Night
But with morning's early light
There's not a hear to really call your own;
So before it's too late, 
Change your ways and repent,
Take my love that was meant
For black butterfly along.

Roy Eldridge,"I used to have a perfect sweetheart
Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

I know why I've waited
Know why I've been blue
Prayed each night for someone
Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I want to hand the world to you
I hope you'll understand
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'
And dream I'm dreamin'

Now I know why mother
Taught me to be true
She meant me for someone
Exactly like you",Exactly Like You,1991
Roy Eldridge,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Roy Eldridge,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1991
Roy Eldridge,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1991
Roy Eldridge,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1991

I'm discontented with homes that are rented so I have invented my own.
Darling this place is a lover's oasis where life's weary chase is unknown.
Far from the cry of the city, where flowers pretty caress the streams,
Cozy to hide in, to love side-by-side in. Don't let it abide in my dreams.

Picture you upon my knee, just tea for two and two for tea, 
Just me for you and you for me, alone! 
Nobody near us, to see us or hear us, 
No friends or relations on weekend vacations,
We won't have it known, dear, that we have a telephone, dear. 
Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake 
A sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see.
We will raise a family, a boy for you, a girl for me, 
Oh, can't you see how happy life would be?

You are revealing a plan so appealing I can't help but falling for you,
Darling, I planned it; can't you understand it is yours to command it, so do.
All of your schemes I'm admiring, they're worth desiring but can't you see,
I'd like to wait there for some future date dear; 
it won't be too late, dear, for me.

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it

That you'd turn away romance

A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts' content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""
