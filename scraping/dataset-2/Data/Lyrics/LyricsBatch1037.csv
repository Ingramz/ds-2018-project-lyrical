SRC,"If you start me up,
If you start me up I'll never stop

You can start me up,
You can start me up I'll never stop
I've been running hot
You got me just about to blow my top
You can start me up, you can start me up,
I'll never stop, never stop, never stop

You make a grown man cry,
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry,
Spread out the oil, the gasoline
I walk smooth ride in a mean, mean machine
Start it up

You can start me up
Kick on the starter, give it all you've got
(you got, you got)
I can't compete
With the riders in the other heats
If you rough it up
If you like it you can slit it up, slide it up
Slide it up, slide it up
Don't make a grown man cry,
Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry,
My eyes dilate, my lips go green
My hands are greasy, she's a mean, mean machine
Start it up

Start me up
Ah, you've got to, you've got to
Never, never, never stop
Start it up
Ah, start it up, never, never, never
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
Ride like the wind, at double speed
I'll take you places that you've never, never seen

It you start it up,
Love the day when we will never stop
Never stop, never, never, never stop
Tough me up
Never stop, never stop
You, you, you make a grown man cry
You, you make a dead man come,
You, you, you make a dead man come",Show Me,1969
SRC,"Heat wave
Heat wave
 
Whenever I'm with you
Something inside
Starts to burn deep
And my heart's filled with fire
Could be that I'm very sentimental
Or is this just the way love's supposed to be?
 
I got a heat wave
Burning in my heart
I can't keep from crying
Tearing me apart
 
Sometimes she calls my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can't explain
I feel, yeah I feel
I feel this burning flame
This high blood pressure's got a hold on me
'Cause this is the way love's supposed to be
 
I got a heat wave
Burning in my heart
I can't keep from crying
Tearing me apart

SRC,"Fuck you and your stupid smile
You make me want to strangle you
Fuck you and your disco flavor
Hot sauce on your snake skin boots

Hey you forgot your rag bag
Your sixty-nine sedan
Hey you fucking fag hag
Drop trou tossed salad man

Sucking on my thumb just like the child you think I am
You've managed to convince yourself but I don't think you can
Manage me! me, me, me
Life based on a short story

Written by a bitch named Vern
In a maroon velour sweat suit
Playing with your brand new urn
Shit has he lost his mind

Can he see or is he just blind
Sucking on your brains like the zombies want to revive
You could talk me into fucking you but I don't think you'd survive
Survive me! me, Survive me! me

It's your own technique anyway
With all the foam in your mouth when you say...
It's freedom rock baby
Turn it up here's how to order this

Fuck uncle shifter's got the night towel
I'd kiss you but you're covered in piss
Punk are you threatening me
Your style is faulty while mine is the best

Spock have you lost your mind
Are sure full duration is best
I'm sucking on your life just like the hole you're living in
You're complaining all the time but now the sucking really begins

Das hier ist Rambo Nummer eins (Nummer eins, Nummer eins)
Ihr macht auf Pablo Nummer zwei, doch tanzt Mambo No. 5
Mann, ich baller' dir so 'n Teil, darauf freut sich jeder Zahnarzt
Bis du auf Brettern liegst wie'n Teppich und dein'n XXL-
Sweater wird zum kuscheligen Schlafsack
Und deine schmuddeligen Hooks klingen wie Husten oder Asthma
Dann brech' ich mir 'n Beinchen aus der Skinny-Jeans, du Lauch
Und pule Reste von 'nem Kilo Steak aus Zahnlücken raus
Warum krieg' ich so Lust, dir auf die Hühnerbrust zu schlagen
Bis du nach deiner Gang schreist für Mund-zu-Mund-Beatmung
Hier wächst dir Brustbehaarung wie 'nem Bären Rückenwolle
Kommen wie Mogli nett aus dem Dschungel, kläre deine Olle
Häng' mit Wölfen und Gorillas ab, die eimerweise saufen
Ich bin eingeölt wie Schwuliberts, die Eiweiß verkaufen?
Jeder Song von dir ist Freiheitsberaubung
Genug gerappt, jetzt geh dir Eyeliner kaufen

Rede nicht, hier heißt es, entweder machen oder nicht

Scheiß drauf, ich leb nur einmal dieses Leben

Ah, dieser Teufelskreis
Mein Kopf ist gefickt
Soll ich aufhören oder mach ich weiter?
Ah, 2012. Reasozialisiert, ah
Es gibt Tage die mein Kopf so ficken. Ich mein wie kann ich bloß auf Kombi ticken?
Bra, Banditen lauern um mich zu überfallen während Schultas dauernd mein Handy überwachen
Ich zweifle, will entscheiden, zwischen weiterleben mit Schutzweste oder mit 'ner weißen
Scheiße, ich schwöre man hat Hakim gepackt, sitzt Ossendorf und macht nichts mit Russen dort
Jedesmal wenn ein Ticker aus meinem Viertel gepackt wird, desto knapp wird
Meine Luft zum Atmen, ich mach Schluss mit Handeln, ist mein erster Gedanke
Hayde, weg mit der Waage
Doch die Tage verändert sich was, denn ich spür' in meiner Tasche nur noch kleine Batzen
Und sie schrumpfen, Tag für Tag, ich frag mich selbst: Was hab ich falsch gemacht?
Plötzlich tut es weh meinen AMG vollzutanken, ich denk schon ich fahr zu viel
Dazu schieb ich film wann ich Nachtflug geh und merke das auf meinem Tisch weniger Flaschen stehen
Dann am nächsten Tag, bei Foot Locker, fick ich meinen Kopf wegen paar Scheinen für Shox
Ich sag Stop, bis hierhin aber nicht weiter. Hole Handy, neue Nummer, bin wieder erreichbar!

Es ist ein Teufelskreis, gestern dacht ich khalas
Heute merk ich irgendwie fehlt mir da was
All die Kubinden die Stubinden auf mich warten und mir Batzen in Hand geben

Wir machen unser Para mit Haze und weißen Steinen
Packe ab den Stoff, nix da khalas
Ich geh raus in das Gesocks, liebe die Luft in diesen Blocks
Kein Stop, ich muss Parra hier im Drecksloch machen
Digga, meine ganze Straße will den Jackpot knacken
Alles gleich, schwarz, weiß
Wir bauen uns auf bis die alte Waage nicht mehr reicht
Die Amcas fahren vorbei, die Bischarafs drehen ne Runde durch den Block
Ich bleib ganz gechillt und ich bunker mein Stoff
Jedes Mal wenn ein Ticker aus meinem Viertel gepackt wird, füllt sich schneller die Kasse
Dieses Mal war ich dran wegen irgendso ein V-Mann
Nach Polizeischutz setze ich sein Haus in Brand

And don't fear the night time, 
Because the monsters know you're divine.
And don't fear the sunshine,

It's never to late to pick up the phone.
You know it's never too late to lay your head down on my shoulders, 
It's never too late just come on home.

Don't fear the water, 
Because you can swim inside you within your skin.
And don't fear your father,
Because a father's just a boy without a friend.
And don't fear to walk slow, 
Don't be a horse race, be a marathon.
And don't fear the long road, 
Because on the long road you got a long time to sing a simple song.

But it's never too late to start the day over, 
It's never too late to pick up the phone.
You know it's never too late to lay your head down on my shoulders, 
It's never too late just come on home.

Don't fear your teachers, 
Because if you listen you can hear music in a school bell.
And don't fear your preacher, 
If you can't find heaven in a prison cell.
And don't fear your own self, 
Paying money to justify your worth.
And don't fear your family, 
Because you chose them along time before your birth.

A war that's fillin' up the nations jails
World war one, two, three and four

Chemical weapons, biological war
Bush war 1, and Bush war 2
They gotta a war for me, they gotta a war for you!

[Chorus]
We can't stop it when the beat just drops!
(And we don't stop)
We can't stop it when the rebel rock!
(And we don't stop)
We can't stop until we hit those heights!
(And we don't stop)
We can't stop because we love this life!
(And we don't stop)

Dance to the new day
Sing to the new day, Rhyme to the new day
Transform hell into heaven God lives through,
Grab hold of today

Yesterday is over, tomorrow may be too late
Everything is one but the one is off balance
Music made for the dollar like soul and talent
Really ain't it all about a feeling you was havin'

As a child runnin' wild
Before the mind programmin' set in
Threatenin' your establishment
Get in this energy, lay back and sit

The next men wreckin', to the master's lips
Head spin breathren, get to askin' if
Where, when, Mr. President, ""What do you know?""
It's evident settin' in slow, ""How does it go?""

An unprecedented event is about to unfold
The devil can't stop, won't stop blockin' the globe
Fall in a cell here
Freedom come knockin' at the door

They try lockin' it though, but we about to explode
We got the firefly, tiger eye apocalypse flow
So deep in the bottom of your bottomless soul
Send mind darts flyin' out, without a pistol

Redesign lost minds got outta the cold
Bring order to a world that is outta control
""Truth"" you say, I say, ""How do I know?""

[Chorus]

I wanna rock with punks because I love punk rock
I wanna rock with heads because I love hip hop
I wanna rock my beats all around the block
If I was in Baghdad then I would rock Iraq

I wanna rock with punks because I love punk rock
I wanna rock with heads because I love hip hop
I wanna rock my beats all around the block
There is just one love so the planet we rock

New world days and new world nights
New world wrongs and new world rights
Putting new world funds in the new world banks
With the new world guns on the new world tanks

New world devils and new world gods
New world jails see the new worlds hard
New world names sing the new world songs
New world planes are the new world bombs
New world's flying, the new world's dying

The new world's crying and the new world's trying
New world sons and new world daughters
They are already selling us the new world water
New world beats for the new world to bang

New world streets for the new world to hang
New world president, new world drugs
New world resident, new world thugs
New world players for new world sports

New world trials for the new world courts
New world lawyers and new world laws

Don't let your love be so confidential, and
Don't let your mind be so darn judgmental
And please let your heart be more influential.

If you need some money, I got some that you can borrow
We dance until the sun come up and cast shadows
Right now, the tune reflects, lights out, we soon connect
We ride on lows and high
So hot that we sweat, so happy we cry
Wish bygones goodbye, thank god we's alive
With time on our side and this rhyme I provide
We smile while we slide, do I say goodbye?
We keep it rockin' like the sound of lion

So make a plan or simply hold a hand but don't ever be a passer by

Could you ever love another lonely soul? 
Could you ever find a love that was oceans wide? 
Could you ever find love in another stranger's eyes?

We need you more and more 
So lend a hand or simply hold a friend

Catch you out again

A mistake I have to share if it kills me

It seems we're pulled apart again
Torn apart again
Too easily

It's a risk that I have to take
An affair that I have to break if it kills me

You know that I would often pray
And talk to me of jealousy

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

Harlem has come to bid farewell
To one of its brightest hopes
Extinguished now and gone from us, forever

For Harlem is where he worked
And where he struggled and fought
His home of homes, where his heart was
And where his people are

And it is therefore, most fitting
That we meet once again in Harlem
To share these last moments with him
The black man, black

For Harlem has ever been gracious
To those who have loved her, have fought for her
And have contended her honor
Even to the death

It is not in the memory of man that this [Incomprehensible], unfortunate
But nonetheless, proud community has found a braver
More gallant, young champion
Than this Afro-American, who lies before us
Black, black, black

Did you ever talk to brother Malcolm?
Did he ever touch you?
Did you have him smile at you?
Did you ever really listen to him?

Did he ever do a mean thing?
We must honor him
For what he was, and is
A prince, our black shinning prince

When feelings like this
Cannot be given a try

Just delusion

Is goin’ all alone

At the president’s impeachment sale

St. Lunatics,"Ayo this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

Ayo this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

You see Biggie be like ""What's Beef?""
Me I'm like what's weed?
Weed is actually a medicine for me, you know
Every 4 hours like a prescription I'm smoke
And I'm thanking my reefer chief for making me choke
I'm like one of those half-baked thugs, I'm in love
Then after that roll cool ""J's"" I mean bud
'Cause I still piss stems and still shit seeds
I spit residue, smoke on my way to buy weed
Wrap Sumden, always I smoke more then Cheech and Chong
My best friend's a bong and my homies is smokers only
I know one day, I'm gone stop
But that'll be the day when my seeds don't pop
You see weed helps me get my thoughts together quick
But on the other hand, as soon as I'm sober I forget
Shit, I'm still stuck at point ""A"" ya dig
And my momma think that I should quit

Ayo this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

Ayo this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

Ya I get high
You might see me stroll by
In the Bob Marley tie die with the red eye
I'm sick now, I think I'm catching glaucoma
Standing on the corner, looking for weed donors

You know how we do it kid. We get that good herb and swerve
Till the gas run out, the way we smokes absurd
That's my word, wrap sumden (Wrap Sumden)
Make a nigga clap somthing, get all mad and slap somthing

Yo grab the towels cover the smoke alarms and doors
See I smoke alone, I need grass like lawn mowers
Say dutch time, roll up it's clutch time
And I burn mine, don't you ever ever touch mine

Fire it up dog, but watch out for 5-0
Eyes low from plenty Henny and hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich
Go platinum and do some shows, and get blowed

Ayo this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

Ayo this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

All I know, is money making hoes and smoking endo
If I wasn't high I'd probably know a little more
But since I don't some might consider me slow
Don't worry though, I keep the pants saggy.
Bubble eye, hands waggy
Eyes glassy, smoking fill from the hash
Choking after that but don't the blunt pass
""What we doin' today"" Same shit we did last week
Wake up in the morning and yawn and roll up
Bag up and make some runs and roll up
5-0 behind me my niggas so hold up
Ok made a left you continue to roll up
Don't get me wrong police, yo I stop for them
But guaranteed when they leave I'll be smoking again
Catch my second wind and start in on my next bag
The type of nigga smoke on the way to his rehab

Ayo this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

Ayo this is no lie
Me and my niggas gettin' high
Yo if you look up in the sky
You might see us floating by

This is Mark, oh-Who-gives-a-fuck from '93 TV
This is my co-host, Bob Buttafuoco
(Hey hey guys) Yeah yeah yeah
We got a crowd that's in a frenzy Bob
Let's go down to the announcers for the start of the game

And now, please rise for the singing of our national anthem

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying
Just to get up that hill
I said but now we're up in the big leagues
My dirty it's our turn at bat
And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

I'm the first to swing
Home run with that give-me-what-you-got thing, hot wings
Fuck a dub, smoke an ounce, show me love
Hit the club, me and T-Luv holla what
I put my mack down, she throw a curve ball
She owed Milli smoked that herb and some Llly-bone
She tip-top 'em, Optimo
First base, god living like a worst race
First chase, throw yo' people and yo' kind
Second lesson, smoke that herb and clear yo' mind
It's about time, second base wisdom rhyme
Sitting strong, skipped third base and headed home
Third baseman just don't understand baby what the bong
What the fuck wrong, with this world today
With these girls today, diamonds and pearls the way
You wasn't fucking with me, leave, for the wrap that's in my seed
Now you stays on yo knees cause we's be in the big league
Cause we's be in the big league

Well you should see me now, I'm eating Wheaties now
I'm stealing second and third and looking home peeping greedy now
See me now, people call me speedy now
Known for running the quickest miles
hit and run in any town, any ground
Rules 'fore I hit it, split it, lick it and quit it
And hit it, lick it, did I say lick it, (yeah) fuck it, lick it
Ain't no shame in my game, that normal shit ain't my thing
If I think with my dick then put your mouth on my brain
I maintain through the atmosphere, what we got here
A sucker in fear, hear the roars and the cheers
From the crowd when I take the mile, let me show 'em how
Hit the ball on the ground and make 'em get down

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)
It took a whole lot of trying

And just as long as we living, it's Lunatics player
It ain't nothing wrong with that, batter up

Well this next young batter on deck
He's still in high school (yeah I heard that)
(It's a great day though)
A good high school out in U-City of St. Louis, Missouri
(I think his name's umm, who knows,
Murphey Lee or something)

I want my name not, not said but screamed
I went from fantasies to dreams, dreams to bigger things
I'm like Bennett I been in it since, ninety-three
You can tell cause my L angle 90 degrees
I'ma sixteen year-old school boy, platinum skills
Swear to tell the real, the whole real to make a mill'
I lie little but still, talk straight up like motto
I could tell you something now, you think twice about it tomorrow
I promise, I gets deeper than file cabinets when rapping
Money, money, money, money what's happening
I'm coming up like family members in basements, and I stay bent
Make a milli to play with, buy a building you can pay me
And the 'tic is who I came with
You know how we do, we do, we do, we do, we do, we do

I say the fish don't fry in the kitchen
Beans don't burn on the grill (that's right)

Brought my slums, cats play like rums
Money in large sums, navigators and guns

Get your hands out my pocket
You don't want just blow, blow
The only bird I get wit more is the doe-doe 
They be like oh, oh

Hey timber, is when I hit 'em wit the axe
Put ya gun away

Yo, when I rock Vokal its either Timb's or Nike's 
When I step in my Prada I'm a rock the ice
When the 'Tics do a show I'm a rock the mic
Born in ""New Jack City"" like Wesley Snipes
Drive a SS M.C with racing stripes
Runnin two P's of L.G, flip it twice
Hang round with cats who bust and they don't think twice
Nothing but dome shots no coming back twice
All I knew was hustling and rolling the dice
Scraping up dimes for whole-orders of China Men Rice
Now I sacrificed my life for publishing rights
Hoping everything gonna be aight

Top down holdin a blunt

Turf shake 16 bars of earthquake
If I do the whole song boom {*booming sound*} it's Vietnam

Candles lit, and burning incense

You showin' yo' mind, I'm showin' you mine
We discussin' supreme mathematics and takin' our time
Reading me with your third eye
Baby no worry, I'm an educated dime
See you touchin' me, and I'm diggin' it actin shy
Full of smiles, we can't help it, but why?
Through our eye contact our mindsets intensify
Fantasizing what's under that Vokal and you between my thighs
See, you want studio time, in and outta town doin shows
I'm studying to be a doctor or a future, who knows?
Listening to Dead Prez rap about ""Gettin Free""
And becoming intellectually wealthy
Me and you discussing how to eat healthy

'Bout sixteen, seventee, um, Murphy age
But this rap game I love it, it's like I'm married to it
I proposed on Clue?, she said I'd be happy to do it
Gave her a kiss, mmmwwhha, she gave me fifty G's
Silly Cardi I spent it, now Cardi on his knees
Now I'm livin' reality, a Biggie Smalls theme

So we can get these papers and give these hoes the vapors

Didn't want Nelly on it, said his verse didn't fit
Some ol' separatin shit, ten percent ass bitch
Whole town love us, no one is above us
Treated you, no talent, knowin' niggas like brothas
No street team, no promotion
Just woof tickets, raw fuckin', no lotion
One year later you decide to drop an Ep
At the same time drop us, that confuse me

So like a bastard child, we on our own
Put out and left alone, why'all won't answer the phone

And if you ain't makin' 'em right it's just crazy
You ain't got nobody else to blame, nobody but yourself
You know what I'm sayin', mad truth to that

Let me pretend that I'm a lawyer and explain the situation
Facin' three-to-one five across state, humiliation
St. Louis set it off, phone calls was long distance
(Ay yo, it's four birdies in Houston), c'mon, send some one to get 'em

Who would do it for a grand?
Eighteen, only thing on our mind was that killer money
From Missouri to the T-e-x-a-s
Two cats strapped it tight, right up under her chest
One-way trip on Southwest but she didn't make it that far
Metal detectors went bizarre, one-way trip to the car
Your honor, she got a baby that'll drive my granny crazy
A long distance lawyer that keep on tellin' us ""maybe""
And we all raise her baby, takin' care of her daily
This law shit is crazy, never cease to amaze me
It's different from the eighties, ninety-five to lately
They givin' out time like dogs givin' out rabies

Remain the cleanest, always smoke the seedless greenest
You've seen this like reruns, pop-a-lock like reruns

You got to stand up and get it together, roll with the punches, whatever
Get in our way, destroy ya, make you wish you had never, ever

Sunnin so nut and shady, kid pass me the three-eighty
By my sack, cock and load it, your world I'm a rock and roll it
My business, you shouldn't a told it, to end I'm a forty-four
They switch guns and they go for show it, your pupils is dilating

The 'tics just can't be faded, to nothin that's star related
More than just duplicated, Kenjuana's to celebrated
Got damnit we finally made it, haters they gotta hate it
Bought my house off and finally paid it, often intoxicated

Nah well Kejuan and Murph they with me already
And you know Leezy on his way we gonna be out there in a minute
But what's goin on with you though? Cause I hope you ain't frontin
Cause it's too late at night for that why'know?
Nah no doubt though aight?

All over you baby girl, uh uh

You know I, spend hot shit when need be
Only nigga that can take a still picture in three-D (What?)
If need be I'm leavin the party with Cindy (Who is that?)
Cocky bowlegged long hair and Fendi 
That ain't nuttin, how bout her twin sister Mindy
I spit game like that, I get brains like that
Butter-soft leather seats, it came like that
If sex was football, I'd be a running back
I can only get low and I never fumble
Make ya throw ya hands up when I break in the zone
So if it's on it's on, shit I'm takin you home
I got my own doghouse, own thrown, own bone
She like my bizza, my bad, lil' dawg
You Lunatics - and that's what I be sayin bout y'all
Hell, not an M.D. but I'm always on call
And I got a stick for ya guaranteed not to stall

Not even Ricky Ralph or Johnny, instead it rain tonight
Is this the end? Damn right I, turn out like Ike
Until Vanessa Del Rio like over Bryan McKnight
Said oh no, baby doll kissin me as she goin down low
Peepin that demo oh I can tell that you a pro
Swore up and down you never did this before
Whatever just go slow
Hated by all types, baby fathers and dykes
The type they ready to fight cause I'm the one they women like
He think he tight, he think he got more game then spike lee
Running through his veins like an IV, high speed
Tightest nigga for five G's of Al D.
Better catch me now while my price is low
Demandin five digits when the Lunatics blow
Another zero for a show, just to let you niggas know, now what?

[Chorus]

You see me and my niggaz only come out on the weekends
Cause the weekdays too busy creepin
Freakin, wit yo' rat, now picture that
When she with you she not speakin, but she weaken
Lettin me know, that she really been thinkin
About a nigga oh, even when I'm not wit her
I'm frosty all year while you only in the winter
My pockets gettin fatter, your pockets gettin thinner
I ain't baptized so you callin me a sinner
Overpaid, twenty nine, callin me a young tenor
Nelly stop don't leave, don't stop when I'm in her
Ready for whatever and I ain't even bought her dinner
I, started the game on the bench with splinters
Beggin your coach let you play for a minute
The last seconds of the game you still waitin to enter
I ain't gotta hear the buzzer boy I know who the winner, come on

Ay yo, I'm Chachee the Navihater
Fuck shoes, I want the whole fuckin' alligator
Murphy rather put the shoes on a Navigator
Size twenties that could kick it like a soccer player

Been a player since Freeze Pops, nigga, 'Now 'N Laters'
I used to be well connected like an operator
I used to rub on some of the teachers an' administrators
Woulda' hit it, but yo, I'm not a good cooperator

That's why the, that's why
The people wanna get me for pollutin' the sky
Factory full a bud, got the whole city high
St. Louis peoples can't cooperate without

My milky flow's cowin' these hoes, I make moves
True smooth figga, coochie licker, relationshipper
Damn right, I'm wit' her 20, 4, 5, she gettin' thicker

By the daily, as a child they couldn't fade me
Brotha, my league's speakin' the truth, I'm only eighteen
Do the math, killed a pig, chicken an' cow
My third eye's so versatile, it make me smile

At myself, damnit, I'm in the backfield like Emmit
My life is a movie, goddamnit
Give me a Grammy or a meal ticket
I ain't picky until I get it, we can still kick it
Gimme a minute to handle business 'cause I'm real wit it

Soon as I'm finished, yo, we can deal wit' it
Bill wit it, Lunatic skills to make a mil' wit' it
We ain't black, we original
The deal is y'all don't see it's all Biblical

From high school ball to feelin' booties in the hall
Skip school, buyin' Nikes, twenty deep up in the mall
Me an' my dogs, found a road to make it flow

Got money to go, fuck somethin', we want it all
Done worked too hard to see it fall
Seven years to get our name on the wall, Cuda called
That did it all 'cause we cool now, pockets grab for now
I'm like Jordan in ninety-five, no Bull now

Promotional tours now, funky like sewers now
Six hundred with duals now, like tractors got pull now
We in a good situation like Phil an' Shaq
On our way up the hill like Jill an' Jack

And the, fly honeys want to rock me now

Ayo' I'm Murphy Lee, The Ladies' Man, I'm Leon Phelps the go-getter
I've been pimpin' since pimpin', even was pimpin' my babysitter (You not no pimp!)
I beg yo' pardon I've been pimpin' since kindergarten
She had the nicest boobies and remind me of Dolly Parton (Tits)
My first grade teacher bought my first set of markers
My second grade teacher, she kind of favor Ms. Parker
Third grade, I switched schools, then my teacher was a dude
He taught me how to pimp the teachers into breakin' the rules, shoo'.
My fourth grade teacher man she had a badonkadonk
If I would shot from a ""A"", she would give me a couple points
Fifth grade, I exposed my first ass, 
Sixth grade, I skipped my first class
Seventh grade, is when I first smashed
Eighth grade, I smoked my first grass
Uh, I'm not a bad dude been on more backs then tattoos
Girl's scared to say ""Hi"" so they just blush and just ask you
To ask me, autograph, pictures and hugs
I see a whole lot of women on the parking lot but more in the club
What up.

I-I-I-I-I-I see some hoe's in here
And I-I-I-I-I-I see some hoe's.
In here

I-I-I-I-I-I see some hoe's in here
And I-I-I-I-I-I see some hoe's.
In here

Now in the V.I.P. I see so many hoe's it's hard for a playa' to make a decision
One in there with an ass so fat I seen it with my pimp view vision (Oh!)
You ain't got no panties on, my rep' name, The Panic Zone
(Ali, is you a pimp?) 
'Till I die, and I'm standin' on
It's nothin' to a boss, you'll fuck on what it costs
I'm the type to lose at dice and rob for what I lost
God Glory Hallelujah's, you miss a call I knew ya'
And what's ya' name? 
My name Ali, I want to stick it to ya'
Now as I sit there and check ya', ya' lookin' kind of tight but you act too fly to me.
Push this thing in ya' mouth and right before I nut I pull it out and get ya E-Y-E.
Now you know I go hard on them know, got a pimp card that I show
And a bourgeois bitch, I dump cigars on that hoe'
Give a model something to swallow, send her back on the runway
Day off bitch? Please we gon' double up on Sunday.

Tell your boss you ain't gon make it to work in the mornin'
And why you explainin' go ahead and throw a coffin
And kindly explain that this won't happen often

But I'm lost and I'm amazed I'm be willing ingaige
I'll rage that niggaz think that derrty don't need a cage

Drop on wacks, simple facts that rap needs
And its awlays kris I miss and rap trees

And I got my game, I said I got my game
From the og's, smokin reefer moonshine
Poppin oldies, but the whole plane change
Yo you know me, shipped in from cali got it home

Cops and goldies, then we smash some ass

All the freshman from the vocals started firin? the booth
Got more whips and chains, then I'm a start in roots

Ali I'm sick of ballin, unnecessary phone callin
Man down pimp in distress, I think I'm fallin
For anything but the okie doke, I'm old school 
Like her and bonz and nukee ropes I can't stand them groupie folks

They want me to turn around like this is hokie poke
They want to break me down like erv before I choke
I'm not a jack at all I'm quick draw mcgraw
And number 20 on the lakers couldn't hold me yahl

I'm climbin over yahl I'm still scorin
85 percent of yahl awake but still snoring
Got knowledge yourself and now my style is much older now
We derrty ent we all we got we hold it down

I'm feelin cooler than cool, my wrist colder wow 
If there's a fashion king then I deserve the crown
I'm you city, you dressin up I'm dresisn down
And you keep messin up, me and your girl gon be messin around

A-iyo I'm fresh out the gate, from the Lou with a grammy in my rezzie
Nelly bought me a prezzie with a diamond in the bezzie
Chicks taugh me how to walk, so when I run I'll be ready
Females fans sayin that I'm there baby daddy WHOA

More attention then Justin and Janet
How I Midwest swing and how St Louis ram it
Deerty ent dammit, got more bread than a sandwich
And my writst got more nuggets than Carmello and Camby

Look, I'm from the Lou and I'm important like the arts
So tours look for me like an important part
Find your talent use your talent get your money
Or don?t find your talent and don't use it and stay bummy

But that don't owe me cause I built it from scratch
My next shit is a house with a house in the back
Man I'm been while since middle school
I was that little dude that been round more waist lines than hoola hoops

St. Lunatics,"When the games on the line
You don't wanna be behind wit 2 minutes 40 seconds to go
And its startin' to decline
I'm steady losin' my mind so I take a look around at the coach
I'm sayin' Put me in coach I'm ready to go
And I don't care if the games on the line
But change the numbers on the sign get me off up this pine
When we're fun we do this every time
Its time 
Its time 

Look, now when the game is on the line I'm ready for competition
I don't take no coach permission I always play my position
I'm a leader but I listen they tell me the time is tickin'
But I still ain't gonna let em see me sweat nope
And when yours palms all sweaty 'nd your stomachs butterflyin'
If you miss it you a loser
If you make you da flyers
Ghettos supposed to the the highest but always remain humble
As long as you walkin' up you can stumble if you wanna
I mean I can hold a lawyer as long as you not at the corner
As long as those grays good you can do what the fuck you wanna
I ain't tryin' to be a preacher nor your mother or father
If you don't give a fuck y the fuck would I even bother man

When the games on the line
You don't wanna be behind wit 2 minutes 40 seconds to go

I can dribble past your team or drive through trash
I lift up, now you school me to find a new basket
But if you found me you no the song so y you askin'
I upped in the stands like I can buy you classic
On the court focused still sneak at peek at ya ho
In the crowd to the beat sneak a squeak on the floor
Tsh, to get me into college you'd best pay me
Give me a core 'nd help me cheat on my sat
Steal class in the bathroom roll up a 
Shoot dice at lunch and wont show up for practice
Me and Jordan got the same kinda hang I'm a
Get drunk but still ready come game time

When the games on the line
You don't wanna be behind wit 2 minutes 40 seconds to go
And its startin' to decline

When we're fun we do this every time
Its time 
Its time 

Now its time for you women to understand that 
When I talk real good to you its not a game
You no what I mean
Its false I let other men play games 
I'm just talkin' to you ma you da same way

Cause I'm a coach not a playa
They tell ya nah they tell me yea
Their rhymes say I make 3 point shots look like layups
I pick 'nd roll wit whoever
You see these letters on my jersey so you no who's better
My 45 is cold brotha, take a look at it
Murph threw a ball through his legs 
'nd back wit it look like hot sauce did it
Big leads a sinner brotha he thought bowls were hella hard
I'm a point like a guard 'nd way is hell fought
Slows messed start gotta play hard
Him 'nd JV need a better car
Better car? who better car?
Him 'nd JV need a better car
So put me in coach, so put me in coach
I m so fly that you gotta put me in coach

Then I'll call you back or you can just page my cousin Keith
And he'll call my cousin lil Daryl

Start readin' some things, we got it, holla at us, c'mon
Easy with that murder murder murder, kill kill
We did that back when I was born, Bill Bill
But I still do the knowledge, let me give you the math
I rock a seven-and-a-half for my seven-and-a-half
I be with Moses and Cain and Abel puttin' in work
I slap a nun, beat the reverend up, spit in his church
My derrty niggas come through, we turn the heat up in June

Start your cars up, trick your broads out
Pump your hard up, homie now put your guard up
You throw that one-two but, look how I jab you
No need you run in the derrty, homie I had to
You was doin' a lot of talkin' (yup) a lot of barkin'
But your bite was nothin', guess you mighta been frontin'
Yo ain't no mic to it, City see right through it
I was born to be the shit like I was Mike Hewitt
Don't, test me though, homie I might do it
Check my track record, the feelin' go right to it
It was easy for me, I was born to win
You was born to hate me, you should be born again
You with Mike and Kevin, we with Law and them
You cop American cars, we cop foreign 'em
Take a look at us dirty, we put the star in them
No slow stray bullets nigga, we Brett Favre'n them

You gots to chill, and let your conscience be free
Lil' boy, obviously y'all ain't fuckin' with Ky'
You see I stays real high, but I be's low-key
I'm so allergic to the line everybody know me
You know what? (What?) Why shouldn't y'all hate?
'Cause y'all so half decent, we Frosted Flakes great
And these ain't came out yet, I know y'all so late
I smoke zips, you pop 8's, damn what a waste
My lady is so happy, yours masturbates
You wash up in a sink, nigga I bathe in a lake
The way y'all copy our style ASCAP should make y'all pay
But they don't, so I'ma smoke a joint and get to the point
The motherfucking point is keep my name out your mouth
Unless you sayin' how we repped the Lou, since we came out
We've been winners since we came out, yo' mouth keep my name out
You don't wanna see thirty cardinal birds with they things out

My style can't be copied people trust me (trust me)
Even though you look like me, your flow musty (musty)
That means you stinkin', what you think's extinct
Been gone too long to even dig up the bones
I'm on my new-new, upgrade the kush from the doo-doo
That's a big step, but that's how niggas from the Lou do
Last rap was too cool, but this one is too damn hot
You wack rappers think you hot when you not (this is why I'm hot)
All this I talk slick shit as if you really did shit
Thinkin' you deserve my spot, well there it is then
Gave niggas time but now I'm back with a few of my friends

Always used the right amount of strokes, that's why I stayed par
I ain't no killer lil' silly nigga but they are
You got the same ride as me but that's just my day car

Fifteen G's in my pocket just to play cards
So meet me in the casino, way in the back
Me and her fleein' the scene, away in the 'Llac
She say she feelin' her bean, a green of a stack
She say she like it obscene, I'm way in the knack
In fact, you niggas ain't like me, you salty (no)

(you tried to fuck her)
I didn't even have time
Ask her where she know me from
Who I be with
What number she dial that crazy girl wild

[Chorus]

I really don't know her
I've seen her on Myspace
Looked on her page all I seen was my face
Her user name read Kewan for life
With videos and pictures set up so right
The only bad thing she writes me all night
Saying shit like her tits are so tight
She ends it with I love you that starts a big fight
Baby I can't control what she type

Smokers smoking in the smoking room, fishes in the fish tank
Sailors waiting for the tide to turn, too bad the ship sank
Well dressed wax-work wound up to walk
Stares through the window
Clown in the alley-way looking for an exit, facing the shadows
I don't patronise you
I don't' try to put you down
I don't criticise you
I ain't the one , I ain't the one to judge
Hard hitting journalist, says he's a communist
Says he believes in world war III
Lives in a high-rent luxury apartment, he ain't fooling me

They steal your secrets, but I ain't the one to judge

Holding council with the king and queen

Trying hard to decide the fate of their regime

There's only one needed to complete the harmonizin'

And that's a man with a voice like a scraping violin

Waiting for Mr. Damage


Toothless jaws gumming melancholy stuff

A burst of rapid fire Spanish from a window up above

Students out to pose in studied disarray

Books of Sartre, Marcuse openly displayed

Waiting for, Mr. Damage


Mr. Damage, walks through the doors of the sacrificial church

Mr. Damage, meets you in the lobby then leaves you in the lurch

Mr. Damage, stands at the altar, Sermon of the search

All the faithful follow


Resident winos stumbling and lurching

Walking cadavers smiling and searching

Man in the DT's looking at the feeble glossy portraits of long dead celebrated people

Waiting for Mr. Damage


Trying hard just to keep a candle lit

A leather flyer leaves the subway anxious to admit

That the marvelled one so recently deposed was seen

Three days later in a brand new suit of clothes

A brand new suit of clothes for a very special day

A brand new suit of clothes for a very special day

A brand new suit of clothes for a very special day

A very special day, a very special day, a very very very special dayyyyy - OOOOWWWWWW


Mr Damage holds a curse

Mr Damage drives a hearse

Don't you know who did it first...Mr Damage


Holding council with the king and queen

Trying hard to decide the fate of their regime

There's only one needed to complete the harmonizin'

And that's a man with a voice like a scraping violin

Waiting for Mr. Damage


Mr. Damage, walks through the doors of the sacrificial church

Mr. Damage, meets you in the lobby then leaves you in the lurch

Mr. Damage, stands at the altar, Sermon of the search

All the faithful follow


Holding frozen hands as Mr,

Holding frozen hands as Mr,

Holding frozen hands as Mr,

Damage holds the curse.......

The whiskey bottle in his withered hand
Put his finger on a photo from an old magazine
Saw himself in the shadow of his dream

Told him his feet stank and took him downtown
Called him agitator, spy and thief
Shut him up in solitary third degree

Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling? 
Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain,
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain.

Bring me flesh, and bring me wine.
Bring me pine logs hither.
Thou and I will see him dine
When we bear the thither. 
Page and monarch, forth they went,
Forth they went together
Through the rude wind's wild lament
And the bitter weather.

Sire, the night is darker now,
And the wind blows stronger.
Fails my heart, I know not how.
I can go no longer. 
Ark my footsteps my good page,
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shalt find the winter's rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly.

In his master's step he trod,
Where the snow lay dented.
Heat was in the very sod
Which the saint had printed.
Therefore, Christian men, be sure,
Wealth or rank possessing,
Ye who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing","Good King Wenceslas (Piae Cantiones, 1582)",1996

Tell him I got nothin' for him
Bird outside the kitchen, fightin' his reflection
What's he gonna win when he wins?

The unkissed boys and girls of paradise
Are lining up around the block
Back pockets full of dynamite
While neighbors talk and talk and talk

Bird outside the kitchen fightin' his reflection
Tell him I got nothin' for him
Bird outside the kitchen fightin' his reflection
What's he gonna win when he wins?

the phone out the window

You'll have to shout out loud and set the bell and slow

You'll have to shout even louder",Black Rainbow,2009
St. Vincent,"The people in the street had overtaken you

The letters stopped unceremoniously in June

So I changed my I's and A's to yours

Too big to be a lake, too small to be an attraction
And when you wander in and start to flail a bit
I let it happen, let it happen, let it happen

Sometimes I stand with a pistol in hand
I fire at the grass just to scare you right back
And when you won't run, I'm mad, but I succumb
Let it happen, let it happen, let it happen

And sometimes I go to the edge of my roof
And I think I'll jump just to punish you
And if I should float on the taxis below
No one will notice, no one will know

When he crushes her  she can't feel her screams are silent 
Hides in the corners of her mind where she plays contently

But I'm sure I'll be seein' you 'round
Don't get up I know the way out

Stacey Earle,"I woke up early this morning, I asked myself why
It's four in the morning, so closing my eyes
I rolled over on my other side
Ten o'clock came fast
Heard a noise down the hall
Sounds just like broken glass
And for no reason at all
A picture had fallen from the wall
Oh, it's just another day

Guess I'll spend it in the garden
Why, I can make this day mine
And later at the market
Where I know I can find
A place to spend more than just time
Everyone is in a hurry
They're grabbing only what they need
Their faces poured with worry
Please sir, go ahead of me
I really have no place I need to be
No, it's just another day

Three o'clock came slow
I heard a knock at the door
So I opened it real slow
He said say no more
I must not be who you're hoping for
Why, could it be you're expecting company
Ma'am if I may
Have you sign right here please
And as he walked away
He said, Oh have a lovely day
Yes have a lovely day

Six o'clock rolled around
I hear the traffic building up
It's all around the town
Driving like there is no giving up
Arriving home to the ones they love
Table set, please sit down everyone
Won't come to bed until the dishes are done
And turning out lights all but one
I like to read some
Won't fall to sleep until my day is done
It was just another day

But I've enjoyed it anyway
Just another day
I'll always find a way
Why I can sleep in tomorrow",Just Another Day,1999
Stacey Earle,"I'm going back where I come from
I'm going lookin' for someone
Someone I left behind
We were both such babies at the time

When my family moved away
Wanted you to go , but you had to stay
And out the back window, as I waved good-bye
Your mother held you as you cried

[Chorus]
We play hide and seek, finders keep
Only the loser is left to weep
Gotta secret can I keep it
Better cross my heart and hope to die

Gonna go be a big girl now
I'm gonna go show them just how
I can make it all on my own
They'll say my girl how you've grown

And I'll be married in the spring
No white dress, no diamond ring
With a baby on the way 
I know I heard one say, guess she never learned a thing

[Chorus]

Some say leave well enough alone
Some thing's better if never known
But I still remember the place
Just have no name for an empty space

So I reap what I've sown
But still get to keep what I have grown
And I'll let the willow weep
For the secret it must keep
In a mission down in San Anton'",Losers Weep,1999
Stacey Earle,"Can't run can't hide
From something down deep inside
I feel it I've even seen it
When I lay me down to sleep
I dream it

It wakes me up in the middle of the night
Ain't enough so I turned on the light
Said girl you gotta go
From your heart said my soul

[Chorus]
Don't get down
Take a look around
You know you might try the next door down

[Bridge]
So I come and go
I'm not the only one, and I know
Right time right place
Maybe even knowing someone who can show me all the ways

But I gotta hand that one to ya
Wouldn't get on my knees if I knew ya
I've got lots of time to buy
I use it up but use it wisely

Told right from wrong
Told to wait as long
You can do what you are told
From your heart said my soul

Don't get down
Take a look around
Keep your feet on the ground
Hey you gotta sound
So you might try the next door down",Next Door Down,1999
Stacey Earle,"I live, I breath, like anyone I need
To tell someone who will say nothing when I'm done
And not give advice like it's a holiday
Repeating it twice for just something to say

Seems I said one word
One everybody heard
Oh my now she's mad
Now Stacey is being bad

I can hear but not speak for myself
But sure cry a tear for everybody else

Someone show me how
Come and show me how
To be strong enough, but not too tough
To say hold me now, come and hold me now
I feel a little tired today

I am my worst enemy
Please someone come save me

I live in a dream but it's busting at the seams
Don't want to wake up by myself
So I go shake me someone else
But I can't see them above the crowd
So I sit up and I scream out loud

Someone show me how
Come and show me how
To be strong enough, but not too tough
To say hold me now, come and hold me now
I feel a little tired
I feel a little tired

I don't need no fancy car, I'm not going very far
That's OK, don't want to go anyway
I can stay home and be your star
I will be your simple gearle
I'll be your simple gearle

We don't need a lot, happy with what we got
If we had everything, it would not be the same

Stacey Earle,"Oh girl here you go again
Today what world are you living in
Does your world just tickle you pink
Or is it as blue as an ocean where little boats sink

While little miss denial is sittin' on high cotton
All is well, as long as forgotten
Wipe off the wall, pick up your tin pans
Runs to the sink to wash off her hands

Upon your high horse, life is just too short
Same little girl wouldn't jump off the front porch
So afraid we might see eye to eye
And I'll see that gleam, it's just tears that you cry

[Chorus]
The tears that you cry, that rains on parades
Then trickle on down, someone open the gate
Till the streets all run dry, and the whole town was saved
While under the ground to the ocean with rage

Sleeping beauty gets her sleep at night
Wake up in the morning everything is snow white
Only one thing in her garden still grows
What else could it be, smells just like a rose

But she will snatch  it right from it's stem
And the thorn will prick her, just like a pen
And as the water begins to fill up her eyes
It will make up the tears that she cries

[Chorus]",Tears That She Cries,1999

I left the porch light burning for you
In the vase are flowers for you

Time and time again I wonder when you're gonna wake up
I am running outta time here so make up or break up
My heart is (1. tired) (2. through) waiting
You can't keep me waiting

In the lock you turn the key
You walk right by sayin' nothin' to me

For my white wedding gown
Seems a little silly
When it's only his tradition now
Packed down deep in my suitcase
Got a black silk gown

Stacey Earle,"We packed up for the weekend
One change, t-shirts to sleep in
Anything you left behind
Exactly now what's on your mind
But anything you forgot really couldn't cost a lot
Everything now has its place
Even the tension on your face

All wound up now ready to go
We are winding down but it's coming slow
Sitting on the edge of our seats
Smooth pavement of the city streets
Disappear beneath the hood
And how about the weather, looks perty good
Perty good for an opening line
Why I didn't even have to use my mind

Why shame on anything we may do

We laughed until we cried
We stayed up half the night
Told all there was to know
Leaving nowhere else to go

We said little all the way home
I guess we just need a little time alone
It's the art of women that can close her mind
The heart of of a women that finds the time

To put every thing right back in its place
Always leaving an open space
Just making room for a little bit more
When I get home, I gotta run to the store, yeah

Stacey Earle,"I almost hate to go back home
Somebody's died every time I've been gone
I ain't saying I don't want to know
Just that it brings me down so low

I was needing more out of life
I forgot how to be your wife
Everybody's settlin' for settlin' down
Hear the jingle of the chains rattling around

I never really gave much thought
I'm sure it's my own fault
I just figured after years gone by
All them tears would have run dry

I go out night after night
And I wonder if I'm treating myself right
And I think about the ones I left behind
When I cry night after night

Here's to the ones who worked all along
Living in fear of being alone
Well I started out early in life
I made mine and I knew I

Could never really go back home
That's the same as being alone
Sure, I could always turn it around
That'd be the same as shooting me down

I don't care if my hairdo is in place.

I never put a mudpack on my face.
Oh, who'd have thought
That I'd walk in the daze now?
I never go to shows at night,
But just to matinees now.
I see the show
And home I go.

Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire,
Uneasy in my easy chair.
It never entered my mind.

Once you told me I was mistaken,
That I'd awaken with the sun
And order orange juice for one.
It never entered my mind.

You have what I lack myself
And now I even have to scratch my back myself.

We'll settle down
Right here in town. 

We'll have Manhattan,

It's lovely going through
The zoo.
It's very fancy
On old Delancey
Street, you know.
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro.
And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July?
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by.
The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy.
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy. 

We'll go to Greenwich,
Where modern men itch
To be free;
And Bowling Green you'll see
With me.
We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in.
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin
Fin to fin.
I'd like to take a
Sail on Jamaica
Bay with you.
And fair Canarsie's lake
We'll view.
The city's bustle cannot destroy
The dreams of a girl and boy.
We'll turn Manhattan 
Into an isle of joy. 

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the wilds.
And starve together, dear,
In Childs'.
We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney
On a roll.
In Central Park we'll stroll,
Where our first kiss we stole,
Soul to soul.
Our future babies 
We'll take to ""Abie's
Irish Rose.""
I hope they'll live to see
It close.

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

In my heart it will remain

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand

Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the phone
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away

Wishing she had never left at all

I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action

I try to reach for you.  but you have closed my mind

When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on?

Stacey Smith,"I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
She says I began to sing long before I could talk
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!

Stacey Smith,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
 
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad,
And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",The Winner Takes It All,1999
Stacey Wheal,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere

Stacie Orrico,"What child is this, who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap, is sleeping
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet,
While shepherds watch are keeping

This, this is Christ the King,
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring him laud,
The Babe, the Son of Mary!

So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh,
Come peasant king to own Him,
The King of kings, salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.

With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white.

I'm not a very funny person so i get excited if anybody laughs other than me.

It blew my mind in to a million pieces
Pushed You aside
And still You got my back

Caught up in the hype
Started getting rough but

Stacie Orrico,"Verse 1:
I saw him shaking his change in a coffee cup
Asked for a dollar but I told the man to give it up
Said he's hungry, I don't think that it's true
Bet my dollar he gon' spend it on booze
I turned my back on him and began to walk away
But then I heard the little voice inside me say
What if it's really true, what if he's hungry?
What if it's not for him, does he have a family?

Pre-chorus:
How'd you get here?
How'd you end up on the street?
Where did it go wrong?
Wonder what I'd do if it were me!

A new point of view
A walk in your shoes
I wish I could get inside your head
To see what you see
When you look at me
'Cause I could've lived your life instead

Verse 2:
It was 90 degrees in the summer heat
She was veiled in black all the way down to her feet
This is America, doesn't she know?
Somebody take her shopping, buy her some cloths
She came up to me, I didn't understand a word
I was about to leave then another thought occurred
She might be really lost, scared and frustrated
I should try again to see what she's sayin'

Pre-chorus 2:
How'd you get here?
How'd you get so far from home?
What was it that made you leave?
Wonder what I'd do if it were me!

A new point of view
A walk in your shoes
I wish I could get inside your head
To see what you see
When you look at me
'Cause I could've lived your life instead

Oh, see what you see
And I would feel
Oh, feel just what you feel

Stacie Orrico,"As I rest against this cold, hard wall
Will you pass me by?
Will you criticize me as I sit and cry?
I had fought so hard and thought that all my battles had been won
Only to find the war has just begun

Is He not strong enough?
Is He not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out, and start again
Is He not brave enough?
To take one chance on me
Please can I have one chance to start again?

Will my weakness for an hour make me suffer for a lifetime?
Is there any way to be made whole again?
If I'm healed, renewed and find forgiveness and find the strength I've never had
Will my scars forever ruin all God's plan?

Is He not strong enough?
Is He not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out, and start again
Is He not brave enough?
To take one chance on me
Please can I have one chance to start again?

He took my life into his hands and turned it all around
In my most desperate circumstance
It's there I finally found

Stacie Orrico,"As I rest against this cold, hard wall
Will you pass me by?
Will you criticize me as I sit and cry?
I had fought so hard and thought that all my battles had been won
Only to find the war has just begun

Is He not strong enough?
Is He not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out, and start again
Is He not brave enough?
To take one chance on me
Please can I have one chance to start again?

Will my weakness for an hour make me suffer for a lifetime?
Is there any way to be made whole again?
If I'm healed, renewed and find forgiveness and find the strength I've never had
Will my scars forever ruin all God's plan?

Is He not strong enough?
Is He not pure enough?
To break me, pour me out, and start again
Is He not brave enough?
To take one chance on me
Please can I have one chance to start again?

He took my life into his hands and turned it all around
In my most desperate circumstance
It's there I finally found

That You are strong enough
That You are pure enough
To break me, pour me out and start again
That You are brave enough
To take one chance on me
Oh Thank You for my chance to start again",Strong Enough [Avcd][Version],2003

She's too young, there's no way (there's no way)

But everything will be alright 
Everything will be alright 

Everybody seems to notice you 
Cause you're not really tryin' to hide a thing 
Sometimes you're cool 
Sometimes your mood swings 
No baggy shirts to hide the change, no shame 
Nobody to lie to, to pry with what's inside of you 
And he say, she say 
She's too grown 
Poor thing, all on her own 
But who cares what they say 
Cause no one can judge you at all 
It's not who's right or who's wrong

Over here late at night on the sofa?
Kissin' and touchin', whisperin' in my ear, got me breathin'
Marvin Gaye in the background singin', it ain't helpin'

Now in this moment candles burnin', oh, it's so easy
Got me compromisin' with my sexuality
And I know that you and I have got a real good thing
But when I pause, think it over, it ain't right, gotta tell ya

I can't give it up
Shoulda never started, now we gotta stop
But one day I'ma put it on ya
So you better get ready for me

I can't give it up
We started a fire, gotta blow it out
But one day I'ma put it on ya
So you better get ready for me

When I move like that on your body, bump and grindin'
Can't stop, now got you breathin'

This is really hard for me
'Cause when I'm with you, boy
I wanna give you everything

But there's much more
Than a night of ecstasy
I need commitment
With a diamond
Then I'm yours to be your fantasy

I can't give it up
I will be your fantasy

I can't

Tryin' to find an explanation
'Cause it's gettin' aggravating
Why my relationships never seem to work out
Beginnin' to worry and doubt

If I'm even able to detect he's the one
When this day you're wonderin'
Why I haven't seen the sun
Shine his light on my heart and help me ease the pain
'Cause I'm gettin' tired of the rain

Fallin' on my heartbreak and I
Get my hopes up when I'm in love
Until we break up then I'm back to the
Same spot, I've been lonely, drownin'
'Cause every guy turns out to be the same
So now I'm questionin' is it me to blame

Is it me? Am I so complicated?
Is it me? Or is love over-rated?
Is it me? 'Cause I don't quite understand
Why it never turns out how I thought I planned it

Is it me? Am I too independent?
Is it me? Not ready for commitment?
Is it me? 'Cause it doesn't seem to last
And it's the only question that I never asked

Maybe I'm longin' for it more than I should be expecting
All the standards that I'm settin', unrealistically I'm gettin'
Possibly in the way of what is left to have in store
Because I'm so confused and insecure

'Cause when I know for certain everything is goin' wrong
I permitted to prolong, tried my best to hold on
My Mister Right's probably hangin' round my window pane
While I look through only watchin' the rain

Get my hopes up when I'm in love

Never thought it could be that it's me
Till I realized I'm the only
Common factor and played a big part
In lettin' people break my heart

Never noticin' I was wasting time
Askin' the same thing every time
Who were you with? And where were you at?
Until I took the time to turn and look back

Just left the bank I took 50 from the teller
I'm fittin' to make it rain so getchu an umbrella
We also make it snow we cocaine gram sellers

Ballin' gettin' high throwin' dolla's from the sky
Big refer cloud got in storming inside
Foreign outside I'm usually foreign when I drive
A buck sixty feels like you soaring in the sky

Blowing money on the liquor
At the strip joint blowing money on the bitches
We standin' on the bar throwing money like a pitcher
But nigga I ain't slippin' got a fully-loaded trigga

And that can cause a heatwave that mean you diggin' you a deep grave
Nigga's jump yo ass have 'em missin' you for 3 days
Cam says that this nigga's a sucker
So that mean that this nigga's a sucker, ya heard that?

I be all over the bread like sesame seeds

Automatic with the money like Reggi for 3
Big birds no Sesame Street, bitch
I'm to clean they ain't messin' with me
I'm just trying to see my decimals speak

These niggaz just lighter then some good shit to me
These niggaz sweet like a taheshin' treat
They say I'm full of hot air then I release the heat
Split a nigga from his teeth to feet

Know what I'm talkin' about, know what I mean like keep the sneaks
I go dolla for dolla, week for week
And Bird man said you niggaz is bitches
So that mean you niggaz is bitches, and me?

Pockets full of kitty, these niggaz ain't gettin' money like I was
I make it rain on 'em, they callin' scattered showers

Tornado money can't fit it in a rubber band

Check tha news It's goin' be a cloudy forecast
And when I move a couple goons in that are Class
She want a Dough boy nigga that do numbers
A smile like lightning and a ass like thunder

I shows out and the whores all love it
And when it stop drizzlin' the floors all flooded
In one night blew bezzle on charm money
Fuck it it's nothin' I'm still spendin' Desert Storm money

She made me cry, she done me wrong
She hurt my eyes open, that's no lie
Tables turn and now her turn to cry

Because I used to love her but it's all over now
Because I used to love her but it's all over now

Well, she used to run around with every man in town
She spent all my money, playing her high class game
She put me out, it was a pity how I cried
Tables turn and now her turn to cry

Because I used to love her but it's all over now
Because I used to love her but it's all over now

Well, I used to walk in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
When I'd gotten worried, she'd ease my aching head
But now she's here and there, with every man in town

You bogus in the lambo if you ain't lifting the door up
You bogus poppin' pills if you ain't pickin the ho up
You bogus running out on your kids my nigga grow up
For God's sake, like a wedding, cutting large cake
For large stakes let the hammer bang broad day
Ay, nevermind what the blogs say
This what my mind and my heart say

My philosophy profit off of my properties
Get it, flip it, we got to be rich, that broke shit is obsolete
Possibly off of my rocker, watch how you watching me
Sophisticated, psychotic, fly as a pilot
Officially silent, all you wish you could get I got it
Unlimited titanium nigga, what's in yo wallet?
Out of gladiator college, I made it summa cum laude
While you clowns couldn't have got a cap and gown if you bought it
I parlay with Saudis, buying crude oil and diamonds
Hustle January, July, fly to Dubai
A broke nigga telling me 'bout how I'm dividing the pies
Like a blind nigga telling me it's an eye for an eye
Bullheaded and stubborn I be that way until I die
But find a nigga with more hustle then me I dare you to try
And according to the hand on my Audemar
It's my time to shine so fuck ya'll

I grew up in the gutter, life a motherfucker
I guess that why I don't trust a motherfucker
Seen a nigga snitch on they mom, shoot at they brother
Go to prison in love with a bitch and a nigga fuck her
I seen real G's destroyed by real suckers
Innocent ladies raped and defenceless babies abducted
Such a horrible truth, but you see it over and over
It's nothing, get numb to it and your heart grow colder
Pacify your pain with a chain and a Rover
Fuck it, justify your action with stacking your dough up
You show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda
Just enough for me to blow up, nigga hold up
Switch the flow up, 'cause these niggas be snitchin' so much
I promise all they missing's the badge, coffee, and donuts
Go to jail so what, never see my integrity perish
That ain't the Harris' way, study my pedigree
Promise I'm one of the only ones who keep it 100
Probably why I think they all out to get me, you can't convince me
Large money and fame will plant seeds of envy
To make my partners resent me enough to come and get me
Catch me slippin' and hit me, just like they did 50
'Cause I'm in the position that he think he should be given
Listen, dawg, the fact of the matter is
I'm on a narrow path and we all can't travel

I learned that apartment is way more exciting than a big ass house on a hill
I used to be a way better writer and a rapper
When I used to want a black Karmann Ghia
Now a nigga speeding in a Porsche
Feeling like I'm going off a course
Cut these fuck niggas off
Negative in my life, scream that till I'm hoarse
Duck these get the fuck off me projectiles, bitch you ain't really got a choice
I'm living my life live yours
I don't even like rapping fast, but that's how the word come to me
Talk to me sideways nigga that's your ass
Slow it down, this that shit that'll make you call your momma
Say hey I'm sorry for begging for all them clothes you couldn't afford
And this the type of shit that'll make you call your rap partner
And say I'm sorry I'm awkward, my fault for fuckin' up the tours
I hated all the attention so I ran from it
Fuck it if we did, but I hope we ain't lose no fans from it
I'm a grown-ass kid, you know ain't never cared about no damn money
Why do we try so hard to be stars, just to dodge comments
And this that shit that'll make you call your baby mama
When you gone on half a pill, don't know why but that's how it is
Then you take a flight back to the crib, y'all make love like college kids
And you say all the shit you gon' do better, we can try this shit again
'Round the time the dope wear off, you feel stupid, she feel lost
That's that dope, I mean, I mean dopamine you think Cupid done worn off
Waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed
Baby boy face full of applesauce
Maybe should have stayed but it ain't yo fault
Too much pressure, I peel off, I'm sorry
Was young and had to choose between you
And what the rest of the world might offer me, shit what would you do
Well I'd probably do it differently if second the chance
Only if some cool ass older man would've let me know in advance
This, this quarry, that is dug so deep in a father's chest
When he feel that he's broken up his nest
And he figured shit he was just doing the best that he could
Which end up being the worst that he could
And all some pussy nigga on the internet can say is that verse ain't good
It's boring, boring?
Really?

When I'm disgusted with this world and I can hardly breathe and
Told so many lies, don't know what to believe
I discussed it with this girl, and this is what she said
She said lay down baby, baby, rest your weary head up
I love these distractions but my mind don't wanna rest

If so the weight is heavy, that's why I'm staying steady
On the grind, aligned with the will of the divine
I know the world is changing but I'm still in my mind
Where the peace be, days that greet me
I'm facing the east sea
We facing the beatly, daily and weekly

Somewhere between the pimps and the priests
So the angels can reach me, tomorrow

I know who killed Pac, nigga
The police know who killed Pac, nigga
Suge Knight know who killed Pac, nigga
He died at the carwash, the world heard the shots, nigga
Then they killed Biggie, he just came through to visit
Rampart divison, Pirus ain't had nothing to do with it
So many niggas in caskets, then turned ashes
Some get shot, some Hussein Fatal in car crashes
I think it's a conspiracy theory, Illuminati
How Pac died and two months later they killed Kadafi
Then they killed Buntry, [L?] and Heron, they getting sloppy
LAPD, these niggas worse than the Nazis
And Pac was only 25, thuggin' as a youngin'
Sitting shotgun, I wonder if he seen them shots coming
Guess it don't matter, all the niggas buried, though
Wouldn't have never happened if Suge kept it real with Harry-O

Late night down Sunset, liking the scene
On a tour bus in St. Paul, riding to win
Don't know how it begin, every day was a new
When he was young, living life fast and rhyming his truth
And if crack had took a part of the homie's family tree
Lil' nigga he was talking 'bout was probably me
And him to know my life story and we not even meet
When we did, it was like we'd known each other for demon
When the last time I seen him, he was playing his tape
And he would lay the title Makaveli the Great
Smile for me, yeah, it's strictly for my niggas
Try to touch money, high on weed and liquor
Hoping God'll forgive us, we been stuck here in the Matrix
Dead before you dishonor, lil' nigga, when he face him
Whatever shit you killing with, you get you two Glocks
I guarantee that pussy shit'll stop
When the last time you seen 2Pac?

Last time I seen him was in the mirror this morning

Stacy Barthe,"How's everybody feeling out there? We good?
Let's talk to the sample right quick
I always pictured we'd be
It go like this. Listen

Let me tell you how I pictured this
A few houses, a couple businesses
Striving for greatness, we would be each other's witnesses
And during beef, we both would put aside our differences
Where I ain't flinch a bit making you insignificant
Maybe kids and shit, perfect arithmetic
Meaning we could build our own world and co-exist in it
She a synergy, sharing energy
Let our souls mate in the air if you remember me
Now here's what I did with it
Went out my way to fuck these stripper chicks
Lost good girls making them mistresses
Just savages, missed marriages
They all was my babies, I needed those miscarriages
My worthless self when Joe felt hurt
I went out and targeted women who had no self worth
I relate to praying nightly feeling no spell work
When you can do it, but a stranger gotta go help first
I called moms on the phone, here's what I told her real quick
I said my 20s flew by with no control of the shit
Her next sentence swear that I’ll forever hold with a grip
She said it go by even faster as the older you get
I wanna never dumb down, I'd have to lower my wit
Ain't gotta post this on the Gram for you to know what it is
A partner to trust, I'm thinking even bigger for us
Mom should've told me this when we had shit to discuss
Now neither one of us is how we figured we’d be
Sometimes the thought of what if still lives here with me
I always pictured we'd be

Nah'mean? That's how I see it in my head though
Ain't quite pan out like that. Word up
Let me tell you about some more of God's work though

I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know, ah
I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know

Nah, I like it just like that, Parks, let it run
Lemme go right here, right here, right here
Look, Look

A love that's tideful, never prideful
If you're truly better without me how can I spite you?
As I yearn for the greatest love I ever had
Pardon me, kid, I'm still learning how to be a dad
We be in spots you shouldn't be in 'till you grown
I was absent so long I'm just not leaving you home
So nah, too much to learn, too much world out there
Let me teach you about these hoes, too many girls out there
I respect your mom's tutelage
But that's my weird and my brain, what's she gon' do with this?
Watch and learn, foolish kid
Eyes light up with surprise, you're just like I am
I think that you're enjoying this ride just like I am
Look, same pedigree, theoretically
Cut from a cloth that was gone, that's just genetically
One job in life to make you a much better me
Greater feeling than I imagine this shit would ever be
You be feeling strong when you diss me in songs
I did the same my whole career, would never tell you it's wrong
Whatever works out, whatever the price, get that embedded
Even if at my expense, I'll pay it, you take the credit
Had a power struggle when I thought your mom abused it
My hands were in bondage, useless
Beyond the excuses, calm through it
It’s crazy, our bond music
And we do it beautifully for our beautiful conduit
So right now I stand in a place I never stood before
Finally filled the void in my life, I wasn't good before
Fucking with these hoes, that energy I was putting forth
God, this was more like the fucking love I was looking for
Now it's better than we pictured it'd be
And the supervised visits, we'll never have to relive it
Little nigga we'll be

This is greater than us. Greater than me
Greater than anything I could ever imagine, man
I ain't talking to everbody
Trey, what up though? What up? What up?

I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know, ah
I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like

When you walked into the room
I found I couldn't even move
There was magic in your eyes
(I tried to hide, then I knew)
You could see inside my mind

There is magic in the air tonight
There is magic in the air tonight
There is magic in the air tonight
There is magic in the air

When you touched my hand I knew 
That I had helplessly fallen for you
You had cast a spell on me
(I was blinded, but)
You were all that I could see

'Cause there is magic in the air tonight
Yes there is magic in the air tonight
There is magic in the air tonight
There is magic in the air

Now the moon is full tonight
So maybe this is why I've lost my mind
But the spell you cast on me
Has made me feel so free
I think we're gonna fly away, up to the stars
And I don't even know who you are
Maybe it's just and old superstition, but,
You're a warlock aren't you?

'Cause there is magic in the air tonight
Yes there is magic in the air tonight

On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""

I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",Frank Mills,

Stahhr Tha F.E.M.C.E.E.,"1, 2 1, 2 yes
Yo, it's King Gheedra, combined with the forces of nine ether
Blowing woofers and tweeters, shaking syllable meaning
Disaster's cataclysmic, mystic natural, it's about time
We hit you with some substance that's actual

I got a gift call, hip-hop prophecy, says 2003
Ends the reign of the jiggy MC
No more roaming on this planet like scavengers
Sciences broke the code of the Gregorian calendar

Define laws and space in time, trying to trace my lines
Hold up, respect the architect
Digital rollin', my whole crew roll with VS
Type to master this whole universe in three steps

We stretch across the equator with something major
Universal rhyme tones, tamper with ya time zone
Minds blown by the millions jus' for the feeling
Hip-hop, it just don't stop until I make a killing

Nah, I'm kidding, but for real, the world ain't the same no more
Take your life to next level or remain no more
Take your life to next level or remain no more
Word up, word up

Well, I'm colliding with the mind of a survivor
Surviving, uncover the time brother
The high volume white collar high styling
Verge jocking the side, dodgin' mirages

Conquer the vibe, hunger lurks
Nine to five work saga, God bless the life
Father trife, crawl for the light, pounding the globe on sight
Vocal pimpin', it's throat

So you know how we go down yo
Struck from the ghetto yo, medal throw
Settle the dough, live showbiz
The cannonball, weapon, men and arms

Four section, super intelligence, balance
Benevolent, stinging nettle medicine
Crouch tiger, dragon, craftmatic
Watch ya back, if, catch this

Fascist through the atlas, first class diplomatic status
Stagma flag, overstanding the plan
Bar skin, then a [unverified] streets watch timex clocks
[Unverified] punchless [unverified] on the dot five

Minutes to rot
So we blew blocks, crews
It's old news how we do

I'm a drop one rhyme
For every time, I cross the thin line
Between yours and mine, see, it's part of my design, shifting paradigm
Yin and yang combined, must be out ya mind

Thinking star would never shine
Pops duke, focus with a hawk's eye view
I'm all that, a plaintain, and some Ital stew
Gettin' spine ache, British, ATL upon this

Even avitronic figures be thumpin' off over this verbal elixir
Magnetic attraction, raw, nearly Jacksons
Straight open in the caption, here comes the Hix and Braxton's
Lyrical contraction, delivery reaction, it started with a passion

That's just the way it had been, raw with umbilical cords strapped
A corpse, won't drop a curse, while mustard hit this spouse?
Sharp with a needle, try to reach the people
Ya'll fiending for the sequel and the beat's not even EQ'd

We have a snake to catch

I don't look like you, do the things you do 
But I'm fucked up too I don't need you 
I don't understand it 
You're killing this planet

Dance, how low can you go?
Death row, what a brother knows
Once again, back is the incredible
The rhyme animal, the incredible D

Public Enemy number one
Five-O said, ""Freeze"", and I got numb
Can I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun

Now they got me in a cell 'cause my records they sell
'Cause a brother like me said
Well, Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you, what you ought to do

Follow for now, power of the people, say
Make a miracle, D pump the lyrical
Black is back, all in we're gonna win
Check it out, yeah y'all, here we go again

Turn it up, bring the noise

Never badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact that's corrupt as a senator
Soul on roll but you treat it like soap on a rope
'Cause the beats in the lines are so dope

Listen for lessons I'm saying inside
Music that the critics are blasting me
For they'll never care for the brothers and sisters
Now across the country has us up for the war

We got to demonstrate, come on now
They're gonna have to wait till we get it right
Radio stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black but we'll see if they'll play this

My burdens at the door

I can see through you
See your true colors
'Cause inside you're ugly
You're ugly like me

I feel the same

You take away
I feel the same
All the promises you made to me
You made in vain
I lost myself inside
Your tainted smile again

'Cause you can't feel my anger
You can't feel my pain
You can't feel my torment
Driving me insane
I can't fight these feelings
They will bring you pain
You can't take away
Make me whole again

I feel betrayed
Stuck in your ways
And you rip me apart with the
Brutal things you say
I can't deal with this shit anymore
I just look away

'Cause you can't feel my anger
You can't feel my pain
You can't feel my torment
Driving me insane
I can't fight these feelings
They will bring you pain
You can't take away
Make me whole again

You take away
I feel the same
All these promises
You promised only pain
If you take away
And leave me with nothing again

You can't feel my pain
You can't feel my torment
Driving me insane
I can't fight these feelings
They will bring you pain
You can't take away
