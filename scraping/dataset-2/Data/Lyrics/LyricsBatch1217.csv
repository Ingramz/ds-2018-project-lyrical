Tony Williamson,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1997
Tony Williamson,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!",Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!,1997
Tony Williamson,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo

Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Tony Wilson,"When the twilight is gone and no songbirds are singing
When the twilight is gone you come into my heart
And here in my heart you will stay while I pray

My prayer is to linger with you
At the end of the day in a dream that's divine
My prayer is a rapture in blue
With the world far away and your lips close to mine

Tonight while our hearts are aglow
Oh tell me the words that I'm longing to know

My prayer and the answer you give
May they still be the same for as long as we live
That you'll always be there at the end of my prayer",My Prayer,1996

Tony Wink,"[Intro [Dame Grease]:]
We have (we have)
Some the (some of the)
Exclusive (exclusive)
Hardest (hardest)
Vacant Lot ya'll! (Vacant Lot ya'll)
Yeah (yeah)
It only just because I told ya (I told ya)
Let's go Muh'fackaz (Muh'Fackaz)

[Verse 1 [Tony Wink]:]
Yo, I 'em payed dues for years, so I'm in to shot game
Even though I got a deal, I still hustle in the rain
Fuck fame
These cold streetz puffin' through my veins
Like a agent ?affected payin' me, want to dig with the cane?
Young niggas comin' up fast, we wantin' the same
Lookin' back on 'em years, like the streetz ain't changed
Ten years in the game, still spinnin'
I'm still runnin', still gunnin' at foes
And money's still comin'
A half of these niggas is talkin' about it and get shit
Is the winky type of bite a block, just revere it
Live my life tactfree and don't give a fuck about nothing
A ?17's? fo' enemies a whole type of duckin'
So every picture's money I get, I'ma double it
Even if I'd sell a mill, I'd still be bubblin'
I still cop solo, can't trust no man
??? Meeno & my nigga half dead
(C'mon) [Yeah] (I have told ya'll!, huh, die slow)

[2x Chorus:]
Never Thought that it would happen this way
After all this shit I did, never thought that I'd be rappin' one day

Uh, uh, uh
[Verse 2 [Meeno]:]
Never Thought I'd have a Benz
Fo' ?V twizzy?, when a dime's on a ?D-Throw?
You know the tinks
Never thought a nigga like me would cheat in the game
Taxfree money, still get a seat in the change
Never Thought of bein' taught, with me deep in the game
On the other side of the town with these weak ass lames
Never wanted to see ""Live On Lenox""
Vacant Lot
Foot ya'll niggas, my crew will make it hot
Def to a man that saved a lot
We do it all for the love of the kids, love of the block
Want to start me poppin', love it or not
I've been through a lot of Bullshit and you thought I forgot
Gotta get whut you deserve and I owe you a lot
Cause we the ballin' niggas
Hard to fall niggas
Ready when it's time for thoughts, you cored niggas
Sendin' this shit out to all ya'll niggas
Want to know whut we about, we ball on niggas
Vacant Lot, 99, Fuck ya'll

[Chorus]
Verse 3 [Baby Madison]:
Who would ever thought I woulda switch games
I thought all this crack money I gain
And all the cold nights hustlin' in the rain
Still runnin' from the cops
Game don't stop
Want to restin' til' they catchin', I'ma had it the game
Back my coke to blast
Nigga rubbers' been on my nuts
The free work is on the block
I ain't tryna get knocked
Supplyin' with the light tops with plastic glocks
I'ma ball til' I drop whether you like it or not
When it's on, so they dump, blamin' on Vacant Lot
We niggas makin' it hot, we about to drop
Talk slick and blow ?droh?, I be blazin' tribes
Watch your mouth and your man ?off? I be diffin' the back
Grimmy niggas lay back, slingin' raps like crack
House full of Platinum Plaques, I did it at last
Dirty money to green cash, to the best throw wacks
And if you can't except it, then nigga respect it
Number One on Billboards, better run and check it
Uh!

[2x Chorus]
Outro [Dame Grease]:
I never realized life can be so simple, baby (so simple baby)
Haha ha-hah (Haha ha-hah)
We doin' this for the kids (doin' it for the kids)
We doin' this for the love of the block (love of the block)
It's all we got (It's all we got)
Ya know whut I'm sayin' (Ya know whut I'm sayin')
Whut you livin' for (Whut you livin' for)
Cause whut you love (Cause whut you love),

Tony Yayo,"Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
If you got it, I'm gone take it
If you're in it, you're coming with me
Bench warmers, get no playing time
No sleeping til I cross the line, I'm running

With 99 miles left, on the Avis rental car
Blowing horns like Miles Davis
At the pearly gate, God let me in
Give me a room by Aaliyah with ESPN
I know I got more sins than two lesbians
Been back and forth across the border like Mexicans
But I'm running like New York pedestrians
Trying not to scuff my Nike Air checks again
It's funny how niggas be the best of friends
And fall out over pussy and wanna dead they man
One of my niggas in the grave the other one in the pen
She fucking my enemies inside my homeboys Benz
Now she begging God's mercy cause she ain't listen to Nas
And never heard about Ike and the Iverson jersey
He got a cousin named Jayceon that rock the Gary Payton
Now the same trifling bitch is a HIV patient, true story

Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
If you got it, I'm gone take it
If you're in it, you're coming with me
Bench warmers, get no playing time
No sleeping til I cross the line, I'm running

If I get knocked with my gun nigga I'm running
If I catch a murder one nigga I'm running
Homicide come around and they keep on coming
That's why I'm out of state and I keep on running
I ain't Nelly but my Desert Eagle's on girl
Just dropped bail traveling the world
When I sign my deal I said fuck jail
I went on tour to Barcelona and Brazil
This shit real fuck an appeal
D's want my head like that bitch in Kill Bill
Sling dope sling crack and them E pills
That's why I'm on the low like a damn navy seal, I'm running

Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
If you got it, I'm gone take it
If you're in it, you're coming with me
Bench warmers, get no playing time
No sleeping til I cross the line, I'm running

Cause I gotta pack them shows
And Dre told me ain't no coming back from gold
So I gotta get my album in place
My G-Unit features, my Eminem sixteens, my Dr. Dre beats
And it was two years from today when I started rhyming
And took my demo to Suge and he ain't sign me
Niggas threatening my life like it's hard to find me
See me shining in the hood like twenty inch Lexanis
My mom said I'm hard head, I don't follow the rules
Why should I when Reebok giving niggas they own shoes
And I'm dealing with the same problems 50 Cent got
Yayo in jail and they think I'm trying to take his spot
I'm in the studio laughing at Chris Rock
Then I turn on MTV and see Soulja Slim shot
And niggas trying to gun me down in the rim shop
Cause I just want the same recognition that the Crips got
They say I'm the next in line and if I get shot
Then I go out as the Bobby Fischer of hip hop
Make your chest move, Sylvia Rome and Kevin Lyle slept cool
Jimmy Iovine was the best move

Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
If you got it, I'm gone take it
If you're in it, you're coming with me
Bench warmers, get no playing time
No sleeping til I cross the line, I'm running",Runnin',

I got birds in the hood so I'm in to birds with Mary
My writing methods got me more hoes than tice and betha
Icy necklace on the tour bus ass naked here straight jump
Bitch say how high and flag down a car when the shit drive by

Is shorty ain't feeling me shorty must like girls
Cause I'm only eating your whirl
Bitch I can make you famous you don't know what your missing
I can change your mind if you listen
If the bitch don't like me the bitch must don't like men (like men)
I say what I want cause I can
If I didn't id be a liar 
Mommy I'm on fire
Come ride with a rider
The crowd say you might catch the king with a singer
For touching my doorbells the only way ill put a ring on your finger
Give me a convo with two cups an 
I'm in your bedroom fucking up your sheets like the ku klux klan
I shook hands with my fans and fuck em
I'm in the hallways trying to duck em
So i can climb in to something
My names B-A-N-K dollar sign bitch
I'm a bigme to make that switch
Now come gimmie that

[Chorus]

(Groupie love I love that shit)

Groupies come and groupies go
And they are always at our show
So I garb me the tightest one and pursued straight to the mall
she's so excited that's she's here with me that she feels she should pay here fee
And I did not disagree so she dropped down to her knees

Tony Yayo,"I smell pussy! Is that you Irv?
I smell pussy! Is that you Ja?
I smell pussy! Is that you Black?
I smell pussy! Is that you Tah?

Y'all niggas is pussy!
I'm balling out nigga now watch me (watch me)
Ain't nothing you can do to stop me (stop me)
Y'all niggas get so emotional (emotional)
You remind me of my bitch

It's not of my nature to make a commitment so let me breathe
What she doesn't understand catch attitudes when I leave her
My other relationships just make it harder for me to accept her as my own
She tries to tie up my phone and
I'm not at home she's thinking I'm not alone
Probably out tryin' to bone anything in the street
I let her know she can leave I ain't tryin' to tie her up
But see it's hard to fuck wit somebody after she touches me
Mami I'm not your regular nigga I know the game
But I don't play by the rules I'm focusing on my moves
That way I will never lose
See I can tell by your shoes if you attracted to Bentleys with 22's
You say I confuse you play little trick with your head
Catching feelings ever since the first time I slept in your bed
I'm not here to tease you mislead you with so your dreams
I can't say I love you I don't know what that means
I'm a pimp

Girl you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy

Girl you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy

When I first met her, I did anything to get her
Paid all her bills and filled her frigerator
Reminiscing on late nights when I tried to lay up
But couldn't get off cause your baby would stay up
She even crashed the whip tryin' to switch in the third lane
That's when I realized this bitch was a bird brain
A pigeon writing her baby pops in the box in prison
Sing-Sing is where he been in
She in the Gucci tights and Fendi high heels
Baby wipes and cans of Enfamil
Motorbikes and grams of fish scale
So 9 to 5 niggas was no frills
Turning young niggas with principals to old men with debts
And all the prank calls was death threats
That bitch got the best sex, all across the globe
And the bitch head game was out of control

Girl you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy

Girl you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy

I wonder when I'm gone if you miss me
Or do you miss that Don Perignon and that Christy
I'm fuckin wit you
I'm feeling your shape I'm feeling your eyes
Later on I'm feeling your ass and feeling your thighs
Sweetheart you book smart and street smart
I knew you was my type from the very, very start
I'm in to tongue kissing, foreplay all day
Momma ain't home so the noise is okay
ODB you know we like it the raw way
Latex, safe sex, no hickeys on the neck
Now you're learning
The lords blesses make me wiser as the worlds turning
My tongue touch the right spot I'll have your toes curling
Whether we just kicking it or we sexing
I'm a pro baby girl I spit game to perfection
So when niggas make mistakes I correct em and
When niggas get out of line I check them man

Girl you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy

Girl you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock

I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what what up keep steppin' and just rep D12

Keep my nose clean stay away from weapons jail
And livin' wreckless, but if you would check my belt
You may see soemthing else I use to protect myself
A vest to stop a ruger and deflect the shells and

Send em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more I don't got to
Got under cover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people crossed the line

But this motherfucker Ja mustve lost his mind
That X has got him thinkin' that he was DMX 
Then he switched to Pac now his tryin' to be him next
So which one are you X Luther Pac or Michael ?

Just keep singing the same song recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and hailey dance to your songs we like you
And you don't really want to step inside on my group

Come on now you know the white boy will bite you
I'll hurt your pride dog and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to 
With syllable after syllable ill just slap ya

Killin' you faster 
Than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of
That shit you on but if you want it you got it 
You'd bump this shit too if we didn't diss you on it

But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants ta
So what's the deal where was all of the tough talk
When I walked up to ya like Ja what up dog

How come you didn't say you had a problem then
When you was standin' there with all you men
We could've solved it then I'm a grown man dogg come holla
All you did was slap hands smile and swallow

Another one of them lil x pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you want to be (Cmon)

[Chorus: x2]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You can talk I'm still the m.c
You don't want to bump heads with me

You couldn't slug me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot my bars would melt you
Ja, you... stuart little, shells will lift you
Every other week I'm buyin' a new pistol

I clap at yo ass with this chrome 38
And put 6 through yo hat so seven in 3 eights (?)
Erv you ain't shug knight you shook light
I put my knife in ya wind pipe

Then freeze on this turn pike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got rolled two times so your ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with segal

Yo fuck that I'm tired of these -

On ya mark, get set, let's go, switch the flow
Teach ya how to turn Yayo into dough
The original don dada, nobody bomb harder
Ya heard what I said boy, I'm hot, I'm hot
The hoodrats they say ""He so crazy""
The snitches they say ""He tried to spray me""
That's what you get for trying to play me
The aftermath and my wrath is so shady
No matter how you try you can't stop it
I catch ya stunting in the Bentley Coupé cockpit
If you a pimp why ya hoes stay outta pocket?
Front and find out how my P-40 Glock hit
""50 you need some help?""
Chill, Yayo I got this
Where I'm from the D's tryin' to knock us
They swear to God that it's me selling the choppers
Man, I ain't give them little niggas no product

But how much do you like my style?
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how

I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style?
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how

The birds they say I got a way with words
I be like ""baby girl, I like them curves""
If ya not busy tonight then we can swerve
I'mma bachelor, baby, fuck what you heard

From the tellie in ten minutes I'll make you a believer
Tongue touch ya, I'll have ya shakin' like you havin' a seizure
I make hits about what I do in my leisure
G-Unit gang, can't another clique out there see us
Niggas lip sync the lyrics cause they wanna be us
Groupie hoes from the hood they be trying to G us
Trying to holla at the kid every time they see us
Girlfriend quit pretending, I'm the nigga ya love
And I ain't got to say nothing, you know that I'm thugging
Put my hands on that ass and ya say that I'm bugging
We family, baby, kissing cousins
Now look what the riff raff done drug in
For the cheese my degrees is hotter then ya oven
I'mma New Yorker, but I sound Southern
And we sip DP 'till the Don stop bubblin'
After we play, ok, go to ya husband

I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style?
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how

I know you like my style
But how much do you like my style?
You like how I break it down
Wanna get rich I'll show you how

Em said you gone like my style
Dre said you gone like my style
I said you gone like my style
You gone like how I break it down

You're not really, really ready
The drama will have ya ass in trauma, boy
You're not really, really ready

Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car

I like the way this feel right here
Yo turn me up in the head phones just a lil' bit

There ain't shit in this world deeper than loyalty and love

For you, I pull up in the whip and spray the whole strip

For you, there ain't a damn thing that I won't do
I'm a Thug, this my way I show, my love for you

For you, if we go broke, we gon' rob a nigga ass

How could you not love a Thug like me?

Would you ride for me? (You ain't even got to ask)
Would you die for me? (Nigga, they blast you, they blast me)
Would you cry for me? (Shit, when I die I don't cry for me, just keep reppin' Southside for me)

I'm the knife, you the stab
I'm the driver, you the Jag)
I'm the ice, you the bezel
I'm grimy, you ghetto
I'm the bow, you the arrow
I'm the shell, you the barrel
I'm a pimp, you a player
I'm dope, you the hustler
I'm a nine, quiet me down, you the muffler

You can catch me in public housing, wit' bundles of D
Or in the Santa Monica mountains, bundled up to ski
Since, time is money, I rhyme on the clock
And walk through the strip with a nine in the ox
You seen the ice, you know it's top notch
And when it comes to dice, I'm seeing' shorty to the shot box
Banks stop, guns pop through your tank top
And leave you wet up like a sonar range drop
When I grind, I wear the same thing tomorrow
When you grind, it's Showtime at the Apollo
Damn near every rapper gotta hide sixteen
Well my flow's like a ho that's sixteen
I ran through niggas, dismantled niggas
They mad cause they see me in Cancun bitches
But I'm ghetto, straight from the 'hood my nigga
If there's no toothbrush I'ma use my finger
I got so many minks, and so many leathers
The crib is surrounded by animal protesters
I'm a grown man, still livin' like I'm young
With the mind of an old man, full of wisdom
Here the cops come, task force van
Rock so much ice, I'm called Jack Frost man
And while we sippin' on cris', you sippin' backwash man
Your team got heart, but your heart's in my hand
You want sixteen bars, in song format
Or sixteen cars on your mom's doormat...Wha",True Loyalty,2003

By now I know you done seen me
On ya' stadium or TV, with 380 on the EV
I skeet babies on ya breezy
And I ain't' stoppin', Only Jack the Jacob could freeze me
Squeeze me and its bye bye gone
We got guns like Popeye's arm
I put a ring on every finger but the rats still askin'
'Cause there's one on all of mine, I'm the rap Phil Jackson
I built the rep for murder on every Who Kid
Kay Slay, and Big Mike, admit it the kid tight
And you ain't' even put up a fight, so its back to the amateurs
Wrappin' ya' sandwiches, I'm hot now so the rats want to stand wit' us
They hop in the van wit us and clap on cameras
I hit the clubs, now I'm back tourin' Canada's
Amongst weed smokers and crap floor gamblers

I watched Kobe go from the Basketball Court to the courtroom
Go'head try to do my harm solider
And you'll be in a black bag like grass out the lawnmower
And I'll be damn if I cosign a old snitch
That was gangbangin' when Jaws was a Goldfish
I've been named New York's screamin' on the street
For bullying the baseline and leanin' on the beat
I'm well known now so you see me on the creep
Schemin' on a freak, fan base leanin' on the jeep
They walkin' wit the fire
So if you say banks in ya verse, Then you better be talkin bout Tyra
From P.A. to L.A., Atlanta to Texas
Nashville to Memphis, My buzz is tremendous
I pass through the city slow, But hit the gas on a silly hoe
Bounce like ass in my video

Stunt in the club, get hit wit' yellow bottles
Don't speak ma if ya neck don't swallow
'Cause 50 push Bentley's and Dre push Diablo's
That Eminem money got cash in my Escrow
Screws ???? swimmin' in my Castro
Yay' rap is crack, and I got the best blow, best flow
Banks' put me in the booth, Let's Go
Think like Cestro, the games in a lasso
Jump in the Benz without snaps on the petro'

I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)

Don't go against me I'll hurt your feelings
Stones in my cross the size of your earrings
My confidence level's high nigga can't tell
Lickin my lips at ya bitch like I'm LL
I smile like a nigga in jail receiving mail
Better yet like a nigga in the bookings that made bail
From day one I came in the game they said I was hot
They got scared, ""Cent got money,"" and I got shot
You put pressure on me when you compare me to 'Pac
I'm just a new kid, I can't help that I'm hot
What little niggas say to 50 cent don't matter
I'll fire shots at the shepherd and watch the sheep scatter
My enemies never turn into friends, my friends turn into enemies
You scared then get the fuck around me
Record execs, know not to play wit my check
I come through and put my knife on that vein in ya neck (YEAH!)

I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)
I don't like you, you don't like me
It's not likely that we'll ever be friends
Why pretend? (Ma, 50's back at it again)

And you know I'm finna take her back to the crib
Here we go I'm a show her how a playa' live
At the door I tell her to take her clothes off, shit

Shorty so seductive dancin' on me
It's the way that she move that makin' me horny
If I wake up next to her in the morning
I'm a turn over and tell her let's do it again

The way that she move is makin' me horny
If I wake up next to her in the morning
I'm a turn over and tell her lets do it again

I put the G in G-unit baby I got game
Head to go good to go and I don't know your name
Is it the wheels on the hot car
Meals on the shock bar
Or you just want a quickie with a rap star
Ladies tell the truth you know I'm cute
But what really turns you on is the rims on my Coupe
Before you jump in my whip and you get dropped off
You goin' to the telly and you gettin' popped off
I can't stop thinkin' of the things you do
When your freakin' me and I'm freakin' you
I said the ice on my neck make the shorty's stare
Baby let me fly you in my lair
Stop slow down baby if you hear this in the club shake and go down baby
Its past my curfew but parole don't know
Tear up the club don't call my p.o.

[Chorus]

My ways be spinnin' I charm the amazing way
You know them black and white and asian women
Let's cut the small talk you know why I approach you
I can't stand when a dime act anti-social
Gucci,lip gloss,Louis Baton,and the boots from Batego Vanetto cost a arm
Yayo's a don my car European
You got mirrors in your pants 'cause I can see me in them
Listen I piss out Cris inhale haze
I'm in the Marriott gettin' laid all day
Tattoos and piercings and rings in your tongue
Shorty things like that will make my black dick cum
I need groupie love the Coupe on dubs

Don't blame it on David I'm all iced out
'cause 50 got me rich so the bar all priced out

Tony Yayo,"Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh huh

Comin' up I was confused, my mommy kissin' a girl
Confusion occurs comin' up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out commitin' felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out My Melody""
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin', niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's MVP
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

I told Dre from the gate ""I'd carry the heat for ya""
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya
Put Compton on my back when you was in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my N.W.A. gold
I had the whole crowd yellin ""Free Yayo!""
So niggas better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us 'cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your lil' rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West coast mouth-to-mouth? (Hahaha)

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top

And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

From the beginnin' to the end, losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change, it's stayin' the same

How many of them boys is witcha'
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walking with a snub, 'cause niggas do a lot of slick talkin'
In the club 'til they coughin' on the rug
Ain't never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin' up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke, my boy just got poked in the throat
Now it's an RIP shirt in my coat
Now I'm speedin', reminiscin'
Holdin' my weed in, never listen
If I see him I'ma lift 'em
And maybe that'll even the score
But if not, it'll be me on the floor

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop

And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me

I started out at 15, scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and I made them sales
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil' deuce-deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin' Easy Jesus, rockin' a Alesis
My momma whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life and thank God I'm blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest

You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, it's a hood thang; that's why I'm loved in Brook-lyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey, I'm still all good
Let me show you what a thug 'bout, born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put 'em in my fo'-five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen a worthy check

Do it exactly the way I said do it man
These niggas is pussy you heard me?
Get up nice and close

I put that battery in his back
I'm the reason why he move like that
That's my muh'fuckin toy soldier
I tell him pop that gat, he gon' pop that gat
You don't wanna play with my toy soldier
I say it's on then it's on until your life is over
Fuckin' with my toy soldier
If he's a casualty of war, trust me I got more
You don't want it with my toy soldiers

Listen up close now, follow instructions
Catch a nigga slippin', run up on him and buck him
I ain't got no conscience no morals or nothin'
They ain't wit us, they against us, we supposed to touch 'em
Here's what to do if you see him approach me
Pop that nigga, I don't care if he know me
Half the niggas hatin' on me used to be homies
I don't trust 'em when they smile or when they frown 'cause they phony
Everytime I come around they call the police on me
That's why the D's in the precinct know me
They know about my rap sheet, they know 'bout how I clap heat
Run like I'm in a track meet, swift with the MAC, B
You can see the envy in they eyes fo' sho' mayn
Mad as a motherfucker that I'm holdin'
See me in the back of the Phantom, rollin'
Quick to make examples out of niggas fo' sho' man, hold me down

Shoot, stab, kill muh'fucker
If you ain't 'bout it I don't want you around, cocksucker
Every word out my mouth is felt; that oo-wop pop
Them hollows so hot, yo' ass'll melt
Barber razor in the club, stunt, I'll give you a shape up
Have your ass stitched, gored, your head all taped up
Niggas know how I get down, see they know when I'm around
Ha ha, my soldiers around
And if some shit goes down, and a nigga get laid down
It's no surprise 'cause niggas know how we get down
Black tints on the Testarossa, hammer out the holster
Gat in my lap in case you gotta get clapped
You monkey niggas swing through my hood, we on that Gorilla shit
You clap off and miss, we come back, start killin' shit
Catch us on the corner wearin black chinchilla shit
We organized, disciplined, plus we militant

I'm in that two-door Phantom and the body's kitted
Waves in my head lookin like tsunami hit it
Niggas scheme, but the infrared beam's on the MAC
I'll put green on yo' head like an Oakland A's hat
One boy was a doja, now he a soldier
My little son Dula lettin' off the Ruger
In a whip masked up, lookin' for his enemies
Riled and gassed up, off double D batteries
His last casualties, is hooked to them IV's

Click-clack, take that, fall back
It's a contract, 50 grand, I'm 50 man

But every time he home, he beatin her and smackin her

You need diamonds from Jacob that's black and blue

Listen boo, nobody in the world is perfect
So when you around my team there's no need to be nervous
I hit it from the back pull out your tracks

Stop it money, I'm out for the profit money
And that advance that you got, be my pocket money
Yeah my transporter's cute but got a real flat chest
Put a brick in her bra she a 36 F

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
You got diesel on your strip, that's that G shit

You got your bitch movin bricks, that's that G shit

[Tony Yayo - singing like Suzanne Vega's song ""Tom's Diner""]
I was slingin, on the corner
Seen this fiend I, ran up on her
She was lookin, kinda hungry
So I gave her, five 20's
When she handed, me the money
Man the money was marked
Here come the NARC's, do doo doo

[Tony Yayo]
Duckin the D's, runnin the P's
Tossin my cheese, man I got these hoes on they knees
Yo my coke is Snow White and my workers the 7 Dwarves
I got what you need homey hard or soft
Man, I drop bombs like Hiroshima
I got the heroin cut, with the bomb bonita
Task force got me hemmed up, facin the wall
Cause I'm up in the mornin slingin wake-up calls
Dimes and 20's, don't you know, time is money
I done slept in spots straight supplyin junkies

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]
What'chu know about, measuring spoons bags and scales
My hood's a goldmine but it's hot as hell
There's money to make, I scuff my Timbs runnin from Jake
And got knocked with my ratchet, jumpin the gate
Listen I been had the fishscale, and the white butter
Since Heavy D was known as the ""Overweight Lover"" (believe me!)
Sling that D, sling that coke
Sling that meth, 'til your spot is hot death
Yo D's kicked my door for the search and seizure
My moms dropped to the floor, and she caught a seizure
I got 4 workers, and one lookout for the jux'ers
A mac in the garbage and a mac in the bushes
This is drug dealer rap, a mean 16
I'm Tony Yayo, I'm a hustler's dream

[Chorus]

Tony Yayo,"[Intro: Tony Yayo]
Turn me up in them fuckin headphones real quick man
I'm feelin to body this track
And body a nigga when I get the fuck outta here man

[Tony Yayo]
Cocksucker this ain't rap, check my rap sheets
I feed you to the rats with peanut butter on yo' feet
44 bulldog, get money hustle hard
So the feds want my face on that damn number card
I drag you in your elevator, hit the stop button
So when I pop somethin they can't fingerprint nothin
I help you wit'cho bitch, I'm lovin your dame
Shoot her ass and her heart, hit her jugular vein
Niggaz talk it they don't live it, these niggaz is butt
Go through they projects and they jewels is tucked
I'm in apartment 4B, wipin down the llama
With two freaks kissin like, Britney and Madonna
And you know how I ride when the beef is on
Pull up, LA LA like Jamaican songs

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
It's a niiiiiiiine, it's a nine
There's a clip in the nine, bullet in the clip
Bullet in the chamber, round on the ground
And that's why homicide all around
There's a hole, there's a hole
There's a hole in his head, hole in his leg
Hole in his pants, holes everywhere
And that's why homicide all around
There's a body, there's a body
There's a body in a drop, body in a lot
Body uptown, body downtown
And that's why homicide all around

[Tony Yayo]
I'm in that brand new Range; when I pull up kid
I turn your brains into red concrete stains
That's the beauty of gruesome violence
I'm loudmouth nigga but my Ruger silent
Sun-up, sundown, my fishscale move
And if a nigga wanna stop it he gon' be fish food
Yeah Yayo rhyme but I murk a person
And when your mind leave your body your spirit is soul searchin
Gas your team, nigga I'ma blast your team
I got plastic milk jugs full of gasoline
Four-fours bark loud, you layin in heaven
While your moms and your pops in deep clouds of depression
I turn your head into pasta, and baked zuchinni
Like that bitch did that rasta in ""New Jack City""
In broad daylight, you better think twice
Or that thing on your hip nigga better spray right

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
It's a niiiiiiiine, it's a nine
There's a clip in the nine, bullet in the clip
Bullet in the chamber, round on the ground
And that's why homicide all around
It's a hole, it's a hole
It's a hole in his head, hole in his leg
Hole in his pants, holes everywhere
And that's why homicide all around
It's a body, it's a body
It's a body in a drop, body on the block
Body uptown, body downtown
And that's why homicide all around

[Tony Yayo]
Feelin to fuckin kill somebody right now nigga, fuck!
Got a SHITLOAD of guns right now nigga
Homicide come around I'm gone nigga
When you see them suits and ties
You best to believe I did that to you nigga
Matter of fact I didn't do that to you
Huh, c'mon man, shit is real man
This is for them niggaz - fuck yo listen lemme tell you somethin
Don't run up on no whip
Just run up on a nigga and blow his fuckin brains out
That's what, that's gangsta nigga - you hear me?
Don't fuckin run up on a whip and spray somethin
Lemme see you, shoot a nigga brains out
And stand there for two minutes, and then run, motherfucker!

You scream and holler when Eminem's in town
I know you don't love me, I know you don't love me

Gators and ostrich, you know we in power
You could see my outfit on the Discovery Channel
I'm a stunner, my bitches train like robots
They sniff coke, deep throat, and they hold out glocks
It's the brick-copper, the L-sharper
645 NASCAR driver that's known to spit lava
I'm in Cancun, with a model in the bedroom
Her pussy tight like an airplane bathroom
Talk out your mouth piece, baby pah
The baby A-are will make it hot like South Beach
I move like, Bin Laden armed with them hammers
In that new Jag wagon, with James Bond vagrant
Medina all - red; mira give me - head
Bad bitch, look like Eva Mendes

I'm in the candy-painted Range, Cardier frame
Six-by-nines playin so I can hear e'ry thang
Heavy on the gas homie, hoggin up two lanes
The navigation got me to where I'm gon' be stayin
The trunk full of somethin that can get a nigga life
So my seatbelt's on, and I'm stoppin at the light
I done been to Queens before but not behind the wheel
I'm a country nigga, ain't this many buildings where I live
But the business gotta be handled so where this coward at?
We leave a couple niggaz layin, bet them bitches holla back
Ever since Yayo been home it's been on
Smackin niggaz up, employers is gettin sent home (yeah!)
On this battlefield, you know, it's kill or be killed
Leavin niggaz with bulletholes and hospital bills
This is how it is homie, La Cosa Nostra
I won't stop 'til I'm on a ""Wanted"" poster, motherfuckers

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I know you don't love me, I know you don't love me
You ain't the same when Lil' Jon's around
I know you don't love me, I know you don't love me
You scream and holler when Slim Thug's in town
I know you don't love me, I know you don't love me
Yeah Em put me up on how the hoes get down
I ain't got time for a groupie ass bitch
Try to run game and they ain't about shit
I know you don't love me

[Lloyd Banks]
Uh-uh, yeah
You should thank the Lord if the ray gon' getcha
Cause the sawed-off'll microwave a nigga like, Adolf Hitler
Fuck pressure, I enter the ring calm
I'm nicer than them Japanese niggaz in ping-pong
Look at my ring don, lease a 100 K worth of bling on
Smokin the same buddha as the courtroom shooter
I got the mind of a genius; the rag-white Jag
Backhand like Venus's, jab like Zab
Ya bitch, I'm makin her knees knock in the lab
Let off, and send her to the weed spot in the cab
And I don't hate all music, I just hate y'alls
And I hear you when you whisper, got the ear of Ray Charles
I'm ahead of my class fucker
And I only serve a bitch once so they treat my dick like the Last Supper
Niggaz callin out my name in vain
When someone jab to the jaw they be the claim to fame

22's on the Porsche drugs henny in the fridge
That's how we live it is what it is
We run up in your crib snatchin kids in your wiz
We know where you live it is what it is
If we can't eat then your team can't live
That's how it is it is what it is 
Nigga that's how it is it is what it is
Nigga that's how it is it is what it is

I'm crippin' everyday token meet Jamaica
My pistol get it poppin' like the pistons and the pacers
I'm the messenger of misery I move discrete
You kiddin' me my victory is in the jaws of defeat
Then these haters wanna kill me 'cause my dreams is reality
The sig with the beam will cause a fatality
Just caught a case but it's a minor technicality
With shooters on the street prosecutors keep houndin' me
What you know about Grammy speeches sandy beaches
Pales that seedless four pounds and sweepers
Movie features groupie divas deals wit sneakers
Secluded in the woods from the snakes and leaches
I'm makin' money on the road homie autographin ass
While you on a silver horse with your metro pass
For every dollar you make nigga I make a G
Damn it feels good to live life like me

[Chorus]

Its spider and big yay, we doin' it which way?
Real big 'cause he stay where the rich stay
We get it crackin' like a high school ditch day
Ghetto mackin' is how I do the inch pay
A Escalade and a two che six tray
But his life is the price that the snitch pay
But its polital my paper sprowtin'
My girl get upset I don't take her out and
My choice of occupation make her doubting
Ill be out the front door I can't take the poutin'
I'm about anything that'll make a mountain of this mula
Ooh all the cake I'm countin'
See the games too deep I can't shake I'm scoutin' the clout
A fast line like the Lakers shoutin'
Tryna have me a flat wit some acres
Out in the boon docks so I move without them fakers

I'm filthy so stop hatin' the milli's what I'm waving
You guilty by association you payin' for operations
Your kids be orphans coughi'n up orchids
We sprayin' up your Benz you layin' in coffins
Its gunit click nigga you love what we spit nigga
My wrist glist and glitter 'cause we sittin on six figgas
Yo its all about the benjamins feel the adrenalin
Yo we killin' 'em wit' beats from Dre and Eminem
Your bitch keep runnin' me I know she feelin' me
My last cap and gown was in elementary
The kid is back the kid is crack
I'm hot hot the way we rap we blazin' tracks

Yo we project livin', with plastic on the furniture
Little niggas comin' up will fucki' try to murda' ya

Yo the strip movin' slow, but everybody goin' hard
Seein' more D's than a damn report card
Everybody rap now, following these dreams
I'm a call my clientele, man, and sign all my fiends
Same gear for a week, wearin' dirty cloths
All day in the spot, by a dirty stove
Trials keep me strong, hope keep me happy
But I'm only human, so these niggas want to clap me
The drug game over, but there's money to make
So niggas clappin' at niggas who raise that crime rate

You niggas push me, for sure I'm goin' pull it

Snakes in the grass be on that bullshit
Niggas that's ass stay with a full clip
Guns get blast, niggas on that shook shit
So live by the gun, or die by the bullet

The rhymes you spit could embarrass the city
When my game bag names like Paris and Nikki
Load the semi, I'm in the spot carvin' the crack
You stunt, I'll leave my bullets lodged in ya back
New York City, everything move fast
Little girls get pregnant, throw they baby in the trash
China white whizzy movin' quickly on the ave
The same dope that Whitney in the rehab
Up early in the morning, cause there's money to earn
Cause the early bird be the one that catch the worm
We got nicks, tres, twenties and dimes
Got my spot lookin' like a soul train line
Fuck doin' time, I'm tryin' to progress
Get that money, nigga, serve ya projects

You got mirrors in your pants 'cause I can see me in them
Listen I piss out Cris inhale haze

Tattoos and piercings and rings in your tongue
Shorty things like that will make my black dick cum

I ain't your friend, you a tattle teller
You rat, you snitch, you jealous nigga
You coward nigga, you teller nigga
Tuck your tail, pluck your whiskers you tattle teller

There's rats in the street, and rats in the jail
In the feds, rats wear wires in they cell
Shit Steven Seagal, I used to love his karate
But even he snitched, he told on Peter Gotti
Pillow-talk wit' cha girl about that German Ruger
Got her in a small room with the prosecutor
Watch ya shooter, them feds givin years for them guns
And there's nowhere to hide, when the marshals come
D.A. don't play, giving life off of hearsay
And right hand on the stand for conspiracy
Kingpin charges, and that RICO law
Got agents in your spot for them bricks of raw
And people tellin on you that you never saw
Like your next door neighbor that live on your floor
The game over, man everybody wanna snatch
Fat Cat and Alpo nigga started this shit

[Chorus]

Be careful what you ask for, Joe got bagged
He got knocked by the feds for some things in his past
Now he rattin' on his co-D's, snitchin' on his homies
To government officials, and U.S. attorneys
He told about his lifestyle and old war stories
The brawl in be	-more in the stall with them shorties
Out of town trips, cocaine connects
He told about the ratchets, fo'-fifths and tecs
He snitched about the diesel, stashed in the ceiling
He bragged about them kids that caught bodies in his building
He told on himself and told on his right hand
He talked about taxes and credit card scams
Joe took the stand, he sold his soul
But little did he know he dug a deeper hole
He lied on his friends and the judge flipped on him
Now he in Fort Dix with a man's dick on him

[Chorus]

Death before dishonor, what happened to that?
Them wolves in lamb's clothing is the ones that's rat
Nicky Barnes and Alpo, Cat and Freeze
I heard Ta-Ta tellin' just to get that cheese
Pipe on death row, they told on Pete
They the reason that pistol ain't on the street
Chris Portello, yeah he used to fuck with Madonna
The South Beach King is, federal informer
Homey watch the corner, slingin' that crack
That kid C.K. told on O.G. Mack
Sammy the Bull man, he the biggest of them all
He broke the code, he made the whole mob fall
Italian Joe Camby, he messed up the game
He tellin' on his people like Saddam Hussein
So when you standin' on that corner, chillin' wit' cha fellas
Kid watch your back for them damn tattle tellers

You scared, get the f*** out the way
And pray, them G-Unit boys don't play

Nah, I can't play sacs or pull a rabbit out a hat
But I can c*** back and blow your blather out your back
Take that, I'll show you n****z how to rap
I'm c****, that's snowy white p***** on the track

I told 50 I was going to take it to the top
Get close and get pop like hot bacon out the pot
And my goons are loony and strip you naked on the spot
Ain't nobody scared in south, Jamaica but the cops

I'd probably be in the penitentary
But I played the cards, the dead lord sent to me
The whole truth, I use this booth to speak to my thug niggas
Why you mad at me? the government's the drug dealers
Before I let this police kid harass me

He made a move and I heard a blast

For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope

That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's

Of just getting by, there's no way to live it!

Some of these comrades were grieving here before,

Enough talking, let's take it to war!
Stay laying on the floor,
What are you taking me for?

They want me to lose but I'm gonna win,
I made it here before; I know I can make it again.

Ain’t nobody gon' love you
Your shit ain’t right
What bitch in her right mind gon’ fuck you
That’s what they told me then
So I was like ""fuck a bitch""
Imma grind, Imma shine, every time blow they mind
Oh now she like me, oh oh oh now they like me
All I want is a blow job
This bitch wanna be wifey
No 3-course meal, all I want is fast food
I wanna have fun, how about a cookie huh?

I don’t wanna love you
I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out
I wanna fuck you
Maybe later on, if you’re free you can come to my house
Only if you want to
We can get freakier and freakier than you’ve ever been,
If you want to
We can get freakier and freakier you can bring a friend

Bitches from Belize, keep all in the weed
Remy crew got me sweating out a remi weave
Fuck a model tonight, my bitch is from the P's
She the project dick tease
Them hood bitches always bring back memories
They all catch the makers like ""Yayo you remember me?""
I certainly do, pull the curtain on a ’62
Hands was free, she on her menstrual
I promise I don’t love em, I don’t cuff 'em
I don’t pay a bitch’s rent to have the next nigga fuckin’
I’m a pimp with principles
Killin' with visuals my diamonds like two ? bitch

I don’t wanna love you
I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out
I wanna fuck you
Maybe later on, if you’re free you can come to my house
Only if you want to
We can get freakier and freakier than you’ve ever been,
If you want to
We can get freakier and freakier you can bring a friend

I don’t want a relationship, I just wanna have fun
In every position, we can come up with til we’re done
And my request is to be kickin' shit in my ear
Like to hear what you're thinking, after laughing and drinking
We can have a ball, we can do it all
Moonshine light up the sky at night time
With me any time could be the right time
I’m sort of impulsive, I’m kinda explosive
Me, take a little at a time in doses
Don't want you addicted, I just wanna kick it
You could pick the spot, I’ll be there with the quickness
Give it to you good, when I’m gone I’m sure you gon' miss this

I don’t wanna love you
I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out
I wanna fuck you
Maybe later on, if you’re free you can come to my house

I'm a ride-or-die nigga; I be tearin' shit up
We ain't like them other fools who don't compare to us

They hop right on mine and hop right off yours

I'm the aviator man, baby; AR shoot your baby out your hands
Spaghetti and corn bread; mix got me blunted
There's no talk abouts; you don't fuck on an empty stomach

Had a share of problems don't you know
Just the same the city had too

“There's a lotta things that you know
But there's a whole lot more you need to know”

“Money, have your own
Friends, just for fun
Drugs, don't indulge
Sex with the right person”

“Work all your day
Crime does not pay
Love don't apply
Live, to live you must die”

And I can't be late 'coz I was born not to know
Things are getting crazy, I ain't getting lazy
I was born not to know

Now since I've grown, I've learned a lot more
The city hasn't changed a bit since
Doesn't mean I have to live like this

I still can recall what my mother told me
There was a lot of things that I knew
But the ones my mother said were true

Money, had my own
Friends, we had fun
Drugs, didn't indulge
Sex, had the right person

Work, all my day
Crime did not pay
Love did not apply
Live, now I live but I gotta die

Tony! Toni! Toné!,"I've been penalized too
Working with some fools
Everyday from 9 to 5

Now it's time to break the rules
Wear the fancy shoes
About to hit the town tonight

I don't care about the price
If the place is nice
And has a lotta food and drinks

Of course you can't forget about the babes
And if you all behave
About to rock your house tonight

Let's have a good time
Let's break out in the house
Let's have a good time
Turn the whole dull place alive

Let's have a good time
Gotta be at work the next day
Let's have a good time
Party all night anyway

It feels good to break the rules
Forget about the fools
I had to see the next few days

No one cares about the times
They ought to fill the wine
To care about it anyway

I know friends about to keen
I have to turn it in
To make it through another day

But now I'm 'bout to make a move
Especially on this groove
And party with the girls all night

Let's have a good time
Let's break out in the house
Let's have a good time
Turn the whole dull place alive

Why I want to kiss you with my nut in your mouth?
I'll fuck you in between your jaws of course
And that's the reason your voice got hoarse
Cause niggaz like us tag-team on tour
You say you're 19, hoe? Yeah, sure
And ain't no bitch that I met had a boyfrined
Lyin and they steady tryin to get in

With thoughts on my mind of a 211
Threw on my fresh socks and my stomping boots
A brand new pair of brownies and my khaki suit
So I said to myself it's time to go jack
I grabbed a couple clips, loaded up the gat
I ran out the house, jumped in the Cutlass
Tired of bein broke, damn, fuck this
Hopped on the freeway lookin for the area
Showin no mercy and I'm not gonna spare ya
Searchin like a eagle but I ain't found shit
But just as the moment I was about to quit
Out jumps this Mustang doin 'bout 50
Driver bumpin sounds, he's rollin real swiftly
Now when I seen him I punched the gas
But I couldn't catch his ass cause he goin too fast
But hell yeah, I'ma get him tonight
I never wouldn'ta caught him but thanks to the red light
I'm in the left lane and he's on the right
Hey homeboy, you better check your taillights
Man, them muthafuckas don't work

He hopped out his car and walked to the back

Empty your pockets and drop your keys""
His girl screamed out, ""Don't take his car, please""
I said, ""Bitch, get your ass out
You know what I'm about, I'll knock your ass out""
Grabbed her ass by the hair and drug her out the window
Pushed out the car while I fired up the Indo

Lookin in my mirror it's niggaz all on my ass
So I said to my girl I'ma have to blast
So I bust a turn on [Name] Street
Then I pulled a muthaufckin .357 out the seat
Them niggaz jumped out 12-gauge ( ? )
Give me the keys to your shit, or get shot in the rump
My girl got out first, they said (Ooh, look at that)
Not knowin my bitch had the big, big gat
I got out and just threw 'em the keys
Then my girl said (Don't take his car, please)
Looked at my girl and gave her the sign
The girl whipped out the gat and she blast three times
1 nigga laid dead
The other cocked back the gauge and shot her in the leg
""Don't shoot my girl,"" I begged and begged
But my girl shot again and blew his brains out his head

There's a bitch on the block named Sue
A hoe in the hood everybody been through

That that's the fuckin house that he's gonna stop to
He was rollin a clean-ass Lac
On Daytons and 20s, a bumper kit in the back
I said damn, now who in the fuck is that?
He had diamonds on his hands and his chains was fat
He went in Sue house, I don't know what they was doin
But me knowiin Sue they was probably screwin
Now this nigga musta been on crack
So I rushed into my house, broke out the bumper jack
Stripped his shit and left it sittin on bricks
Fool-ass fag was in a hell of a fix
He was ready to leave the house
So I crept up to the door when I heard his big mouth
He kissed Sue and said good night
I threw my left hands on the chains, I bombed with the right
You know Sue, the stupid ass bitch
The hoe in the hood done turned into a snitch
Police pulled me over, I said what the fuck I do?
""I'm Crawf, officer, it wasn't me
""Shut up, nigger, don't they call you Hi-see?""
They turned they back, then I broke down the street
I almost got away till a K9 creeped
But it caught me and almost chewed my ass to death

All you had to do is give Crawf a call
And watch me come through and get it crackin why'all
I'm still breakin bricks with the homey Quik
We try to get it down just as far as it gets
Cause all I have to do is hop back and spit
And watch all the lil' mommas start havin fits
When I slide through the city in my Escalade
I ain't worryin 'bout shit, cause we extra paid
Tryin to stay sharp as a razor blade
And you thinkin 'bout now that we got it made
And I'ma take you right down, that ain't the case
Ain't nuttin like mo' chips in my safe
Stop skinnin and grinnin all in my face

With 3 dimes and I'm lookin for a place to lay

[ VERSE 1: Hi-see ]
Nine o'clock in the morning, yes, I got dressed
Thought about my girl with the big fat breast
So I called her up and asked could I see her today
She said okay, so I said, ""I see ya Shante""
Hung up the phone, then I threw on my clothes
I pulled some tissue off the roll to blow the boogers out my nose
Put on my chain and my boots and things
Bout to step out the house and heard the telephone ring
I grabbed the telephone just to see what was up
She said, ""Gimme the place and time and we could hook up""
I said, ""Okay then, why don't you meet me in the park?
At a quarter to five, cause at six it get dark""
She said she didn't mind, okay it's on
So I grabbed my Skanless jacket, then I hung up the phone
I stepped out the house, smilin and grinnin
Sayin to myself, hot damn I'm winnin

[ CHORUS ]
Oh what shall I, what shall I, what shall I do
Sittin in the park waitin for you
Oh what shall I, what shall I, what shall I do
Shall I slap the trick and tell the tramp it's through?
I'm (sitting in the park waiting for you)

[ VERSE 2: Hi-see ]
On the way to the park I had to stop at the sto'
When bums beg me for a quarter I usually say no
But that day I made all they butt holler
Went in my pocket, gave the poor fellas a dollar
They couldn't believe it, they had to ask me what's wrong
I said, ""Yo, just take this dollar and get yo butt on""
I bailed five or six blocks with a skip and a hop
Mmh... what's that smell? Oh, the flower shop
Now I pulled a lotta girlies out they panty hose
And never never have I ever bought a chick no rose
But that day I had to be the Life Saver
To top it all off, I rushed to 31 Flavors
The girl said she loved me, she said I was cute
But all I thought about was just knockin her boots
I thought about doin it with no hesitation
Now I'm sittin in the park just waitin

[ CHORUS ]

[ VERSE 3: Hi-see ]
Now I'm sittin on a bench with my back against the fence
Hi-see's not dumb, I got a gang of sense
Flowers in my hand, ice cream in a cup
I'm thinkiin to myself, won't this girl hurry up?
I seen my homies comin and my butt puckered up
They said, ""There go the homie Crawf, hey Hi-see, what's up?""
I grabbed the roses, tried to hide 'em behind my back
But I was stuck in a - ouch - caught in the act
Then a old man walked up to me
He said, ""You know, whatever will be, will be""
I said, ""Excuse me sir, I don't mean to be rude
( ? ) I'm in a bad mood""
He said, ""Look like you got yourself a few problems
Why me bein a old man, maybe I can solve em""
""Pops, that sound familiar, what shall I do?""
""Well, just slap that trick and tell the tramp it's through""

Then again, fuck around and get you bust in the nose
Some niggaz that I know get sprung on the coochie
Spend their last dollar, goin broke on a hoochie
If you see tight titties and a big fat butt
Your dick'll be sleep but his ass'll wake up
He'll fuck with your mind till you go and get her
Even if she got her big boyfriend with her
You'll step to the girl, thinkin you can clown
Touch her on the ass and her nigga beats you down
It's a dick thang, girls, don't get offended
Cause y'all the muthafuckas that be puttin us in the clinic
So homies, let's chill and don't play ourself cheap

Watched bad cover bands play
Got little drinks for free
Kept betting on twenty-three

We got drunk
We got sad
I met a girl who
Said she could save me

She said ""I am a hug
I wrap around you and I scrub
You're made of dirt my dear
I scrub until you disappear

That's what absolution means""
She put a dollar in a slot machine
Three triple bars came up we won six
Hundred bucks

We got stoned
We had sex

Too Much Joy,"Meet our band of merry men
Shake the hand of every one
We'll eat your food and steal your wives
Buy us beers we're friends for life

We only shoot when shot at
We give away what we don't need
We live for fun and freedom
We stamp out fear and greed

To create you must destroy
Smash a glass and cry too much joy

We sleep on floors and live on crumbs
We're a bunch of ugly bums
A great idea when we were smashed
Turning anger into cash

We ain't seen much
But we don't starve
We drive around
In our mom's cars

To create you must destroy
Smash a glass and cry too much joy

To create you must destroy
Smash a glass and cry too much joy

That's right, we're Too Much Joy
We're like the reverse Buddha
'Cause Buddha teaches you
To give up the things in this world, they only tie you down
And Too Much Joy knows it's the opposite that is true
It's the puddle of beer on the floor of the club that stinks
That ties you to this world and makes you know you're alive
It's only having two dollars to fill up your car with gas
and ?

To create you must destroy
Smash a glass and cry too much joy

To create you must destroy
Smash a glass and cry too much joy",Theme Song,1991
Too Much Joy,"he called me 
william holden caulfield
it was no compliment
what's wrong with 
william holden caulfield

all that stuff that bummed me out ten years ago
still bugs me today, and boy i wanna know
who died and made you my mom and me some stupid kid
how can you forget all those things we did

so keep on sleeping on
till your hair is grey
when I turn eighty
i better feel this way

i'm afraid of people who like _catcher_in_the_rye_
yeah, i like it too, but someone tell me why
people he'd despise say i feel like that guy
i don't wanna grow up 'cause i don't wanna die
when i'm thirty-one
then keep living on
for fifty more years

i respect the man in _sunset_boulevard_
got a heart somewhere just won't let down his guard
doesn't trust happiness or the bad luck that it brings
he's lonely and he's cold and he's proud of these things

Too Much Joy,"When I was a kid my dad had pictures of these clowns
He hung them on my wall and wouldn't let me take them down
I didn't understand then and I still can't figure out
What those goddamn clowns were so goddamn sad about

Clowns were my boss at every job I ever had
Clowns run all the record companies that ever said we're bad
Clowns pretended to be a girl who pretended to be my friend
This world is run by clowns who can't wait for it to end

I have yet to meet a kid not scared to death of clowns
They don't walk and they don't talk they've got painted on frowns
A clown with a gun I hope I never see
Would he shoot himself or shoot me?

A clown taught every class I took at my old high school
Clowns all wear Speedos when they hang out by the pool
Clowns dress up like cops and threaten to call my folks
This town is filled with clowns who don't get my jokes

They fall on their asses
It takes lots of practice
They fall on their asses
It takes lots of practice
They fall
They fall

I have nightmares filled with clowns and you're there too
You have a big red nose and stupid floppy shoes

You're becoming one I can see the signs
I hate clowns almost as much as I hate mimes

A clown was my boss at every job I ever had
Clowns run all the record companies that ever said we're bad
A clown pretended to be a girl who pretended to be my friend
This world is run by clowns who can't wait for it to end
Wait for it to end
Wait for it to end
Wait for it to end",Clowns,2001

Too Much Joy,"I met her at the movies, she was there on her own
A bargain matinee
Theater deserted, she sat right next to me
Can't remember what played that day
She leans real near, she whispers in my ear
I blink, she grins, choke on my M&M's

The lights went down, the lion roared
Donna got down on the floor

I'm losing my mind, but I don't care
I see Donna everywhere
Down by the lakeside, in a lawn chair
Donna, Donna everywhere

She agreed to move in, but my dog made her sneeze
So I gave the dog away
Should've kept the dog, given her to my friend
Cause he took her anyway

Those lips, those eyes, that tattoo on her thigh
White teeth, red hair, she hated underwear

Is this real or in my fucking head?
Donna's dancing on my bed

I'm losing my mind, but I don't care
I see Donna everywhere
Down by the lakeside, in a lawn chair

I'm losing my mind, but I don't care

And he lived in the sand at the Isle of Man.
The kids would all sing, he would take the wrong key,
So they rode on his head in their furry donkey.

The kids couldn't like Jack, they tried, tried, tried.
They dropped things on his back, they lied, lied, lied, lied, lied.

And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy.",Happy Jack,2001

Girlfriend was snoring and it was boring
I just turned twenty three, what did you get for me?
I'm having a party and you can't come

I met my brother's ghost I made myself some toast
I took it all in stride and I went outside

I climbed up a tree, I shouted ""look at me!""
Nobody answered, 'cause I have cancer
I feel my body burn, I gotta a lot to learn
I have lost my pride, I am dissatisfied
Everything tastes sour
I have no power I cannot sing I hate everything

Gone fishing (whoa, whoa) gone fishing (whoa)

She said ""I really want to be a dancer""
""It's too bad you have cancer,

Yo, Joe Flizzow
First to go on this track
Transcending continents
Who better
To hold it down for Malaysia?
Ain't no argument
I'm eloquent
With my words
And linguistics that I abuse
MC's wanna bite
But still got on
Some loose baby tooth
My rhymes so hot
We got fire blankets
In the vocal booth
Producers with extinguishers
To put out the blaze
When I'm on the loose
I'm rolling with the best
Meeting of the minds
Not a contest
Evoking MC's around the globe
With finesse and skills God blessed
From KL
But a hungry MC
Like I was from Budapest
Too Phat to go on diet
Toe to toe with Joe is ludicrous
Don't fool with this
You know we fly
Like a stewardess
Impressing pure hip-hop purists
In every single metropolis
Don't step to this listen
Rubbish we don't utter
Got to stop the hating
Unite us and start working together
So keep it butter
We'll kick it hotter
Than your average MC
They'll flee
We'll make 'em stutter

And tourists get a Rolex

Students still collide
To keep they peeps rights
We hostin' different ghettos
Different sounds each night
No drive by's in caddies
Clocking marks
Up on the east side
No kids with 40's
Shootin' dices under street lights
And buck guns
Here thugs swingin' samurais
In street fights
But buck a where I resides
As long as the beat's nice
I keep my rhymes precise
And when it recites
It makes you
Wanna peep twice
Impressin' each type
In each tribe
From jail to kids in Yale
To tribal Indians
Blowin' peace pipes
And buck the cheap hype
Your metaphors are re-writes
Your style is like tryin'
Your granny panties on
Could never be tight
The type that chicks like
Dudes wanna be like
And while you jerkin' offa free sites
I'm doin' three dykes, uuh
Yeah, I'm a Malay kid
And no

The type a A&R will tell Dre

That we abide by is ruthless
Enough will never satisfy
Until we toothless
Filthy millionaires
Are gamblin' until they muflis
A sad fact of life
But mankind approved this
I gotta call Him
Sajadah is where the booth is
I'll make it clear that
I ain't even tryin' to preach ya
By sharing thoughts I hope
To find a little peace here
I thank Allah for blessing me
To be creative
So here's a diss for me
For bein' unappreciative
Wanted a perfect life
Yeah smile then die old
Fame, money, women
Phat cribos and white gold
Drive my own Beemer
Before I hit two six
A straight pink bitin' toothpicks
Who walk around town wit' two chicks
And doin' new hits to woo tricks....
Now that's wrong
Pleasure from partyin'
And bullshit don't last long
A lotta yuppies sneakin'
Cars out when dad's gone
Crackin' bottles in clubs
Frontin' designer fashion
But I ain't about
To trade happiness for a Jag
So stop smilin' with your ragtop down
Cause for a fact
I don't care about your money
Or how slick your car
'Cause no matter how rich and big you are
It's still Allahuakbar...

[Chorus]
Ult li albi bissaraha (I'm opening up my heart with honesty)
Hayya nab'idil karaha (Let's avoid the hated and hatred)
Syakkireena a' kulli ni'ma (Let's remain thankful with what we have)
Ba' ideena anil fattana (Let's avoid all lies and sins)

[Verse 2]
I know that all this
Ain't the right thing
Partying, chasing moneys
And material things
Flying high
Think nobody gonna
Clip my wings
I'm lying to myself
Knowing that
I've been neglecting
Responsibilities
As a healthy Muslim
Riches and loot
Ain't nothing
We frontin'
Diamonds and scrilla
But forget to say
Alhamdulillah
Made my album a killer
Plan be	
Now 2-3 droppin'
And I wish to
Ask for forgiveness
Your guidance
Protection and strength
For humbleness and faith
To make me a better man
Success in foreign lands
Never dreamt of that
I remember being 18
When we started Too Phat
Now let's go back
Three years before that
Sometimes I forget
Me and my parents
Took a trip with granddad
I remember '95
While performing Umrah
Made my wish in Mecca
Right in front the Kaabah
Dear God
You made it possible
When facing obstacles
Please let me do good
Before I pass on
In the hospital
And keep reciting
The Testimony of Faith
And find the right way
Out of this life's maze

[Chorus]
Ult li albi bissaraha (I'm opening up my heart with honesty)
Hayya nab'idil karaha (Let's avoid the hated and hatred)
Syakkireena a' kulli ni'ma (Let's remain thankful with what we have)
Ba' ideena anil fattana (Let's avoid all lies and sins)

[Verse 3]
Ay yo?
Two candles go out
That's when
I feel the wind blow
I haven't met Fatim
For two years
Been livin' like I'm single
Evaluatin' all the friendships
Relationship
The reason it's the tenth year
Is 'cause she's a patient chick
And as far as friends are concerned
Many I've had it all
From those who cried for my pain
To those who plotted my fall
I learned to differentiate
Fakes from the great
Mates from the snakes
Apes want to beef
Hate's all it takes
For me to blow
A diss song for you
Not even worthy
As an album filler
So now it's smiles
And Alhamdulillah
Yeah, love me
Or hate me
This who I am
Look at the past at times
I wish that I was born again
So I can rectify mistakes
And my wrong doings
Attempts on minimizing my sins
Before my story ends
I ain't no Eddie Murphy
Tryin' to sound as a holy man
But if I tried to be a better person
Now I prolly can
(Wait...)
Who am I to advise you
I ain't been the best
Of God's slaves
Just a poet writin'
What my thought says
A little house
A little car
A little sweet girl
Thank you Lord
I'll try to slow it down
On the cheap thrills
This song will prolly stir
A little controversy
At least I ain't be rappin'
Bout the stuff
As tho' I'm born in Jersey
Stage name is Malique
And lost name is Cairel
Mama told me
Stop complaining too much,
So I will...

[Chorus]
Ult li albi bissaraha (I'm opening up my heart with honesty)

Too Phat,"Verse 1
Ladies and gentlemen guess
Who's back in town
It's Too Phat and Phlowtron
Ay yo we runnin' it down
Breaking the barrier's of sound
Jealousy knows no bounds
Moving in three sixty degrees
Like a merry go round
Still red and warm
The blood that courses through my veins
Arising from the underground
Like a hydroplane
Smuggling in crack phlowcane
Where there's no pain
There's no gain
So I sustain my domain
In a mind frame that's untamed


Verse 2
Yes
Yes yes
I know I'm sick
I confess
Displays of finesse
When my raps manifest
You couldn't handle this
Till I'm hundred I spit tight
Can't battle me on the mic
We'll hit the streets and fist fight
I'm quick to dislike
The type that
Speak a cheap hype
How they gonna take me down
With frail tales
And weak psyche
Raps weak
Your style's mild
And a tad meek
Welcome to this game
Of hide and seek
With crazy mic freaks

Verse 3
Yo it's Khazanah the Khalled
I bled the ground red
Moses scarred through
The red sea
I speak what the future said
Resurrect hip-hop for the dead
This egomaniac's drive to ecstacy
So let the ground rules be laid
The kid with braces grace
The scene in this hiatus
Rebel reborn revive
Rehearse this verse


Verse 4
Yo five years now
Malique is an astonishing cat
We started off the same time
You still promising act
Now what your problem is black?
They say they callin' you back?
You still are shoppin' for your demos
While I'm polishin' plaques?
Should start your colleging back
Or start workin' like in Mc D's
At least you'll get some mack on
But minus the rap cheese
You mad G?
Start your cripwalk
And wanna smack me?
Please, a nation of asian Bloods
Are gonna back me


Verse 5
Ba' wit' granna wit' mini bonn
It's Atom Da'Bomb
Namaewa genshi bakudan
Inspectin' the kinda conduct
To contemplate
The kinda way
You cynics trynna put
The muthalovin' rhyme away
It's evident that we adament
About the element
Of this hip-hop commandment
Equivalent to utilising
This brilliant tool
I can prove
Coz I barry more wack emcees than drew


Verse 6
Panel of the jury
Witness this starscream
I represent
The infamous Phat Fam team
Exhibit number one
Murder raps on the run
Spittin' fireballs
We defy the sun
Burning principles
Killing bass
Distort your eardrums
Diagnose you with sun strokes
Spotted your headlumps
Defiance against us
Will lead to your misery
Nation of the three sixty


Verse 7
I'm sick of cats
Who wanna diss
But be acting like witches
Here some disses
To discompose disconcert
And hit ya'
I'm quick to disfigure
Any figure who wanna play
Swift with sharp blades
Discover I'm hard to dissuade
So keep your distance
Don't discomode
And disturb this verse
Disingenous punks
Disheartened best quick disperse
I'll distinguish haters
Who disunite the scene
And discard disgusting friends
With rap disabilities
Verse 8
I rhyme nice twice
So lemme entice you
On this mental heist
You hidden behind a screen
Never seen like a poltergeist
Take my advice
Up wit' us
And you pay the price
When it comes to street fights
I transform and y'all be looking
Like itty bitty mice
I spit out lines
Like a bad taste
Of chocolate mocha
Gimme the crowd
I bring it loud
Then I rock it fo' ya'
I'm sick of these cats on posters
I burn 'em to crisp like toasters
Rob yo' as leave you screaming
Like six flags on coasters


Verse 9
Delusions of grandeur
Is one of the symptoms
With you trynna build
Your imaginary kingdom
If you think your Aragorn
Then I must be Tolkien
This is what happens
When you messin'
Wit' the protean stylist
Let the finest
Cunning linguist recite this
Like this your so called highness
Are you indisposed?
I offered you the blue pill
But the red pill you chose
Now you'se overdosed


Verse 10
Yo, buck a pencil
I scribble stupid rhymes
With my brain
I'm mental
This songs a little toast
For my pain
I'm roastin' my brain
Crazy but I post no complaints
Buckin' paranoid when tourin'
Think of bombs in a plane
I think I'm dyin'
I'm seein' stuff
I ain't supposed to
Like Linda Blair in Exorcist
Up in my lovin' poster
Buck the mic I'm lonely
I'm one fourth of a boaster
Imaginary girlfriends
Cause reals ain't buckin' closer
",Ali Baba & the Mic Thieves,
Too Phat,"Verse 1
If I die tonight
What would I do
On my last day
I know I'd wake early
In the morn' for crack
Of dawn's last pray
Then prolly go for breakfast
Like I used to do
Fried kuey teow FAM
And roti canai at Raju's
With my boo
And friends from way back
Neighborhood homies
Extended fam
They only know me
As that same cat
With that shaved head
Rocking Cross Colors
Sneaks to school
Writin' rhymes at the back of class
Playing tricks on fools
Then I'd come back to the crib
Tidy up a bit
Y'all know my room's messy
Though classy
Start arrange my ish
Line up my shoes one by one
Start with Jordans
And end with them Air Force Ones
Put a Post-it on the tongue
Of each one
With the name of each dun
I think I know my homies
And who would want which one
Get on the phone
And holla' at everybody
It's nearly noon
Gots to have lunch
With the family
Then spend the last day
I don't know
Try do a million other things
Hoping somehow
Time will slow
I guess what
I'm trying to say is
Take everyday
Like it was your last
Work towards your dreams
Before you pass
And have a blast
While you at it
'Cause we don't know
When we go go
So make the best of it
Just keep it real to yourself
And to all people
If y'all lost somebody before
Remember there'll be a sequel


Chorus (2x)
If I die tonight
You know it'll be alright
Just smile for me
Reminisce the fond memories


Verse 2
Well if I die tonight
I wonder
Where I'll be tomorrow
Nobody cry please
Push away the sorrow
'Cause I ain't been
The best of men
The best of friends
The best of mom
And daddy's last son
The best of anything
Tell Joe here's a last one
If I die tonight
Would I be forgiven
By all the people
I been slackin' with
When I was livin'?
Those who I hurt their hearts
Took advantage of
And even lied to
Hug you one last time
For forgiveness
Yeah I would like to
If I die tonight
Would you feel the loss?
Tomorrow would you dial
My number by accident
Then suddenly... pause?
If I die tonight
I wonder who would get
To keep my caps and shoes
Jerseys, even my little
Stuffed crocodile Coco too
Get my cell phone
Message everyone from A to Z
Tell 'em this ain't Malique
He passed away last night
And pray he rest in peace
If I die tonight
Would you think of my room
When you see blue
Wanted to clean it up this morning
But then I never knew
If I die tonight
What would happen to Tim
How long would it take
Before she kissed another man?...
God damn...
At fast food joints
Would she still order
The same combo meal for two?
Things I wish I knew...


Chorus (2X)
If I die tonight
You know it'll be alright
Just smile for me
Reminisce the fond memories


Verse 3
A cute lil' thing
To many eyes
To me you were simply
A beautiful thing
I tell no lies
We went from
Mere invisible friends
To pals real tight
Rendezvous up on the net
To chitty chat all night
I used to pick you up
Until you got your own ride
A slammin' two door whip
A grey 36-72
Lookin' all slick
Remember when I asked why this
You said because it's real fast
So you can rush
To see your boy after class
The last time
We met was '01 September
You left feelin' upset over... something
I can't remember...
I never apologized
Till January 10th 2003
When I heard you passed away
When I was deep in my sleep
Your loss taught me
Not to take my friends for granted
Misunderstandings
Gotta slam it quick
Death you never plan it
You're sorely missed down here Wawyn
Rest in peace
This too shall pass
But our true friendship will never cease...
Love...


Chorus (till end)
If I die tonight
You know it'll be alright
Just smile for me
Reminisce the fond memories

Judging by the way you roam

But I know what you're thinking
Nasty intentions
Now party with me
And by the end of the night
You gon' leave prolly wit' me

Why they call me Big Joe
And why I've got gurlies
Lined up like corn rows
Skirts up like Monroe
Lined out my condo
They bend like elbows

And at the height of the night
Yeah I love 'em too
Just remember that
You never gonna be my boo
You know how we do
If you came to party

",Nasty Girl,
Too Phat,"Chorus
Tell shorty I love her
Tell shorty I need her
Tell shorty not to cry
My love for her
Will never die


Verse 1 [Malique]
Remember Jenny?
The witch who
Really drove me delirious
And ever since
I never took a gurlie serious
Well I was heartbroke
And straight up revengeful
Looked up in the mirror
Saw some playa' potential
I started workin' out
Just like a mad man
Learned some rap slang
Even started off a rap band
I called it Too Phat
Now anybody heard of 'em?
I don't know why
But some gurlies
Are crazy over 'em
The story goes
I met all kinds of creatures
Some dime pieces
Some fly chicks wit' fine features
Some were ugleeeh
Some were so so
But the ""hey, he's just a friend"" type
Is a no no
'Cause through experience
It's not worth it
It's uncool
And any guy
Who fights over a gurlie
Is a dumb fool
You feelin' me?
This little Bill Bellamy
Now all the shorties
Wanna chill with me
I was like
Damn, I never felt great till lately
Makin' all the gurlies
Who date me
Hate me
And usually I'll be gettin'
Those who I planna'
Except for two model chicks
Noarlene and Hannah
But then aaa
I had Nana, Nini, Susan
Make 'em fall in love
And at the end
I confuse 'em
I get bored
And dump 'em
No reason gave
Just get a friend to go tell 'em
This what I said
Now lie it...


Chorus
Tell shorty I love her
Tell shorty I need her
Tell shorty not to cry
My love for her
Will never die


Verse 2 [Joe Flizzow]
Yo, I ain't never been the type
To break a woman's heart
But sometimes
I sing 'em this song
When it's time to part
When it's time to go
No you can't be with Big Joe
I tell 'em trust me girl
In due time you'll know
Rather break if off early
Before they in too deep
Before I lose interest
Before I start to cheat
See I don't like that
I play my game
With some respect cat
Leave 'em still loving me
So later still can tap that
Some szex with the ezex
No strings attzached
Y'all playaz feeling me?
See I like dzat
These o's think
I'm a celebrity?
And I'm gonna
Write them a song
On my next CD
Well you right 'cause
This song is about you be
Or how it's about to be
I love you girl
But it ain't meant to be
I know that don't make sense
I took your innocence
Babe I promise that
We'll still be friends... What
Might be a lame
And cowardly reason
To get away
But I got that ish
A lot way back in the day
Ain't gon' lie say
I ain't never got played
Ask my homie K-Laid
I've been down
And been betrayed
We called 'em the ish
That's every man's unicorn
The one that got away
Left you with your heart torn
But know I'm on my feet
Life is sweet lets get in on
And when it's time to exit
That's it
Peep this song
I'm sorry shorty...


Chorus (2x)
Tell shorty I love her
Tell shorty I need her
Tell shorty not to cry
My love for her
Will never die


Bridge
Please don't tell my shorty why
Please don't tell her it's a lie
Tell her that she's still a dime
Yeah that's why she can't be mine
Baby bye bye hugs and kisses
Fly lies, love and misses
You can't be my Mrs.
So goodbye!


Verse 3 [Malique]
Yo, whuttup cheeky
I'm Liquey
A tad picky
Specialize in heartbreaks
And 2 inch hicky
That's how I picked up
This curly chic Asha
Last year
Walked passed her
At Mc D's at the cashier
Nearly crashed her
Didn't know she had a man
Till this dude called me up
I said, ""I'm just a friend!""
Then I met this really cute thang
Sarah, a VJ
The problem is she in Jakarta
Me in PJ
Came Catherine, a model
A stunning looker
When she caught me
With her bestfriend Luna
It shook her
Luca, Stephanie, Daphne, Janice
Rachel, Kimmy was the president's niece
Peace!!!
To all the hearts that I broke on tour
At least 5 in Indo
And 4 in Singapore
But back home
You know I got scores for sure
Just tell me
What type you lookin' for
I had a chick in showbiz
She liked to slow kiss
But I dumped her
She had halitosis
Hana, a half Japanese chick
Friends with Shukri
Bed wrecker
Made me go ""Yukkuri, yukkuri!""
Cookery expert
MILF named Yuzi
Chilled wit' her two kids
In their jac'causei
The Jaguar chick
I met at the red lights
Gimme ten seconds flat
Imma get my mack right
Now the list it goes on
Till the break of dawn
Yeah I'm strictly white lyin'
When I'm singin' this song
Young playaz sing along
To shoo pigeons
Who either plain wack
Or love you
For wrong reasons
Like the chicks
Who only want me
Cause I'm popular
Not because that I'm simply
A fly fella'
So to all the hearts I broke
I mean many
Don't blame it on me honey
Blame Jenny...


Chorus
Tell shorty I love her
Tell shorty I need her
Tell shorty not to cry
My love for her
Will never die


Verse 4 [Joe Flizzow]
I'm lookin' for a ride or die chick
Down *** chick
That drive her own whips
Had Monique
Fly trick
Used to buy me force kicks
Loved to watch pawn flicks
But couldn't really suck it
Had to kick her out quick
Met a half Latin chick in Ipoh
Her mom was from Rio
Company CEO
But damn she had BO
Adios senorita
Then I met Anita
But messed around with Rita (Ain't that her sista?)
I'm the type of kid
That could give Stella
Her groove back
Never drop corny lines like
""Baby, you're Too Phat""
Don't do that
I drop conversations worthwhile
That stimulate minds
And tend to generate smiles
Operate with style
How I do is hard to say
Call me Big J
Hugh Heffner protegee
See I ain't met a girl
That could get down with me
And blow my mind
That's why I still
Play around you see?
Ya'll think
I got a thing for flings?
Well you wrong
See until I meet
The girl of my dreams
I'll keep my game strong
Keep my game fly
Keep telling white lies
Never deal with a trick
To say my bye bye's
Somebody please tell shorty
That it's over
Somebody go tell shorty
That I love her
This is for the better
Believe my story
It ain't you
It's me shorty
Believe I'm sorry
C'mon now...


Chorus
Tell shorty I love her
Tell shorty I need her
Tell shorty not to cry
My love for her
Will never die



",Tell Shorty,
Too Phat,"Intro (Lah)
Everytime I close my eyes
Shorty I see you
Right there with me
Walk with me

Verse 1 (Joe Flizzow)
Girl I seen you do your thang
Make a playa' wanna holla'
Seen cats trying to run game
Impress you with their dollars
You ain't like that
That's what I love about you
No need no man to give you ends
And try support ya'
You rock manolo things
Your blings match your rims
You only know me as that rapper
Workout at your gym
I seen you work that punching bag
Releasing ya' anger
Baby something's stressing you
That's why you look so gangsta'
That ish attracting me
'cause' boo you ain't fake
Let me step to you
Holla' boo make it a date
Then we can conversate
Get to know what you hate
And what you want
Ain't trying to front
I ain't no second rate
I'm the real deal
Ain't no run of the mill
And I'm digging you crazy
Your style is real ill
So take a walk with me
Open up and talk to me
Ain't no pressure
Just kick it
That's how it's gonna be
No fancy restaurants
We both sick of that
Let's take a stroll
If you cold wrap my hoodie
Round your back
Walk to your doorstep
Give me that smile baby
Huh...
Hot damn you the ish...


Chorus (Lah)
Everytime I close my eyes
I fantasize myself with you (Shorty I see you)
Shorty lookin' tight
I bet you'll look so right with me
There's so much to talk about
So yeah let's talk about it
While we walk around
Now baby come, right
Hold me tight
And take a walk with me...


Verse 2 (Noreen)
First off
I heard your relish for chicks
I'm not your average witch
And that's a fact
That I'll establish quick
So kill the devilish tricks
I'm not at all a fabulous pick
Stay in the palace or rich
Or slammin' like the chicks
In your clips
And quit the modesty
Of course
I know your name man
Heard 'bout your fame clan
And all about your game plans
I'm not your typical prey
A different dame brand
Yo star struck
And fall for celebs?
Yo' that's a lame trend
We come from two different worlds
Like Uncle L sang
Go tell fam
That why I play hard
It's just a gal thang
I know my words sting
So tell the whole gang
Well oh dang
Still pushin' ma's whips?
You lil' poor thang
You like the rims on my ride?
You need a hike?
Psyque, a lil' walk
Will make you feel aight, right?
Burn some calories
Out by every mile
Yo peace
I'm outtie five thou
With a coke and a smile... Holla'


Chorus (Lah)
Everytime I close my eyes
I fantasize myself with you (Shorty I see you)
Shorty lookin' tight
I bet you'll look so right with me
There's so much to talk about
So yeah let's talk about it
While we walk around
Now baby come, right
Hold me tight
And take a walk with me...


Verse 3 (Malique)
Ay shorty listen
I bet you hear this ish
All the time
But here's a lil' something
Worth playin' on auto rewind
I hope you don't mind
To kill a lil' time
To hear clearly
Since you a harder target
Let me take my shots fairly
Rarely, I gets to meet a gurlie
Hard to be tamed
Yea I done broke alotta hearts
And I ain't mentionin' names
A playa'
Too many games played
Has gotten me a tired man
And your rejection means
Delayin' my retirement
So shorty grab my hand
And walk with me
I'll crack a joke
And make you chuckle
Promenade up in the park with me
It's just a lil' me and you
Chill session
To change your foul perceptions
And your misconceptions
I'll sit you down
And make you look in my eye
So when I talk on future plannings,
You can tell it whether I'm lyin' or nah
Alotta guys are steady lyin'
Just to get through your thighs
But I just wanna make you smile
Cause I'm allergic to cries
You feel me?
I swear to God I'll treat you proper
I'll love you proper
Apologies for lesser wealth to offer
I heard your man
He drive a Benz
You like to ride that?
Well off that
I ain't got that
Now shorty
Lets just take a walk right back...
What...


Verse 4 (Quotazn)
Ok, yeah
My man he got a nice car
But that's not my deal
Plus we didn't get very far
He left me in a hurry
Like he had the damn right
To leave me feeling this way
Wasted every night
But I don't need your shoulder
Or your tissue
I'm the kind of girl
Who can handle her own issues
Listen
I don't place affections thoughtlessly
So I'm kinda weary
When you say walk with me
So what the dilly?
Now really what's the hype?
Stop explainin' yourself playboy
I know your type
You wanna step into my life
And do me right
You play with girls all day
Call me every night
You wanna walk with me
You wanna talk with me
But when I need a boy
Boy where you gon' be?
Would you be my side?
Maybe in your ride?
Maybe even on the stage
Waving side to side?
Your words fall on deaf ears
I don't need your sweetness
I'm oblivious
'Cause I know women
Are your weakness
Maybe we should walk
But in opposite directions
I hope my irritance
Shows in my voice inflection

Chorus (Lah)
Everytime I close my eyes
I fantasize myself with you (Shorty I see you)
Shorty lookin' tight
I bet you'll look so right with me
There's so much to talk about
So yeah let's talk about it
While we walk around
Now baby come, right
Hold me tight
And take a walk with me...



",Walk with Me,
Too Phat,"Verse 1
Listen...
It's been like
One fourth of a score
And I ain't glad at all
'Cause I been facin'
More bull than a matador
And ever since
The success of Plan be
Alotta people think
It's been candy
Sweet and dandy
It can be
Minus all the envy
And all these underground cats
Wanna slam me
Yeah I admit I been quiet
But off that I'm tired
You got beef?
I'll fry it
Now which motherlover
Wanna try it?
My silence's an act of charity
And now unmerrily
I'm forced to stoop down
To your mentality
Battle rap was an excuse phrase
You 'bout to lose face
The whole sing sing thing
Was a loose case
Sing sing's a pen
Short for penitentiary
S-G is Singapore
And Singapore is family
So tell Kuza
Which you's a loser
And if I see her face
At my show again
I'll bruise her
Duality of Styles'
Diss track was garbage
Illustrait, garbage
Souljah Boo, fat garbage
And praise the Lord
The mentions are kept minimal
And when I diss
I say names
Buck bein' subliminal
You asked for my autograph
Memorized my recitals
Well last year
You groupies
And now you punks rivals? (Please...)
Illegitimate beef is suicidal
I still hold the title
And I'm still your freakin' idol


Chorus
Now where my love at?
I'm askin' young cats
And all that
If I ain't phat
Now what you call that?
Alotta suckers are mad
Because I'm all dat
Yo' blast the track
Where you ball at


Verse 2
Alotta people love
Us but even some hate
And the feeling
When you dealin' wit'
Dumb hatred's ungreat
Five years
I met all kinds of people
Some minds are simple
Some kinds just grind your temple
Critics can suck my ***
I'm sick with it
Anonymous diss
And say another kid did it
Word is
Since in the limelight
Malique can't rhyme right
But puff that
This rhyme's tight mate
Now am I right?
Or am I right?
The buck I do
With my life is my right
Well everybody sins
Why mine's the highlight?
Now reporters stay nosey
Gossip and rumors
Life is made humor
Sicker than brain tumor
Friends turn to snitches
Jelly duns is vicious
Try to set me up
By hookin' me up with witches
Now even Joe thinks I'm paranoid
Cause I got this odd
Sense of danger every 40 yards
So I roll with bodyguards
I swear to God
If it wasn't for the cream
I've quit cause I've had
And done enough for the scene
Promote the four elements
Key show performin'
Foreign land tourin'
Now doin' a song with Warren
Kids is stormin'
Bum rushin' pack shows
But respect from the scene
Ain't had those
Now all fingers up
Not one, yeah I would love that
Askin' hip hop heads
Now where my love at...?


Chorus (2x)
Now where my love at?
I'm askin' young cats
And all that
If I ain't phat
Now what you call that?
Alotta suckers are mad
Because I'm all dat
Yo' blast the track
Where you ball at

Verse 3
Yoâ?¦
I got emotions to let out
Impossible in two verses
So here's a third one
Pardon the curses
First is first
Imma make clear
And state here
That I ain't start ish
And won't stop until
Your eighth tear
Diss until your mates cheer
It's retaliation
The price you pay
For thinkin' I've eternal patience
After squashin' beef with Ammo
I thought it'll be
Like no problemo
Until I heard kiddies
Who dissin' on they demos
Not just that
Go on the net
Phat Fam dissed by Bobby
Little sick kid
Who surf porn as a hobby
14 and racist
In real life Phlowtron
Will stomp you on a daily basis
Alotta internet nerds
Think they wildin'
Keystylin' ain't freestylin'
No timin', no hooks
No production, no beats, pal
I rather write dope lyrics
Than come up with wack freestyles
I write songs good hearts listen
The rest start dissin'
Wit' stanky rhymes
I call 'em farticians
Yeah I only mentioned
Few from the namelist
Your overnight trick
Of gettin' famous is the lamest
Diss the best
He diss you back
You get known
That's obsolete witch
Work the throne on your own
But until that day comes
Kill the bull ish
And all that
And realize that deep in your heart
That's where my love at


Chorus (2x)
Now where my love at?
I'm askin' young cats
And all that
If I ain't phat
Now what you call that?
Alotta suckers are mad
Because I'm all dat
Yo' blast the track
Where you ball at

Now Imma kick a lil' som'n som'n funky for the fellas
And all the phat ladies who been acting ovezealous
That tell us that Whutthadilly? was really the best one
And they could hardly wait to check out the next
So I bless'em wit this phat verse fatter than tractors
A kiddy kinda voice a contributory factor
On how I let my phat words affect the fat gurls
They start moonwalkin' backwards until they back hurts
Now check this is hella fancy you in a frenzy
And now you and your frens be, jumpin' like chimpanzees
I know our fans be wantin' us back so bad
So Imma kick a track and let you lay back and check
This easy playa, songs you bump to on your CD player
Tiggedy tellin' all the sleazy, cheesy haters see ya later
Gimme the piece of paper with the funky ball point pen
Some people they ready to battle but to busy to make an appointment
Oink oink man just take a look at that biggy that wanna be tupac
He hittin' me up the rooftop cause my group is too hot
Your crew not, some fool said that my music abusive
Just like the two fists of Len Lewis when he too pissed
You boo'd this but now you think my coo'ish amuses
Your two sisters dig my voice and drip woo juices
0,1,2-0,1,2 is how we do
We make the crowd they go rowdy rowdy hooooo

Chorus
Wo-o-oh Malique and Joe again,
They on the radio-o-oh
Blastin through' your fat momma's stereo-o-oh
Don't wake your neighbors so you gotta keep it

To all the playez in the club, **** **** to the beat
To all the honeyz show me love, **** **** to the beat
Everybody throw it up, **** **** to the beat
**** **** to the beat

Verse 2 ( Joe Flizzow )
Biggedy back up in this be'nez again ya dream
Womans dream man

To show love but I get down for sure love, ya know
Love neva hold off
On gracious boos, that unheard off
WORD ain't' it never of ever occurred
I be pullin' stunts they kinda crazy and absurd
Joe Flizzow, Malique clockin' boos in scoo's and herds
When I'm grabbin' microphones they grabbin my shirt
We contemplating, sometimes we complicatin'
Amazin' pharasing got ya gazin tryina be chasin' the dragon
They call me Joe the dragon and I don't mean to brag on
But JZow got his hands on experience to make ya
Hunny got delirious
I'm seriously silly so Whutthadilly? You got beef wit' me really?
You gotta be jokin' don't try to be provokin'
Joe and Malique we hot and we smoking...

Chorus

Verse 3 ( Malique )
Yeah yeah we ain't through until we take you fools on a
Journey back to the old school
When it was all about love and brotherhood and
Everythang was crazy cool
Check, we usta wear white Nike Air Force sneaks
With the fly grey Nike Air sweaters
And at the little playground next to the school is
Where everybody got together
Check it out., we usta drink and chill out in the park,
And freestylin' from top of the dome
Then everybody would party at Moomoo's crib
Because the mommy and daddy ain't home
Check, see I be chillin', Joe be chillin'
Whole Phat Family be chillin'
And I still got it, love for thee
Suckers that's down the me!.

Too Phat,"Pinklady dance with me
All night in a trance with me
Love dove you make me fly
Take me high....

Verse 1 (Malique)
Yo fly Friday, feel slick I'm hummin' ladi dadi
This chicka promised me eternal dancin at a rave party
In flesh and bone I'm hiphop, but now I'm changin flava
JOLLY GREeNS to JELLY BEANS tonight I'm gonna be a raver
Now Imma knowledge you on who and how this chicka be
She had a PINK HEART, and loved pink CK's and D&G's
And had a BIG BLOKE brother ADAM, some called him BIG E, who pushed
An E CLASS white MERCEDES wit buddies BIG D
And BIG see, but BABY SLITSTA only drove a MITSUBISHI
Little rookie raver waitin' for she now he gettin' pissy
Glanced the ROLEX, this PINKY LADY kinda late
Until I saw the MDM 4 up on this license plate
Now all them BLUE BUTTERFLIES in my tummy started flyin'
Baby was E BOMB, she left ELAINE and MARY JANE cryin'
CHANEL smell good as NOSECANDY is the aroma
Everybody straight or crooked lookin' like they wanna bone her
Sexy PINK CROSS TOPS that make you sip saliva in
She hold me tight like it's a HONEYMOON LOVE THANG
Promise to dance with me all night long
Remember drink alotta water so ain't ish goes wrong

Chorus 2x
Pinklady dance with me
All night in a trance with me
Love dove you make me fly
Take me high....

Verse 2 (Joe Flizzow)
Friday night, I'm at home hittin a fat bammer
When out of the blue the phone rang for the LOVE DOCTOR
It was MOLLY, she back from the States
HAWAII'S FINEST was gon' pick me up about eight
I said where we goin? she said she wanted to blaze some green
And after that hook up wit' JANE and check out the Rave scene
I said cool in no time she was at my spot
8pm on the dot, walked in lookin Hot
She gave me a kiss on the cheeks
And cruised in her LAMBORGHINI way above the LEGAL SPEED
Valet parked the car all eyes on she and me
Tipped the fool, skipped the queue, walked through the VIP
Introduced me to the bouncer RACEHORSE CHARLIE
He let us in and said have fun with DIRTY MOLLY
MOLLY took my hands and tried to kiss me on the lips
I said chill MAMA COCA take it easy I ain't about to trip....singin..

Chorus

Verse 3(Malique)
The club was slammin', no SAMS or JAKES to make the party stop
Guys were chewin' gums and the gurlies were sucking lolipops
I chose not to pay attention mind my own bnez
On some BOOTY JUICE tonight no time for fancy drinks or Guinness
Hit the dancefloor dirty dance with PINKLADY
Tongue kissed me once and twenty minutes later went crazy
She musta used the LOVE POTION NUMBER 9 or something
Baby struck my heart wit' sudden love and plus it kept me bumpin'
I started gettin' funny, LOVE HUGgin' everybody
Pinky pulled me to her gave another kiss and I'm like hooooo
I started seein' angels in thongs and Cupid with a poison arrow
Aimin' at me right behind a cloud of YAY YO
That's when I saw MOLLY goddamn I miss her
My summer fling last year but never really kissed her
She all in pink too, I winked and then she winked too
Excused myself from PINKLADY one and went to pink two
Kissed her twice not once felt like a pimp foo
Four kisses, two pinkladies now don't you think it's coo?
I think it ain't a BAD TRIP after all comin
Ish I'm startina see a bunch of little midgets hummin'
Ring around the ROSES and have an overdose
A TISSUE, a TISSUE and we all fall down

Chorus

kinda confused with the ambience, everybody sippin' Evian
No sign of Chardonay, Moet or Perignon
That's when I saw my man layin' on the ground
No more black in the eye ose bleeding made no sound
I slapped him around, I shouted in his ear
The **** you've been messin' with?
Hey get some help in here
What chall doin'? gimme a hand people
Hang in there man..we gon' get you to a hospital
My man's dying gotta act quick
Carried him to the car saw PINKLADY and I felt sick
I prayed to god let my potna live please...

Chorus



",Pink Lady,2001
Too Phat,"(Malique)
Remember back in the time when it was all about the simplest rhymes
Way before Malique be kickin' the the wickedest flows and ticklish lines
But hey it's a little bit changed now, it's getting more strange now
I'm feelin' the pain and sick of the dirty games and sick of the flirty dames now
I'm sick of them kekos who kickin' their simile so similar to the mista
I'm sick of them people that takin' advantage now is you diggin' the picture
Slick with the raps I'm bringing, I'm killin' any cats in Sing Sing
Your cat wanna battle me? Bring him in the ring ring
And see this killa be sting him

(Reefa)
Wanna battle me dribblin'
Gonna be laughin' at you like you be ticklin'
While I be goin' fast you be tricklin'
Doze off like a dose of penicillin
And even though you be figurin wit the flow you deliverin'
In a bose speaker bein' in
For this ear to be listenin'
Keep your head up for a dissin', I'm good like finger lickin',
Wanna test the best and get yourself in a mess
While you kickin' a dress
I'll be up in the press
Never settle for less
While you feelin', depressed with a stick in your chest
So bring it on, and lay it down
And now you know I get around
And while you kickin' it
I'll be the fella in the back puffin' under breath lickin' it

(Mizz Nina)
Get ready for the attack 'cause look who's back
Mizz Nina comin' through with the crew and Too Phat
Have you ever seen a hot be-girl emcee.
I bust rhymes with mad style
Positions, baby freeze
So please acknowledge the fact that I'm the equal in this hip hop sequel
Don't be judgin' on my physicals
I swallow you and your crew like small raisins
Whether sober or under intense intoxication
What you facin' are nights full of frustration
It's amazing how I always keep my rap blazin'
Hot like cajun, witness the chicks assassination
It's evident, believe my hip hop dedication
This highness be with wisdom, touchin' upon the throne
Furious intensity bestowed upon my microphone
Lyrical fitness, the impact like a hitlist
Keep your s***list and won't stop till I'm finished, what?

(Noreen)
Your whole style feminine
Sickin' when you spittin em
No more fans be diggin em
Cause I be the one who addictin' em
Sugar make you high like I'm lemon gin
Grillin' any man like I'm Eminem
Who's that next chump? Bring em in
I'll stomp on him wit' ma Timbalands
Y'all know I ain't no fairy yo, some might think I' a scary ho
Mind full of war scenarios, Noreen remain imperial

(Joe)
My dribblin' don't impress you
But would you be depressed,
If I address your female siblin'
With my ticklin' too, and the figidy freakin fools
Swing my diggity dingaling from Petaling too Timbuktu
And got me impromptu freestylin' spits blow you to bits
Turn your fans into my fanatics
Jizzow addicts we'z a force to be reckoned with
Now don't you know
I can pull it off slow
But then again I could be droppin jams
Advertising bpm


(Saint)
No more time to be silent , it's time to get violent
Cause you know here I come with the bomb and it's pumpin'
So best beware don't sit down and just stare
Pump it up in the air when you know we are there
Get it up and down comin' to you straight from the underground
Buck buck pow it's the sound of the shallow streets of my hood
And it's makin' me frown
Steadily standin' me, feelin' me, backin' me, bring it on to the top
Better just makin it real so you can feel the beat don't make you drop
Get your groove on, put your strap on
Don't keep me waiting too long
Cause I'm a blow it off

(Sam)
Feel ma' heat when I'm home alone
Couldn't keep me asleep gotta sleep till dawn
Shall I stick with me click
Might get rid of the heat so I sit on
My seat 'fore I slip or get prick on my feet makes me sick
As I peeped out the street, got a tip for the treat
Better hit down the beat start to lead on this song
Couldn't keep me home
Close up the wind blow
Get in the car and close up the window lookin' in far and
Ya'll better be holler me for battle as I rebel against the devil
Friends form the past
Enemy who dares to stop on my chest go ahead
Be my guest



",Wanna Battle?,2001
Too Phat,"(Malique)
Tell me what you want boo, now it`s gettin' pretty confusing
Go on cry for all I care, ain't ish I'm losin'
I thought your friends warned you this bound to happen
And now they laughin' cause back then you was no rap fan
Until you read about me in the paper and the mags
And daily on the radio until you got the wax
Some mere infatuation, until you got to check me out in person
First sight of me causing exhilaration
You love the way I do my cap and how I move the crowd
The funny way I hold the mic it kind make you smile
So that the kid that got mo chickss than Kentucky ay
You tried your luck hoppin' it's one of your yer lucky days
Snuck to the backstage I said relax ay
No need to panic I'll sign anything you ask me babe
Flashed your thighs wouldn't settle for less
And left my crib the same night with autographs on your chest,for real

(Chorus A-Camelia)
If you want to party baby know that I will be there by your side
Treat me like a lady I'll be yours tonight the felling's all so right
Leave your boo behind while you and I together we'll rock this fantasy
Baby tell me what you want from me

(Joe)
It'sall butter baby, now lemme show your man how real a playatreat a lady
Forget the fool the situation lookin' pretty shady
Now chillin it daisy keep it proper
Rerlax your mind and soul and get down with this hip hopper
Pimp poppa, Jzoe is what they used to call me cookie
And when it comes to lovin' yo you know I ain't rookie
I love your style and profile, the way you dancin'
Now skoo the puppy love it's time real romancin'
I'll make breakfast in bed, I'll lift the toilet seat
Your man harassin' you, his gass and plus he gettin' beat up
Actin' all hostile, you don't need that love child
Press the speed dial, and holler at me on the mobile
And come to my crib and make it happen
Ain't no confusion, just chillli and relaxin'
My love ain't temporary, the type of story
We gon' be tellin' our children hen we forty...

(Chorus be	-Camelia)
Anytime you want me boy just ask me know that I am by your side
All these fellings I have inside my heart no I can never hide
Tell me what you know that I would try to live your fantasy
Baby tell me what you want from me

(Malique)
It was just a night thang, yeah sure wasn't the right thang
I never thought of all the drama that it might bring
A playa straight chillin' until I heard that you be catchin' feelings
Sick of your grillin' when you see me illin'
And kneelin' you beggin' for rendezvous ang stuff
That ish ain;t gon' happen sil a 'gac and go loosen up
Flings a fling fling, love is love love
I'm through with you boo, enuff is nuff nuff
You got your man I got my own girlfriend
A couple of flirt friends so I don't need hoe fans, bub
My shorty's back so quit calli' my celly
And if you miss me daily, there's a vide on the tele, yeah...

(Joe)
I like the way you rock your prada, jock escade
You lookin' hotter by the minute honey come to poppa
I love the way you always smellin' nice
Your eyes mesmerize, make me memorize
Them features of your face girl, full of grace girl
You got taste, lemme embrace and then race you to bed girl
Won't close my eyes till I kiss you goodnight
Let me hold you tight you know it's gon' be aight and butter

Too Phat,"Verse 1 (Joe Flizzow)
I'm always tellin' my moms and pops not to worry to much
They always tellin' me to slow down and not to party to much
Sometimes I be like hey, now why ya'll folks buggin?
I'm makin a decent livin' I ain't slangin' or thuggin'
At first I didn't understannd though I was man enough
Frontin' like I'm to tough to be sharing love
Used to take em for granted, including my two little brothers
Treat my home like a hotel and ignoring my mother
But now I realised that I can't live without em
Take away my money, honeys aiyo even the stardom
But can never take away my love for my blood (whut)
My big brother Farez doin' sit ups to loose his gut
Iman wanna emcee and spin records at the same time
While Ash wana be a rockstar, you doin fine
Keep ya head up all the time know I'm feelin for you
And always keep it real whatever ya'll do...ONE LOVE

Chorus 2x
You are my sunshine, you are my rainbow
After the rain has gone

I spread love to all my peeps that help me make it happen
Ain't talkin' 'bout the fools I knew after I started rappin'
I'm talkin''bout the folks from back then when I was wack
Friends and fam that kept me steady laugh when I was steady slackin'
Y'all usta call me a different name, and yo it's still the same
Ain't nothing changed, y'all never took advantage of my fame
I got y'all free tickets to shows, y'all never asked for it
But still y'all pay and stand in backrows and see me mash for it
Mom and dad y'all still cuttin' those paper interviews
Don't see you daily but trust me daily I think of you
I know I promised to be a lawyer in a court suin'
I'm sorry now but thanks for bein' proud of what I'm doin'
It's impossible to spit love in 16 bars
So imma cut this short just to let you know who you are
Mom and dad, bro, sis and Tim, just know I love you
Wish y'all were here so I could just breakdown while I hug you, ONE.

Chorus



",You,2001
Too Phat,"( Chorus - Lil' Marissa )

Hey everybody stomp your feet and move your body
Just feel the beat inside you when you clap along

(Malique)

Allow me to complain now, a llotta thangs done changed now
Livin' the fast lane, I'm tourin' in planes now
And all the spots at cities that we go, we glow
Snaps and autographs after each show
We blowin' them heads until they brain seen
We off the hook this year but yo we came clean
My main dream ain't a dream to make it mainstream
To steady gain cream and make ya dame scream
Aight then, then maybe I should quit writin'
Too many starin' eyeballs have got a kid frightened
But why in the world, should I even pay attention
To lil' suckers who ain't even worth a mention ?
So Imma keep my head up, Imma stand strong
And stay creative in providing my fans songs
You dance on, while I rap to this
Let's celebrate the platinum plaque and clap to this, c'mon!

( Chorus )

(Joe)

Ever since I was a kid I just wanted to sing
Pursued my dreams and kept doing my thang
Is we rap stars now? Yo I don't know
Am I having a ball now ? You best believe so
Always wanted to be able to kick it at live shows
Rip mics in studios and meet some hot Ooooâ?¦..oh oh oh oh
Now we got platinum plaque, we got gold award and hits back to back
Never thought that rap could put us on the map
People rush and get our CDs off the rack
This 'ish be off the hook now imma telling you done
All a playa like me wanna do is have some fun
And make you bounce to this and make you clap to this
Wave your hands hard till you snap your wrist
Now what this really is ?
Now what we all about ?
Too Phat Baby make you scream and shout, c'mon !

( Chorus )

( Malique )

I understand, that fame has a price now
It's goin' too high it's gotta get sliced down
A lotta people say I'm no longer nice now
Ain't nuttin' changed though I'm still eatin' rice , clown

( Joe )

Yeah man, now you know what I feel yo
People front and brown nose just to get near ya
And people think since we got a string of hits
We've gone soft I ain't slowed down one bit

( Malique )

Flip the script in spilt secs, punk *** it's hard now
Down wit' spittin' ish that'll rip me off the charts now
A schizo kid who switch fast like a shinkansen
Bust' on you punk *** marks for talking nonsense
Rush in your crib fast style is so hardcore
Snatch your ma's bra then upper cut your pa's jaw
I sit you down to get familiar with this style
And once I see smiles I gotta bust you' wit a pisstyleâ?¦

( Joe )

Alotta cats wanna spit but can't even recite poems
They lost star trekkin' back in time through twilight zone
Want a piece of me I pull your hair back like combs
Be hiting your chest plates and shattering your dome
Your words ain't wise you trying too hard to be an intellect
Your side ain't sick you ### punks are hypochondriacs
Claimin' undreground MCs, You be dumb found Mcs
And flee when you zunk wit my steez

( Chorus )



",Clap to This,2004
Too Phat,"When it comes to raps, I'm similar to the thriller in manila 
Who drop a double album with no album filler 
Who back into reality, mentality is scrilla 
Killa verbal gigolo the ladies mind sex fulfiller 
(On and on) is how we do this 
I'm peacin' like a Buddhist and attracting more heads than nudists 
And Chris Wallace influence, spittin' knowledge with coolants 
(Remember Dallas 63?) he?s back now, let's do this 

(Aha) 
JFK when I come through son 
Roofs retracted hunnies run to son 
(Aha) 
Raps is shogun lurking moving in the dark 
Stay the dopest on lighting doobies in the park 
(Aha) 
Yeah I gets you lifted 
You know the windows tinted in the back sweat we could kick it 
(Aha) 
And when the shit is lighted 
You know it feels terrific cos we hotter than a minute, on and on?

Heard your first single, now who soundin' like a b***h here? 
You stay unnoticed like a bad landmark 
I stand out like an albino at a million man march, huh 
If you don't understand press rewind

Exactly how I?m digging how ya butt cheek sways

We could do it three way, on and on? 

[Chorus] 
 
On and on and, 1,2?s and phat jams 
I'm guilty of puttin' 34's on black rims 
Back then, a 3 for 10s with black vans 
Now roll in black tims with mens in black vans 
(That's hot) 
Sorry it's just the lil' dragon in me 
I'm blazin' man this vocal booth should get a chimney 
(That's hot) 
Like your mothers fried rice, right from the pan 
It's time to add a lil' spice right from the man 
That's hot... 
 
(So sexy) 
Yeah I see them hotties, from the VIP balcony with a view of these hotties 
(So sexy) 
Sit wit a few of these hotties, 
I'm thinking of jetting soon and getting a room with these hotties 
(So sexy)

The only crew capable of
Taking this track
To critical mass
We got you open
Off the lines

Long rage we snipe
Scoping up close
With mic cords choking
Deliver the final blow
The rhyming prose
With melted wax vinyl flows
Oh,its time to go

",Phat Family Anthem,2007
Too Short,"Newscaster: In the news tonight rap star Mack 10 releases his second
solo album titled ""Based On A True Story,"" and according to reliable
sources Ha, he laughs in the face of the sophomore jinx. After the 
release of Westside Connection and Mack's new record, gangster rap
seems to be at an all time high.

Verse 1
Either the thrill of victory or the agony of defeat
you either got ends or struggle to make ends meet
You can either turn square or keep the mind of a rebel
some uppity livin' good some faced with death in the ghetto
I'm a product of the streets so I vow to never slip
so I trust no one and keep a P. Coltrane on my hip
I always paid attention while my O.G's was teachin'
Rule number one if it's on blast the first nigga reachin'
either death or the pen' shit I had to do better
It was a must I moved on and now I'm all about cheddar
a young entrepreneur I rather slang than bang
now girls be like you go Mack 10 baby do yo thang
So I continue to get down and I keep writin' rhymes
and I parlay every dollar to flip at least a hundred times
So keep your game tight and it's all fame and glory
and everything I recite's Based On A True Story

Chorus 
You can feel nigga
It's based on a true story
You know it's real nigga
Based on a true story

Verse 2
The year 1986 is when it all started
now eleven years later we still rough and cold hearted
and as the saga continues I ride the wave like a Sea Doo
not to knock hip hop but gangsta rap is what we do
Niggas on they first album
already sold a mil'
So before you knock our style
at least admit that it's real
It's all sex drugs and violence
so you pretend you ain't checkin'
You mean to tell me people
really ain't dyin' every second
Now y'all made the rules
niggas can say what they choose
So if you gone ban Gangsta rap
then you got to ban the news
That means no weather report
no Waco and the bad reverand
No channel 4 channel 7 and no film at eleven
With no high school diplomas we became millionaires
media mad 'cause we winning and we really playin' fair
So keep your game tight and it's all fame and glory
and everything I recite's Based On A True Story

Chorus

Verse 3
I crumble green on a magazine
ready to roll a joint
damn in this billboard
I'm number one with a hollow point
It was a rough road ahead
but for my kids I gotta pave it
so I twist one shake the weed out
close the book up and save it
'Cause my son li'l Mack
might grow up and have a crew
and he can show all his homies
this what my daddy used to do
See I was raised around gangstas
and grindas since a youth
so the shit I rap abouts like 99% truth
With dedicated fans from bebe kids
to bambinos and niggas that's CEO's
before they reach they three O's
Maneuver through the corporate world
makin' moves to take ours
Rolling big German luxury and Italian sports cars
so watch what you do 'cause you know we playa hated
and everytime it's a homicide they call it gang related
So keep your game tight and it's all fame and glory
and everything I recite's Based On A True Story

Chorus (2X)

Too $hort talking: Say Mack baby, it's yo pa'tna $hort dog man.
You know I got yo back boy. You know a nigga like me I just left
the Ferrarri dealer man. I ain't go lie I know you ridin' rims.
But the problem is, it's a lot of mothafuckas out there that think we
rappers man. That think we just sit at home and make this up at
our momma's house. I hate to tell y'all man some of us are real playas
real ballers biitch.",Based on a True Story,1997
Too Short,"[Intro:]
And it don't stop to the beat, baby
Funky Fresh on the microphone
One time for your mind, beeyatch (Beeyatch)
Short Dogg's in the motherfuckin house
doin what we always do, a stack
(Gettin money) Gettin money (Gettin money)
Chorus: Too $hort, (Slink Capone)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(Fuck a secret indictment, all I do is write shit)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(You got the wrong rappers, nigga you better tell em!!)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(Tell em Short, tell em!!!)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(OOOOOHHHHH!!!!!)

[Verse One:]
You broke the law, and you got caught
Got a good lawyer, case is bein fought
Life is full of choices, make em at the crossroads
If you had five, you already lost four
Straight apprehended, handcuffed and can't stand it
Don't want to go to jail but you was caught redhanded
A felony, strike number two
Federal Agents like, ""What you want to do?""
Make a choice, so you start to think back
Short Dogg was a nigga that always rapped
Half my life ago, didn't sell no dope
I sold dope fiend music for your stereo
Sittin at the crossroads in '84
I knew hella motherfuckers that was slangin coke
Use to tell my homeboys, front me a sack
Postin me at the dopehouse dumpin the crack
My niggas wouldn't do it, I love em for that
'cause now I still rap and get paid to gat
Since '87, that's how the shit comes
We made two hundred thousand in six months
Sellin tapes not cakes, cheques kept comin
Fuck buyin *?boats?*, niggas makin hundreds
Legit, you think I'm stupid, bitch
I bought a studio so I can do this shit
Chorus: Too $hort, (Slink Capone)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(You got it twisted, Bridget
 Why pressin charges when I'm depressin hard and shit)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(Run tell em, tell em Short, tell em)

[Verse Two:]
I used to sell weed in high school, smoked the profit
I never sold *?company due?*, I can't knock it
'cause the inner city public school system is fucked
Go to class all day, you ain't gettin enough
So at 3:15 it's time to put in work
Buy you some dope and go hit the turf
Ain't no scholarship, no rap contract
but a nigga get paid sellin hop and crack
I got lucky, it's not a get-rich scheme
I've been sellin rap tapes since I was 15
I told the Oakland police, too many times
I make a lot of money doin pimp rhymes
I never sell drugs to jeopardise my freedom
You never could make me realise I need em
I went from hundreds, to hundreds to thousands, to millions
I know what police want, I feel em
I'm always ballin right there in the hype
Instantly, dope dealer stereotype
but shit is serious, I know I never sold drugs
so why these motherfuckers tryin ta roll me up?
And smoke me, why? No one knows
The only thing I did wrong was fuck all ya hoes
I don't smoke coke blunts and sho' don't sell em
Call the FBI, somebody please tell em



[Chorus:Too $hort, (Slink Capone)]
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(All you motherfuckers is lookin at us rock jewelery and shit
 That's all you are)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(Somebody better tell em we got receipts)

[Verse Three:]
Rap is brand new, not long ago
Made a billion dollars last year round the globe
Now all the little kids can't let it go
to the new millennium with a brand new flow
Too $hort baby straight from the O
If you're like me, you're tryin ta make some doe
Roll to the spot and try ta break a hoe
Pimp her real hard and then take it slow
When I rap to a bitch, I'm a pro
I spit this game like never befo'
Grab the microphone and always rock the show
then I grab me a freak, tell her ""Keep it on the low""
If I take her to my house she won't say no
I burn rubber with the bitch in my fo'-fifty-fo'
California niggas drop the top and roll
Stare up at the mountains, won't see no snow
I go coast to coast smokin indo
If my bitch actin up, I fuck her friend so
don't investigate me for sellin dope
If you see me rollin clean through the ghetto
I'm probably on my way to the studio
Probably playin somethin loud on the stereo
Short Dogg, don't forget the funk motto:
'Free your mind and your ass will follow'

[Chorus:Too $hort, (Slink Capone)]
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(We're up why'all in this motherfuckin holdin tank for hidin snitch ass
niggas)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(Nigga, I was promoted a tour of Kentucky nigga, and D.C.)

[Outro: Slink Capone]
Pop this shit, be outta state, niggas is hella fake
Moms ain't mess with the motherfuckin phone
My girl, she's fuckin up, god damn!
Nigga you better stop all that motherfuckin snitchin
Tell them motherfuckers we ain't runnin no motherfuckin coke factory
Tell em, tell em!! TELL EM!!!
YOU BETTER TELL EM!!!!

Too Short,"I got a problem with this punk ass bitch I know 
Ol' no good skanlezz switch out ho 
An untrustworthy bitch like delilah 
Only thing she good for is puttin' dick inside her mother fuckin' face 
Bitch got some good neck 
But the little trick need to learn some respect 
She made me beat her ass. 
Take a nigga out this game. 
See I don't beat my hoes cause all my hoes is payin' 
But this one act like she don't understand 
You is the bitch, me, I'm the man 
Remember dat shit, then learn to submit 
And that when you stop gettin' your funky ass kicked little hard headed 
trick 
See a nigga know about ya 
And I know a dollar bill 'll bring tha ho outcha 
Then you got the nerve to claim you better than the rest of my hoes 
When you ain't even in the rankin' of the best of my hoes

Cause this players gotta keep a fat knock 

I'm like JD Walker 
Pimp hat to tha right smooth talker 
Bitches workin' all night like a stalker 
Gettin' every last nickel dime and quarter 
Pimpin' ain't hardly nuthin' new to me 
Used to be a little kid watchin' movies 
I knew what I wanted in life, about nine or ten hoes 
I ain't want no wife 
I used to walk real cool like my leg was broke 
And I still do, now I get paid from hoes, Beeitch 
'cause this East side nigga don't care

And now I got a lot 'o women

Got these niggas got they nut up for some cut ups 
So wut up all I want to do is get this money witcha 
I'm dead serious, I ain't tryin' to be funny witcha

When I see you with some change you just bring it to me 
See you can come up in this game 
And you can get hurt ho 
When you in public just remember who you work for 
Cause all them tight ? cats gonna come try to holla

I can tell she a pro. She must have had a lot of practice
Kept her back on the mattress. Either I'm fuckin her good, or she's a damn good actress

You know you wasn't raised like that
You need to hit a club or something
You going out, Keyshia

So while you going out having your fun, I should sit here waiting for you
All this time I've invested in you baby,
Now you kicking yo dubs and making yo runs and popping yo drank and having your fun
But see its OK, cause what goes around comes around and its always been that way

Didn't I tell ya I was gonna be the one
Be the one and when its all done boy
She cant love you like I do
Didn't I tell ya boy
Didn't I tell you, didn't I tell you, didn't I tell you
Didn't I tell ya boy

So now the sun coming at ya won't change, but I ain't sitting out there crying and shit
So while you rolling out doing yo thing, I be popping my bottles,
Rolling on dubs, hanging with my girls, I be having my fun
Cause I don't deserve all the games you play
Now you coming back this way

Didn't I tell ya I was gonna be the one
Be the one and when its all done boy
She cant love you like I do
Didn't I tell ya boy
Didn't I tell you, didn't I tell you, didn't I tell you

But she could never be me and ya know it baby (she got the game)
The proof is in the putting ain't no way to hide it
Didn't I tell ya boy (I know she told you)

You think you got her stuck you must be smoking
She got a lot of money too she ain't no joke man
We raised her good she got the game before the fame
You should call, ain't nothing changed you know her name
See her riding something clean looking hella fly
I know you first should change your mind I'm bout to tell ya why
She ain't staying at the house she goin out
To some exclusive shit, that you don't know about

The sun's coming up we started at four
I switch so much game, it's hard to absorb
And everything you believe she hates, like pimping, she appreciates

See you a hot mess with the booty and thang thang
Swinging in the club when you drinking that drink drink
Smoke in the air chilling all in the zone
Fuck me on the dance floor with my clothes on
Too short ah, imagine that
She threw me the pussy, I threw the dick right back
See I just wanna hit it and stick it in

Can't be broke, selling coke
Fat ropes, shattered hopes
Fresh cars and all that dope
Baseheads keep the trade alive
Nobody know about a 9 to 5
Everybody's just trying to survive
You need a gun, can't use those knives
You got a bullet? Well just pull it
And if you trip, get pistol-whipped
By a psycho maniac sick in his head
want to be a gangster, now he's dead
His brother took over, ain't no sweat
Bought a new drop-top white Corvette
Now he's buying keys, making G's
And all the girls say ""Won't you please
Take me"" In the City of Dope

See I'm hard as hell, no ghetto tale
You play a gun, but the game is real
You want to stop my money, how?
You keep smoking, I'm selling out
It's called the City of Dope, might be your town
Get a piece of the rock, turn your life around
So cool, don't even trip
You got the sack, get on the tip
A resident in the City of Dope
And every day I'm selling coke
I'm never broke, I don't smoke
I sold a rock and made you have a stroke
Pay cold cash you know, I won't need Bruno
I'll hit you with my gat and then I won't come back
Like ym peanut butter top with the candy paint
All the high school tenders drop down and faint

Life in a coke town, heard it before
Think it's all been said, but it's so much more
It's like midnight, slanging rock
Task force just hit the block
Time to make a move, the spot got hot
You chase a cop, homeboy why not?
She lit the match and light the crack
Ain't giving no bitches no kind of slack
Or if you're playing the game, you're thinking the same
Goddamn that rock cocaine
I've seen a lot of my friends go off that pipe
And every night smoke coke that's white
So when you get up, man, there you go
You and that pipe just dogging the hoes
In the City of Dope, and the story goes
Want to be like free, breaking millions of loaves
In the City of Dope, where the color is gold
On your neck, and your fingers, and your brand new Rolls
Enough said, but my rap won't end
It's on a one way trip to San Quinten
Like you my friend, ain't nothing new
You want to grind that boat til it's way past two
You say it's not easy, that you're so hard
Sporting gold tone Z's, not credit cards
Got clout turn 'em out, you got bitches
You say you're not fake, but I'm telling you this is
The City of Dope, might be your world
Get a beeper homeboy and just sell that girl
I'm from the town called ""The City of Dope""
It couldn't be saved by John the Pope
So go on, live your life of crime
The beat'll keep beating while I say my rhyme
In the City of Dope

Smoking weed, rolling 'em fat
You wonder where the boy learned to act like that
Hey was raised in the ghetto and felt the need
To roll a fat joint and smoke that weed
But the tale goes on and years went by
Another drug came and the boy got high
Ever since that day, he just wasn't the same
Where I come from, we call it ""rock cocaine""
Where you come from, you might call it ""crack""
But wherever he went, you see he never came back
I tried to tell the motherfucker, but he don't know
I say to coke, ""Pimp that ho""
I don't live in a mansion but I drive a Benz
Cut to the turf and collect my ends
Say ""Look here freak, kick me down
I don't have time to talk right now""
Got to go to, my next hoe
And get kicked down, a little more
Left right left, down the street
Getting paid freak by freak
There you see me, there you don't
You wonder will I, or won't
Is it yes, is it no?
But does it really matter you freaky hoe?

Turn up the radio and drop the top
I see you look so good, and you're so fine
Young tender, would you be mine
I get you in my car, drive you to my house
'Cause I'm a mack, I cold turn you out
I wont ask, and I sure won't beg
Reach right over and rub your leg
I let my hand slide between your miniskirt
Slip a finger in your panties, straight go to work
What time is it? Don't watch the clock
Lay back baby doll and I'll rock the cock
Funky Fresh I am, and I always can, Freak Nasty
I'm the man
I take you out to the finest restaurant
Buy you any damn thing that you want
You want flowers, I'll buy your ass a rose
But later on you're coming out them panyhose
You want gold? Girl what's next?
It's me and you, doing the sex
So now you know I'm just a freak
Give it up baby, I can't wait two weeks
I want it all, don't say I won't
Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't

Nigga please, you provoke no feeling
You must of forgot, the girls of whom you're dealing
We haven't the urge, to get busy
Like those dizzy Lizys, who used to dance for you, you're through
I can't put it more blunt, your vocab is restricted
You're addicted, to the words you inflicted
Time after time, line after line
Talking bout the bitches that are on your mind
Do they call you $hort because of your height or your width?
Diss me boy, I'll hang your balls from a cliff
Wrapped around a slinky, you're a dinky
It's an easy task, to the corner 'cause the curb didn't want your ass
Your name is yuck mouth, you don't brush
Gotta cover your mouth like this
They call you yuck mouth
You refuse to brush, no sweetheart you can keep that kiss
You're a freak with no tail
You have no ass, class
You can't pass, you're simply trash
You're a typical nigga, the kind you don't take home
This is Entyce and Barbie from the Danger Zone
Like a short dog that carries fleas
You make my ass itch, twitch
Don't you wish you could scratch it
And grab it like you want it
The name fits 'cause you're all up on it

Get mad if you want, I won't front
When it's time to hump, won't be no punk
Roll your ass over and tap the butt
Too $hort baby all in them guts
I'm not your ABC, from the alphabet
Every letter I'll write'll get your pussy wet
It's just a freaky note, from me to you
At the bottom I signed it Playboy II
I'm a player, bitch, I thought you knew
Like every other nigga in my crew
I bump hoes, now it's your turn
Tell me young tender when will you learn
I cold mack like pimps you know
Won't sell you dope or sell you blow
Just your average everyday straight bump up bitch
My gold rings come from spitz
Look baby, You know what I want
You're acting like it's that time of the month
Are you bleeding? Can't think about sex?
Irritated by your Kotex?
We don't need to kiss, we don't have to fuck
I'll pull out my dick bitch, you can suck
Now here, don't say I won't
Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't

Punk I'm not a tease, I'm not a skeezer
And most definately, not a dick pleaser
You're dreaming, and scheaming, and fiending for my lust
You don't have enough, for you I feel disgust
Wait, small things I hate
For goodness sakes, if I wanted someone small I would masturbate
I'm not talking 'bout your height, weight, or what you dream
When I say too short, you know what I mean
You see, I need man, not a boy to approach me
Your lame game, really insults me
Your name is Too $hort, or shall I say too skinny
If size were money honey, you wouldn't have a penny
Little boy, you're not a player
I'm your savior
To try to get at me shows audacious behavior
I've got to sit on my feet to come down to your level
Your mother should have hung you, from her umbilical cord
If she would have known your mission
Okay little boy, here's a proposition
You wanna bit of danger, step into my zone
You call yourself a dogg, thatz how I'll send you home
With your tail between your legs, screeching and whining
Dare to say you got some? Nigga please you're lying
'Cause to fight the feeling, there would have to be one
And mathmatically, me plus you equals none

I am the rapper that they call 4-tay
I'm gon tell you like my homie Short Dogg would say
Hoes in the world, trying to play it sweet
Knowing damn well that they wanna freak
Some do this for maybe a week
And then it's cool to get up under the sheets
Trying to work that thang, but she said no
That's about as far as it's going to go
So I toss and turn, to make it loose
Finally she feels the act right juice
Some of you hoes say, oh that's nasty
Back of your coat say sweet and sassy
24 deep, that's how you sleep
Undercover freak every day of the week
You see some of you freaks just need to quit it
Playing that role like you ain't with it
The rest of you freaks just won't admit it
Especially when you know just who can get it
Ain't nobody tripping cuz I know I'm right
You could be black or you could be white
For a black girl it really don't take too long
But a white girl's always tryin to turn ya on
With a little squeze, but it's just a tease
Give her some time, she'll be on her knees
Then I'll pick her up, so I can work the butt
Baby, I just wanna try to bust a nut
But don't get me wrong, cause you started it all
Coming to my house in a camisole
But when it's time for me to shove
Then you front on all that love
First you said that I deserve it
Now you fight, don't want to serve it
Gave it some time, so make up your mind
Don't fight the feeling, it's time to unwind
You was talking 'bout you gunna give my some
But I'm Rappin 4 Tay it don't make me none

Yeah man, the little hoes got ill
So now it's time to get way too real
I know they never have some real dick
They need to quit talking that childish shit
You wanna rank ho
Go get your bank ho
My little dick'll have you screaming no
Because when it comes to sex, you don't know what's up
You're still playing that finger fuck
See I'm a grown man
I bust some young cock out
I like big butts, not big mouths
I know some little girls'll break you down in bed
Pull your drawers down, give you some head
But little girl, you wanna have some fun
You better go to magic mountain cuz your way too young
So at this point, I really can't say shit
Ain't dropping no lines, I'll just call you a bitch

Too Short,"I was told not long ago
Too $hort don't stop that rap
Now every time I grab the mic
I rock you just like that
8 years ago when I started to rap
I use to sell tapes everywhere
It was me and my homeboy Freddy B, y'all
Kickin' it like big players
Everybody loved my raps like 100 dollar bills
I rocked house parties on 98th
Even rocked in the 6-9 vill
Might find me on the mic at Hot Lips house
Or at the Eastbay Dragon spot
All the 85th boys with their hand in the air
Screamin' Too $hort just don't stop!
Like Royal Park, like Plymouth Rock
First street and Sunnyside
Like Sobrante Park and Brookefield
East Oakland, yeah, that's right
5 years ago I continued to rock
And if you haven't yet heard my name
It was all in the papers, on the evening news
I was stone cold in the game
Around that time a friend of mine
My homeboy Lionel B hooked me up like this, y'all
On the stage just rockin' the beat
Some say I have a dirty mind
Sometimes that might be true
But these are just some dirty times
I ain't trippin' on you

I ain't trippin', keep on talkin'
You think i'm smokin' that pipe
I got money, homeboy
I even got some of your future wifes
Well, my story goes like this, man
I smooth went out on wax
Singin' Girl, that's Your Life
Female Funk and Shortrapp
Silky D worked the beat kicked me cold cash
I was ridin' the bus one day
Next day I was on the gas
Everybody loved Too $hort
Rollin' down the strip
Then one day just like that
Homeboy jumped on my tip
You started spreadin' rumors, man
Said you saw me rappin' in jail
No, I never came down to the flatlands
I was chillin' with the homies on the hill
I ain't trippin' but the word went out
Sir Too $hort was through
Can't really say where it all began
So i'ma blamin' it all on you
Everybody use to say
Too $hort don't stop that rap!
Now every time you see my face
You say i'm smokin' crack
Oakland, California, I heard it all before
I'm makin' big bank now, rockin' the crowd
I ain't trippin' no more

Now I'm back on top again
I still don't stop that rap
Every time I grab the mic
My bankroll's gettin' fat
Freaky Tales took care of that
You know I'm comin' up
Cause every time you see my face
I'm rollin' all so tough
When I made the cut, the-he-he Freaky Tales
I started picturin' this
I named my album Born To Mack
With the cleaniest raps and beats
Everythin' was kickin' in
Me and Ran kept cashin' checks
Next thing I know there you go
Guess who's on my tip?
You said I just got out of jail
Jumped right back on that pipe
Your sister's boyfriend told you, man
I'm smokin' every night
Then you came to my show
And stood there so damn bold
You said Too $hort, man, you smoking'
And i'm standin' here dreamin' gold
I ain't trippin' no more
Really ain't worth my time
So to squashed it off I kicked on back
And wrote you all the rhyme
Benzes rollin', Beemers jettin'
And Caddies keep on dippin'
You keep on talkin' all that crap
I ain't trippin'",I Ain't Trippin',1988
Too Short,"I remember how it all began
I used to sing dirty raps to my East Side fans
Back then I knew ya couldn't stop this rap
No M.C. could rock like that
Then the new style came, the bass got deeper
Ya gave up the mike and bought you a beeper
Do ya wanna rap or sell coke?
Brothers like you ain't never broke
People wanna say it's just my time
Brothers like me had to work for mine
Eight years on the mic and I'm not jokin'
Sir Too Short comin' straight from Oakland
California, home of the rock
Eight woofers in the trunk, beatin' down the block
Short dog, I'm that rappin' man
I said it before and I'll say it again

Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
Too short

Life is to some people unbearable
Committin' suicide and that's terrible
Was it much too much or nothing' big?
If ya live my life, you'd be fightin' to live
Life is to me my main asset
I be doin' all right and keep it just like that
Chill out at the house and pump that bass
I'm tryin' to get rich as I rock the place
Everybody's got that same old dream
To have big money and fancy things
Drive a brand new Benz, keep your bank right here
Never hear me stutter once because I talk real clear
It's on you, homeboy, watcha gonna do?
You can take my advice and start workin', fool
Or you can close your ears and run your mouth
And one day, homeboy, ya soon find out

Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
(Too short)

Life is too short, would you agree?
 
While I'm livin' my life, don't mess with me
It's been a long time, baby, since I first got down
But I still keep makin' these funky sounds
Cause I don't stop rappin', that's my theme
I make a lot of money, do you know what I mean?
Like this, complicated ya must stay up
Ya asked a simple question boy, don't say ""What?""
Ya only live once and ya callin' it hell
Policeman tryin' to take ya to jail
You could give a man time but you don't know
I a matter of time, I'll be runnin' the show
Now another young buck wants to be on top
Makin' big money, slangin' hop
The task force tryin' to peel your cap
Turn around, homeboy, ya better watch your back

Life is too short
Life is

You can take back all the things you give
But ya can't take back the days you live
Life is to some people who've been on earth
Livin' every single day for what it's worth
I live my life just how I please
Satisfy one person I know that's me
Work hard for the things I achieve in life
And never rap fake when I'm on the mic
Cause if a dream is all you got, homeboy
Ya gotta turn that dream into the real McCoy
Not time to waste, just get on that case
Ya can't be down 'cause ya need to taste
A good life livin' like a king on a throne
Gettin' everything ya want
And tryin' to have all your own
Its your life
Don't be stupid though
Cause when ya waste it, you'll know

Too Short,"Pimp the ho

Pimp that ho

It's like Too $hort raps been around a while
I rocked to the beat and got my own style
I'm from the O city, and I said it before
I was born to mack, call me Playboy $hort
You want to get freaky? Look at the time
We could do the nasty, but it's almost nine
My show starts at ten, I got's to go
Like the mack said, homie, pimp the ho
Check it out everybody, if you got two ears
Turn your radio up, Short Gog is here
If the bass ain't kickin', pick up the phone
Dial 911, tell em, turn it on
Bumped a cute young tender in a tight red dress
She had a soft booty, and a real big chest
She said, ""I love you"", said it again
At the motel freaked her and her friends
Like a Too $hort rap, and everybody knows
Like the Mack said, homie, pimp the hoes
Ain't no need in playin' games, none at all
Fakin' like a giant when you're just too small
No need to rush, take your time
To adjust to the changes in my rhyme
To you rappers, tonight's your night
You all jump straight up on your mic
Screamin' ""I'm the best"", but let me see
I make a lotta money, could that be me?
He said, ""Hell no, I'm the king of the rap""
Looked me in my eyes, said, ""Deal with that""
I said, ""Hold on, buddy, don't talk that junk
You drank two 40s, now you must be drunk""
He said, ""Let's battle"", I said ""Go""
Like the Mack said, homie, I pimped the ho
All hail the king, go straight to hell
If your girlfriend's freakin on a freaky tale
Better play your rap and take mine off
Before the bitch gets wet and you're still soft
No need to rush, take your time
To adjust to the changes in my rhyme
I was on the turf, cold chillin' out
When a sucker MC got hit in the mouth
Tryin' to find out if he can hang with me
The boy got hooked on the Dope Fiend Beat
I said, ""Bitch, what are you smokin'?""
It ain't funny, cool, I ain't jokin'
You never shoulda said I was fakin' the place
You wouldn'ta got socked straight in your face
I'm the coldest MC on a microphone
Now the sucker MC's just leave me alone
They might suck on yours, but they can't get mine
Like the Mack said, homie, pimp all the time
I'm not talkin bout hookers in mini-skirts
When you pimp like me, put your mind to work
It's like 24 hoes, better known as tracks
When I grab that mic I spit these raps
I start workin' the hoes, and it just don't stop
It's goin' on till the panties drop
I'm Sir Too $hort, like I said
Bitch can't lick, don't give me head
Had a fresh young tender, won't say her name
It's the same old story, ran the same old game
She can blow more head than a well blows water
The girl won't stop when she get started
Like the freak you married, I had to get with her
Ain't no doubt, Short Dog would get her
I'm a cold player, I can't lie
They call me Playboy $hort, and I told you why
I'm a mack, so get back
I put my tape in the deck in my Cadillac
And as my ride goes on definitely
I speak each word loud as can be
I'm the T-double o, and like I said
If your girlfriend's freakin', I accept all head
Scream out the combination, and I open the lock
Plug in the mic jack, and then rock that cock
Back to back like the Oakland Raiders
In and out like your crossfaders
Makin' people dance all over the floor
Lovin' that rapper named Sir Too $hort
You got my bank, little girl, no time to act silly
I'm dynamite, baby, and my name ain't Willy
Cold as hell, hard to stop
I spit these raps and rock yo block
Hit the city talkin' bout, it's goin' on
And the next thing you know, the whole nation's gone
It's Too $hort on the mic
And I'm spittin' mo' raps than any rapper you like
So all you suckers-worth rappers, you hate my beat
All I gotta say is, don't fuck with me
My game is tight, my bank is made
You can hate big $hort, but I still get paid
You say, ""I can't"", I say you can
Show respect, little boy, when you deal with a man
I saw you laughin when you came in the place
Punk, I start laughin when I spit in your face
See I know how I feel, I should be shut at dawn
But I'm a true MC, I keep rockin on
I won't say I'm best, won't declare I'm bad
I'm just a rappin' motherfucker with a hard-ass rap
Too $hort cold comin' up
Say a rap, homeoby, get the mic out your butt
Be a man if you can, cause it might get worse
You be walkin' round town with a wig and a purse
No tellin' what's next, I don't know
Like the Mack said, homie, pimp the ho

(I'll be good to you
You'll be good to me
Anything you want
Or anything you need
I got my eye on you
And I'm into you
I'll give you all my dough
You just pimp that ho)

I'm never draggin' when I'm rhymin', cause I make a lotta money
I jump in my car, drop it if it's sunny
Doggin' the freaks, and all that shit
Long haired hoes with real big tits
I'm a Eastside player oh yes, I am
Grab the microphone and start makin grands
I take a freak to her room, not a hotel trick
I cold chill out at the Motel Six
I'm ridin' in the car, and I can't be found
I'm the hardest motherfucker rappin' from this town
My name is Sir Too $hort, and if you say 'so what?'
I look you in your eye, and wouldn't give a fuck
I live a California lifestyle, ain't no trip
8 years on the mike, and ain't faked it yet
So when you see me on stage, I won't blow you a kiss
I put my finger in the air and tell you just like this
Say bitch

Dangerous Music and it don't stop to the beat, baby

Bitches on my mind
I can't hold back, now's the time
All you loud-mouth bitches talk too much
And you dick teasin' bitches never fuck
I seen a long-hair bitch, workin' at stitches
Her hair ain't really but two inches
All you bald-head hoes in the Oakland world
Runnin' around town with jheri curls
Nappy head niggas like myself
Get a bald-head and say, ""Go to hell!""
But you's a snake, you's the one
You bald-head bitch, you need a perm
So much game when the homies tough
I make a bitch blow who never sucks
It really ain't life but I just met her
Now I'm sayin', ""Bitch, suck better!""
Fuck you, stupid hoe, tell me just what you know
I came to the party and turned it up
You say, ""Ouh, he's got a dirty mouth!""
But, bitch, I kept talkin' shit
Motherfuck you, damn shit-head bitch
I want a blow job and I'm not kiddin'
Work it in your mouth till your head starts spinnin'
I'm that nigga you'll answer to
If I say, ""Bitch, jump!"", that's what you do
I'm a fast talkin' conman blowin' your mind
Breakin' you and your cousin at the same time
With a dirty rap comin' out my mouth
And you know damn well what I'm talkin' about
I'm the Too $hort, baby, way too cold
So motherfuck you, bitch, goddamn asshole

The dope fiend beat
For all you junkies to just ride

H-E-A-D, I need a doctor just for me
To suck my dick like a vet
To give me head until I sweat
She gotta suck dick
So I can tell all my homies just what she did
She sucked and sucked and she's a bitch to the beat
I'm Too $hort, I said my name is Too $hort and it don't stop
I love you bitches for the blow jobs
I just laugh over and over
When the bitch drinks sperm like it's soda
I straight start aimin', would I miss?
Get back bitch, I wouldn't never kiss
I say she looks so good and she's so big
But, man oh man, that bitch can wimp
If I want to I could rock her
But I can't fuck no-head doctor
Bitches don't know that's Too $hort's tip
You might get G'd if you don't suck dick
But I'm so fresh, I'm so down
I tell you bitches the other way around
If you do me first then I do you
So the game jumps up when the bitch is true
Soon as I come all in her mouth
I smooth get dressed and roll out
I'm Too $hort, baby, fresh fresh again
One MC, one bitch broken
I tell you, baby, playin' just like that
I'm the best of the players to the ice cold rap
And, bitch, you just a bitch
You work fast food and you think you rich
You see, my game don't stop when it's on the one
I love to see you when you work that tongue
Gettin' real busy at the back of the car
Rollin' down the Skyline Boulevard
I say, ""Bitch, what are you smokin'?""
A big fat dick in the big East Oakland
I see my homie, he needs to quit
He was walkin' down the street
With a big fat bitch, maybe I'm wrong
He might get every two weeks that welfare check
Oakland, California, is the city of snakes
Pimps, pussies, players and fakes
The big Oaktown, the city of liars
Fresh store wires and voltaires
A strip, bitches, nasty freaks
My raps, homeboy, with tremendous beats

She's a bitch to the dope fiend beat
All you junkies just ride

Bitches on my mind
I can't hold back, now it's the time
To bust a left nut, right nut, in her jaw
Opened eyes and guess what I saw
Bitches on my mind
Grabbed the microphone and then I started to rhyme
What would life be if it wasn't Too $hort
It be nothin' but rappers from the old New York
But that's not likely and there's no doubt
Bitches like me cause I'm turnin' it out
I'm here, there, everywhere
Sportin' fat gold rope, I'm a motherfuckin' player
Recognize game when it's in your face
As you dip to the beat and you feel the bass
Crook it up loud, would be doin' fine
Pose like a pimp and check my rhyme
Some young tender doesn't like this beat
But a bitch ain't nothin' but a word to me
I can check her, wreck her, or just get paid
Cut to the house and freak my maid
You see, she doesn't speak english but we don't talk
I call her Lucy and she's juicy, makes your eye balls walk
We never hesitate to make good love
She clean up my house and then clean me up
So check it out, you bitches
I tell you a story of rags to riches
So check it out, freak nasty
I know you're fine but you look like Lassie
Bitch, not a long ago I used to hang at the mall
Top floor, baby, all the freaks I called
And if they didn't want to come that ain't shit
I just drop a few lines and then call her bitch

These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well

I met this girl, her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked the ON microphone
When I met Joan, I took her home
She was just like a doggy all on my bone
I met another girl, her name was Ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann, I shook her hand
We ended up freakin' by a garbage can
The next young freak I met was Red
I took her to the house and she gave me head
She likes to freak is all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
There's another girl, her name is Mary
Talked about sex and the girl acted scary
I heard she was freakin' for my homeboy Jerry
Took her to the house and I popped that cherry
Young and tender, sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast
I tell you, homeboy, if you get a piece
She only talks about signin' a lease
I met this tender, her name was Lori
And a X-rated movie wouldn't tell her story
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa
And just like Lori, she's a real dick pleaser
My girlfriend's name was Michelle, 
Her booty was bigger than a tale on a whale
When i freaked Michelle, I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than flames in hell
I G'd this girl, her name was Tammy

Freaked one night with a girl named Pam
The very next day I saw her with her man
One week passed and I was in her again
I had an old tender, her name was Janine
She was thirty-two and I was only eighteen
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend

Two tons of fun, big mama jama
A country-girl from Alabama
I met this freak, her name was Betty
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as hell, I was drippin' sweat
But I was all up in her tryin' to hold my breath
Bake and shake us, I met this freak in Vegas
She said her name was Donna
She was a built little freak from China
I said I don't pimp or gigolo
I'm havin' so much money that I don't need a hoe
You can break yourself but you can't break me
You never met a player like $hort, baby
I knew a dick sucker named Betty-Jo
Took her to my home and we did it on the floor
The girl got freaky and I tell you more
She was down on her knees beggin' to blow
She's like another freak named Rene

Always talkin' about havin' fun
Once again in the bed I got it goin' on

So when you see me comin' or see me goin'

On the Foothill bus number forty-three
All the way on the back she was workin' me
Had my big beatbox and I was jammin' the beat
I met this freak named Antoinette
Macked on the baby like an ice-cold vet
Everythin' she had is what I get
Cause I'm Too $hort, baby, I don't play that shit
I met another freak, her name was Rita
Baby thought Too $hort just might eat her
I told her like this, she can suck my peter
Or even go home cause I  knew I didn't need her
Scratched her name off my telephone book
Never again I took a second look
Cause the next young freak, her name was Sharon
She kept lookin', while I kept stairin'
Baby came through with my homeboy Darren
Her booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearin'
She never left, he cut out
I know you all know what I'm talkin' about
There's a freak named Shannon, such a sinner
She smokes that pipe and she's gettin' thinner
Shannon is cool but her mind is gone
One fat rock and it's goin' on

Thick ass bitch, said her name was Grace
She walked in the door workin' lace
You shoulda seen that look that was on my face
She's like this tender named Belinda
Homeboys call her Belinda the Blender
She gave head like she made it up
She was twenty years old with a big round butt
Had a girl look like olive oil
Her father was rich and the girl was spoiled
When she got mad he blood would boil
But I rapped her all up like aluminum foil

Shockedy life, Friday night, it's goin' on Too $hort
Three weeks ago I met this freak
She followed me around like Mary's sheep
I hid around the corner and when she came
I grabbed her by the arm and I asked her name
She said it was Anita and her man's in Santa Rita
I took her to my house and homeboy, I geed her
Set her on the way the very next day
Playboy $hort was ready to play
I bumped into this girl, her name was Roseann
We hit the motel and had it goin' on
Holiday Inn to the break of dawn
When I took baby home, I freaked her mom
I knew this tender named Sherrie
I took her to the house and let her freak on me
Baby was a fan, she loved my beat
But I wouldn't raise my leg to let her kiss my feet
I met this freak named Yolanda
Rolled baby doll like a brand new Honda
I was on top and she was up under
The bed hit the wall and it sounded like thunder
I once had a date with girl named Kitty
She was so fine with big fat tiddies
All night long she was actin' shitty
So i macked on baby like I was Frank Nitti
There's another girl, her name is Rose
I use to ride baby like brand new Volv's
I never saw Rose wearin' clothes
She's a penthouse pet, ready to pose
I was ridin' down the street when I met Janet
Her booty was bigger than the whole damn planet
Ass everywhere, I just can't stand it
Tried to palm it but I could not manage
I had this freak, her name was Bunny
Said I'm the only man who ever called her honey
Everythin' I did to her was funny
I macked on bunny and I took her money
Eight tonight a date with Shirlie
She was really short and her hair was curly
If you saw baby you liked this girlie
She was so fine I went to get her early
Shirlie was freakin' like a girl named Rachel
Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal
She liked to kiss all on my navel
Those are her lips on top of my label
I knew another freak, her name was Candy
Real big lips and they came in handy
I smooth got worked and it was so dandy
I hooked the brood up with my homeboy Randy
He did me a favor in return
Gave me a lizard, said her name was Laverne
Baby got tossed and I got it on
I grabbed the microphone and started singing my song
My young homeboy heard me rap
And said he had way more freaks than that
So I told him like this, they might be freakin'
But, boy, you never had that T-P-Treatment",Freaky Tales,1989
Too Short,"Little girls of the world, you're all so sprung
15, 16 and all so young
I thought about you just last night
Grabbed my pen then I started to write
A rap that'll cap like a true blue rap
Not a washed-up almost MC sap
Little girls so fresh and I know you are
Wanna take a little ride in my new car
I see you more than baby, it's more like hell
You screw a little girl and end up in jail
Even though she seems she's 19
You're looking at her body an it's breaking your jeans
Well you know she's not, so don't play dumb
Little girls walking round trying to give me some
But I tell them like this, I'm the player $hort
Playing freaks like you is just a sport
I'm coming way too real and I can never be funny
Niggas like me just want your money
Give it up, cause I'm no lost cause
Little girl recognize Too $hort's the boss
When they turn 16, we all find out
What little girls like that are all about
So you girls out there, that fit my rhyme
You'd better think twice before you jump on mine
Little girl's so thick, you might think she's grown
But if you knew when she was born, you might leave her alone
She's trouble homeboy, with a big fat ""T""
Little girls like that make old men peek
Then a brother like me might break my neck
Looking back saying ""Ooooh!"" Bout to get in a wreck
Cause she's always flirting, might give me a look
Like I put her in the oven and she started to cook
But when I put her on the spot, she could not hang
With my so rough, so tough Playboy game
I only said two words, something like ""Get busy""
Her head started hurting and she got real dizzy
Growing up too fast, all you little girls
Letting brothers like me cold crush your world
Should've listen to your momma when she told you so
But you went and got G'd now you want some more
They ain't paying me money, talking 'bout love
And the other girl's who I'm thinking of
Can you understand, I'm just a man
I want to come in this world and cold take command
So just step on back, while I walk on by
I might look you down, and I might say ""Hi""
And if you come up choosing, I just might laugh
Say ""Little girl check me out in about two and a half...years""

I took a little girl to a drive in show
Jumped in the back and heard ""No no no""
She was only 16 but the girl was ripe
36-24 and a 35
I was wasting time spitting lines
Thinking 'bout going home cold getting mine
Baby said, ""Stop it."" I said, ""Drop it.""
I tried everything but I could not cop it
I was going to the store about a month ago
Met another girl that just loved my show
We talked for a while and it was all about
Having big fun later on at her house
She said her pops was gone but her mother was there
And everything was cool cause she don't care
So I gave her a ride, kissed her goodbye
I said I'd be back and we all know why
Went to find my thrill up on that hill
I was coming right back with the power drill
I had fun for a while but it wasn't enough
When it all got good, her pops showed up
He must have walked in the room and said ""Young punk""
Cause when he walked in the room, he smelled the funk
Then he tried to mash, but I don't play
Cause I was out of that window and on my way
Little girl

Every night you call and say ""Come by""
You tell me things changed and I know you lie
I came by last week, you said drive on up
And your pops came out talking all that stuff
Next night we made a date for 9 o'clock
And I always wondered why you walked the block
I saw you waiting on the corner when I made the turn
I didn't really think about it cause I wasn't concerned
I said, ""You look so good, but you always do""
I was rushing to the house for the old 1 2's
But the ones ain't cool, and the twos don't work
Every time I tried, you kept saying it hurts
And then it all came out under all your tears
It seems you only been alive for 15 years
You could have fooled me baby with your lying scheme
Said you worked in the mall and just turned 18
When it came down to it, I couldn't go through it
It's all so sad cause you wanted to do it
Little girl, you want to have some fun
You'd better wait a few years cause you're much too young
Stop playing games, you might find a guy
Who will like you for yourself, not for all your lies
So I put it like this, and I don't play
If I see your young ass, I'm not going your way
Little girl",Little Girls,1989
Too Short,"It's a mack attack, coming from way back
My name is Too $hort baby, I don't play that jack
I'm from the Dangerous Crew, and I tell you it's true
Everything they say about Playboy Too
I'm $hort Dog, ain't nothing nice
I drink g-juice and wouldn't cut it with ice
From the Eastside baby, Oakland town
Can't understand why I'm so down?
I'm not a whitewall, I'm a vogue
Like a Zenith wire wheel I roll
Got a fresh new beat, made to get freak
It was everything you wanted cause I can't be weak
Yeah baby that's it, do the split
Freak nasty all on my tip
I took it to my DJ fresh on wax
Put it on the turntable, I got taps
It started burning up, wires smoking
Had to be the sound coming straight from Oakland
$hort Dog, it's a mack attack
My name is Too $hort baby, I don't play that jack
One young tender lost all hope
Slapped her in the face with my dunkey rope
Another young sucker tried to front my staff
Saw it on his face when they broke him in half
It was the Dangerous Crew, and I tell you it's true
Everything they say about Playboy Too
When I say my rhymes, I'm never fake
When you start my beat, that's when I break
On you, and it don't stop, and it don't stop, and it won't stop
Cause I'm Too $hort baby on the microphone and I'm mackin'

I'm not a wannabe pimp, I never simp
Since I started walking I had this limp
It was a cool type walk, just like me
The Too S-H-O-R-T
I might be young, but I spit this game
I start it with P, and it ends the same
If your brain is lame, remember the name
When it's Too $hort baby, ain't nothing plain
Dangerous Music on the microphone
Makes you want to break your hip bone
Might break your leg, or maybe your back
Grooving tOo hard to my mack attack
It's really not easy, you know it's hard
Sort of just like my gangster car
You know what I mean, Vern? It's like funny
I mack legit and make all the money
See my capital T on my diamond ring
We hook up the beat and love to swing
So while you're out there grooving back and forth
I want you to scream out ""Sir Too $hort"" (Sir Too $hort!)
Don't stop that rap (Don't stop that rap!)
And it's just like that
Get busy girls, while I rap
I make big money, that ain't no crap
When I grab that mic, and spit my rhymes
I gotta have an 8 or 909 BEAT
So I can rock you all night long, SHE'S
On my tip, she love my song, HE
Tried to do it but did it wrong, FREAKS
Want to get my all alone, but I'm macking

I finally got a chance to grab my pen
And make another rhyme so I can make more ends
It's a rush production, not the beat
I rushed it out the studio and hit the street
Now I'm rocking one more time
Young girls love my Too $hort rhyme
But that big fat girl better let that go
Before I point right at her say ""Ho!""
I'm riding drop-top Caddy, I don't dip fake
I step on the gas then I hit the break
Do it again as I catch the beat
You're feeling that bass all down the street
Jumped out the car on 9-0
I was wearing all white Capezio
Had my 501's, five dunkey ropes
Couldn't be saved by John the Pope
The M, A, C and K, from Oakland, California
I'm Too $hort baby, no I don't play, I'm macking

Freak nasty, I like your dance
You know it looks good in those pants
So damn good, I had to glance
Now I'm macking
See this gold? I bought it all
Now every night you young freaks call
You see my car? It's my best friend
So it you touch, you'll meet your end
Time will tell, just keep it cool
Don't play that game, don't be no fool
I'll burn rubber all down your block
You know what I want so keep the door unlocked
I'm coming in baby, don't waste no time
It's a mack attack, and now you're mine
Dangerous Music is what it seems
The reason this floor just met those jeans
I was running the game all in your ear
You're talking bout love to a stone cold player
Girl look good and want to have that sex
Took another look and wanted to break that neck
It's a mack attack, coming from way back
My name is Too $hort baby, I don't play that jack
I'm from the Dangerous Crew, and I know it's true
The only thing you'll say about Playboy Too
Is I'm macking",Mack Attack,1989
Too Short,"Party time
It's party time

Without a doubt I'm coming back and I would do it again
You can take away my beat and don't touch my pen
My name is Short that's so fake because I rap so long
Other rappers hear pop I put funk in this song
Young tender on the floor wiggle it all
Homeboy keeps telling her to give him a call
He's been on her since ten and it's almost two
Walking through the party with his dick on the roof
Tryin' to catch a little freak in the mini skirt
She was dancing real nasty all the boys like her
You can handle like a dog but you won't get game
You'll only get dog fake number and name
She's a mother to be and you better believe
You'll be looking at her mean next time you meet
Young tender won't care, she's still fine
Here you come again with your playboy lines

You don't stop

The party start jumping five hours ago
The mix don't stop till it's way past four
At three A.M I hit the scene
Buck-toothed freaks drop at three-fifteen
Pull out with one ditch the other
I jumped in my ride and I burnt rubber

Party time
Get busy
Too $hort

She's the one, love those legs
Danced two records but it seems like days
Baby so fine I keep telling myself
I want the young tender under my love spell
She could be all mine, nothing more or less
Life with a smile never, ever depressed
I give her ever lasting love around the clock
Baby doll it's you and me so just rock

Breakdown

All you superficial rappers will cease to exist
If I come into a party hitting raps like this
Though I make you feel weak when you want to be strong
You're soft soap buddy as I state in my song
According to the scriptures in the book of rhymes
Biting on a line is considered a crime
Unintelligent? Yes!
Never fresh!
RUN DMC tattooed in your chest
I'll tell you one time and one time only
You might be fresh if you weren't so phony
The ability to rap is a gift from God
And your biting what your writing and it won't be bought
At the spur of a moment I will bust a rap
Simultaneously jamming with the beat in the back

Party time!
Get busy
Party time
It's party time, so get busy

Shake it, bake it, make it, break it
Work that body girl just don't fake it
I'm the kinda brother for a girl like you
I can see in your eyes that you know it's true
I'm the mack and the (?) from the big Oak Town
Laying track by track that vicious sound
All you sucker MC's hating my face
Even though there's not a rapper who could take my place
You better hook
Look
Or just get took
I know what you're about, see I read you like a book
Desperate dreams are on your mind
With a 10 foot mic you couldn't touch my rhyme
I'm impeccable rapping
Won't stop capping
Front one time and you'll see what happens

Party time

See, I'm fresh like always, I'm comin' at you
And you know I won't stop till I'm through
So get on it now is the time
Too Short, baby,'s gonna spit that rhyme
At you, 'cause I'm jammin', so check me
I play the music even made the beat
'Cause I'm the most rappin', most rhymin'
Rollin in a drop-top straight high-sidin'

On you, boy, I'm poppin' the most
I come from Oakland don't play me close
'Cause I'm a player love to play this game
I get funky out here pumpin' the name
Too Short the one and only, I just rock it
Fat bankrolls in my pocket
Call me the dirty rapper', I'll say, ""Sure""
But I'm a young black entrepreneur

I'm an MC, right I own a company too
Programmed the drums and made the groove
So when you look in my face you see a wealthy man
I hope it's not hard for you to understand
I'm the businessman, it's not the same
I'm treated like a dope dealer runnin' the game
And you wonder why I can't get no peace
I'm makin' more than the chief of police

I'm Short, Too Short

Now that I've established one fact I came here to rap
You got a choice to make about me
Can I get busy, are my raps too weak?
Boy, you're too grown, don't say I'm borin'
Just because you know I come from California
Where many rappers get no respect
I'm at home in a tape deck
I get played and played until it's all played out

Sucker MC's come to my house
They want a contract, get signed up
But like toys they need a good wind-up
Then the other suckers sayin' no names
Rap on the mic and use New York slang
Even though we don't talk like that out here
The point I'm tryin' make comes out so clear

You want paper or plastic, Visa or cash?
You wanna burn rubber, gonna step on the gas
Now nip, dip, roll the strip
Gonna take your mind on a serious tip
Like always I made the beat funky
I keep your head bouncin' like a dope fiend junkie
I got to say it before I break, I never rap fake

'Cause I'm Short, Too Short
Short, Too Short
Short, Too Short
Short, Too Short

See, I'm fresh like always no sweat
It's time to jump back in the mix
And get on it, now is the time
Too Short baby's gonna spit that rhyme
I sell records everyday and still I get no radio play
I got homies they love my beat
So you hear me all over the streets

A tape rhymes with bass, I make it deep
The kinda tape you'll always keep
So if you lose it, you're not my mama's son
It ain't free go and buy another one
Like a costume party on Halloween
MC's pop up on the scene
So you made a record, I saw your poster
I'm still harder than you, boy, look closer

Won't say who's best, I just tell you the truth
You're not makin' money so it couldn't be you
So if that leaves me Too Short, baby
I keep it in tune like Do-Re-Mi
With a strict rap tempo, bass line simple
Take that, it's a Too Short rap
It's on you, boy, I'm poppin' the most

I take a Limousine to the airport
Fly first class, never ever last

I know you wanna hear my triple X
Foul language, girls and sex

Well, I'm gonna tell you 'bout livin' the life
Stayin' in school and not smokin' the pipe
It's hard to be a rich man, don't you know?
When you drop out of school and start smokin' dope
It goes D you M be, you're lookin' for some D
Then start tweakin', it's goin' on
You don't like it?We'll, play another song

Too Short,"I heard there was a rumor Too $hort was dead
Walked in the house and got shot in the head
I know you don't believe it, if you do you're wrong
How can I die and rock it all night long?
I'm Too $hort baby, spit that rap
I put Oakland, California on the map
It's so hard, got you telling lies
Can't hold me back so you say I died
It's incredible, I came back to life
I never let 'em bury me without my mic
I keep breathing, don't stop that breath
Now everybody's talking about Too $hort's death
Am I a zombie, or something close?
I'm not Casper, I mack all the ghosts
Oaktown style is the only way
I catch a new freak every day
It's not the Yellow Brick Road, it's called the Foothill Strip
Stand on your toes, make your heels go click

So why you want to bury me all alone
I bring a new meaning to underground rap
Dead or Alive, I'm still Born to Mack
Always on the pop charts, straight rapping
I'm not dead, I'm just macking

So as the word turns, I'm a living soul
I even heard a rumor that I overdosed
I'm not a reincarnation of something old
Like King Tut I was buried in gold
Why you want to cry when I'm still living?
Word got out and the rumors started spreading
My momma, called one night
Said ""Todd, are you all right?
The whole family's got the Too $hort blues
I heard it last night on the evening news""
And that's bad, it's not even true
I told my momma like this ""Let's sue""
So many times, I heard I died
I guess I'm like a cat and I got nine lives
Well I'm the P-L-A, why-E-are
I lay bunnies, like Hugh Heffner
I'm her flavor, kinda saucy
I lay back and let the young freak toss me
Even if she don't like serving a pimp
I'm still living, so let's do it again
I keep rapping, hard as hell
Cause your rumors make my records sell
If you continue, I'll soon be rich
Riding around town going ""Biiiitch!""

People always say ""Too $hort can't rap""
Now I drive a Benz and my bank is fat
It's like crap, put a ""see"" on a rhyme
Ain't nothing left homie but a scandalous crime
I'm the best damn rapper you could ever hate
Say I died on the freeway in the earthquake
Say I'm washed up, say I'm through
But the fact still stands I'm better than you
You got rhymes? Well I got more
I take you on a trip to my rappin' store
You find rhymes and raps, poems and caps
Way more raps than any rapper could rap
Cause if you rap like me, he wouldn't have to be
Weak on the mic like my boy MC
It don't stop, to the funky beat
I know you like dancing with a real big freak
I can't dance, but I sure can rhyme
I sold a million, in '89
And if you didn't know baby, it's the 90's now
Old Short Dog got a new breakdown
I went to Miko's, fresh candy paint
Now I'm doing things that the suckers can't
If I was dead, they'd call it ""Dead Man's Rap""
But on the real, Short Dog is back

Funk funky, off the Parliament
I'm still living, so let's do it again
It's incredible, even if I die
I never let 'em bury me without my mic
I bring a new meaning, to underground rap
Dead or alive, I'm still Born to Mack
I say ""What's up"" to my homies in Santa Rita
Right about now I know you need a
Too $hort rhyme to get you through the day
Oaktown style is the only way

To rock this mic til I can't no more

The story I tell is so incomplete
Five kids in the house and no food to eat
Don't look at me and don't ask me why
Mama's next door getting high

She's rather spend her money on a H-I-T

Drive fancy cars, make love to stars
Never really saying just who we are
We use alias names like Too $hort
Sell your stuff you might kill for
Young kids grow up and that's all they know
Didn't teach him in school now he's slangin' dope
Only thing he knows is how to survive
But will he kill another brother before he dies?
In the ghetto, you keep one eye open
All day long, just hoping and hoping
You can pay your bills and not drink too much
Then the problems of life you'll be throwing up
Like me, but you don't see
Ten years from now, where will you be?

Blacks can't be white and whites can't be black
Why you want to act like someone else?
All you gotta do is just be yourself
We're all the same color underneath

Never be ashamed of what you are
Proud to be black stand tall at heart
Even though some people give you no respect
Be intelligent, when you put em in check
Cause when you're ignorant, you get treated that way
And when they throw you in jail you got nothing to say
So if you don't listen it's not my fault
I'll be getting paid while you'll be paying the cost
Sitting in the jailhouse running your mouth

Too Short,"Sunshine, convertable tops
You call 'em rags, we call 'em drops
You ride black walls, we ride Vogues
You got a girlfriend, we pimp hoes
You say I'm fake, I say you're smoking
I'm just a mack named $hort from Oakland
Just like a tag team wrestling tip
With a nasty bitch, then the homie switch
Bitch, ain't getting nothing but a lesson taught
If your pimping ain't strong, it's not my fault
Hoes start choosing, wouldn't give 'em a break
I pull out my old white Too $hort tape
I'm playing ""Dope Fiend Beat"" and the shit still hits
Trying to stick my dick all in them lips
She said ""No, I never did it before""
Well you ain't the bitch I'm looking for
Cause she's rich and thick and chocolate
Wouldn't hesitate to lick my dick
All my parters say ""$hort what's up?""
See me with a bitch with a big-ass butt
I don't answer, I start laughing
Nothing going on but the Oaktown macking
Laying it right, all damn night
Hoes getting sprung like they smoking the pipe
El Dorado, Mazeratti
Nothing but freaks with fine bodies
I love to roll my Mercedes Benz
I'm nothing but a player like all my friends
So when you call me fake, be for real
The call me Short Dog cause I'm hard as hell
Hope your girlfriend's name ain't Linelle
I screwed her last night in a cheap motel
Like I told my crew, when the toss up's chill
Humping like a Chevy rolling down Foothill
Get off the pipe fool, stop cracking
Be like Short Dog and start macking

T double O S-H-O-are-T
I go solo, can't nobody fuck with me
I'll just kick back counting my bank
No cokes smoking, just potent dank
Funky fresh on the microphone
When you spin that wax, it's not the same ol' song
Round and round it goes, where it stops no one knows
You see me at the clubs catching all the hoes
I don't drink vodka, I do drink gin
I like to get a blowjob from your girlfriend
Cause I'm macking, baby, you know that's right
I'm from the Oaktown, straight Eastside
I got all my game from East Oakland streets
Now motherfuck you damn shit-haired freaks
I go on and on as I sing my song
If you're tender and young, I fuck you all night long
I'm not a no-good punk, I didn't make you flunk
I didn't tell the whole world your pussy stunk
I cut you slack in my rap, I could've macked your mother
But Life is Too $hort so I kept it undercover
I'm so damn hard, on the boulevard
Hoes ain't tripping on me, they want to fuck my car
Freak nasty don't trip, to me it ain't shit
You can suck my dick with some fat hoe lips
Riding in a Caddy with the top let down
California sunshine, cruising the town
On the boulevard, maybe drop my top
If you're feeling hot, don't even stop
Cause it feels so good, I'm oh so sprung
They way you work that tongue, it just makes me cum
I told all my homies, all about
The way I bust big nuts, in your mouth
On the boulevard, we're riding oh so real
Not Skyline, I'm talking about Foothill
And when it ended, you know what happened
I'm so hard I just can't stop macking

I know I gotta stop sooner, but I'll stop later
They call me Short Dog, I'm nothing but a player
I know what she's thinking, ""I'm falling in love""
But there's another freak I'm thinking of
She's got long long hair, she's not like you though
She'll do whatever I say, she'll even be my hoe
Cause I don't want to get married, I'd rather freak Mary
Make good love and I do mean very
Wherever I go, it's the same old case
Same damn thing all over the place
(Nothing but bitches) Tight-ass jeans to pose in
I used to ride the strip trying to catch the hoes
They wasn't choosing, nope not these hoes
They wanted big time Vettes, riding brand new Vouges
So like I said before, I ain't tripping
Told myself it's time to stop bullshitting
Did the gangster walk, did it like this
Walked up to a girl and I called her a bitch
I said ""My name is $hort, I don't play games
I only play young bitches, now what's your name?""
She said ""I wouldn't tell you in all my life
You're just a little thug, you're not my type""
I said ""I'm Sir Too $hort, couldn't be no punk""
East Oaktown is where I'm from
You see wherever I go, it's the same old case
Same damn thing all over the place
(Nothing but bitches) Mad cause I told the truth
I'm calling you one and you can call me, too
Call me Too $hort, call me ""Too Thin""
But you wouldn't get a dime out of this pimp
So just give it up baby and I'll run right through ya
Maybe just maybe I'll come back to ya
Like Too Clean, I'm riding Cadillac
I hit the strip, turn around, and come right back
See I'm a big mack, and every bitch in sight
Says ""Is that Short Dog sitting at a red light?""",Hard on the Boulevard,1990
Too Short,"You hear me talking you know I'm from the O-A-K
I tell it like it is and that's the only way
I'm the M the A the see the K I write my rhymes everyday
Now all you one-rap rappers what are you doin'
I got so many raps so just go right through 'em
My name is Short but I rap long rhymes
Hand me your mic I do it all the time
Now could you be like me I hate to say it
It's like comparin' Mickey D's and Quick Ways
You only got 3 stores I got the whole wide world
I get beeps everyday from your favorite girl
But I'm such a dog I never call the freak
Hit it once and she was just too weak
At my house I keep finer things
The candy paints, got her sprung on my diamond rings
She could live like a queen if she was Miss Too $hort
Have 2 babies, get child support
But at this point she gets nothin' from me
I ain't fakin' it, freak, I'm just makin' the beat
So don't dance, ride the strip
All day long playin' Too $hort hits
Pop in the tape and start ridin'
Silly young freak who started sidin'

I'm just rich and famous and way too cool
I get paid to rhyme and I do mean G'z
You don't like my raps don't buy 'em please
I give you no refund cause my bass is phat
Make it hit so hard just like a punch in the back
It's that dope fiend beat got my rap on your plate
Tryin' to bite my style and make a demo tape
Now could you be like me or someone else
Bass hittin' hard like the Freaky Tales
Oaktown style it goes just like this
If you never heard me rap don't trip
Cause I hit the scene with my homie Too Clean
We slap hands like a tag team
Some people say they don't like Cali raps
People like that must be smokin' that crack
I rhyme good it's been 10 long years
Gettin' sick of all that stuff I always hear
Too $hort can't rap, he's from the Westcoast
Between me and you patna I sell the most
So let's take it to the stage and don't get scared
Cause me and Too Clean, we come well prepared
They call me Playboy Short, and the girls I play
Every single day

It's your life, don't be stupid dope,
'Cause when you waste it...
It's your life, don't don't be stupid dope,
'Cause when you waste it...

Now I come from, the Oakland town
Task force roll and rock, cold cracked down
Young brothers my age makin' dollars so long
Drive a brand new Benz with a cellular phone
See his diamonds and gold, call him Big Bank Bob
Got a ring for each finger and he can't get a job
This is not a song I made about crack
It's all about losin' what you can't get back
'Cause the name of the game is to control yo' life
And all the things you do you must do them right
It's not my life, it's on you baby
What's really goin' on is that cash money
How you make it, it doesn't matter to me
Work at MacDonald's or just slang them ki's
Or you can be like me and go straight legit
Drive a brand new Benz and they can't say shit

[Chorus]

Partners in your face, ain't even your friend
Probably have to blast him if you see him again
And if you don't blast him you'll get shot in the head
Seven days later you'll be buried and dead
I can't be like that, the only thing you fear
Homeboy you can't see it but you know it's there
It's called tomorrow, what'cha gonna do with that
Cut school, sell a few dope-fiends crack?
It's not a one-way street, it's more like a dead-end
So if you take it, you better turn back my friend
I know a lot of young brothers don't think things through
They really don't know what they want to do
When you lag, you lose, you start payin' your dues
You can't kick back and let your bankroll stack
You'll be stuck on stupid, for smokin' a friend
Ten years from now you'll still be in the pen

[Chorus]

I got my eighteens pumpin', ridin' the five
People lookin' at me like I stole the ride
Am I a gangster, player, makin' them G's
Cocaine dealer with the Z's and V's
Can't tell 'em nothin', so I say, ""Whassup?""
They get mad, I don't give a fuck
I keep ridin', sidin', whippin' and dippin'
Look at all my homeboys trippin'
They'll knock you out, one punch like the champ
Goin' to jail is like summer camp
We shake hands one day, kill each other the next
And if you don't like it it's just like that
'Cause I come from, the city of dope
It couldn't be saved by John the Pope
But since I have the chance, I'll say in the rhyme,
We have to stop the killin' sometime (soon)

Too Short,"Bitch! That's a trademark

I was at my house not doing anything
Half past ten I heard the phone ring
When I picked it up, I said ""Hello?""
The bitch spoke up and said ""What's up ho?""
I said, ""Bitch, if you're fine it's my dick""
Enough playing, who the fuck is this?
She said ""Janet"" I said ""Oh""
Met the bitch last week at my show
I told her ""Call me"" and I gave her my card
She talked dirty and my dick got hard
That night I fucked the bitch three times straight
Next night we made another date
I gave a concert and she came backstage
Fuck a bitch, I'm trying to get paid
But that puusy squeezed tighter than a vice grip
Fucked around and met this other bitch
Right out the back I told her ""Bitch let's go""
Took the bitch to my limo even though
Her friend said I'm ugly, I ain't even fresh
She told her friend they fuck the best
Rushed the bitch to the back seat
She pulled up her skirt and fucked the shit out of me
She said her name was Paula, bitch turned me out
Took my dick out the pussy, let me cum in her mouth
She kept sucking like a veteran, I couldn't handle it
The limo door opened, it was Janet
She jumped in the car, they started kissing and shit
I kicked back and let 'em have this dick
I told the driver ""Take me straight home""
Then called my partner on the car phone
I said ""I'll hook you with a bad-ass bitch""
Come to my house and don't even trip
He came over and we served the hoes
Fucked the bitches like gigalos
Paula and Janet will make you wet in your pants
But to me, they're just two more tramps
With some good ass motherfucking pussy, no shit

Too Short,"All we want is the money

I keep em' bro.  
Wake up one morning, and, with some money
To spend, they go crazy.

I'm going to tell you a story in stereo,
About the pimping game, that you should know.
But if you don't, it's alright.
'Cause I'll be spittin' this game to you all damn night.

When I was 3 years old, 
Straight pimp game I was told.
My daddy sent me to pimp school.
In this man's world, you can't be no fool.
If a pimp is what you want to be, 
You're gonna have to learn pimpology.
Pimpology, a pimp's profession.
Can't be effected by the Great Depression.
So if you want to be giant sized,
Come to my school, get pimp-matized.
In your school, what do they teach?
English, math, and history.
Pimpin' game, you can learn.
And if you do, you will earn
A pimp diploma, just for you
For learning what you're taught when you come to school.
Lesson 1, you should know,
Never fall in love, with your ho.
Lesson 2 tells you to do only one thing,
Act cool.
Lesson 3,
Don't be a trick. If she's poor, if she's rich,
If your game is soft or hard,
It shouldn't take long to break the broad.
Lesson 4,
Keep ya ho, it's the most important thing to know.
'Cause I pimp or die, I'm like the Mack,
Riding around Oakland in a Cadillac.
But on the other hand, if you can't pimp
And the hos keep treating you like a simp,
I don't know what to say about you boys.
You better go to the store and buy some toys.
'Cause you can't play this game.

Next time you hear grown folks talking, shut the fuck up why' hear?

Now you heard my story in stereo:
About the pimpin' game, that you should know.
And if you don't, it's alright,
'Cause I'll be spittin' this game to ya all damn night.

I'm Short Dog.  
Ain't nothing nice.
I never rap fake when I'm on the mic.
I ride around town in a clean Benz.
Never ever frontin' on my real cool friends.
My zodiac sign is a Taurus the bull.
I drink Old English, and I do get full.
If you're wondering why I don't stop my rap, 
'Cause other MC's can't rock like that.
My music flows like domino's.
I pimp these hoes that's how it goes.
Tenders on my beeper all day and night.
I'm a true blue player homeboy.  
That's right.
O-A-K-L-A-N-D,
That's where I rain, top dog MC.
Too Short, baby, on the microphone.
I work more tails.  
I don't take freaks home.
Man, they start trippin' when they think your rich.
Met her yesterday.  
All on my tip.
It's not hard to believe.  
But that's how it goes.
I'm burning rubber on these hoes like vogues.
Check out my style.  
Baby don't stop.
If you can't call me Short, just call me Dog.
Black is my color.  
I have no other.  
Nothing else will do.
I've got a black car, black bed, black TV.  
I've even got a silk black suit.
Dangerous music, and the Dangerous Crew,
Oakland, Ca, and the Playboy too.
West coast rapping all over the place.
Too Short, baby, all in your face.
I rap so hard, ­you can't stop me.
My last album sold a million copies.
Me and the maestro, laying the beat.
DJ scratches from my homeboy Pete.
Dangerous music is what you hear.
A new LP, every year.
You know we rolling.  
Can't be faking.
We come through, and all your girls, we're taking.
You know we're rolling.  
Don't do no simpin'.
Oaktown players, strictly pimpin', baby.

My name is Short.  
Just what you've been looking for.
Sending young tenders on a wild goose chase.
Up in the hills, trying to find my place.
Getting lost, getting tossed, getting found and clowned.
Every time you see Short baby, you get down.
'Cause the raps I make are the raps you like.
The way Sir Too Short rocks the mic.
It's a one of a kind, rapping style.
Have the freaks in the crowd, going wild.
For when I spit my rhyme, I just don't quit.
Grab the microphone, and just make me rich.

It was $35, 000.  
$35,000 cash money?
No. 
I get 1.  
$35, 000 plus 1, right?
The one I gave you?
No, I gave you 6 alright.  
I had 1.  
Now $35,000 plus 6
Right.  
Now $35, 000 plus 1, plus 6 makes 7. 
$35, 000 plus 7, right.

Fake punk-ass bitches
Do you know what i mean?
Fuckin'em up like this, man...
$hort Dog's in the house, bitch!

She's a punk-ass bitch, hoe, tramp and a slut
Took her to the hotel just to fuck
Last night she licked all on my balls
Pussy got wet like Niagara-falls
Dropped my drawls and bitch said: ""Shit!""
Skinny motherfucker with a fat-ass dick
It's like a T-P-treatment, thangs so foul
From the tip of my head to the crack of my ass
She got busy so I called to the crew
You bitches know what to do
Hoes try to front like they ain't no tramps
Try to get that pussy and she say you can't
Me and my partners we got that game
Check a square-ass bitch and make her throw that thang
You wine and dine that nasty freak
Dropped her off and got a kiss on cheek
You never even know how she ran in the home
Jumped on the phone and started to burnin' me out
She kept beepin' so I made the call
Bitch on the phone jackin' off
Sounded like she was havin' fun 
Playin' with her pearl thang
I said: ""Bitch, I'm on my way!""
I givit to you, homeboy, play by play
She had on polkadots with miniskirt
Jumped in the car straight went to work
I must to bust two nuts back to bay
Never seen a bitch work head like that
She had me jumpin' out of my seat
Workin' her jaws to the beat
She was a good dick sucker, I can't lie
Sucked so good I thought I'd die
Bitch blew me up and blew me down
All the way back to the Oakland-town
Baby started to singin', ""I love you!""
Tellin' me things she wanted to do
If I needed some money come to her
Everythin' I want is everythin' I'm worth
And you know what I said? I told the bitch
I said: ""Bitch, I'm rich!""

Fuck these hoes, man,
I ain't trippin', I'm like hell
Long-hair suckers

I know you're fine, bitch
But you got no cash you need to get a job
But your lazy-ass try to juice me up
I ain't no punk 
I put you in the rap with some serious funk
I wouldn't buy you a car, no diamonds and shit
All the time talkin' about your fake-ass gifts
George bought you a ring, John bought you a chain
Bitch, I'm buyin' you an ounce of this game
You better take it and shut the fuck up
Stop runnin' your mouth like a sucka
Cause you's a punk bitch
Everythin' you say and everythin' you do
Makes you a punk bitch, no good, no doubt
All I gotta do is stick a dick in your mouth
want to give up the pussy, bitch, I had it
You're too slim, I like your mama's ass
Pops came home, came up to show
Family in the backroom, I'm fuckin'em both
Now I'm the stepdaddy and the son in law
You call me Too $hort they call me too raw
I creep by one room in to the next
Nothin' goin' on but some serious sex
Some of these hoes might think I'm played
Bald-head bitch need some new brains
Cause that nappy-hair don't even hit
What's cookin' in the kitchen
On the back of your neck
Like you burned the rise and want to front on me
You could never fuck with $hort, baby
I'm from the O-A-K-L-A-N-D
I slap you in the face with reality
These punk-ass hoes out there is sick
Happy walkin' around with a trippy dick
So beautiful fine young thang
To get that cog was just like a dream
But now three days later ask cool Moe
You feel burnin' sensation down below
You're a true blue victim of a punk-ass bitch
Thought she was a square and she gave you the shit
So for all you hoes that live like that
All the homies in the house say: ""punk-ass bitch!""",Punk Bitch,1990
Too Short,"Too $hort, MC

Rap like me, you'll go straight to the top
Keep doing what you're doing and you're sure to get dropped
Like a trick, nothing's even up my sleeve
A million albums sold and it's hard to believe

Well it's true homeboy, it's not a lie
I used to sell tapes on Sunnyside
I used to catch the 40 bus around the way
Me and Fred Benz, slanging tapes
All these things, that we did

Grab the microphone and start screaming ""Bitch!""
You fronting MC, I hate to cap
You make hit records and you still can't rap
I said it before, I'll say it again
You don't belive me, ask your fans

When I walked into Cali, the place was packed
Sir Too $hort ""Don't stop that rap""
I keep rapping my rhymes, all the time
You got no rhymes, so you listen to mine
I'm not starting a fight, just telling it right
The best damn rapper who ever grabbed the mic
His name is Too $hort, now shut your mouth

In '81 I was rocking the house
I'm a hustler, baby, coming up
I hustle every day and I don't sell drugs
I don't run no gangs, don't shoot no dice
Gave the same damn speech to the Oakland vice
But if you keep pushing, just like you
When they see me on the strip, coming through
I break it down so vicious it'll break your back
With the beat so loud playing Too $hort raps
That's it, I'm set
No need to talk that bullshit

I need a, Oaktown, big time sound
Just enough beat to get on down
So, you other rappers listen to mine
You wouldn't catch Short Dog rapping nursery rhymes
Call my rap trash, jam the junk
Put a sticker on the cover: ""X-Rated Funk""
It's just me, you say I won't go far
But I won't stop rapping cause I rap so hard

From here to New York, back to California
I bumped your girlfriend, don't say I didn't warn ya
All this time you said she's your ho
You really shouldn't give baby all that dough
She gave it all to me cause I fuck so good
I practice on the girls in my neighborhood
Cause when I'm freaky I rap, I spit a rap to a freak
I rarely ever think about a sucker MC

I go platinum, it's just like slapping 'em, bitch
Short Dog in the house, starting some shit
MC's rock and MC's roll
But the albums they make never go gold
When I was young, I knew I'd be one of the best
Every time I made a song it came out so fresh
I was the king of the Oaktown, spitting my game

10 years later, ain't nothing changed
Still the Boss of the Bay, and I know what they say
They call me ""Godfather"" and they call you ""Gay""
Bitch! It's 1990

Your girlfriend's out there trying to find me
She heard about me, I fucked her best friend
I guess she wants to see if I can do it again
You want to be like me, so damn bad
The impossible dream all you MC's had
If you could rap like me, you wouldn't have the dream
Start rapping quit flapping like a chicken wing
If could rap like me, they say you're so great
But when they talk about you, they say you're so fake
And as the days go by, you can't forget
The way I make you feel like shit

MC's like you, I've seen 'em before
You keep on saying ""Fuck Too $hort""
But I'm a better MC than you
And ain't a damn thing you can do, but bitch

On the TV screen, in the magazines
When they interview you, you just make up things
You're on an ego trip and you're fronting like you're down
You're not the first real rapper from the Oakland town
You're just a new jack, and you can't even rap
You want to trip? Trip on that
I'm like MC Lyte, checking hoes tonight
If you're not a real rapper, get off the mic
Cause with a fake MC, a song's never complete
You'd better learn to rap like me
	
Whenever I rap, you call it noise
I'm tearing up shit up like the Acorn Boys
On 10th street, I got a big freak
Until you learn to speak, realize you're weak
Cause it's the Oaktown, and they all get down
To the rhythm of the Too $hort funky sound
It goes boom, baseline's on ya
Dangerous Crew from Oakland, California

Bitch don't front cause Short Dog is hard
If you answer my rap, I tear your ass apart
Just like this, it lasts forever
You make a song and I make one better

You say I cuss, I say you're fake
Your eyes pop open like paper plates
You fronting MC, I hate to cap
I make hit records with the vicious raps
I said it before, I'll say it again
The boy ain't nothing but one of my fans
He's like silicon titties, can you feel 'em?
How can a fake rapper fuck with a real one?
Shit, I'm that rapping man
I like you like the Klu Klux Klan
Motherfucker want to front on me?
My posse got a real MC, Too $hort

And it don't stop, and it don't stop, and it won't stop
Cause I'm Too $hort baby on the microphone and I'm macking, bitch
	
Now back to the subject, my boy MC
Whatever you say, you can't rap like me
Rappers like me make real hits
Rappers like you talk bullshit

I told my boys there's a new Funky Drummer in town
You're trying to be like James Brown
If I couldn't be me, who would I be?
I damn sure wouldn't be a sucker MC
'Cause I'm not like you, my game is true
I pimped these hoes and I pimped you, too
Cause I'm boss, and boss makes the rules
You disobey and you be a fool (Now listen)

One, remember how it all began
Don't guess, the answer is ""Oakland""
Two, you'd better learn to rap like me
Or you like to be a fake MC
Three, never talk down on a player
I wouldn't care if you was Fred Astaire
Last but not least, number four:
Don't ever fuck with Too $hort, bitch",Rap Like Me,1990
Too Short,"Life is too short but now it's kind of funky
I make the beats for me and my homies
Newspaper reporters and others always ask me
Why I'm X-rated and I rap so nasty
When I was a teen I did nothing else
But pick up a pen and express myself
The things I wrote were obscene and kind of dirty
But mama always said the truth couldn't hurt me
She also said that it would set me free
I guess she was R-I-G-H-T on the nail
Cause now I'm out making my mail
It all started out from a freaky tale
If that's what sells then I'm a stick with it
Short Dog ain't changing, so forget it
You can sell out if you want to, homie
But I'm a stay short but funky

Don't stop, just call it verse two
It's Short Dog baby from the Dangerous Crew
Not your average everyday fake rap on the micro
I might say something that your mother don't like so
Don't play it loud if she's around to see
But you can play this cause it's rated PG
When I'm rated X I'm just having my fun
I bring a smile to each and every one
But there's a serious side in everything I say
Life is too short for you to wait 'til the next day
Just straighten up your life and you can start right here
Drop the cocaine and the bottles of beer
People always say it ain't right to preach
But take my advice, get wise and reach for the sky
So you can live like a king homie
And I'm a stay short but funky

You never catch me on the mic rappin' a dance tune
I like it kind of mellow with the sound of the bass boom
The style is mine, I've been doing it for ten
You might say it's simple, but I'm making my ends
See I don't trip on a punk cause I jack him
Too short plus the cuss words equals platinum
What would I look like dancing on a stage
I wave my hand and do it like the old days
But some dumb fool want to take it out of hand
With fifty million dancers and a big old band
That ain't me, I'm from the old school
Play the instrumental, get the mic and I'm cool
Cause I'm an Oaktown mack and it's like that, so
It all comes out in my records and my stage show
In my category I'm the one and only
And I'm a stay short but funky

Hey yo, that's it

You either play the game or you smoke the pipe
I became a rapper at the age fourteen
No gold ropes, no diamond rings

But look at me now, ten years later
Ask any MC if I rap greater
See I'm known in Fresno, even the big O
From San Diego to Sacramento

They'll tell you yes, wherever you go
And I bet my life won't one say no
Ain't nothing like a Too $hort fan
I ain't tripping, you can play it again

Don't fight the feeling, life is me
I rock shows in Nashville, Tennessee
It wasn't ""Hee Haw,"" so don't laugh
At the good ol' boys getting autographs

In Cincinnati, I know you heard
I got fined for the cuss words
It's true, baby, so so unique
Might slap your man or just thump your freak

I come to your town, I'm not under
I want your name and your telephone number
You think I'm faking, but I'll call
We only got one night to do it all

I know baby it's such a pity
Tomorrow night, we hit another city
Cold macking in the game is all we do
Me and the boys called ""The Dangerous Crew""

I used to be local till I signed with Jive
Too $hort then went nationwide
I went to Georgia with the Too $hort sound
I went down like Bobby Brown

I said a rap and they took me to jail
Pulled out my bank and made bail
This is my story, it could not wait
It all started out in the Golden State

California, where I was born and raised
I used to play the drum in my younger days
I just hit that beat any way I can
Smooth high-stepping in the marching band

I turned in my drum and I started to rap
Now beats I make, make my bank so fat
It's Too $hort, on the mic tonight
Pennsylvania, can you see the light?

From Chicago, to Indiana
From Mississippi, to Alabama
Louisiana, even Texas
Females, call me sexist

But don't they love it, you know me
Freak nasty in a room trying to blow me
Like engine, engine, number nine
Homies run a train, standing in line

If that train jumps off the track
Then my brother you will catch the clap
From Colorado, to Arizona
All the way back home to California

In Chattanooga, they know the tip
Short Dog in the house, I'm that flip
Getting clip, or playing pool
I can't help it I'm so damn cool

Call me 'Dog' or leave me alone
I'm riding in a Cadillac Fleetwood Chrome
With Too Clean, behind the wheel
I'm riding shotgun, rapping for real

Total boss in the back, give me supersede
They like to roll 'em fat cause you know we ride
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rapping

Now you know, nothing but the Dog in me
You make love to me and I still act stingy
Oh should I pay you? You must be tripping
I didn't buy you and I sure ain't renting

I said ""I love you"" 'cause you gave me head
I didn't love you when we got out the bed
If I could love you, you know I would
But what you giving, ain't all that good

A little southern hospitality
You'd better try to get away from me
I love money, and I just can't fake it
I go to Magic City and the girls dance naked

I'm somewhat of a hero by the way I rap
But I'm living like an Oak town mack
I'm in the house y'all, I'm like peeser, y'all
Rat heads get nothing but cheese, y'all

Or get slapped, put up your dukes
I kick you in your ass with my Nike boots
Some rappers try to be just like Too $hort
Can hang with the Dog, you'd better stay on the porch

In Minnesota, Virginia Beach
Wisconsin, I got freaks
Atlanta, Little Rock
Louisville, it don't stop

want to be my friend, you know

You know what I'm sayin?

Let's just check em
Check em real quick

Let's check em, man

I know that you're a hoe for my wealth
You better just check yourself
Cause in these days we don't go for that
So you better try someone else		(2x)

[ VERSE 1: D-Nice ]
Now I can recall the first time I was out on tour
With my boy Too $hort, leavin everyone in awe
I met this little honey, she said, ""Hi, my name is Bunny""
I never would have thought she was out for my money
Now she appeared to me to be smart and legit
Equipped with hips that'll break your whole shit
But before that I can get a chance to knock it
The goldigger's goldiggin in my pocket
First she tried to say that she was playin
She musta thought I was a fool cause she was sayin
""Ugh, oh D-Nice, I want you, I want you""
I wouldn't try to trust her even if I want to
I wanted just to smack her in the face
But hittin females is just a bad mistake
I guess tryin to get your money is a hobby or a sport
Cause next she tried to kick it to my boy Too $hort

[ VERSE 2: Too $hort ]
It's kinda funny: you want money from a pimp
(Biatch) you're thinkin like fifty percent
I put my foot in your ass and then I owe you the rest
I know the game, hoe, cause I'm the best
Playin broads ain't based on luck
You want money? I want to fuck
And after we do all that
I'm takin my money back
Biatch, kiss my pimpin ass
Cause all the time I didn't have this cash
You wouldn't call, wouldn't give me a number
I couldn't see ya like Stevie Wonder
I made a hit record, now I got money
You want to play Short Dog for a dummy
You're so cool cause you think I'm rich
You know you want to be my bitch
I'm not single, baby, not for you
Fuck a bitch, and that's the goddamn truth
If I was you, I wouldn't hold my breath
Cause all you money-hungry hoes might starve to death

[ CHORUS ]
[ VERSE 3: D-Nice ]
Now I'm not tryin to come down too hard
If you need some money, you should go and get a job
But this one does not go out to all women
Just those who try to kick game for a livin
Cause I'm not the one to be played
So don't step to me when you want to get paid
Cause you're the type of woman that survives on greed
Yo $hort, won't you tell her what she needs
[ Too $hort ]
What you need is some type of financial support
You won't get shit from your boy Too $hort
I don't pay bitches and never will
I'm too busy tryin to pay my bills
I understand your reason for tryin
But I been mackin since '79

It only takes a second to pop the trunk
And just like that, you know it's real
You're in the right damn town to get killed

It's all about the game and nothin' else
You come out here, you better watch yourself
Cause you can wear what you want, even blue or red
But cross the wrong brothers and end up dead

You catch a body full of bullets and get blasted
Tryin' to be a gangsta but you just ain't lastin'

Check the penitentiaries and all the jails

If they could lock us all up, that would be just fine

But it's a mind game and you gotta deal with that

I wake up everyday and I just can't wait
To make mo money 'cause back in the days
When I rapped, I did the same damn thing I do now
Grab the microphone and show you how

But I was broke, the only thing I had was game

Is a pocket full of money, count seven G's
Now you wanna think I'm sellin' keys

Cause I'm a black man, but I run my own business
So why the police wanna send me to prison
They see a brother makin' major cash
They knock a patch out his black ass

And that's the truth, you can't argue you at all
Tryin' to give you ten years for a phone call
Ain't even trippin' on the dank smoke
Cause all they wanna find is guns and coke

In court all the time, tryin' to fight it

Is havin' big money, bein' black a crime?

Or did you take me to jail to teach me a lesson

What's really goin' on in the Oakland town?

Tell me who went broke, and who got rich
But Too $hort baby, just ain't no snitch

How in the hell did I make these ends?

Here we go, I pull over to the right
Stop the engine, keep my hands in sight
I start cursin' 'cause it don't make sense
Why would I run and try to jump a fence

If I was plannin' a smooth getaway
I never woulda stopped in the first place
You'd be high speed chasin' me but this time you ain't
Cause all I got on me is a big fat bank

Hell fucking no, I don't want to get married
'Cause can't no bitch hound me
Talking that shit about a family

I wants no champagne, I drink gin and juice
Bring a bag of ice and watch a ho get loose
Spread the word, we're getting tossed tonight
And please don't trip on the cellulite

I got a fat bitch, sucking on my dick
Every day homie it's the same old shit
Don't look stupid, hoe, drop them goddamn drawers
Get your ass in the bed and let's fuck like dogs

On the very first night, we fucked
I got the pussy, I got sucked
I couldn't wait, she asked me why
I let the answer shoot straight in her eye, bitch

Hoes are like cum freaks, they suck you dry
The do what you say, and don't ask why
Who said that hoe ain't old enough?
If she could bleed, then she can fuck

Call me ""Dirty Dog"" but your cock stank
Motherfuckers think pimps ain't making bank
But the, pimp game just don't stop
You gotta be down to reach the top

I tell all my homies ""Play these hoes""
Don't eat the pussy and play these hoes
'Cause some of these hoes get tore up smoking
Bitches like that you find all through Oakland

Miniskirts and no panties on
When it's time to fuck, it don't take too long
And it's mandatory for hoes to simp
Catch other hoes and bring 'em to pimps

So take this game and keep it for life
Never make a hoe into a housewife
Just get a good bitch, a workaholic like Holly
Bitch so bold, she'll take a piss in the alley

And make big bank, it's the pussy is dope
They keep coming back until the tricks go broke
But if that hoe jumps off the track
Another young bitch will bring them tricks right back",Hoes,1992
Too Short,"Yeah, you know, it's like, I rap
I got two platinum albums
I do a lotta concerts all over the place
I seen the groupies
They do whatever you say
When you want it, how you want it, and where you want it
But I ain't trippin'
Cause these are the '90s
So when a freak say to me she loves me
I just say somethin' like this

I say baby, why you want to do all that?
Sleep with a brother just because I rap
You keep lookin' in my eyes, and you just won't stop
All damn night you been on my jock
But I'm no fool
Cause you're sprung on my house and my swimming pool
Call me a dog, I got several freaks
When I do my shows I can't get no sleep
Cause you keep knockin at my hotel door
I was there to sleep, and can't get no more
Sleep, so why you want to wake me up?
When I told you once I don't want to fuck
So get on, girl, won't you mind your own
I'm tryin to sleep, so just leave me alone
Next time I see you, I do my duty
But tonight, I got another hoochie

[Chorus]
Hoochie, tryin' to be bourgie
But you're nothin' but a groupie
Riding on my snoopy

I'm Short Dog, I want to take you backstage
And you can read it like it's on the front page
You want to do somebody right
For those who ain't famous, not tonight
You do the NBA and the NFL
Rappers and singers as well
Keyboard players and the drummer
It's like track and field with just runners
So let me get on the phone and call all my friends
Ain't a damn thing changed but the paint on our Benz
Get somethin' that you can't get from good girls
Care less about a weave or a jherri curl
Cause I know something you don't know
Ain't nothin' like these groupie hoes
And since Tony Toni Ton?made the track
Get lost, fool, and tell your girl I'm back
Sing it

[Chorus]

Get off my lap, cause you're gettin' kinda heavy
Lookin' at the bed, askin' am I ready
Ready for what, sex?
Well, after that, baby, what's next?
We get a house in the suburbs, two-car garage
And every night I get a good massage?
Save that drama for later
And take this number to my sky pager
Keep in touch, but don't call too much
When I come back around, you know what's up
It's time to get busy once again
Bring a few partners, cause I got friends
It's goin' down like always
Young groupies in the hallways
I got the money, the fame, and all the things you like
So I see you next time when I rock the mic
You

[Chorus]",Hoochie,1992
Too Short,"I've been a dog ever since I was young
I saw The Mack and got all so sprung
I couldn't help it, I had to be just like that
With a stable of hoes and my pockets fat

But don't trip, I made up my mind when I was 17
I ain't with no marriage and a wedding ring
I be a player for life, forget about a wife
She just ain't my type

'Cause i mack each hoe and get richer
And if it ain't like that then I forget ya
I know you're just a freak, hoe
You're so nasty

That's why you're stairin'
When you walk like pass me
Bitch, now you're lookin' back
All dogs must chase the cat

So here I come, I just want to fuck you and cut
Treat you like trampy slut
So much game when homies' tough
Meet a bitch like you and smooth come up

I have your fake-ass closin' up bank accounts
Spittin' straight pimpgame from the Oakland-town
It's been done before and i do it again
Break your mama, your sista and all your friends

Short dog's on the microphone
And I won't stop mackin' till my bank is long
So try to break me if you want to
From me you get nothin' but drama

If you're a rich bitch, I got a new twist
And if you're with it, bitch
Then we can do this
Put me on the payroll

Bick me down bankroll
Buy me a benz and keep my tank full
'Cause other than that, I don't need no brood
Short Dog ain't nothin' but a dog...

I got all my game from East Oakland's street
So mothafuck you damn shit-head freaks
Couldn't pay me enough to treat you right
'Cause $hort Dog ain't nothin' nice

Like a sucka-mothafucka let a bitch be boss
Tellin' him how much she wants
Let her use your car
I'm from oakland, bitch

And you can check my rap
I hear fake bitches get slapped
Let a bitch get bold with me
I start to act like Goldy

Tell me who's in the house now?
Shorty The Pimp
And I'm the last mothafucka
That will pay your rent

I ain't blind, I know you're fine as fuck
But you're a tramp, bitch
You ain't mine what's up?
Try to give me some pussy but I want some head

And I already know everythin' you did
They say you fuck like old-ass tired bitch
But the word is out you suck some good ass dick
And I don't want nothin' if I can't get it all

You should know
'Cause I ain't nothin' but a dog, bitch...
$hort dog ain't nothin' but a dog
Bitch, fuck with me and you gotta do it all

Most brothas try to take freaks out
I get a room and stick my dick in her mouth
They spend money on a movie and some dinner
But $hort Dog goes straight up in her

I give bitches no respect
And the way I run my game they understand this shit
You couldn't be like me cause you buy her things
Used to be a broke fiend and now it's diamond rings

I remember when I fucked your prom date
You bought a dress and everythin'
But she just couldn't wait for the pralm to end
So she can call me up it was our very first date

And it was cool to fuck
Now I be doin' this shit all the time
I got bitches on my mind
Can't change in 1992

'Cause I still gotta find new, sweet, black
What should I call it? I won't say it
But if it's lain' on my bed, I'm a fade it
$hort dog ain't nothin' but a dog

Use to clown to hoes at the East Maid mall
I was actin' like a pimp when I was 7
Started to suckin' up game at 11
And at the age of young 14

I started to knock young bitches on the scene
Couldn't give a fuck less about a bitch
Thinkin' like that $hort Dog got rich
Now I'm makin' ends and you think i'm weak

'Cause i'm allways downin' these toe-up freaks
Tell me who's the man
And who's the mouse, bitch?
I'm Audi-five to my dog house...",I Ain't Nothin' But A Dog,1992
Too Short,"You think Oakland California is a city of punks
It only takes a second, to pop the trunk
And just like that you know it's real
You're in the right damn town to get killed
It's all about the game, and nothin' else
You come out here, you better watch yourself
Cause you can wear what you want, even blue or red
But cross the wrong brothers, and end up dead
You catch a body full of bullets, and get blasted
Tryin' to be a gangsta but you just ain't lastin'
This little town is gettin' wild as hell
Check the penitentiaries and all the jails
If they could lock us all up that would be just fine
Got my partners from Oakland doin serious time
You can't argue with the truth it's hard to be black
But it's a mind game, and you gotta deal with that
I wake up everyday and I just can't wait
To make mo money, cause back in the days
when I rapped, I did the same damn thing I do now
Grab the microphone, and show you how
But I was broke, the only thing I had was game
I started makin money and knew things would change
Bought a Benz, thought it might earn respect
But the OPD, found it hard to accept
I got jacked by the Task and jacked by the Vice
Face down on the ground keep my hands in sight
Put the handcuffs on backseat I'm in it
Illegal search for about thirty minutes
Askin' me, where's the dope
Where's my gun, but I don't know
I said I'm rappin', they laugh like I told a joke
And to this day they think I'm sellin' coke

I want to be free! (and that's the truth) Oh yeah
I want to be free! Oh yeah

I be in Oakland California every day of my life
bass so hard you think I'm smokin' a pipe
And if I don't smoke it, I got's to grind
Searched all my stuff, and all you find
is a pocket full of money count seven G's
Now you want to think I'm sellin' keys
Cause I'm a black man, but I run my own business
So why the police want to send me to prison
They see a brother makin' major cash
They knock a patch out his black ass
And that's the truth, you can't argue you at all
Tryin' to give you ten years for a phone call
Ain't even trippin' on the dank smoke
Cause all they want to find, is guns and coke
In court all the time tryin' to fight it
We get rich, we get indebted
So what's the problem Officer this time?
Is havin' big money bein' black a crime?
Or did you take me to jail, to teach me a lesson
Charge me with somethin', or just ask questions
About the brothers I hang around
What's really goin' on in the Oakland town
Tell me who went broke, and who got rich
But Too $hort baby just ain't no snitch
You say you're just doin' your job
But you're gettin' on my nerves, just like Bob
Every time I hit a corner, I see you
Always tellin' brothers what to do
You lock me up cause I don't know how to act
But I'm down for mine so I be talkin back
And when I do, you treat me bad as hell
I'm sick of spendin' nights in jail

I want to be free! (and that's the truth) Oh yeah
I want to be free! Oh yeah

Got out of jail about fo'-fifteen
Walkin' down the street like a broke dope fiend
Had a pocket full of money tryin' to play the role
Benz got towed and I was hella cold
But I ain't trippin', I'm gettin' used to it now
Handcuffed your boy took me straight downtown
for three warrants, had to catch me sooner or later
Cause the five-oh's always tryin' to jack a player
for no reason, wasn't doin' nothin' wrong
You think I'm lyin', singin' that same ol' song
Well I'm a black man, ridin' in a Benz
How in the hell did I make these ends?  Here we go
I pull over to the right
Stop the engine keep my hands in sight
I start cursin, cause it don't make sense
Why would I run and try to jump a fence
If I was plannin, a smooth getaway
I never woulda stopped in the first place
You'd be high speed chasin me but this time you ain't
Cause all I got on me is a big fat bank
And I hope I don't get robbed by you know who
Make me donate some G's to the boys in blue
And if I sue, I won't get nothin' back
But I ain't mad
I'm just black

Too Short,"It's on
Where they at, where they at, where they at

I sold tapes every day me and Freddy be	
Been  famous since 1983
Give me ten dollars, and you straight get blessed
A rap all about you called the special request
Oakland, you know I go way back
To coug nuts, fal stangs, and Cadillac's
When homeboys put vogues on any car
With 6 by 9's smoking burner
Everybody got addicted to my dope fiend beat
Whole town fucked around and started smoking D
Every rap I ever made was about this town
I made 7 whole albums with no James Brown
And even though I love his music, I just can't stand
The way they used it all up and didn't pay the man
And after 2 platinum albums, you call me weak
Cause I don't sell records in the East
Now what's funky, I say pussy on an old hoe
I guess y'all fools don't know
Why some good rappers can't sell no tapes
It's not the company's fault, the shit sounds fake
You want to be in the trunk, with the booming box
While the young bitches ride on your jock
You can't do it like this homey, so just pass it
And stop kissing them white folks asses
It's like you smoked a whole damn key
You rap so fast you keep leaving the beat
I'm from the old school, I love P-Funk
But now rap music is all that they want
So when I'm in my car, I play Clinton
And when I'm on the stage I start pimping
And when I hear your shit, I push eject
Then I throw it out the window with the rejects
And when the hard core rappers go soft
I like to watch when they ass fall off
Cause ain't nothing worth kicking like a sucka MC
And any other rappers ever talk about me
I don't stop rapping, that's all they can say
And how I dog bitches, every day
But if you can't be a dog, then you're weak
You be phony like a side show freak
Some rappers try to come off positive
Where I'm from that just ain't how it is
They say rap music is here to stay
But the sucka MC's don't think that way
It took 8 long years before I got my break
So I wonder why rapper's make fake ass tapes
You won't get paid like I did, so give up punk
And while your in the studio, I'm in the trunk
You got no choice, so don't flip that coin
This ain't the military, so you punks can't join
It ain't pop, it's called underground rap
From Oakland California and the shit sounds phat
I'm spitting raps to my motherfucking homies
That's why they listen to the one and only
I used to be broke, but now we all used to be
Got no game for a bitch, all the game is for me
And these bitches, can't say shit to me
They could never could fuck with Short baby
I'm not a tongue twisting rapper with a funny style
Don't dress hip hop and dance real wild
But I do sell records like a motherfucker
Even though you might I'm just another sucker
I find the beat and then never switch
Grab the microphone and then call you a bitch
You want rent money, I got pimp money
One thing's for sure, I won't give it to a hoe
I throw a bitch in the god damn trunk
And start slamming that Oakland funk
Short Dogg's in the house, once again
Trying to fade the platinum, with Shorty the Pimp
And when I do, I'm going straight to the bank
Withdraw some money and buy some dank
You can't relate to my motherfucking homies
That's why they listen to the one and only
I grew up on the funk called P
But these motherfuckers growing up on me
And if I ego trip, and my head is fucked
I take my ass back, to where I grew up
And get real boy, it's never too late
Before I do like you and make a weak ass tape
I'm in the trunk

In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk beating down the block

In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk, in, in the trunk

Bitch

And it don't stop
To the beat, baby

Oakland, California is in the house
Bitch

I tell you, nobody does it better than Too $hort
I got so many raps, I know you can't have more
Cause I grew up on the mic, I spent my whole life
Writin' raps, late at night
And I never would make no fake LP's
Sucker MC's don't make no G's
They make weak, weak raps, and need to quit
22 songs, and only 3 on hit
Frontin' on me like you want some
Better sell a million records, go platinum
Cause I wouldn't waste my time on a one-rap rapper
You want to get with me, you gotta climb that ladder
But you ain't nothin' but a joke
Rappers make money, tell me why are you broke?
We get paid like a motherucker, and we get
A brand-new house full of brand-new shit
A brand-new car in my brand-new driveway
I always keep the top down on the highway
Too $hort, baby, known everywhere
Had a life-long dream to be a player
Way too cold at a younger age
It was everyday, 'just make that pay'
12 years later, still in the game
And you never talk down on a player's name
Cause I'm (Too $hort, Too $hort)

You see, I'm fresh like always with funky beats
I say what's up to the brothers on 10th Street
It's goin down in the Oakland town
Home of the infamous Too $hort sound
So keep your jealous-ass thoughts in your diary
And if you're lookin' for a leader, you can hire me
And if your so-called boss don't pay
The only thing you need to say
Is ""I quit, I'm through with you""
Pack up your raps, and join the Dangerous Crew
We got mo' beats than the average joe
And a 24-track studio
So forget what you heard, and we'll see it's on
Oakland, California can't leave me alone
Cause I'm the most rappin, most rhymin
Sold my drop-top, but I'm still high-sidin
I'm (Too $hort, Too $hort)

Now that I've established my career
I want to help some other brothers out here
Hook em up and let em make some dough
Flip Benz's and turn out shows
Cause Oakland got talent, fool
MC's in elementary school
Not to mention musicians and singers
And Shorty be	 with his magical fingers
We get funky like skunk weed
Light it up, hit it, and get keed
This dope fiend beat will get you high
If it don't go gold too soon, I'll cry
If the bass ain't deep, somethin's wrong
It must not be a real Too $hort song
Cause the first thing I do when I make my tape
Is drop a few kicks from my 808
And when my tapes hit the store, they sell so quick
You can tell by my big fat royalty check
It's just a Dangerous thing when I'm on the mic
And the local police don't even like
The way we hit your town, it's so funny
It's all about makin' big money
So before I go, you should remember this
Motherfuck you, damn shithead bitch
Cause I'm (Too $hort, Too $hort)",It Don't Stop,1992
Too Short,"Ain't no love in Oakland, bitch
Niggas always talkin bout 'I love you'
But ain't no love, bitch

Now it's a shame, I can't be saved by John the Pope
I gotta be a pimp or sellin dope
Cause in this town, it's goin on
And brothers doin that can't live too long
So what's my option, do it or not
Break a hoe, sell a ki, just don't get caught
Cause if I do, I'm goin to jail
On a one-way ticket to a prison cell
So why commit the crime? Don't ask me
Went to school everyday, and I still can't read
I count money like a champ, now ask me
Why everyday does the task force jack me
The story's been told one million times
About a boy growin' up to a life of crime
I heard it before, you heard it too
But now, homeboy, it's just me and you
You see, people try to call us filthy trash
Even though we live better and make mo' cash
Than they do, I'm not a no-good thug
Standin' on the corner sellin' drugs
And just remember, this ain't multiple choice
Without a college degree you only got your voice
You gotta talk for yours, or get nothin' at all
This ain't the NBA, I ain't havin' a ball
Every day is a trip, but I ain't trippin'
Watch my back and don't start slippin'
Money won't talk, but it looks right back
Every time I dip into my stack
I'm buyin' cars, jewelries, and mobile phones
Things I couldn't get with a high school diploma
It's alright, cause I just help myself
You should know, cause I can't do nothin' else
And you better watch out for the day
When you lock me up and throw that key away
Cause I'll be back on parole
Ain't changed nothing, cause I'm ready to roll
I go to school now, but just to front
Still servin' dope fiends what they want
Count 5 to 10, 10 to 20
And I just keep on makin' money
I hope you don't think my story's amazin'
I tell it to a kid in the ghetto, it won't faze him
So many blackmen die for drugs
I think back on the way life was
Before rock cocaine started runnin' thangs
And drive-by shootings was a normal thang
Before brothers bought Benz's, used to drive Mustangs
12 years later, and I'm still in the game
All my life all I wanted was a few hoes
If I was pimpin' or slingin' at the liquor sto'
Ain't nothin' but street life, fuck that school
All the squares up there ain't even cool
Plus my partners at the house sell coke all day
Hit the mall like players, spendin' fat-ass bank
Junior high wasn't shit but a place to fight
Motherfuckers wasn't learnin' how to read and write
I'm just walkin' down the street all alone
High as hell, my mind is gone
I'm thinkin' bout some brand-new shit and I'm broke
I know I be a fiend if I smoke that coke
But if I go back to school and get educated
Be a old-ass man before I graduated
So what should I do, I can't even cope
I guess I'll get a sack and start slingin' dope
I went to my homie, said, ""Give me the sack""
He disappeared quick, and he came right back
He said, ""You owe me a g, I give you a week
You fuck up my money, don't cop no plead
Cause in the Oak ain't no love, $hort""
I knew right then I couldn't sell that coke
When I was young, it was hard to tell
If I grow up and be rich as hell
See, I was cool I knew all the shit
Big bank on my finger tips
But I never had a big bank, not back then
I kicked back and watched all my friends
Make big money, right in my face
And if you ever crossed them, they be on your case
You go under, six feet underground
You gets no love from the Oaktown

I drive my top everyday like a movie star
Drive around all night in old towed up cars
And if you stop me, ain't no tellin' what you find in my trunk
Gotta live like this, cause I ain't no punk
So break down the dank and roll up that shit
Light the motherfucker, take a fat-ass hit
My fingers all sticky from the residue
Don't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you
Cause life is only give and take
In the town where the strong control the fake
The wild wild west, that's the place
Suckers take a bite, and don't even taste
The California lifestyle that I live
Mack these hoes every chance I get
Like a drop SL, three times black
I'm a pimp, a player and I been known to mack
I'm a motherfucker, I broke your heart
She gave it all to me, and I tore it apart
Talked about love right to the end
But I broke your heart and, bitch, I do it again
So young and tender, also fine
Tryin' to get Short Dog all the time
I take what I want, you can keep the rest
You gets no love from East Oakland, bitch
That's the place I call home
Where the Oakland City players roam
Game don't stop, listen to me
Everybody fuckin' with the O.P.D.
Slingin' cocaine, knockin' it off
Killed some nigga, and he never got caught
High-speed chases everyday
Can't make no money no other way
A bitch yelled ""raid!"", that ain't true
Cause you laid down, and she fucked you
Two days ago I didn't know she existed
But now baby is just one of my bitches
I don't care what you say
Cause I catch bitches and straight get pay
You don't care what I'm sayin'
Punk-ass square ain't got no game
Hoes love me, cause I'm a player
They think maybe I just might fuck em later
I keep mackin' though, I don't work for free
To be a true hoe you gotta pay me
I spend endless days and endless nights
Plottin' this shit to keep my money right
I build stages in my mind, and it's all an act
All I'm tryin' to do is keep my pockets fat
With this pimp game, and these funky beats
Now here's a little story from the Oakland streets
You see, Tania had a boyfriend, his name was Jack
Always had the bitches on their backs
Jack told Tania, ""I love you so""
But Jack's a mack, he's got several hoes
One day she beeped him to say what's up
He didn't call back, cause she was only out to fuck
She beeped Mike, cause she got mad
She knew about the bitches her boyfriend had
Mike called back, and he was on his way
He just got the pussy yesterday
You see, Mike ain't trippin' on his girlfriend
Fine little bitch, I think her name is Lynn

My name is Too $hort baby, I don't play that jack
I'm from the Dangerous Crew, and I tell you it's true
Everything they say about Playboy Too
I'm $hort Dog, ain't nothing nice
I drink g-juice and wouldn't cut it with ice
>From the Eastside baby, Oakland town
Can't understand why I'm so down?
I'm not a whitewall, I'm a vogue
Like a Zenith wire wheel I roll
Got a fresh new beat, made to get freak
It was everything you wanted cause I can't be weak
Yeah baby that's it, do the split
Freak nasty all on my tip
I took it to my DJ fresh on wax
Put it on the turntable, I got taps
It started burning up, wires smoking
Had to be the sound coming straight from Oakland
$hort Dog, it's a mack attack
My name is Too $hort baby, I don't play that jack
One young tender lost all hope
Slapped her in the face with my dunkey rope
Another young sucker tried to front my staff
Saw it on his face when they broke him in half
It was the Dangerous Crew, and I tell you it's true
Everything they say about Playboy Too
When I say my rhymes, I'm never fake
When you start my beat, that's when I break
On you, and it don't stop, and it don't stop, and it won't stop
Cause I'm Too $hort baby on the microphone and I'm macking

I'm not a wannabe pimp, I never simp
Since I started walking I had this limp
It was a cool type walk, just like me
The Too S-H-O-R-T
I might be young, but I spit this game
I start it with P, and it ends the same
If your brain is lame, remember the name
When it's Too $hort baby, ain't nothing plain
Dangerous Music on the microphone
Makes you wanna break your hip bone
Might break your leg, or maybe your back
Grooving too hard to my mack attack
It's really not easy, you know it's hard
Sort of just like my gangster car
You know what I mean, Vern? It's like funny
I mack legit and make all the money
See my capital T on my diamond ring
We hook up the beat and love to swing
So while you're out there grooving back and forth
I want you to scream out ""Sir Too $hort"" (Sir Too $hort!)
Don't stop that rap (Don't stop that rap!)
And it's just like that
Get buy girls, while I rap
I make big money, that ain't no crap
When I grab that mic, and spit my rhymes
I gotta have an 8 or 909 BEAT
So I can rock you all night long, SHE'S
On my tip, she love my song, HE
Tried to do it but did it wrong, FREAKS
Want to get my all alone, but I'm macking
I finally got a chance to grab my pen
And make another rhyme so I can make more ends
It's a rush production, not the beat
I rushed it out the studio and hit the street
Now I'm rocking one more time
Young girls love my Too $hort rhyme
But that big fat girl better let that go
Before I point right at her say ""Ho!""
I'm riding drop-top Caddy, I don't dip fake
I step on the gas then I hit the break
Do it again as I catch the beat
You're feeling that bass all down the street
Jumped out the car on 9-0
I was wearing all white Capezio
Had my 501's, five dunkey ropes
Couldn't be saved by John the Pope
The M, A, C and K, from Oakland, California
I'm Too $hort baby, no I don't play, I'm macking

Freak nasty, I like your dance
You know it looks good in those pants
So damn good, I had to glance
Now I'm macking
See this gold? I bought it all
Now every night you young freaks call
You see my car? It's my best friend
So it you touch, you'll meet your end
Time will tell, just keep it cool
Don't play that game, don't be no fool
I'll burn rubber all down your block
You know what I want so keep the door unlocked
I'm coming in baby, don't waste no time
It's a mack attack, and now you're mine
Dangerous Music is what it seems
The reason this floor just met those jeans

Get out her pocket, bitch you gettin' beat up
You see me hangin' with them niggas like jock
And every single five mile, bitches gettin' popped
Well now I got a rep and they say I'm wrong
I beat my broad ass and she moved back home
Came in one night, I was buzzin'
Bitch tried to front me for fuckin' her cousin
She started yellin', man, the bitch got raw
I took one step back and went straight to her jaw
I gives a fuck that the bitch left

Grab the mic nigga, fuck these hoes

Yeah, I'm thinkin' back 'fore a nigga just came up
Playin' games with the bitches
Thought a nigga might change but
I was tight thinkin' everything's all right
Doin' the same shit to a different bitch every night

Gettin' real funky with the motherfuckin'
Dangerous Crew, bitch, with that old school

Too $hort baby, I'm so hard
Pimpin' these hoes on the boulevard
But I'm not here to tell ya bout me
I got a little story bout a nasty freak
She's the kind of girl you think about in bed
Blow job Betty givin' real good head
Bust a left nut, right nut in her jaw
Sperm on her cheeks is all ya saw
She could blow more head than a whale blows water
Blow job Betty make your dick get harder
She's a one of a kind, a hell of a girl
A trip and a half around the world
Catch her gettin' busy, bitch wouldn't stop
She's the kind of girl that'll make your toes pop
Every time I used to see her, I would know what's up
Blow job Betty better blow me up
I remember the day when I first met her
Bitch kinda loose so I knew I'd get her
Walked up to her said 
""my name is $hort, just what you've been lookin' for""
Pimp is my game, I do it the best 
Hoe fuck with me, she don't get no rest
Well after that, I G'ed the freak
I used to stop by and fuck about twice a week
And from the very first time I went to her house
Walked in the door and stuck my dick in her mouth
$hort Dog'll get bitches anytime I want to
Got a big dick and lay it right on her tonsils
Only stick it in about half way back
Cause if I put it all in, it bust straight through her neck
Niggas always sayin' how they fucked that bitch
But I'm the only nigga that the bitch made rich
Like any other tramp she loved to fuck
With any motherfucker got nuts to suck
I spit game to the bitch, just like this
Why you runnin' round suckin' all that dick for no money?
It didn't take long to stay true to the game
And get my pimpin' on
But every once in a while you get a stupid hoe
Bitch ain't about money and she'll never know how to get it
Blowjob Betty was dumb
A fiend for a fuck and a mouth full of cum
She made money for a minute but she loved the sex
So I cut the bitch loose like a old school 'vette

6 months later, I'm still a pimp, I'm still a player
One night at a club, she was puttin' in work
All you had to do was step up to her
She was in the bathroom sayin' one at a time
Wasn't my bitch but she still was fine
So I went in the back room, seen the bitch
Slapped her on the head, said, ""you ready to switch?""
And to the players out there
Instantly, Blowjob Betty started servin' me
Cause the player I am to the day I'm dead
I was sittin' on the sink gettin' some head
It was all so good and much too true
One young freak and a whole damn crew
But then I shot that fatal nut
Must of knocked that bitch on her butt
She couldn't even breathe, she was holdin' her throat
Me and my homies just hit the door
My homeboy said ""$hort don't worry""
But that next day I read this story
A young girl died just last night
She choked on sperm in her windpipe
It was on her face, her neck, and chest
And we're sorry to say there's no suspect
When I saw that my brain clicked
I bust a nut and killed a bitch
It might sound sick, it might be petty
But ya never been sucked by Blowjob Betty!

On the avenue, having brew, grabbing my dick
And if your clique talking shit, it's your clique I'm a terrorize
The nine to your spine, now your ass is paralyzed
I'm dangerous, and I ain't even mad yet
I drop with couch and watch you bounce like a bad check
Cause I'm a mack that's from 8900, bitch
Rappin' Ron and Diddley Dog and Bad-N-Fluenz ruling shit

Fool don't understand all the shit that goes on up in this nigga's head
From the hood come if you would but you might end up dead
See these sick-ass Oakland streets done turned me out
Surviving and making cash is what it's about
Some people ask me why I commit crimes ?there em? a scratch
But I'm black and I'm trapped and I can't turn back
I was raised as a cruel kid
Because the streets taught me more than these fake-ass schools did
I tried the education system but I dropped it
So now I'm in the goddamn game and can't stop it
And I'm a motherfucking threat to authority
Make the police sweat when they check this wreckless minority
You want more of me, come to Oakland, that's where I be at
Selling dope with my folks, come close and see I react
Hard niggas addicted to dirty money, fast cars, and fine hoes
On the drink every day like winos
And sometimes I be slipping up off the blunt
So I packs a pump for the punks who want to try for their stunt
Cause I would never tell a hoe how I make my green
I cut my cream on an un so I can't be seen
And then I bump up on the block and knock after knock
Watch the cop jock as I create a be a hot spot
Pushing slugs just to make it
I'm in the game and it's real and a nigga can't fake it
I know it's sad what I'm doing
And I don't give a fuck, I'm Ant Diddley Dog and I'm a Bad-N-Fluenz

Nigga you think you got the shit in?
You gotta get in where you fit in, bitch

Too Short,"""Man, this bitch blowing my beeper up""

Ready to put a hole up in one of these bitches, man
Sup? Guess you wondered where I was at
When you beeped me last night and I didn't call back
Supposed to be there, meet you at the house at 9
You made a candlelight dinner just to wine and dine
And I didn't even show up
You beeped me 20 million times, made my beeper blow up
Thought you shot me to the left cause I'm a D-O-G
But you called so I guess it's still cool for me
To get freaky, you know I got that git back
I come right when I hit that
And if you tell me right now it's cool today
As soon as I'm through I be on my way

Do I look like the type of lady
That'll talk to a brother that's shady, hell no
But you can wine and dine me
Spend a little time with me, it's all good
Cause I love the way you take me
Oh boy you shake me, when we lay down
Got my head spinning around

I need a woman that's down for me
Always on my side, not my enemy
We could be gangsters, lovers, parents, or friends
But whatever we do, do it straight to the end
We'll make love like professionals
You and me baby, fuck the rest of them hoes
You know how much we like being together
Seems like every second, it's getting wetter
So good I wish it'd last forever
Cause it would never get no better than this
I know you feel the same
Moaning so loud all the neighbors complained
And all the people tried to tell you I was phony
Talking all that junk and don't even know me
Last night I was chilling at the club
Chilling with my partna's when your friends rolled up
Flirting with your nigga behind your back
They called you on the phone and told you where I was at
Your girlfriends trying to run your world
You'd better stop listening to them other girls

Never cared about those other girls
It's something about the way you rock my world
Even though you make me cry
I still wait alone for you at night, but it's all good

I couldn't come home last night cause I was out making money
But I'll come home tonight if you want me
Cause you sure looking good today
I take you to your house and let you have it your way

Oh boy, oh, it's all good, it's all good to me, baby

I just keep on fucking you all night long
Me and you baby got it going on
You ain't tripping every time you see me
You get loose and you get so freaky
I never meant to break your heart
You gave it all to me and I tore it apart
Talked about love right to the end
But I'm a tell you like it is, I'll never do it again
I'm from East Oakland, I'm an ice-cold player
Born to Mack and got women everywhere
I got one up in E.P.A.
And two down in South Central L.A.
One in Frisco, and one in Berkeley
Got a few Southern girls just to work me
Is that what you wanted to hear?
That your man is the player of the year?
I need a woman that's down for me
Always on my side, not my enemy
We could be gangsters, lovers, parents, or friends
But whatever we do, do it straight to the end
I said the very same thing in the beginning
We played the game but it's in the 9th inning
You'd better wake up and smell the dank
It really don't seem to be what you think, biotch
I'm all about getting my bank
You be the car and I'll fill your tank
Cause nothing don't come for free
Unless your ass don't want to be with me, biotch

Boy, have you been listening?
I can't let you go since I know what I'm missing
And can you fell it in my touch
That I want you so much, and it's all good
It's all good, baby
I'm trying to tell you boy, that it's good
It's all good, it's all good, baby baby baby
Oh, like that baby, like that

Too Short,"I woke up one day in Vacaville
Round the corner from the pen
Fat house on the hill
All the homies in the pen straight locked down
But I gotta get dressed and hit the Oaktown
I called Randy Olson on the telephone
Early in the mornin' but he still ain't home
So I called Ant Banks to see what's up
He said meet me at the studio at two o'clock
I got dressed, smokin on some serious dank
Grabbed my keys off the table and a bid ol bank
I hit interstate 80 and I'm rollin'
Joint's still burnin' and I'm smokin'
I was on my way to San Jose
To the stereo shop that make my music play
Cause one amp shut down and the bass ain't playin
Didn't take long, for Joel and Janks to have me slumpin'
So I called up Boo what's up nigga what you bout to do
He said, just kickin' back waitin' on the fellas
Bout to go eat at Della's
I said it sure sounds good to me
I can't go tho, gotta hit Myrtle Street
Passed the acorns on my way, bitch. it's just another day
Big Banks came through and started mixin'
Sittin' in the studio kick back listenin'
To some funky ass shit from the dangerous crew
Debbie D came through, with FM Blue
Shorty be rolled up smokin' fat ones
Pee-Wee had a crew in the back room
Goldie had the tramps givin' head breakin' off
Rap and rhyme that diddley-dog
Twin one and two is tellin' stories
Bout beatin' down niggas for the glory
Had to catch a plane that night and roll out of town
Everybody gettin' high tryin' hard to clown
I had to go shop fo its time to leave
I dipped to the mall, flipped me some jeans
Rolled on out like a player
Hot ass day, bitches everywhere
I'm leanin' hard to the left like a big shot
Checkin' out the hoes seein' who'll get knocked
Cause when you fuck with $hort you get fucked quick
I rub some cum on ya ass and make ya suck dick
Ride through the ""old"" scene ""beamin' it"" slow
Talkin' that shit five niggas on the four

Motherfuckers gettin' high it's goin' down
It's the same everyday everyday it's the same
But that night we hit the hoop game
Who was playin, Seattle versus Golden State
Hollered at the home boy Gary Payton
After the game, we went to his house
NBA Jams, turned us out
Niggas talkin' bout slammin' bones
Any kinda way to get your gamble on
Bet, all you kept hearin' was bet
Dice game on the pool table fuck that shit
I ain't goin' outta town broke
I gotta have a bank get some dank to smoke
Think I'm gamblin', you must be insane
It started gettin' late I had to catch that plane
So I cut to the airport
Just another day for Too Short
I was high as fuck on the airplane
Thinkin' to myself about a street gang
How a black man'll do you in a minute
Walk around the corner see some shit and get in it
How the police always tryin' to catch us
Fell asleep and woke up in Houston, Texas
Gangtas ass niggas from the fifth and the third
Take yo ass there nigga fuck what ya heard
Next night we did a show, in New Orleans
Same gangstas same old scene
Yellin' at seventh at ninth ward
I see my homies from the third and the fourth
It was me Big Dog and the eight guard posse
Havin fun and you just can't stop me
I did a show in Birmingham, Alabama
Then caught a plane in Atlanta
I heard about the motherfuckin' freak nick
Popped that pussy hole fuck that weak shit
You shoulda seen all the bitches on the street
Niggas from Detroit was deep

Wall to wall dirty on carpet
Sit in a bucket hopin' you can start it
And ride around to the liquor store
Can't get a job get drunk some more
You better stop trippin' on them stereotypes
Cause in the ghetto there's a good life
We ain't starvin' like Marvin and won't see no roach
When ya chill wit the rich folks in the hood
Ya sittin' on leather watchin' big screens
Bought by the dope fiends
Smokin', and what about the brother wit the good jobs
Save money and workin' hard
Bought a house for his wife and kids
Ya only got one life to live
I know a brother that got some cocaine
Ya know his face but don't know his name
Ya know he got the sack man
And he's sittin' on a phat bank
Sellin' cars at his house in the driveway
Being so clean don't roll it just fly away
Cause folks got money in the ghetto
Yea you know

Hey hey hey
What cha got to say
(It's money in the ghetto)

Havin' money in the ghetto

Money in the ghetto ain't nothin' new
It's been like that way before you
Was even born get up from the down stroke
Chocolate City for the black folks
Say it loud in ya hot pants
Man child in the promise land
I take ya back to iceberg's land
And all the players that came before him
If you a everyday hustler, get cha money
Cause what they do to black man ain't funny
All the time tryin' to put us the pen
You get parole and then they send ya again
All the homies in the hood gettin' paid
You might have left but the money stayed
In the ghetto it ain't all bout drugs
Gettin' paid doin' all kinds of stuff
Only rule on the street is don't get caught
Unless ya hustle ain't breakin' the law
And even though rich folks got it good
We're sittin' on it phat in the hood
I'm ridin' them gold ones
Smokin' dank and it's potent
Ask them fools cause they know
It's money in the ghetto

I got money baby just tell me the price
Cause Short Dawg ain't nothin' nice
I always hit the town wit my boy Ben Franklin
Spend fo get an ounce a dank then
Rich nigga get high relaxin'
And if I bust a Ben Frank get some Andrew Jackson's
Five twenties for a hundred dollar bill
You know the math lets make deal
On a one dollar bill if ya look on the front
Ya find the face of George Washington
Make money baby that's all I do
That's how I know Thomas Jefferson is on the two
Abraham Lincoln got shot and died
Freed the slaves so they put him on the five
And how much in my old time friend
They put his face on the front of the ten
They are the dead presidents
From the hood and they represent
The american dream for the average minority
Make some money get some weed and a forty
I'm on the east side livin' like a king
Kick back watch a fifty inch screens
Bounce to the west and hit studio
And spend my money in the ghetto

Matter of fact it did it worse for me
Gettin eyes scarred, bein weak one time ya hard

So I sucked up my peer pressure, and my pride
And realized that this rap shit was gon help me to survive
Stay alive, go with the flow but don't be no muhfuckin fool

Too Short,"From the day we met up until we met right now
If I wanted that girl I always knew how
To fight her get her and tear her apart
Getting everything I wanted all I want

Everytime I see her its time to toss
I walking in the door taking everything off
'Cause I know I'll get it call her in a minute
Short oh boy and I'm a tone cold playa

She was mine and more but more came more
She was giving that funk to the homeboy short
Wanting money but maybe it was just the fact
The life I live made me the man of the rap

Everytime I see her you know I take her
Straight to her house then I braker
If I don't see break she'll give me a call
Same ol' freak show having a ball

Breakdown
She's a tender a star and Angel in white
My wildest dream on a saturday night
My freak of the week but girl of the day

If I like it like that it will be that way
Now everytime I see her she be doing it slow
Like ninety on shorty in a big time room
She's the one I can't resist

Everytime I see her I tell her like this
Breakdown
She be coming around the mountain around ten till eight
Hook me up on a late night date

I be right there homie opening the door
Singing baby oh baby are you ready for more
Everytime I see her you know what I mean
Had her in the back doing sexual things

Same ol' freak show all them moves
Call me short homeboy and I just can't loose
Tone cold freak dressed in lace
The hottest young tender in the whole dang place

Hottie so hot I keep telling myself
I want the young tender if you read this
At lyrics dot astraweb dot com that means
This was bitten didn't waste one second

To take a chance

Yea you
I wanna ask you a question
Where is yo ass?
Baby, what happened?

A nigga like me I know what's up
I want a nasty bitch with alotta butt
If I can't find one anywhere
It turns my dreams to nightmares
Baby right there ain't got no ass
But she's OK if she's got cash
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

I'll tell you 'bout a day that I had
Seen nothin' but bitches with no ass
I woke up early feelin' shabby
Got juiced up with a big fat Cabby
Cause every morning you know I have
A big fat Cabby and a nice hot bath
Just soakin', smokin', Sir Too Short
Thinkin' about the day before
Thirty minutes after I woke out
I pulled a freak and took her to the house
She was Eleve Young, with alotta butt
She sucked my dick and then we fucked
That good tight pussy, I wouldn't pass
A light-skinned freak with so much ass
At 1 P.M. I was fuckin' away
I wanna do the same thing again today
I want bitches, bitches, and more bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

The day my story made itself
Every bitch I saw was flat as hell
I told myself I must need glasses
Where's them bitches with the big brown asses
Me and my group just wanna be tough
Freak two bitches then switch 'em up
It was 3:35, the strip was lit
Every two blocks I seen a bitch
But that ain't nothin' but a cat
None of them bitch didn't have no ass
Wait on the bus, some was walkin'
Me and my homie just started talkin'
I said, oh, she looks good
He said that ass is flat as wood
I said what about Vicky in the black
He said, Short, she's all that
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

The Invasion was on

Every single day of the week
For every nigga livin' there's a freak
If you've got game and a bed
Why not get fucked and get some head
Cause bitches all over wanna get worked
I just need one with alotta turf
Me and my homie, rollin' and smokin'
Flat booty bitches took over Oakland
I told my homie, I hate to say
All the bitches with booties stayed home today
And he said Short, what now?
Put the pedal to the metal and hit the B-Town
I thought them bitches out there was fine
But the invasion was on and it fucked my mind
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

We hit the B-Town like Oakland flares
I knew it, bitches was everywhere
The first one had tits so fat
But that don't work, her ass was flat
The second bitch was flat too
I capped on her like a motherfuckin' fool
I said be-atch, I know I'm cappin'
Where's your ass, baby what happened
She turned around and capped on me
She said, fuck you nigga, where's your teeth
I damn near fell jumpin' out the car
But I slapped that bitch, and slapped her hard
My homie said Short we gots to cut
But I was kickin' that bitch and her big flat butt
I kicked her ass, got in the ride
Looked at the bitch and said bye bye
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

The invasion was on

We parked the car and took a walk
I saw another bitch and I had to talk
I said baby, baby, baby come here
Yea you baby with your long long hair
Baby came over from across the street
She was standin' on the corner just talkin' to me
I was spittin' the game but I talked to fast
Cause I didn't even notice that big flat ass
Shit, and I was ready to go
We was rollin' back to the O
I told that bitch I changed my mind
She looked at me and she said why?
I said I'm Sir Too Short, the Oakland player
I'm not one of them niggas who don't care
It's no thang to do my duty
But not with you and yo flat booty
Flat ain't the date superstar
I could see if you was white, but your black as tar
Bitches, bitches, bitches

In the Berkeley temp, what did we find?
Freak after freak with no behind

Too Short,"Well I'm Too $hort baby, hear what I say
I never do work but I always play
Cause the game is life and I play the game
So you never talk down on a player's name
When I grab my mic I'm the one man crew
Talking bout me, wouldn't think about you
When you heard Too $hort came to town
You never would've thought I'd be looking down

On who? On you cause I'm so big
Me and my money is all I dig
I'm from the Dangerous Crew, we ain't no punk
We take 24 tracks, drop the funk on your ass
Beating like a dope fiend
Back seat riding in a limosine
Telling that freak all about me
The creater of greater, sucker MC's
Chilling out in the Oaktown singing a rap

No MC could rock like that
Now I say it like bitches say
No MC could rock my way
When I rap it's always great
Wouldn't care if it was like or on a tape
It's me, $hort, the one and only
Spitting that rap to all my homies
You know about you, you know I'm a star
When I rap too good I might take it too far
Had the whole damn crowd going wild
Cause I don't stop rapping, that's my style
Too $hort baby from East Oakland
I got more hoes than I can count on my hand
You got women? Well I got more
You don't know? Shit, I'm Playboy $hort
They call me ""Playboy $hort"" known everywhere
Had a life long dream to be a player
Way too cold at a younger age
It was every day, just make that page
Still playing the same, still young at the game
Never talk down on a player's name
Cause I'm big time, paid all my dues
I'm rich and famous and way too cool
People can't fuck with the way I'm rhyming
They say it's too slow but it bought these diamonds

Too $hort baby is the name I use
A '93 Lexus is what I cruise
Clean from the start, I thought I was it
I was Cadillac Slick in the dust I kick
But the Caddy got parked cause I'm riding new
Eastside bitch, so I'm siding, fool
Money everywhere, all over the floor
At the bank I'm known as ""Mr. $hort""
At the house I be chilling, getting some head
Writing raps all day, even in bed
And them groupie-ass bitches love this shit
The funk rap master, made to fit
Just her, I'm all in them guts
Homeboy can't fuck so I hooked it up
But young women like you with your big round butts
Blind girls driving down the street called ""Love""
Chasing that man, who really can't stand
Seeing your face so now you ran
And you don't realize what you'll soon see
The way making love is supposed to be
With a player known as Playboy Too
Rock a mic and a freak and you'll both be through
Players play women who like to get played
Bitched like you just trying to get laid
But I like money, and I get paid
I do my duty and say ""Good day""
I didn't want to make love, I'm not that fast
What the hell, she's a freak, she even asked
So let's go to my room, after the show
Treat me like a pimp, and pay me hoe
You can suck my dick and I might sing
Just love Too $hort, I'm everything
So cool, my name is ""Too""
Call it how you want but I won't call you
Ring my phone and you might see
Ringing my phone just won't get me
Cause I'm hard to find, and I get mine
And if I was looking for you, I wouldn't be in line
I'd be right on time in the right place
Too $hort baby all in your face
Talking bout mine and what I want
Fucking MC's with the Dangerous funk
I'm on my way, to the top
So much rapping I'll never stop
And all that fame, you might claim
Couldn't stand up by my rap name
You might be good, I don't care
I've been rapping like this 13 long years
I got more respect then you'll ever get
Cause I don't stop rapping and you know that shit
Sucker MC's with your record deal
Most tapes out now couldn't be real
Cause your tracks ain't shit, dreaming bout hits
But you'll find out Too $hort don't quit
When I grab my mic I'm the one man crew
Talking bout me, wouldn't think about you

Couldn't be devoted unless you lied

Too Short,"Once upon a time there lived a man
In a place that's known as East Oakland
He can rap to the beat like all the rest
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild West
With his gansta waves and gangsta hoods
He made friends with dealers and crooks
And when the party was on you knew he had come

It is like Gladis Knight and its five oh ones
Walking right up to the dj man
And give another emcee's rap
'Cause they knew about him and his gangsta rap
The fact they just couldn't manage that
He was known around to be the best
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild West

In a land where whips will watch the car
Tell you everything and they still want more
Where live is only give and take
In a land where the strong control the fake
He was known around for all the time
Everybody went wild when he said his rhyme
Said his manly man would come out
With his gangsta ride his turn back side
Out like Jessie Jackson in a land 
Where game that controls the lane
Yes the wild wild West that's the place

Suckers take a bite and don't even taste
The California lifestyle that I live
When the sun rolls out every chance it get
The wild wild West that's where you see
Emcee rappers make you look like wheat
'Cause you would never hang in the wild wild West
Without you hoopsta in the wild wild West

You can get down but I don't know where
You come out here you better act scared
'Cause we don't play don't come my way
When you sudden didn't fight you will say
Front me 'cause you'll front yourself
I'll leave you standing there mad as that
You can rap your best that's what you do
You just can't hang and you know its true
Like a homeboy said its one two three
West coast raps to the beat
You got have a lot of game to spit that rap
I want to put a little game to her just like that

Too short I thought you knew
You can't count three and then skip two
It just won't work but you might high
You the emcee from seventy five
Girls G.I.R.L.S. so fresh
Emcee rap through the wild wild West
Taking you the weed 'cause we don't play
Sucker emcee's do you hear me say
Front me... Front me...

Once upon a time there lived a man
In a place that's known as East Oakland

So rough hang tough in the wild wild West
With his non stop rapping and his West coast style
He had the whole dang party just going wild
Singing rhymes all time banging back
Turning eight out with the West coast rap
That's when the sucker emcee all came to be
Nothing but everyday sucker emcee's 
They were all his friends all his fans
Walk right up and make his man

And you always knew everytime
Sucker emcee's wish they could rhyme
Just like pimp but what's the fact
The fact they just couldn't get with that
They were all frustrated all mapped out
Didn't even know what to rap about
Homeboy do you agree?

And not worth kicking like a sucker emcee
'Cause much talk fresh and all them mad
Sucker emcee's couldn't make him mad
With a rap like his a rap like that
Now its time for a sucker to rap
The sucker emcee would just wait his turn
Sucker emcee's don't want to get burned
What emcee do you play?

He had the sucker emcee's all running away
Didn't want none you couldn't get them back
They never could deal with a real big mack
One emcee was the best
So rough and tough in the wild wild West
There was one emcee who knew the tip
And the sucker emcees don't even trip

So tell it to the world it's not to wise
'Cause you are an emcee from seventy five
Girls G.I.R.L.S. so fresh
Emcee rap through the wild wild West
Taking you the weed 'cause we don't play
Sucker emcee's do you hear me say
Front me... Front me...

Once upon a time there lived a man
In a place that's known as East Oakland
He can rap to the beat like all the rest
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild West
Just a true emcee didn't cash the cheques
Singing that's like this or raded that
Making a champ with a heavy weight rap
No emcee could walk like that
To a point that paid again and again
Saying wouldn't stop 'til he got a Benz

I never thought about it 'til the other day
He had drop chop rolling away
In an eighty five or eighty seven
Said he got paid 'cause he raps like this
You could see it in his eyes he was seeing stars
Choosing folks and having things
Just checking out the girls walking down the street
In the wild wild West that's where you see
The freshest emcees you will say is soft

From seventy five girl so raw
Like silky they and hollywood
They come so fresh 'cause you know they could
Like sir too short when I'm on the mic
West coast rappers rap all long night
So watch how you talk in the wild wild West
East coast rappers make us look fresh
With the save a hoe and everybody scream
East coast rappers make all the cream
With a New York rap and a New York slang
Not too many could spit that game

Now the time has come and I'll tell it right
About a rapper like me who will rock the mic
I'm making you wake up on the Western coast
Were giving you more than just the locs
Its everything you could never have
Took and spent your money to buy my rap
The wild wild West that's what its called
About the West coast rappers that stand so tall
The freshest emcees you'll say you saw
From seventy five girl so raw

When we asked your ass who started that 'bitch' word sayin from the get-go
(Biaatch) In 1982 I heard it from Too $hort
Moms and pops said, ""Turn it off"", but you stuck and said, ""Fuck rap from New York""
Cause your dick got hard, but you ain't seen a pussy or been in one
Listen to $hort, be ready to mack some bitches when it's done
It's some of that mackish Oakland street shit, 'bitch' wasn't no secret
But it got famous when we said it when that beat hit
When $hort dropped, niggas rappin now was infants
We taught you the pimp-player-mack game cause you didn't know the difference
You took the game and twist it, bent it out of shape
Payin a bitch, givin her free dick, savin, just without a cape

Keepin her payin you cash and put your dick in her face

I'm from Oakland, California where _The Mack_ was made
Grab a pen, start pimpin, like that, you're paid
But your game is shallow, not pimpin, you a car thief
Worse than a fake gangster rap to a hard beat
I tell it like it is, not sittin at the house thinkin music biz
I got love for the pimp game, niggas stop dissin
Daddy's in the house, and when you hear, pops listen
Next time you start mackin in a studio session
I got to charge his punk ass for lessons
Cause he want to be $hort Dog so damn bad, why'all
Bitin on my dick tryin to show that ass off
Workin that image just like me

Dressin up like the old days, the player's ball ain't Halloween
We give one in Oakland every year, stay home and keep your collar clean
Cause you're not like a player, more like a shade-tree, better yet a rest haven
Tuck your dick in your ass and watch your chest cave in
Where I'm from niggas be mackin hoes for bread and water
Mackin they wife, cause stackin is life and times is gettin harder
All of a sudden you don't know
That $hort said never love a bitch or a hoe?
Mark, so recognize that you learned it from the legendary Too $hort
You stole that image and stole that game, we claim that shit that you wrote
The slow beat, fat bass, and funky bassline
With a name like Mike Dog get bit from $hort Dog, I know it taste fine
Like givin a fool a ounce of coke, keepin his ass from goin broke
When he get rich don't give you shit, you saw him, but he never spoke
What? What part of the game is that?

Wear that hat like me, nigga, act like me
But I bet that muthafucka won't get fat like me

I been doin this for years, gettin bitches all the while
A real player gotta know how to lay his shit
Fake players get a bitch and don't be sayin shit
You a player? You get teased sometimes
I'm a pimpin-ass nigga makin g's for lines
Some call it gangster rap, even though it ain't
Won't nobody get shot while I spit this game
So call the pimp police, and just hold it
I put the game to the beat, and niggas stole it
Now some want to-be from Oakland pimp
Knocked two bitches, ain't broke em in
You ask me, that shit is foul
You want some money? Can't get it now
You gotta change your style, you can't pimp no more
My old tapes still sit in the record store
Sellin more than yo new shit do
You said you had bitches, nigga, who pimped who?
Cause you're workin in a warehouse now
Bout to blow your brains out tryin to wear my style out
You shoulda picked some other songs to rap

I used to be a broke-ass nigga from the Oaktown
Remember Too $hort? Bitch I ain't broke now
I sold 6 million albums since I got my start

That shit is easy, fucking with the Dangerous Crew
And kick back while I tell you about making the loot
Get in where you fit if you making it fast
Cause a real motherfuck might check your ass
Take all your loot, kick down your door
The word got around you's a bitch-ass hoe
Hanging with these same ass niggas that owe you cash
That won't pay your ass
Them niggas just owe you for life
Be all in your face every day and night
If you'd have broke their ass off years ago
For fucking off all them counts of dough
You wouldn't be a broke-ass nigga today
(I'm a get that shit back) Well I'd figure you'd say that
Cause you go way back, rewind and play it back
You just a fat fucking needle in the haystack
They should've just named you jack
Cause you ain't never gonna get that back
So reminice on the things you had
Cause you having money was just a fad

You working every day and can't never gat ahead in life
Stop punking out running cause you're scared to fight
You hang with nine broke niggas, you know the rest
Kiss a fake nigga ass and give a hoe respect
Lying all the time about your cash flow
And talking about shit that you think you know
Well motherfucker if you only knew
You made the next nigga rich while he stole your loot
You've been hoeing so long I bet you feel like a bitch
Why can't niggas like you get rich?
Cause you gotta be a hustler, can't be a buster
You ever get a ho, nigga, please don't trust her
Used to be rapping, now you slanging dope
Stressing so hard you want to hang your hope
Dreamed of owning a house, maybe two or three cars
Come up like a motherfucking movie star
But the shit ain't happened yet
And I'm an old-school rappin' vet
You trying to get your loot, I say you ain't some
Niggas get their cash, and some can't

All that shit you doing, boy you can't get rich

To see my face on the movie screen""
I tell ya nothing but game came out my mouth

""All you gotta do is fuck a few big shots
Cause if you can't do that, they're going to hold ya back""
She was sucking up the game, down to do all that
She said ""Short baby, I ain't no simp""
But the nigga in the suit ain't nuthin but a pimp
And all them white guys you had sex with
They weren't big shots, they were nothing but tricks

So now you know it ain't a damn thing changed up
Stayin' true to the streets since we came up
So blame us for givin' you the game plus
Much bass now the name is just Dangerous
So here we go, its time for some new shit
From 94 to 95 we can do this
So nigga just love this with no player hatin'

Still in this to win this so you can pretend this
Beat this like my dick in yo mouth, until I'm finished
The shit goes on and on and on
But when you gets no promotion
That ass is gone
In the studio all day puttin' in work
Hoes didn't give a fuck and man that shit hurts
Used and abused no pain no gain
Sure them hoes tried to play us, but we still in the game

Still in the game, after all these years
Been bumpin' so long I can hardly hear
Still got the same flow that I used to have
You can clown if you want, but don't do it too fast
Cause I'm gone slow it way down, than shoot your ass
And send you want to be pimps, back to class
Cause Ant Banks been making these beats too long
You trying to get with these funky songs

10 years chillin' in the game, well respected
But check this, some niggas don't give a fuck
Never be givin' us props, see we don't stop cause we don't give a fuck
We gets paid, so tell me what a nigga know
We hit him low with the bass, than we get more
Number one album, so where the fuck you at?
Doing sit-ups, stay off my dick still tryin' to rap
Damn, we never ballin' out of control
We open doors for the motherfuckin' O

Everybody up cause we all got to get it
And when you get your motherfuckin' chance nigga spit it

Sellin' gold weed, makin' money like a star
Wasn't old enough to drive, but I still bought a car
Ten years later, he was sellin' coke
Fuck with the nigga he was killin' folks
Had to do a couple of niggas or he would've caught the chrome
Hopped on the plane, straight got gone
10 years on the run, still in the game
Bounce back through the town ain't nothin' change
Caught a murder beef, but the shit was weak
Charges got dropped in less than two weeks
Nigga went through a lot, but his bank is fat
Tried to catch him up with them wiretaps
But that snitch then told
Its simple and plain
You can clown all you want, but we still in the game

You're just a big freak, you better not complain,
When you hear these cocktails and you hear your name.
If you a fake bitch, ain't no thing
I'll pick up the phone and call Danine.
If I call Marie, I know for a fact
I'm gettin' fucked in my drop top Cadillac
I met this freak named Naomi
Straight dick sucker worked me and my homies.
She had a girlfriend, her name was Vicki
I pulled her to the side and let her suck my dick.
She was fine as fuck, but can't fuck with Tina
Tina, Tina, the sperm cleana.
I took her to my house and told her strip
Baby got freaky-started doing the splits.
I said, ""Bitch! You can do what you want
Cause this true blue mack won't even front"".
I fucked her with my finger, she tried to cum
Pussy so tight, it wouldn't give me none
I'm Sir Too $hort baby couldn't be no punk
I'm trying to get freaky cause I love the funk
My dick is big and her nigga had a little one,
I didn't fuck her freaky ass, but it was still fun.
I know you stop and wonder just what it is

It's the California lifestyle that I live.
My name is Short, my game is long
I freak these hoes and sing these songs.
I know this girl named Annette
Get her all alone and she'll suck your dick
Hella freaky, won't say no for shit
You and her all alone, nigga that's your bitch.
I know another freak her name's Joanne
I always get the pussy 'cause I know I can
Finest bitch around, ain't got no man
Every time she cross my mind I go fuck her again.
She's like another bitch named Christina
Bitch so dumb, I named her misdemeanor
'cause it had to be a crime to be that dumb
I took her to my house and she let me cum in her mouth
You know I did all that shit
She got my number, if she beep me, I'm gonna call that bitch,
And go dig in them guts like a gardener,
If she starts screamin', I'm gonna fuck the bitch harder.

Cause these are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales I tell so well
You don't like my dirty rap you can go to hell
'cause Short Dogg's on the mike tellin' cocktails.

I meet the groupies, hookers like Kathy,
Fucking M.C.'s cause she's so nasty,
See her backstage trying to throw that ass,
She just like the freaks and she had to pass me that pussy
You can't stop the bitch
Let her roll on my rolls then I drop the bitch
My name is Short my game is long
I freak these hoes and sing these songs.
I know another girl named Stephanie
Do anything she can to have sex with me
She really don't bring out the best in me
But I love her fine ass laying next to me.
She's like another freak named Nicole
So damn sprung on my diamonds and gold
I took her to my house, she gave me the panties
I fucked her so good she told her friend named Angie.
Angie called me up about two weeks later
Talking some shit about do me player
So I did her just like Tamara,
Taking naked pictures with my Polaroid camera.
Next they told a girl named Rocquelle
Got my skin all under her fingernails
She was diggin' in my back while I grind the shit
That was way back now I can't find the bitch
But if I do, I'll probably do the same again
Break the bitch for everything 'cause I came to pimp.
I'm Too Short baby, I don't stop mackin'
I grab the microphone and I don't stop rappin'
You can bet your life as I spit these raps
I'll be fucking em' up like that, bitch.

Short Dawg baby don't fuck for free

I ain't nothin' like Mike, I don't play the court
I play bitches, don't you want to be like Short
First off, I never would trick you hoes
You work hard for my money that I get from shows
And some even ask about my Rolex
Bitch this came from my platinum checks
So break yourself and drop to your knees
I'd rather have ya mop cause you might have fleas
And even mangie mutts love to fuck
They ain't scared to make a buck
So bust a nut bitch
And tease the next one fuckin' with me
Cause if you be with me, I'll have ya workin' the streets
Short Dawg
Their ain't no love involved
Do that old sick shit, and lick my balls
Don't pause cause ya niggas wish you was me
But to be like Short, you don't fuck for free

Whats up $hort?
Hey, ya know they been waitin' on this ol' school game
Let's bring that game back!
Like game one through five?
Yeah nigga, just like we use to do it!
Well check this out

Game! Is the shit
Like what? A rat-haired bitch

I was sittin' at my home, all alone
Thinkin' 'bout bitches I use to bone
Tight young bitches, I can't deny
Rat-haired bitches, I can't lie
The bitch had body is all I know
Only 18 but looked twenty-fo'
Her name was Bitch, class of '92
Skyline High and the shit was cool
Took her to my house, Moms was gone
Turned off the light, unplugged the phone
The bitch said ""Fred, I hearda you
Anything you want, I will do""
I dropped my drawers, dick all swoll
She couldn't believe the position was pole
In and out, out and in
I used the bitch like a ATM
G'd the bitch like the one and only
Bust two nuts and called her phony
She couldn't believe what I said
The next thing you know she was on my head
Suckin the dick like it's suppose to be done
Rat-haired bitch make me cum
Freddy be	 that's the name
Rat-haired bitches, I got game

'cause Game
That's the shit
Like what? (Like what?)
A nasty bitch

I like to fuck a nasty bitch
Witta big fat ass and shit
First lay, dick gettin' sucked
Bitch don't give a fuck
'cause real players run that game 
When I fuck that bitch she won't be the same
'cause when Short Dawg run up in it
Fuck a bitch for about 30 minutes
Real player-like, straight to the point
Bust a nut while I'm smokin' a joint
Stop fuckin', still smokin'
Lay my dick on her lips, say ""Open!""
Ain't nothin' like a nasty bitch
Acting all fast and shit
Bitch just love to flirt
When I see her at the club, I'll be puttin' in work
Feelin' on her ass at the bar
Let's get a room, girl it ain't too far 
On the way, ya know what happened?
She sucked my dick while I was rappin'
I just couldn't resist
I couldn't hold back, I said ""Biatch!""

Game!
All I do is stack
Like what?
A motherfuckin' mack!

My Copue DeVille is all white
Yes bitch, it's hella tight
Crush blue velvet, gameless game
White on white wit the gold things
Bounce tp the spot, check my crap
Wash, wax, straight on fat
The bass on heat every time I ride
A long haired bitch on the passenger side
Mackin' on the cellular phone
I can't be stopped, 50 G's strong
Fred Benz, Freddy be	
Oaktown, a bitch don't sleep
A motherfuckin' mack that's what I am
Taxin' a bitch like Uncle Sam
She pays the tax, Fred Benz' the pimp
16 G's put the bitch in
No ordinary game, just give it and take
East Oakland can't be fake
I slapped the bitch, the money was short
Macked on the bitch and now she knows
Fred Benz baby, the game is fat
Ask these bitches, I'm a mack

Game!
Is like ridin' vogues
Like what?
Breakin' hos

Breakin' hos day and night
They call me Shorty The Pimp, my game is tight
I never do give hos slack

So bitch break yourself
I'm an Oaktown nigga, I'll take your wealth
'cause that's what I was raised to do
Break these bitches, get payed fool

Any bitch I get, you can't take her
'cause the game is fool-proof
Bet'cha momma say I'm tellin' ya true
So won't you pay the man
Hundred dollar bills all in my hand
While I break you bitches
Tell a story 'bout ridin' with bitches
'Bout these pimp ass niggas from The O

[Chorus:]
Ohhhh, givin up the funk [2x]
[Short Dawg:]
Now I'm about to get with this funk shit
And talk real bad to a punk bitch
Cause I'm that nigga she'll dream about
Stickin my dick all in her mouth
Cause that pussy don't last and i'm on the hunt
Bitches like that is all I want
But you playin that roll and can't say why
Bitch get wit it lets fuck tonight
It ain't cool, don't come with that shit
I'll fuck that fat ass from the back bitch
Tappin that ass like Gregory Hines
You can have this dick, but them legs is mine
Bitch, the pimp game is the motto
I'll put you in the back of my El Dorado
Make that money so the story goes
Ride that bitch like a set of vols
Dip in dip out of that traffic jam
Freaky little bitch gotta have it man
She like to get that money from all you tricks
Shit sound better than Parliament
I heard you was a hoe
Where's ya pimp?
Bitch chose me and quit fuckin with him
Old once a month funky cock bleedin bitch
Can't do shit except make me rich
Yep
[Chorus]
[Peewee:]
You love to fuck around for free
But now you fuckin round with Peewee
And being fine just ain't enough hoe you's a diamond in the rough
So I'm sendin yo ass to D.C.
Get me some cash to get my ?indica?
Make my cd's, you tossin senators
You can't get crossed up with the pd's
They payin a cost to get g'd
You got frost on your knees
Fuckin and suckin them d's
They usually be havin you cheesin
I got the hook up for suckers
Skeezin for fees and you just send me them duckets
I'm buying beatin disease
You tellim me what you want bitch
You givin up the funk
But you gotta pay a lump
To this nigga name Peewee
From the are-I-see-H-M-O-N-D
Bitch you can't hang with me cause yo ass is scandalous
Bitch fuck it damn, that's the end
These bitches want these inches off the dick, cause I'm with the Dangerous
Crew
Motherfucker you's a punk and I can't hang with you
[Ant Banks:]
Yo, be comin straight out the pussy
Holdin my nut sack, quick let me bust that rap
How hoes get cussed at
Rashy, you was a warthog, now you's a muskrat
So tramp, I ?? your tramp to much bleedin
Tryin to pursue me, screw me do me
Wanted to do me, started to chew me, then she blew me
Ya'll stay off my level six
You can't proceed I'm like a rebel kid
Makin the devil get
Mad, when the bass and treble hit
So wise up
Keepin yo eyes up
I'm lookin for bitches and bitches to size up
I bust one and thumps one
I bust two and rise up
I'm ready to slide my dick in something hot as wet as you
I bet its you
I'm with the Dangerous Crew, so let us through
Give up the pussy, give up the head
Drop yo panties and rub your clit
Do the splits, rub your tits
Yeah, I like the freaky shit
So give it up to me straggla
Fuck the cheese and bragger
Before I knock her out, beat her down and drag her
Cause niggas be takin the pussy
Just give it up to me bitch
Don't fight it
The last bitch that tried it, don't fight it
I'm just like a bloodhound
You lick my balls and give me a rub down
You want me to eat your pussy, but you stank bitch
Go scrub down
I get up inside the pussy, spend my day in it
Lay in it, play in it
Wake up and go to sleep and still stay in it
Imagine my dick's the basketball
Yo pussy is the basket
I'm a dunk, smell the room you stank bitch
Cause you gave up the funk
[Chorus]
[M.C. Breed:]
Now as I slde on this track, I won't be dissin no bitches
I'll just be clockin my riches
Now bare witness as I spit this
Shit that give you the mumps, cause it bumps so tremendously
And niggas be knowin they flowin up tigh as they pretend to be
Some shit that they ain't
Some niggas front, but I can't
I'm sippin tough on the drink
And makin barrels of bank
Yeah, so niggas save that punk shit
I'm comin with that funk shit
See that's how i was raised and my real niggas want this
So nut up or keep walkin
And shut the fuck up when grown folks is talkin nigga
Before you get your back broke
Now what you want to fuck with a Oakland city mack for?
The place you can trip on
Where the niggas be mackin, stealin, killin and pimpin to get they crip on
And take it to the next phase
We goin city to city, leavin hoes in a daze
That's why they call me bad ass
Cause I be puttin boogers on bitches and fartin loud with my fat ass
But yo, I gets paid for that
And its a fact I was strictly just made to mack
So what the fuck you know about me
A loked out, funky ass pimpin OG
Fool, you can open your eyes but you can't see
I just gave up the funk, now I'm O-you-T
[Chorus]",Giving Up the Funk,1995
Too Short,"Aw hell nah nigga
We ain't doin' no freestyles
Don't even know how to do that shit
Yeah whatevah
Check it out man, check this one out

I been rappin' for half my life
I'm twenty-eight now sayin' pass the mic
If you eighteen or nineteen speak up fool
I was born on the mic before you went to school
Talkin' bout pimp shit, you know whassup
I wonder if you mom'll let you play that stuff
Now you're flowin like your name is water
But I'm ten years older and my game is harder
I'm not tryin' to say you're out there dissin'
I'm just tryin' to say lil nigga listen
Before you grab the mic and act wild
Bitin' on the next nigga's mackin' style
And it's all from head, passin' round the mic
Never even care who you sounded like
Sound like Snoop Dogg, then you switched to Treach
Bit the Pharcyde then A Tribe Called Quest
And you gots no respect for me, is that right?
Well jump your ass on the train witcha backpack tight
and keep rappin', I'm floatin past all the stops
In a clean ass Benz I have all the props
Fuck credit from a rapper can you match my Visa
I heard your girlfriend was a real dick pleaser
And a Too Short fan, faithfully
When I came to your town she couldn't wait to see me

To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin'
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin'

Let me tell you somethin' bout a nigga named Short
Rappers always talk about the way I can't flow
But let me hit the mall with the same MC's
I be signin autographs, spend a gang of G's
While you walkin round broke, nobody knows ya
Lookin' like you smoked a whole sack of doja
Outside in the parking lot in front of the cars
Standin' in a circle with some wannabe stars
Freestylin', but you ain't original
You just shootin everything and you pimpin' hoes
And to think you could hang with me
I never would spit this game for free
I'm the T-double-O, S-H, O-are-T
I rock all stages and any parties
Any my style is gettin' bank
Gettin' head, gettin' hella dank
I drop my top when it's hot and sunny
So how you talk shit when you ain't havin no money
I set trends in the rap game bitch
And gives a fuck when other rappers talk shit
I know you motherfuckers, heard me rap
So hard, I put your momma in my dirty rap
No shit, the old bitch sucked a damn good dick
Put them legs up high she couldn't handle it
I'm not a no good punk, I coulda macked your mother
But Life is Too Short, so I kept it undercover
Now you're all grown up, with your partners rappin'
But old Short Dawg'll your ass what happened
To a fake MC, who tried to get with me
I ended his career, instantly

And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin'
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin'

Now let's compare the lifestyles, of me and you
You're phony and I'm all about bein true
You drive a bucket, that you bought for a G
I ride around snuffin them fo'-eighteens
In the back of a motherfuckin big ass truck
Jump two rows back and get my dick sucked
Benzos, Lexus, Rolex and Caddy
Fine lil bitches havin sex with Daddy
I ain't givin no bitch, no kind of slack
You got one girl then treat the hoe like a mack
What's yours is hers, she don't trip
Sucker ass nigga need to check that bitch
But you're so weak, and it shows in your rap
I'm out here, gettin hoes livin fat
While you at home, gettin sweated by your mamma
I bought my mother a house in Atlanta
And you can't stand it, so whaddayou say
Too $hort can't rap, no fuckin way
But here I am, workin in the studio
And your album ain't out because you're movin slow
By the time you make one I'll be on ten
Hit the studio nigga, and do it again

To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin

Now ask New York, can Too $hort flow
Ask Detroit, they'll let them niggaz know
Then ask Philly, can I rap
South side of Chicago, who's the mack?
I never ever tripped on the shit that you spit about me
Everytime I perform, I make a lot of G's
Cause I'm paid for this motherfuckin rap shit
Eatin good like a motherfuckin fat bitch
Every single day at the house what's wrong wichu
Eatin fast food if you only knew
I understand though, cause I been there befo'
Eat any damn thing and got nowhere to go
Daydreams, about bein great
It all started back when I was sellin tapes
in eighty-two eighty-three eighty-fo' on up
Waitin still waitin just to blow on up
And when it happened, I still had to wait
I didn't get paid til eighty-eight
I made nine albums in nine years
I'm a true blue West coast pioneer
Dr. Dre, Ice-T, and all the rest
All that money we makin don't fault the West
Cause we ain't the ones who created rap
But when we made the shit, we made it fat

And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin

Too Short,"Sup?
Short Dogg back in the house beeyatch!
And it don't stop to the beat
Ain't no thang but a chicken wing
We gonna do it like this one mo' time

Straight from Oakland, California I'm back again
Short Dogg's on the mic 'bout to mack and pimp
We got flavor at the Dangerous Crew camp
Save ya money, can't use dem food stamps
Other crews like to sample and mix
But our crew, we just play that shit
Live, drums, bass, keys
Niggas don't like it, you can get bees
Stuck in the back of your throat
Fuckin with a pimp named Sir Too $hort
We coulda sampled the Luke but we didn't
I'd rather treat ya like a ho and start pimpin
When will you other brothers realise?
Can't fuck with my crew better feel your eyes
'Cause you must be blind if you can't see
And I'ma say this shit quite frankly
I give a fuck when freestylers step up
I don't do it, tell you 'bout it on the next cut
'Cause right now we gotta feel the flow
And make sure we keep it real slow
Just like the motherfuckin Dangerous Crew
We gettin funky like it's 1972
Still puffin on them zags, dressed like pimps
And axe Ohio Players once again
Can we sample the funk?

Y'know we don't want to wear it out
We just want to lil' piece, why'knowhati'msayin?
We ain't goin loopy, we're goin freaky
We gonna funk it track for track
Dangerous Crew style
Ant Banks let me flip this one more time
Ya ready?

All you brand new rappers got a new flow
You ain't samplin James Brown no mo'
Probably try to sample cameo
Parliament Funkadelic, you scandalous ho
You stole it, Ossie Brothers, Bark Kays
Barry White, Isaac Hayes
Have you heard the term 'Sample Clearance'?
Start the nigga who wrote it, would never hear it
Now we're suin your ass for sure
Got'cha spendin all ya money 'cause you need a lawyer
You got problems and ya need ta solve em
Ya shouldn't of sampled wouldn't of had dem problems
If you'd have played your own shit
You wouldn't be broke, you woulda made ya long grip, bitch
But that's irrelevant now, my friend
'Cause they done wiped you clean like Ant Banks' Benz
Sittin on some three-piece AMG's
Better find you a sample, you ain't playin these
Kinda beats, so funky make your fingers pop
If you can't find a sample you ain't got
Not one damn thing for a nigga to ride to
But I been gettin funky since I was in high school
Growin up in that Bootsy's rubber band
In '76, seen a mothership land
Nothin but funk all in your face
I like to slow it way down in ass and bass
'Cause that's how we be layin tracks
Just flip the funky rhyme and start sayin raps
Get funky with Ant Banks, PeeWee, Shorty be	
Father D, Dope D, Tony T
The motherfuckin Dangerous Crew
And that's the drop from the dime, we'll change the groove
Just to sample the funk

Beeyatch!
That's right, PeeWee friggin the keyboards
Tony T on the drums, Shorty be	 on the bass
Ant Banks on the mixing boards, Short Dogg on the vocals

Right now you know the story of Too $hort baby
First started rappin in 1980
I got more game than Monopoly
Now I'm makin money there ain't nobody stoppin me
Used to be local til I signed with Jive, man
Used to like to sample now I'm rollin with live band
Now that I finally did this shit
I'm makin one more album and then I quit
And only one thing could make me say I'm not
And that's one million dollars on the spot
Upfront cash, money, no compromise
No schemes, no scandals, don't front and lie
Just pay the man in full
Thirty years old, torch the bull
Ain't givin shit up but the funk
Let these record companies know what the fuck I want
'Cause they been fuckin black folks right from the start
When you sign that line tear your ass apart
For every one you get they gettin five
Niggas gettin paid but it don't seem right
I know where I came from and know where I'm at
And my last two albums don't sound real bad
I'm Too $hort baby, I ain't no punk
I'm just askin 'Can I sample the funk?'
So can we sample the funk?
Bitch!

Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?
I'm talkin to George Clinton, Bootsy Collins
My nigga Suga Foot and Diamond from the Ohio Players
I'm talkin to James Brown
We know where the funk came from
Johnny 'Guitar' ????
To all y'all niggas, y'all can sample all you want
Here we go loopty-loo
'Cause the Dangerous Crew goin to get funky like this
Flip it!",Sample the Funk,1995
Too Short,"Simpty is for them simp ass niggas
Talkin' lot, til I spray dumpin' ? niggas
Whenever talkin' shit, I straight rip 'em
And niggas know I come equip when I whip them

You say how can I make these dirty raps
Number one albums, back to back
If it was 1950, do you think I sell, no
They probably throw me straight to jail
I tell you life just ain't what it used to be
Between you and me, exclusively
Everybody's changed, were losing our minds
The government won't help, cause they refuse to find
A solution to the problems of the inner streets
Its a shame what our kids are beginning to be
Pregnant teenagers, young gun slangers
There ain't no love, there ain't nothin' but anger
We don't go to church and can't pray in school
Listen real close to what I'm sayin' fool
I know kids who went to school together
Now they all grown up, tryin' to kill each other
Shootouts on the playground is where it goes down
But back in the day, we rode the merry-go-round
And some little kid might shoot me tonight
And I always used to wonder what the future be like
Curse words on the TV and radio
You want to see sex, turn it on HBO
Late at night, you see women freak women
Sex sale, that's why I keep pimpin'
I grew up in the 70s', somethin' like Crooklyn
But I was in Cali not Brooklyn
I could tell the whole world was going crazy
But it really didn't happen til the 80s'
With free basin and smokin' crack
A lotta people learned not to joke with that
Streets flooded, with homeless folks
Whole families, lives gone up in smoke
We're all related to a crackhead
Sometimes I wake up in the mornin' and want to go back to bed
Layin' these thinkin' bout things
About the way life change
How women used to like to wear decent clothes
Now they curse like men and dress like hoes
You supposed to be a virgin til you marry
But teenage girls find it normal to carry a baby
Babies havin' babies
Rappers like me always disrespectin' ladies
Wonder why its like that, well so do I
But I just turn my back and then I go get high
Cause I get paid real good to talk bad about a bitch 
And you bought it, so don't be mad I got rich
Ask your grandparents, is life the same
Man thangs change

There used to be a time when old folks were respected
Kids talkin' back was never accepted
Get spanked and your mouth got washed out with soap
But kids nowadays will curse out old folks
Then you tell me I need to be a role model
And get these babies off the 40ounce bottles
But I'm not the one who made alcohol legal
Liquor stores on every corner that's why we go
Buy 40 ounces and go get drunk
Don't respect our kids, like no good punks
And then they grow up to be hardcore criminals
Shoot 'em up, slang dope always pimpin hoes
I know its those that don't believe what I'm sayin on the mic right
So Baby D won't you tell them what its like

Its kinda hard comin' up as a youngster
Gotta deal with the roof that I'm under
Even though my moms got it hard
My daddy passed away, now I'm stuck without a father
But times have changed bro
I never ever seen Santa Claus comin' through the ghetto
But you know what I always see
I always see the white man robbin' the black man back G
And I don't even get in trouble for it
And I don't see nothin' forward
Always tryin' to beat the black man to death
Punk police want to hide behind your badge
Always tryin' arrest somebody
All we gotta do is beat him with the billy club
Here I come, I comin' with my gun
I'm shootin' in the head police now what

I tell you life is too short for it to be like that
We gotta be leaders, can't follow the pack
With all them fiends in the streets smokin' crack
What you give life is what it gives you back
Cause money in the ghetto ain't nothin' new
But when you get the money gotta know what to do
Buy you a business or buy you a house
Just so the police can't wipe you out
I heard it in the streets, they say you the man
So try to help your brothers and lend a helpin' hand
Now what we gone do

We came to stack some bodies, killin' everybody like John Gotti
I said we came to stack some bodies, killin' everybody like John Gotti
Now run up and get gun up the slack black
I'm hittin' blackjack in the casino when I mack slap
What you want to play like Al Pacino with this
Type of style with the lyricist this funk of hits
And the biscuits I drop
Motherfuckers know I come down and show me ?
I don't really care
From the front or the rear
Word to your mother I'm bout to smother and smear
Its that master all I intelligent
Chain that I swing from the others is irrelevant
For you motherfucker step up to the m-I-see
I'm down with Shorty, Ant Banks and Mally G
Its Malik and I freak it's obsolete
My technique motherfucker know I flow over beats 
Like water, slaughter dick in yo daughter
And my nuts up in her jaws when she suckin' on my balls
Yiggy y'all niggas best to ask somebody
Cause I'm shootin' motherfuckers down with the shotty

Its, its the motherfuckin' ghetto bastard",Thangs Change,1995

You heard about me
and now I'm fucking you from dark to the light
You must of thought I got nicer
Talking about Heiser
I'm an old dog and old dog's get wiser
Caught up in the game, got ya thinking while your doing this
You never did this, sucking on a big dick
What bitch? You better check the size, and recognize
When I'm between your thighs
Shit, I get hard from the sound of a kid rum
Riding down the strip with your diamonds and lil' dro
Shiny bald head catching sun rays
Smashing down the strip going backwards down runwas
Four eighteens with the zues and the zapto
Sounding like I'm riding out a concert at a rap show
Hit a back street and put the top up
Stopped at the light see some hoes watch 'em jock us
I'm so roll with my electric top
Hit a button, ain't gotta get out, fuck with nothing
Let the top just fold up and lay down
Slamming hard passing by the schools and the playgrounds
Everybody knows when Short's in town
Cause i keep the beats thumping hella-hard with my top down

Drop the top
Just drop the top

We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top
We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top

Nine albums out, ain't changed my talk
A thousands hoes walked on I'm still a dog
Ain't changed nothing but the hoe that I'm fucking
Still riding through the hood all the homies say ""Whats up 'nd?""
Give me my props cause i always rock 
And I still gets cock when the fine hoes jock
Still smoking Indo getting burned out
Still got the orange juice bottle full of gin 'bout to turn out
A show
A hoe smashed back to the O
Put them bitches on my beeper then pull some mo'
Cause I bump more hoes than acme
I guess you bitch can't learn that you just can't mack me
I'm off of Gin and Juice
Don't even introduce
If you ain't fucking back up cause I'm free to choose
I want some pussy that could make write a freaky tale
Drawls back, booty cracks, bitch in a hotel
Just to say you got some Too Short dick
You want to show some evidence, don't swallow don't spit
Cause I bust more nuts than a squirrel
And my dick been in pussies all around the world
If you had a picture of it and you asked the bitch
what's this?
I bet you say, ""Too Short dick""
I still taunt the fine hoes and get shot down
I say ""bitch!"", slam the beat
smash off with my top down

Just riding with my top down

We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top
We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top

We rode the AC transit bus
Selling joints for a dollar, smoking angel dust
On the way to a house party
A maybe deluxe
Slanging Too Short tapes
Making some bucks
Looking out the window at the Mustang and Falcon crew
Asking myself ""how can you?""
Roll like the Giants down the foothill strip
With beats thumping top down bumping a bitch
Shit I had to have drop
Didn't care, if I had a Volkswagon
Pick up the beat, had a hoes flagging
Siding with the top down, lit like a lamp
Blowing out the amp, trying to bump a tramp
Most niggas couldn't afford to have a drop top
So they got they shit cut at the chop shop
Couldn't tell niggas nothing way back then
A lot of niggas died or they went to the pen
Couldn't even see the homie Short Bubble
Bank get fat and my whole account double
When I walk in a club bitches say ""Oh God,
Is that you Todd?""
Me and my homies just who-ride
And take advantage of a life we never had
Fuck eating cheese sandwiches, broke, living bad
I'm a do it for my homies that's there to lock down
Ride with my beats slamming top down

Drop the top
Just drop the top

I got my top down

drop the top
Just drop the top

I'm just rolling with my top down

We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top
We call 'em rags, you call 'em drops
Whatever you call it just drop the top

Too Short,"I do it like the best of the greatest, not the worst
Like welfare day, can't stop the first of the month
Can't stop Short Dawg neither
Got a good hoe niggas sure better keep her
Cause I'm on the prowl, all the time
Tryin' knock every bitch so they all be mine
And I ain't never, ever gone change my ways
Drop a few lines, leave a bitch in a daze
Have her homegirls wonderin' what she do
Fucked around and gave me that pussy too
I be doin' this shit on a regular basis
Got bitches everywhere in all kind of places
I can pull out my little black phone book
Flip every last page take a long look
Than pull out a bitch, like a rabbit out a hat
Nigga if I want, I can have it like that
Fuck two or three bitches at the same time
Grab the microphone sing my rhyme
About them same three bitches that fucked me good
Us niggas gotta do what the fuck we should when we want to 
I might pass it
So get butt naked, shake that ass bitch
I'm bout as real as the stones in my diamond rings
You can hate my guts, but I'm gone do these things, bitch

Ah why have a nine, when I can have a ten
Lickin up the nuts, while I'm gone holler at her friend
Bitch, ain't no time for me to teach her
Rather have an everyday hoe, that umm knows how to treat a nigga
Thinkin' if she ain't lickin' me up
I'm givin' her to Short, cause he don't give a fuck
Do yourself a favor and quit callin' my house
If you really don't want this nigga to put this dick in your mouth
Um, have you seen my bitch?
I ain't seen her, but if I do she gets dick
That's what I'm givin' her just like that
To the front and back, nothing but the bozack
The second she get lonely, feelin' she can get her money
And she run to fuck her own ignorant homey
You a lost cause, yellin' pause when they drop the draws
It's entrapment, have yo nigga breakin' nigga laws
But it ain't a matter of mentality, it's reality
Open your eyes, realize bitches ain't nothin' but a casualty
But a factor to a nigga wanting fuckin' time
She's just an everyday, don't want to catch a fuckin' mime
Bitch ain't lying, so I thought you knew this
Bitch this is how I do this

You can call eight ball in the corner when you shootin' pool
But when you play the game of life, ain't no stupid rules
Gotta go for yours at all times
Cause if you don't, nigga yours will be mine
And I won't go to bed early, won't sleep too late
And I'll never take a punk ass bitch on a date
They say Too Short baby why you talk so bad?
Just a player ass nigga and that's all I rap about
Bitches, hoes and all that shit
She got my number, if she beep me I might call the bitch
And go diggin' in them guts like a gardener
If she starts screamin', I'm gone fuck the hoe harder
Just havin' fun with the bitch, as she sprung on my dick
Guess I'll pull it out and just cum on the bitch
And from New Year's Day to New Year's Eve
And everyday in between I will do these things, I won't stop bitch

I like to go to the club mix and mingle
Nigga plays his dick like a 12 inch single
Yeah, so what you bitches want to do?
Step to me you gots to do my crew, first
When I rehearse I change rearrange
My mentality will bring you to reality
You on me like cologne 'til now
I feel it's time for us to bone so I
Look and pimp the background
Look, listen put the bitch on lock down
See you hangin' out with me tonight
Everything's alright, but a nigga want to fight
Damn, that's a real player hater for ya
Fuck it, I'll be waitin' for ya

I'm droppin' lines like a mother fuckin' pimp at this shit
I'm gettin' hoes out they clothes cause I'm good at this shit
They callin' me the pussy jammer cause I'm breakin' hoes off
See I'm paid to be boss, I'm kickin' back at no cost
Never slackin', just mackin', money stackin' that's my motto
With so much game they want to play me like the lotto
Tip the bottle, now I'm drunk as a skunk
High off the dank, but I can't front
See I'm never being senile
See I'm smooth as a nail on a fingernail file
Keepin it wild, but in the meanwhile we the coolest
Sure enough this how we do this

I'm fingerfuckin' with my
Now they peepin' how a nigga climb on the chart
Ain't fear in my heart, I represent it from the start
Deep, my momma raised me as a g from birth
Be a hustlin' motherfucker 'til I sees my hearse
No doubt, I bust a shot for all my niggas in jail
All the young black males, that got slang yell
Cause its a hard life nigga only thugs survive
Ain't no love, unless a nigga slangin' drugs or high
Conversations with these bitches on my Mobil
Always in control and never let these bitches know ya
And even though I'm gettin' high, a thug nigga gettin' by
Catchin' bitches spittin' lies, I'm gettin' mine
All day, I puff a blunt and parlay and sometimes if we party
Gettin' my dick licked twice
And death to a trick's life, we can pursue this 'til my shit's right
Went from havin' fantasies, to havin' hoes leave they man for me
There is no realer man than me
The city of Oaktown laced me with my first case
When them punk police tried to break me
Didn't think the shit was cute, so I got a lawsuit
And made them punk police buy my coupe

Superfly top down speeding through the streets
Killers on the prowl,and jacking is how
They get paid pull out a gat and break your ass down
Nigga show no fear, but you scared as hell
And your partner riding with you is prepared to tell
But you don't know it yet, you havin' hella fun
And when the shit hit the fan and you on the run
You better pray if they catch your homeboy first
Cause if they put him under pressure, he bound to burst
Into a long conversation bout everything you did
No more tusslin', time to do a bid
In the brand new jail that they built for you
Where the smallest little thing you get killed over

(survivin' the game) 

Ain't to bailin' out, you mad as hell
Instead of send you to school, they keep you in jail
That cost way more, when you do time
When you creep through the hood and kill your own kind
They building county jails, and penitentiaries
They gettin' ready for the motherfucking 21st century
Computers taking over, money's obsolete
Now they buying all the houses in the ghetto streets
They way we live now, we can't last long
Cause everyday niggas gettin' they blast on
Funerals and court dates, plea bargain for your life
You'll be out in twelve years, once a month see your wife
Now how that sound?
You killed the black man, now they got you locked down
They let you learn a trade, working years for pennies
And that shit you building, was making white man plenty
Got the game fucked up,  and you'll never be rich
It's all about respect and they treat you like a bitch

I was born with the skills of a black man
To survive in the streets and keep stackin'
I'm thirty years old, and far from done
I don't care what you think, I ain't forgot where I'm from
East Oakland and that's where I learned
Everything I know, and when I got my turn
I never came fake on a microphone
I always let em know that the town is home
I wasn't born in Oakland, I was born a mack
Stay true to the game, always stating the facts
Bitch you can't stop my mack attack
I know you love this shit, when I rap like that
You never would get me to change my style
I spent 20 million dollars on a brand new house
I got bills to pay, no time to be fake
Eating top rump don't fuck with steak
Don't be jealous of me, cause it's well known
I could slip in a minute after hella songs
Make one fake album and I'm through
I be a broke ass nigga like you
So I just try to stay focused and do my job
Turn that shit up loud and watch a bitch head bob
Cause I'm the Too S-H-O-are-T
I take a square ass bitch and turn her into a freak

(survivin' the game) 

Now growing old in the streets ain't no easy task
Losing homeboys every time the season pass
Gettin' phone calls, another soldier dead
Sittin' in the car got four in the head
Rush to his mama house the shit is real
Trying to find out why a nigga got killed
I'm about to hurt somebody, give a fuck who
Cause you already know what you need to do
Kill another black man that's what you figure
Just what we need, another dead nigga
Got your guns you don't want none
You stupid motherfucker where they come from
From the white man, get em like fast food
With an attitude to make a nigga blast you
You little violent motherfucker don't play with me
Cause they ain't never ended slavery fuckin with my freedom

Too Short,"That's right, album number ten, Short Dawg's in the house
It's gettin close to the end why'all 
But we gonna kick it like this on the last album

Now let me holler at ya partner, spit this game
in you ear for a minute, quit complaining
Bout how you can't spend it cause you ain't got it
You got what it takes but not enough to get started
I hope you get the message, no it's not a test it's
Just me ridin legit, they can't arrest me or bust me
I'm still hungry, I want some more stuff
Get fat and watch my whole crew blow up
So get yours, and buy my new album
Peep the game and don't be like Calvin
Get everything you want, get real, get you mail
Get your girl to make bail and get your ass out of jail
You should be gettin it, everything you want
Everything you dreamed of, never have to front
you shoulf be gettin it, gettin money
I'm talking bout you black, don't laugh it ain't funny
You should get a good lawyer, like Johnny Cochran
Swear to tell the truth, hell no I didn't pop him 
Get your kids in school, so they can get an education
Get a degree, and take a vacation
You see I got all my game from the streets of California
Young millionaire with no high school diploma
Livin real good, taking care of my folks
roll up a fat one for the players to smoke
Short Dawg in the house, I know you ain't trippin
Cause Life is Too $hort you gotta Get In Where You Fit In
Stop looking for what you never seem to find
It ain't what you think you got to read between the lines
Cause life ain't long, for a young black man
Tryin to make money doing all he can
Sellin dope don't ya hope he would go to classB
But the boy makes money and he makes it fast
with the twenties on top and the fifties on the bottom
I fuck the top notches oh yes we got em
It's been a long time since I first got down
But I still keep makin these funky sounds
Get your money man
Get yours

You should be gettin it 
Get it while the gettin is good, get it while you can
you should be gettin it
Get it while the gettin is good

I know you tired of being broke just hanging out
You gotta lot a dreams but you can't get out
The first thing you need to do is set your self some goals
Think positive, everything else is old
and work hard, never stop hustlin
Cause they just love to see the black man strugglin
(So what are you saying Todd?)
It's time to come up, put your dollar bills in the air
He said meet me at the White House and I was there
Cause I'm one in a million, black man rising
They want to keep me down but I always surprise em
Spend my money in the hood, I know it's all good
and you should do the same I told you peep the game
Too $hort, you know I'm the man
I lend my brother a hand cause I know I can
I keep going and goin but I'm not the pink bunny
I'm not beatin on a drum I never stop thinkin money
I'm gettin all I can if you don't ya slip
I can't wait to get to heaven just to have a grip
When I was broke, I couldn't afford a meal
But now I'm now rich I can't be fake I gots to keep it real
It's been a long time baby since I first got down
But it still keep making these funky sounds

You should be gettin it 
Get it while the gettin is good, get it while you can
you should be gettin it
Get it while the gettin is good

I had this bitch locked on to me like she was way too clever
Man, Soopafly never ever ever
Fell for the do no and you know I'm
Too swift on my toes and the gifts of hoes
It's too much for me to be givin' to you
Uh, all I'm givin' is some dick in you
Now she agree, I told the bitch to blaze the weed
Now she blazed it but that ain't all she blew
Hey, I got knocked off on the bar
And my room got knocked off in the car
Gave it to me until I reached my peak
Baby flip talkin' bout lovin' me in the week
I said that's too damn quick, and too damn fast
You've been givin' up too much damn cock and giving up too much ass
Nah nah nah you ain't gettin' me like that
Soopafly ain't even called the bitch back
Ever since she tripped, I went on one
Stepped in the club, Caught me a home run
Baby was bad and all, she said gimme a call
I wanted to break that bitch like a law
Picked her up at the bus stop, she was soft and smooth
Talkin' bout what could pop out and hit the roof
Then she said somethin bout the cost
Man, that same bus stop is where 
I dropped that bitch back the fuck off
You can't ride my bird
So I kicked that bitch to the curb
You best to believe
You ain't got no trick up your sleeve that can get with me

I came through in a zoot suit, pin stripe lookin' too cute
Tryin' to get my shoot on, so I'm a scoot on
Over to the next bitch, say her name is Texas
She fly but she wasn't the sexiest
She had a hoe with her named Bama, short for Alabama
A big bad mama-jamma, now look here
I like big bitches cause they large
And big bitches always take charge
Want to grab a skinny nigga like Snoop Dogg
Cause you like it tall, go and work it baby doll
Now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of
Got a lot of cash for a little love
All they want to do is take you down to the mall
Floss a little dick and get a t-shirt that say miss Snoop Dogg
I don't see a god damn thang
That's stoppin you from buying me that god damn ring
It'd look nice on my finger, I'm a buy you a zinger
Cause you make me feel like a real hip-hop singer
Your homegirl, bring her cause I've been dying to meet her
You know I won't cheat her, don't mistreat her
She only get the dick, I'll never ever eat her
But I'll drop her ass cause you know I don't need her
It was fun while it lasted
You know what they say, big things come in small packages, baby
   
You thought you had my grip
But Snoop Dogg never ever slips
You thought you had my cash

I said bitch, what are you smoking
A big fat dick comin' from east Oakland
There must be some kind of misunderstanding
Hit the parking lot, bitch I be standing by the Benz
You think a nigga rich, bitch
Gold diggin' tramps tryin' to get with this dick
For all the wrong reasons
Niggas ain't trippin' during pimp season
But you still jumped your fast ass in anyway
If any other nigga picked you up it'd be payday
I rolled to my house with the bitch
(What'd you do $hort) introduced her mouth to my dick
Glad to meet you, make yourself comfortable
You fuckin' with a dog, bitch you ain't fin' to come up, hoe
So you might as well enjoy the ride
And serve this nigga from the east-side
How much for the game that I'm sellin'
Ain't no tellin' like Jack told Helen
I know sex sells but I'm a tell you though
Couldn't spend on shit that ain't valuable
Fucked all night woke up the next mornin'
Told her I'm a pimp but the bitch kept on
Wantin' me to do somethin' for the time she spent
It's funny, cause now she can't find the rent money
   
You thought you had my grip
But Too Short never ever slips

Ain't no bust partner, that's the third week 
I'm going to pimp these hoes, they can't work me 
How the hell you think I get to ride a B-12? 
The phone and TV ended with a green smell 
I went from Oakland to Atlanta with my top down 
Short Dog, my shit is nation wide now 
You can ask Breed or Pac it don't stop 
I ain't bull shittin' make a mill when I rock 
Three players in the game and it's a major 
Bitch you want to get me better hit me on my pager 
Today I'm on the west coast 
Tomorrow I'm in Texas 
Flip the Benz and Farri, sold the Lexus 
Shorty drop the bass in the mix 
You know what's next bitch 
I'm sure to get rich

Ha ha 
I'd be the thuggin' ass outlaw 
Til my fuckin' casuct drops 
Fuck around and make me blast on these bastard cops 
This is for the hustlas 
Believe me coming stapped with the gak 
When you see me 
Label me a threat to society, but I ain't quitin'
Thug life motherfucker ain't no bull shittin'
Born in these projects destined to fate 
Collecting mail on these broke bitches 
Slanging that game 
Now shit done changed 
It ain't the the same 
I ain't lyin' niggas are dyin'
Three strikes have you motherfuckers flyin'
In the penitentiary or in the cemetery 
Gettin' high no need to worry 
Last year niggas knockin' up the block and in between shots 
Pumpin' tapes from that nigga Breed and Pac 
This year bringin' you the fix 
Including Ant Banks in the mix 
We're sure to get rich 
Still I ride.
 
[Chorus]

I'm a cold-hearted fool 
I mean a fool at heart, head strong 
And I won't be headed home if he falls apart 
Contact niggas like a part time 
When I ride the beat 
Ain't no way to hide from the dark side 
Man of many men's till the very end 
And blend in and change my iden 
Just to mix up with the game 
They know me by the Breed and they don't know it's my last name 
It's mind over matter 
I don't mind, you don't matter 
Pull a glock and watch the whole block scatter 
And we can have us a gak to gak talk 
Do it old style and do a back to back walk 
Count to ten and say goodbye to your friends 
And we can put the bull shit to an end 
I figure if he plays around he lays around 
And he's a motherfucker ? calls a corner when I'm around 
Bodies are buried and found all around 
And parish and charish and thoughts just to be true 
Punk, fellas behave ya and it just might save ya 
So guard your girl and pickup your pistol 
Cause you can't get wit Breed the weed head lyrical nit wit 
The shit won't change as long as I'm alive 
I gotta survive and keep it tight

Can a nigga make a bee-line
To that nappy area?  Don't want to marry ya;
Just want to bury ya head in a pillow.
Sorry, but I got a kill yo' pussy-willow.
Janked ass penicillin; ain't got ta ask how ya feelin';
I'm tha nigga that got ya squealin'.
Ya want to know how we keep these hos in check? 
Keep them broke, and keep their panties soakin' wet.
I like to smoke big, ride fat, and always stack cash.
Believe me, keep her breezy with her fat ass.  (Fat ass.) 
Big thangs on my mind; ain't trippin' at all.
They call me $hort, but I got a big dick in my drawers;
I feel like a giant sometimes; bitch, don't stare,
You'll go blind from my diamonds
Tryin' ta size me up, but basketball I ain't playin'.
Call a tech; blow the whistle; throw the bitch out the game.

We got bosses in the back, countin' the stack.
We got cunts in the front, with Hennesey and blunts.
Now what you want? 
She want to get fucked all night long; bitch, what's up? 
You know I got a tight song;
Heard me on the radio; I can't go wrong.
But you ain't got no features; this can't go on.
You're like a bundle of joy, but you're unemployed.
You ain't throwin', so the pussy is just null and void.
Do you really understand what I'm tellin' you?
Looks can be deceiving, and bitch, I ain't even feelin' you.

Best believe me; it ain't easy, to be off the heazee.

To the salary; that'll be cash or charge.
So large; got a whole floor actin' mirage.

Of big beautiful bitches with big brains.
Bitches with big brains; I went to Spelman College
To see if my dick could get some higher knowledge.
But pussy is pussy, from Bel-Air to the projects;
Bitch better suck my dick.
Ain't nothin' new; the game is old.
You think the bitch is decent, and that's the same old ho;
Used to fuck the whole crew; we was ballin', man.

You can't handle being with a G, I guess it's scary

Too Short,"These are the tales, the freaky tales
The tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales, the freaky tales
The tales that I tell so well

I met this girl, her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked the microphone
When I met Joan, I took her home
She was just like a doggy all on my bone
I met another girl, her name was Ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann, I soaked her pans
We ended up freakin' by garbage can
The next young freak I met was Red
I took her to the house and she gave me head
She likes to freak was all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
There's another girl, her name is Mary
Talked about sex and the girl acted scary
I heard she was freakin' for my homeboy Jerry
Took her to the house and I popped that cherry
Young and tender, sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast
I tell you, homeboy, if you get a piece
She only talks about signin' a lease
I met this tender, her name was Lori
And a X-rated movie wouldn't tell her story
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa
And just like Lori, she's a real dick pleaser
My girlfriend's name was Michelle, 
Her booty was bigger than a tale on a whale
When i freaked Michelle, I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than flames in hell
I G'd this girl, her name was Tammy
I didn't want to do it cause the bitch was flammy
She had a best friend, her name was Jane
I pulled to the side and I spitted that game
I met a lot of freaks in my lifespan
Freaked one night with a girl named Pam
The very next day I saw her with her man
One week passed and I was in her again
I had an old tender, her name was Janine
She was thirty-two and I was only eighteen
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans
I want to big freak, fat and sloppy
I kick on back and I watch her mouth
Two tons of fun, big mama jama
A country-girl from Alabama
I met this girl, her name was Betty
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as hell, I was drippin' sweat
But I was all up in her tryin' to hold my breath
Bake and shake us, I met this freak in Vegas
She said her name was Donna
She was a built little freak from China
I said I don't pimp or gigolo
I'm havin' so much money that I don't need a hoe
You can break yourself but you can't break me
You never met a player like $hort, baby
I knew a dick sucker named Betty-Jo
Took her to my home and we did it on the floor
The girl got freaky and I tell you more
She was down on her knees beggin' to blow
She's like another freak named Rene
You get her alone and she'll make your day
Like Burger King, she knows the play
But a freak like Rene, you can have it your way

These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well

I met this girl, thick as hell
Only sixteen, said her name was Linell
I took her to my house, I could not wait
Her shit was much tighter than Central Safe
Let me tell you this since we talkin' young
I met another girl, said her name was Yvonne
Always talkin' about havin' fun
Once again in the bed I got it goin' on
I'm Sir Too $hort, couldn't be no punk
I try to get funky like female funk
So when you see me comin' or see me goin'
I keep my money, let the hoes keep throwin'
I once met a tender, she did it for free
On the Foothill bust number forty-three
All the way on the back she was workin' me
Had my big beatbox and I was jammin' the beat
I met this freak named aunt Winell
Macked on the baby like an ice-cold vet
Everythin' she had is what I get
Cause I'm Too $hort, baby, I don't play that shit
I met another freak, her name was Rita
Baby thought that $hort just might eat her
I told her like this, she can suck my peter
Or even go home cause I  knew I didn't need her
Scratched her name off my telephone book
Never again I took a second look
Cause the next young freak, her name was Sharon
She kept lookin', well, I kept stairin'
Her booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearin'
She never left, she cutted out
I know you all know what I'm talkin' about
There's a freak named Shannon, such a sinner
She smokes that pipe and she's gettin' thinner
Shannon is cool but her mind is gone
One fat rock and it's goin' on
She had another buddy, came by my place
Thick ass bitch, said her name was Grace
She walked in the door wearin' a lace
You shoulda seen that look that was on my face
She's like this tender named Belinda
Homeboys call her Belinda the Blender
She gave head like she made it up
She was twenty years old with a big round butt
Had a girl slick like olive oil
Her father was rich and the girl was spoiled
When she got mad he blood would boil
But I rapped her all up like aluminum foil

These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well

Shockedy life, Friday night, it's goin' on Too $hort
Three weeks ago I met this freak
She followed me around like Mary's sheep
I hitted around the corner and when she came
I grabbed her by the arm and I asked her name
She said it was Anita and her man's in Santa Rita
I took her to my home and homeboy, I geed her
Set her on the way the very next way
Playboy $hort was ready to play
I bumped to this girl, her name was Roseann
We hitted the motel and got it goin' on
Holiday Inn to the break of dawn
When I took baby home, I freaked her mom
I knew this tender named Sherrie
I took her to the house and let her freak on me
Baby was a fan, she loved my beat
But I wouldn't raise my leg to let her kiss my feet
I met this freak named Yolanda
Rolled baby doll like a brand new Honda
I was on top and she was up under
The bed hitted the wall and it sounded like thunder
I once had a date with girl named Kitty
She was so fine with big fat tiddies
All night long she was actin' shitty
So i macked on baby like I was Frank Nitti
There's another girl, her name is Rose
I use to roll baby like brand new Volv's
I never saw Rose wearin' clothes
She's a pimp house pet, ready to pose
I was ridin' down the street when I met Janet
Her booty was bigger than the whole damn planet
Ass everywhere, I just can't stand it
Tried to poem it but I could not manage
I had this freak, her name was Bunny
Said I was the only man who ever called her honey
Everythin' I did to her was funny
I macked on bunny and I took her money
Eight tonight a date with Shirlie
She was really short and her hair was curly
If you saw baby you liked this girlie
She was so fine I went to get her early
Shirlie was freakin' like a girl named Rachel
Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal
She liked to kiss all on my navel
Those are her lips on top of my label
I knew another freak, her name was Candy
Real big lips and they came in handy
I smooth got worked and it was so dandy
I hooked the brood up with my homeboy Randy
He did me a favor in return
Gave me a lizard, said her name was Laverne
Baby got tossed and I got it on
I grabbed the microphone and started to sing my song
My young homeboy heard me rap
And said he had way more freaks than that
So I told him like this, they might be freakin'

We started out making, small time bacon
Two little niggas baking, talking bout whipping cakes
Get clothing and big cheddar, hoping it gets better
We had no knowledge of this shit we just was with whatever
In front of your building clocking, thought I was making a killing
Right in front of your children, eight ball in my side pocket
They was corrupt too, disrespecting the fiends I used to

So now you own a record label, I got one too
We on a roll now, can't nobody stop our crew
You can treat us like convicts, you know we got records
On the shelf and on the charts the double deckers
The fat donkey house down the block, belongs to me
You criticize the way I walk, you wanna see my bankbook?
I'm not a crook, I flipped the script and changed my ways
So I can get paid, everyday
I see the same old shit, I see in the streets
I know you think I'm selling keys but I only sell beats
Dope fiend music, it's drug related
You can buy it on the corner get a radio and play it
It always sounds better when you turn it up loud
Rap music let these motherfuckers know what we about
I know these gay ass record labels keep fucking niggas
It's just like in the streets main, how much you get?

That's right, I been a hustler for a long time
Always got the right beats, never saying wrong rhymes
I started off with nothing ended up with everything
Now we sip Hennessy in first class on every plane
Ask Jay-Z, he know what I'm saying
Always see me at the bank and yes I'm going again
There ain't no dollar amount, that can make me happy
Fine women, a big house, a truck and a Caddy

Now peep, how sweet, niggas lives can get
Put beef aside, the East and Westside connect
Short Dawg, and Jigga with the, fo'-fo' flow
I got love for y'all motherfuckers y'all just don't know
I know y'all got a thing for them rag six-fo's
I like the five speed drops pop the clutch then go
If you want it, keep balling, and if you jealous stop
I want Biggie to rest in peace, as well as 'Pac

Treat em like we meet em, and never give up freedom

Like E.F. hunting, don't say nothin', I'm haunting 
On the microphone, its the eve of destruction
 
As the world goes around like Passion 
You get flattened in an orderly fashion 
You was warned like a coming attraction 
I got playa hated, felt liberated 
Put him on the burner cause the nigga violated 

We scamper like guard dogs through the fog 
If you feel like you wanna hop, leap like a frog 
The sergeant general get busy chief 
The fastest way to spell rhyme relief is Keith 

I leave you assed out like a cocaine drought 
Hey yo can I get a witness like Andre Krouch 
Niggas need to stop frontin' 
Bitches need to stop stuntin' 
Cause they know fuck well they can't stop my production 

[Chorus] 

I got the forty acres without the fuckin' mule 
Doc Ike Turner givin' mics audio abuse 
I smack a big mouth bitch, and her babysitter 
And her lesbian friend, and that nigga wit her
 
I don't give a fuck, I smack blood out a midget 
My tactics make evil D say come on kick it 
A black five wit rims, what you can spot me in 
Wanna die, I snatch you like Doc Kevorkian
 
So turn the beat up 
While NARCs got me on sweep up 
I'm lucky, I usually tote more Guns than Peter 
I fuck you up to where your forehead will cut meat up 
You wanna box, I square more than Matt Asenerina 
Backstabbing bitches and niggas eat a dick 
Cause you never heard the Doc do (nothin' like this) 
Backstabbing bitches and niggas eat a dick 
Cause you never heard the Doc do (nothin' like this0

She got a sister I really wanna get
Some Georgia girls from college park
You already fucked when we get that started off
Park in the driveway, it wont take long
Do it like that it goes on and on
You know this the kind of shit I know you want
E made the beat let me show you somethin
Quite a few haters want to see us played out
But we got the formula to get payed now
You cant stand in the way of success
We got the same job but you make much less
I remember how it used to be, before we had crack
If you had a few hundred in your pocket that was fat.

I guess the bitch, made me rich
And now you wanna call me hardcore

To Freddie B house to make tapes with my potnah

I said bitch, and everybody read my lips
I got rich, suckin up the game from the O
and even though a lot of rappers got the same kind of flow
I survived cuz I got mo', game than them
It came straight from the prostitutes, players, and pimps
It was my destiny, I came the same every time
So don't question me, I transfer the game in the rhymes

For as I cut one but two down the line

Nothing but dimes in sight, so just might
Bag these bitches like groceries
Player to player, you can't get close to me
Now who you 'posed to be?
Pullin' toast on the  S-O double N-Y, girlfriend lookin' fly
And I can tell she schemin' (why's that?)
Cause she like the ice is gleamin' (okay)

Beyotch
Yeah, you know how they like it baby, nigga you can't retire!

From nineteen-eighty, through eighty-eight
I don't stop rappin' like my first tapes
When I was broke, I used to sell em instantly (instantly)
One look, you could tell it was the pimp in me (pimp in me)
In eighty-nine, I went on tour with Eazy-E (Eazy-E)
A bunch of fine bitches tryin' to sleep with me
Every night, sold out, turnin' young hoes
Tell her baby, no doubt, stick this dick in yo' mouth
I smoked a lot of weed, I said a lot of rhymes
Always fucked up in niggaz bitches all the time
Now I'm ridin' on twenties wearin' nice clothes
but ain't nuttin' like pimpin' hoes, and ridin' Vogues
I live a good life, in my pursuit of happiness
I'm so glad, to get to the point of havin' this
opportunity, for you and me to pass it on
Two years ago, I thought it'd be my last song

Me, Squeaky, Flex and J, on Saratoga Street
Smokin' white boys, bumpin' dopefiend beats
Eighty-eight, my pockets wasn't straight, but I was makin' it
Niggaz like Lil' Tim was out there ballin' sellin' cakes n shit
I was right there, on the Mob Circle, writin' raps
All about my snaps, tryin' to put Ball and G on the map
Nowadays I own my shit and bone bad bitches
Kickin' it with rich niggaz in rollers, and candy sixes
Deliverin' hot shit like Pizza Hut for them hardcore thugs
Niggaz who pimp bitches and hit the highway with them drugs
Feel my flow, mix it in witcha chronic main
$hort Dawg, I don't know why you tryin' to leave this game
State to state, plenty hoes and plenty money to make
Writing raps, makin' more than them niggaz movin' weight
The game been good to me, and I know that muhfucka bless you
Thanks for passin' game, now let's get out here and make this loot

I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'
We some presidential players, with money by the layers
Ain't nuthin' you broke ass niggaz do that can fade us
I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'
I drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes
and meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapes

I had to sacrifice, get things right
In this rap life, I paid my dues
Learn how to crawl, before I walk
Then I learned how to tie my shoes
Tryin' crime, but it just didn't work for me
Matter of fact it did it worse for me
Gettin' eyes scarred, bein' weak one time ya hard
It can only do hurt to me
So I sucked up my peer pressure, and my pride
And realized that this rap shit was gon' help me to survive
Stay alive, go with the flow but don't be no muhfuckin' fool
Hell this music thing is all I got, I ain't makin' straight A's in school
And ain't wind up to be dumber nigga, only to be different
So all the shit that you think we are, the shit that we isn't
When you raised up, where I come from, make it out is a blessing
Cause half the cats, where I come from, don't ever learn they lessons
My first love, even before I had a daughter, or a lady
was rappin', sweet lyrics, I love you, my baby
MJG, what you see, on TV, is fame
But the rapper I let loose almost anything, I love this game

I won't stop rappin', I don't stop rappin'
I make too much money bitch I can't stop rappin'
I live the fast life of a MC
and I sell a lot of records makin' pimp beats
I could do a show tonight and make ten G's
Fuck til the mornin', sleep late and smoke weed
Three cars in my garage, truck in the driveway
I always, get my dick sucked on the highway

My way (pimp til I die) fuck a hoe
Unless that hoe is breakin' me off some dough, to hit the studio
Blowin, niggaz ain't knowin', how far this shit is goin'
I wrote all my shit, but niggaz always talkin' bout what I owe them
But I'm gon' show them, real niggaz stand on they own ten toes
So I'ma make all the money, and try my best to fuck all these hoes
Friend or foe, a bitch or hoe, rich or po'
Eightball got flow, MJG 

Here comes the one they call the P-I, M-P, never will retire
The tree-high, green leaf, helps me to get higher
Eightball and MJG, Too $hort, we all must be
the pimps of the industry, shit people pretend to be
Fuck so why should we, settle down
Leave the kitchen put the kettles down
Stop from fillin' all you hoes
Give up the life of trues and vogues
Hell no, it ain't gon' happen, this shit too deep
So I hooked up with my comrades so we can all get rich, nigga


Yea yea, one time, for your motherfuckin' mind

Eightball and MJG, now what you weigh me

So bad She made me sick some time
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in the galleria shopping, buying
Gifts for some guy that she dating, still shot
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs
She started smiling so I handed her this bathing suit
And told her try it
Replied, while with these light brown eyes
I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size
She put it on so I paid for
Then I told her she could keep it
And then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it
Made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I don it
Made a mack move and girl chased me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless
But honey must of missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just tumbling and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, its me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces

[Chorus]
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brangs
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange

[Too $hort]
I called her up on the phone said I'll be there in a Minute
Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all That shit
Every chance you get you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But every time I see her got to stop and look
Cause she so damn fine bitch
I want to make you mine bitch
I want to fuck one time bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with
Stuck with, I love the way she suck dick
It make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't I knew the bitch would
Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you ain't go last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
Cause It's like that, that's how we do this shit, Bitch

Let me holla at 'cha B, Short check this
Just got through fuckin this bitch, who swallowed my Cum and drank my
Piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or Move it
Sucking and Fucking, man she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6
Nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know that's my bitch
And she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuck her all The time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my side
Girl so fine niggas dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and only
Bitch be all on me chewing my nuts like bologna
Then picked, she licked on my dick like plop
The nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said look what I got
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard as rock, is what these hoes Be missing
And in return she used her stolen credit cards to by Me casing
And later on she got this bone and gives me fuck Faces

I got a call from Laquesha and some of her nieces
Saying its about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we go do is fall through with crushed ice
Man these hoes been talking bout fucking for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and its quiet
The rimmy that she gimme, a phillie and its tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties so damn it, its in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my surprise
Enter the room with the cat ass eyes
Rochelle's who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See I love these kind cause they ain't with that Bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl stop licking right there you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and fell the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me Sit through

Too Short,"[Intro:]
And it don't stop to the beat, baby
Funky Fresh on the microphone
One time for your mind, beeyatch (Beeyatch)
Short Dogg's in the motherfuckin house
doin what we always do, a stack
(Gettin money) Gettin money (Gettin money)
Chorus: Too $hort, (Slink Capone)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(Fuck a secret indictment, all I do is write shit)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(You got the wrong rappers, nigga you better tell em!!)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(Tell em Short, tell em!!!)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(OOOOOHHHHH!!!!!)

[Verse One:]
You broke the law, and you got caught
Got a good lawyer, case is bein fought
Life is full of choices, make em at the crossroads
If you had five, you already lost four
Straight apprehended, handcuffed and can't stand it
Don't want to go to jail but you was caught redhanded
A felony, strike number two
Federal Agents like, ""What you want to do?""
Make a choice, so you start to think back
Short Dogg was a nigga that always rapped
Half my life ago, didn't sell no dope
I sold dope fiend music for your stereo
Sittin at the crossroads in '84
I knew hella motherfuckers that was slangin coke
Use to tell my homeboys, front me a sack
Postin me at the dopehouse dumpin the crack
My niggas wouldn't do it, I love em for that
'cause now I still rap and get paid to gat
Since '87, that's how the shit comes
We made two hundred thousand in six months
Sellin tapes not cakes, cheques kept comin
Fuck buyin *?boats?*, niggas makin hundreds
Legit, you think I'm stupid, bitch
I bought a studio so I can do this shit
Chorus: Too $hort, (Slink Capone)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(You got it twisted, Bridget
 Why pressin charges when I'm depressin hard and shit)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(Run tell em, tell em Short, tell em)

[Verse Two:]
I used to sell weed in high school, smoked the profit
I never sold *?company due?*, I can't knock it
'cause the inner city public school system is fucked
Go to class all day, you ain't gettin enough
So at 3:15 it's time to put in work
Buy you some dope and go hit the turf
Ain't no scholarship, no rap contract
but a nigga get paid sellin hop and crack
I got lucky, it's not a get-rich scheme
I've been sellin rap tapes since I was 15
I told the Oakland police, too many times
I make a lot of money doin pimp rhymes
I never sell drugs to jeopardise my freedom
You never could make me realise I need em
I went from hundreds, to hundreds to thousands, to millions
I know what police want, I feel em
I'm always ballin right there in the hype
Instantly, dope dealer stereotype
but shit is serious, I know I never sold drugs
so why these motherfuckers tryin ta roll me up?
And smoke me, why? No one knows
The only thing I did wrong was fuck all ya hoes
I don't smoke coke blunts and sho' don't sell em
Call the FBI, somebody please tell em



[Chorus:Too $hort, (Slink Capone)]
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(All you motherfuckers is lookin at us rock jewelery and shit
 That's all you are)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(Somebody better tell em we got receipts)

[Verse Three:]
Rap is brand new, not long ago
Made a billion dollars last year round the globe
Now all the little kids can't let it go
to the new millennium with a brand new flow
Too $hort baby straight from the O
If you're like me, you're tryin ta make some doe
Roll to the spot and try ta break a hoe
Pimp her real hard and then take it slow
When I rap to a bitch, I'm a pro
I spit this game like never befo'
Grab the microphone and always rock the show
then I grab me a freak, tell her ""Keep it on the low""
If I take her to my house she won't say no
I burn rubber with the bitch in my fo'-fifty-fo'
California niggas drop the top and roll
Stare up at the mountains, won't see no snow
I go coast to coast smokin indo
If my bitch actin up, I fuck her friend so
don't investigate me for sellin dope
If you see me rollin clean through the ghetto
I'm probably on my way to the studio
Probably playin somethin loud on the stereo
Short Dogg, don't forget the funk motto:
'Free your mind and your ass will follow'

[Chorus:Too $hort, (Slink Capone)]
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(We're up why'all in this motherfuckin holdin tank for hidin snitch ass
niggas)
Tell the Feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(Nigga, I was promoted a tour of Kentucky nigga, and D.C.)

[Outro: Slink Capone]
Pop this shit, be outta state, niggas is hella fake
Moms ain't mess with the motherfuckin phone
My girl, she's fuckin up, god damn!
Nigga you better stop all that motherfuckin snitchin
Tell them motherfuckers we ain't runnin no motherfuckin coke factory
Tell em, tell em!! TELL EM!!!
YOU BETTER TELL EM!!!!

Just like a lie to my people that's caught up in the struggle

Barney Rubble, gettin in trouble and fuckin up

Tell your baby to get your baby daddy to buy you a nail shop

with methamphetamine laughs and heroin balloons

Six po-lice pulled me over laid a nigga on the ground
Searched my car real good I know you know what they found
I had the trunk, full of that junk
X-Rated lyrics, laced with the funk
No doubt, I was just about to flood the streets
Big boxes full of tapes with them dopefiend beats

Used my niggaz gold ropes and his Cadillac

It makes you feel good, like when you bust a nut
Now I'm a millionaire, and can't get enough
Forty tell em how it is (way too tough Short Dawg)

When I first started rappin motherfuckers would cap!
""That nigga fake he sound like Woody Pecker on crack (ha ha ha HA ha)""

Verse 1: TQ 



I like to think back to when we spent the weekend 

In Cabo baby  your sister's boyfriend started trippin' 

And left her lonely 

After you went to sleep   I spent the night out on the beach 

Laid up on her body - how could I keep from hittin'? 

And every time I came to your house 

She always kissed me in the mouth 

Always stickin' her tongue out when you wasn't lookin' 

I want to fuck you sister 



Chorus: TQ 



Now we been messin' round a long long time 

But now I want to fuck your sister 

And I know it sounds foul but that's alright 

Cause why should I have to bullshit ya' 

(play wit' ya) 

I can't help it if she's the one that's on my mind 

Everytime I'm out wit cha 

I know we messed around a long long time 

But now I want to fuck your sister 



Verse 2: TQ 



She comes to greet me when I ring your door bell 

Lookin' like cavvy 

She stands behind you in the kitchen - staring at me 

I like to see her when she's getting out the shower 

All the things she used to tell me when you wasn't listening 

Now the bridge is gonna get cha 



Bridge: TQ 



Ain't no need for us to stop messin' around 

I just want to hit it for an hour when she get out the shower 

On the sink guaranteed not to make a sound 

And you know you shouldn't have to be getting' mad at me 

I can't help if I want that ass badly 

So in the middle of the day when nobody else is around 

I'll be fucking your sister 



Verse 3: Too $hort (starts rapping during verse 2) 



It's time to wake up, control my own destiny 

Can't let my addiction to her get the best of me 

I ain't givin' up 

And I'll never stop tryin' live it up 

Cause there ain't no reason to be lyin' 

So you might as well let you know 

It's goin' down 

You wasting time asking me when, where or how? 

It's a mutual thing between me and your sister 

How you gon' feel when you seeing me kiss her 

Ever since she was young, I knew I would get her 

Waiting this long to fuck can only make it better 

It's like way back when I was tryin' to get wit' cha 

I'm tryin' to keep it real girl, I ain't tryin' to bullshit ya

Don't take 'em to the crib unless they bonin'

All I want is hoes, big booty hoes
Check it out, here's another one
All I want is hoes, big booty hoes
Don't take 'em to the crib unless they bonin'

It's after midnight, it's time to come up
Fuckin' with some sluts tryin' to bust a nut
I ain't seen this many hoes in a long time
I wanna make 'em all mine (get down hoe)
But it's gettin' kinda late, and I can't wait
Bitch fuck a first date
I pulled out my dick, she called me rude
But then she ate it like food (tramp)
Then she noticed the limp and the whip
Recognize game, you've been pimped by a pimp
Throw all that trick shit, out the window
You come up short tryin' to doubt the pimp hoe
Too $hort baby, straight from Oakland
Hoe money is my fix and I can't be broken
Freak bitches all on my dick
We on some Brooklyn, Oakland, California shit (beotch!)

All I want is hoes, big booty hoes
Check it out, here's another one
All I want is hoes, big booty hoes
Don't take 'em to the crib unless they bonin'

Don't take 'em to the crib unless they bonin'

You knew I was a dog when you met me bitch (Bitch)
Ha ha, fo' sho' (Yeah)
Tell you anything you wanna hear right about now
To the spot, that's where we goin' baby
We finna goin' to the spot
Do our thang like we always do
You ain't know?",Big Booty Hoes,1999
Too Short,"[Chorus]
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
All top notches gotta stay on top
Party all night and we make a lot
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop, bitch
Ain't no bitches like the ones I got
When I take 'em to the spot, ya know they all look hot 
Like I said homeboy ""All I got is top notch""
Gotta keep a fat knot it don't stop

I'm the super player, I got women everywhere
I know you love a square, I don't care
I still get it, anytime I want to
Call her at the house, I think she said ""come through""
I'm coming, every time I see her
That's what I'm doing, I can't believe ya
When ya tell me, she's all yours
Cause when I have her on the floor, down on all fours
She said its mine, and that's for sure 
If you come around when I'm near, you gotta go
Cause you don't nothing bout this ballers work
When we was players coming up we knocked all the girls
And now I just go out and take my pick
If you gotta enough game you can take my bitch
I won't hate you, try to clown, I'll put you down
Cause I got women all over this town

[Chorus]

You couldn't be a better player then me, you ain't got enough game
You couldn't take her from me, you ain't even have a chance
Not with me in the picture
You even got the last dance to see what it could gets you
Nothing, broken hearted and lonely
Cause when its over, she's going home with me
Five foot nine short hair big booty
Looking like the leading lady starring in a movie
Fly crib, Mercedes Benz 
She loves niggas like me and my shady friends
And when we hang out, don't count the champagne bottles
Thinking I'm drunk, I don't play game lotto
I put the game down from the start
And you ain't nothing but a dumb ass mark
She started teasing when she saw the red carpet
What did you say nigga ""Get ya ass in the car bitch""

[Chorus]

Hoochies, cheerleaders, groupies, beer drinkers 
High class stuck up hoes, that getting real freaky
Laywers, nurses, police women, teachers
If she's a top notch, I keep her
Tall ass models, skinny and shit, big tities, short and thick
All complexions, different nationalities
Pimp game from from east oakland, out to cali
Keep 'em teenage to middle age, is she paid
'cause if she ain't, what can she make
If I see a bad bitch I ain't fin away, 
I'm gonna holla at her, I can't discriminate
Its not about the sex, not all the time, 
Cause I'm trying to get in her mind
Like when ya stand and just stare at the ocean
I help ya manage your emotions, bitch

[Chorus]

Ain't no bitches like my bitches, I know ya think ya gotta lotta hoes nigga
And ya probably do, but there's one fact that'll always be true
You couldn't be a better player than me nigga
Life is, life is too short, so keep trying nigga keep trying
Number one, player of the year, player of the decade
Player of the century, player of the motherfucking millennium
And his name is too $hort, bitch",Ain't No Bitches,1999
Too Short,"Yeah that's right
We gonna flash back
To 1983
I'ma show you niggas how I was spittin' this pimp game 
Before most of you niggas even started rappin'
1983, Too $hort
Word for word
Like this baby, Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

A nigga like me I know what's up
I want a nasty bitch with a lot of butt
If I can't find one anywhere
It turns my dreams to nightmares
Baby right there ain't got no ass
But she's okay if she got cash

Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

I'll tell 'bout a day that I had
Seen nothin' but bitches with no ass
I woke up early felling right
Do the same damn thing every day of my life
Cause every morning you know I get
A good blowjob from a real fine bitch
Strokin', smokin', sir Too Short
Thinking about the day before
30 minutes after I rolled out
I pulled a freak took her to my house
She was hella young with a lot of butt
She sucked my dick and then we fucked
That good tight pussy I couldn't pass
A light-skined freak with so much ass
At 1 P.M. I was fuckin' away
I want to do the same thing again today
Today my story made itself
Every bitch I saw was flat as hell
I told myself ""I must need glasses""
Where's them bitches with the big round asses
Me and me homie just want to be tuff
Bring two bitches then switch'em up
It was 3:35 the strip was lit
Every two blocks I saw a different bitch
Waitng on the bus someone was walking
Me and my homie just started talking
I said ""Homie she looks good""
He said ""That ass is flat as wood""
I said ""What about baby in the black""
And he said ""Short she's all that""

Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

Every single day of the week
For every nigga living there's a freak
If you got game and a bed
Why not get fucked and get some head
Cause bitches all over want to get fucked
I just need one with a lot of butt
Me and my homie rollin' and smokin'
Flat booty bitches took over Oakland
I told my homie ""I hate to say
All the bitches with ass stay home today""
And he said ""Short what now""
Put the pedal to the metal and hit the beat town
I thought them bitches out there was fine
But the invasion was on and it fucked my mind

Bitches, Bitches, Bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

We hit the beat town like Oakland players
I knew it bitches was everywere
The first one had tities so fat
But that don't work her ass was flat
The second bitch was flat too
Talked about the bitch like a muthafuckin' fool
I said beyotch
I know I'm capin'
Where's your ass baby what happened
She turned around caped back on me
Said ""Fuck you nigga where's your teeth""
I dam near fell jummping out the car
But I slapped that and slapped her hard
My homie said ""Short we gots to cut""
But I was spankin' that bitch on her big flat butt
We parked the car and took a walk
I saw another bitch a I had to talk
I said ""Baby, baby, baby come here
Yeah you baby with the long long hair""
Baby came over from across the street
Standing on the corner talking to me
I was spittin' the game but I talked too fast
'Cause I didn't even notice that she had a flat ass
Sheit!
And I was ready to go
We was rollin' back to the O'
I told that bitch ""I changed my mind""
She looked at me and she said ""Why""
I said I'm Sir Too $hort the Oakland player
I'm not one of them niggaz who don't care
It's no thang to do my duty
But not with you and your flat booty
In the Berkley town what did we find
Freak after freak with no behind
One long day I never got in
I'm glad that shit never happend again

Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

The invasion (Beyotch) is on

That's that old school
'83
Still pimpin' baby
Short dog
You know I can't stay away from this game",Can't Stay Away,1999
Too Short,"Yeah that's right baby
You rolling to the sounds of Too $hort
Album #11 (Just Can't Stay Away)
You knew I couldn't stay away (can't stay away)
Dedicated to the funk baby
that's how we do this, we been doing this
So I made a new album
Fresh out of retirement
I can't stay away, I'm ready to ride again
I could do it for the money, I'd rather do it for the fans
Break out my old caddy, I'd knew he'd understand
See I don't stop rapping, so how could I retire
I had to re negotate, Cause the stakes were getting higher
Lawsuits and jail, partnerships fail
Didn't have a drivers license, so I was always making bail
Three years ago I told Jive: get my scrill
They gave a nigga millions with the same shit deal
You know I gotta live so I might as well learn
I'd be the first motherfucker to tell you I got burned
So I retired, started all over again
I put the game down like an Oakland pimp (Oakland pimp)
And now I get payed like the NBA
First class on that ass,every game we play
Fuck your attitude bitch, you ain't hurting me
I'm felling to cool, I'm rolling three times Barkley
You can get your ass out and walk home
I'll find another young broad and get my fuck on
So please don't trip, in my Cadillac bitch
Maybe some other time cause I ain't having that shit
Right now I'm about to lean to the left
Wipe that frown off your face bitch I mean what I said
I'm bout to bump this beat, I'm wasting time talking
Keep fucking with me and they goin' find their ass walking
I'm to the next level, but I keep on rapping
This shit I be doing just ain't suppose to happen
What you know about the motherfucking east side connection
Hitting backstreets in my motherfucking oldschool flexing
Niggas on the eastside we ain't no punks
Made em get four way stop signs and speedbumps
Always highspeed chasing everyday and night
They call me $ir Too $hort bitch you better say it right
I had to look past rap music and R&B
I be a leader and watch this niggas follow me
I could be 40, album 15 it wouldn't matter
I probably got way more rhymes then all you rappers
I know i got more songs then you ever made
I stayed on the charts and I stayed paid
So don't come around me bragging bout the shit you achieved
Cause I know exactly what you and me need
To be in two different places all the time
I ain't concerned with yours so stay the fuck up out of mine
I own all my shit so you can't destroy it or enjoy it
Unless I say so and motherfuckers better know it
If you living really good it ain't nothin' but fate
I love to see a new rapper doing something great
When I hear a funky base line I always pay attention
I spit these pimp ass rhymes cause hoes love the way
I mention pimp shit all the time
18 years of making music, I bring square bitches to my house
And watch her straight get loose wit it
Too $hort baby can't never stop funking
I've been doing this for years and I got hella songs that bumping
All you hang-around-a-long-time, one-hit-havin'
Got no love for this rap music, you need to stop rapping
I thought you was jealous of my bitches and cars
But you just mad that your shit ain't hitting like ours
I'm so real about these beats, I tell all my freaks
At the studio, bitch don't bother me
Its all about the funk, live bass
Trinity, MPC, JV-2080, dump some chords with the vintage keys
You hear what I'm saying, learn from my example
Break out the instruments and stay away from the samples
Get your publishing for everything you write
Instead of selling it keep it for the rest of your life
So just take my advice and don't quit
Cause if you do, you won't get shit, biatch

Too Short,"Yeah, we balling baby
(As we proceed to give you what we need) that's right
Oh you don't know, we gonna tell you how it is

[Chorus]
When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everybody want to be by you're side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life
When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everybody want to be by you're side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life

You thought it was a fad, you really can't understand rap
How these young players come up and live fat
Big houses, cars, watch the homies bubble
Do a lot of good but can't stay out of trouble
They call you balls cause he's the president, 
He bought a lot of stuff you could never get
Take us to the game you want to see my bus, 
But all the little kids want to be like us
When they get home, and turn the TV on, 
Its Too $hort baby on the microphone
I see a lot of styles when I'm watching videos 
Looking at the background talking at the hoes
Then they are and be cats incorporated rap into their program
(What happened to the slow jams)
We dropping platinum, number one, bitch, that's how its done

[Chorus]

Lil homie went to school everyday, knew what he wanted
Want trying to be a thug want trying to get blunted
It was all a dream, but there's certain things 
You gotta do, like do good in school
His best friend wouldn't listen didn't make good grades
Coach kicked him off the team wouldn't let 'em play
So he stopped going to school and started hangin' with some g's
Drinkin' beer and smoking weed
Two years later one went to college quick he got a basketball scholarship
His homeboy was in the hood one day got arrested
Took him to the pen they say he got molested
Jealous cause his old friend took the right path
Watching ESPN I saw him in the draft
Now he got a V-12 sittin' on dubs, that's how it is when ya what

[Chorus]

She used to be a nerd on the honor roll
A four eye conesour, books kinda short on looks
A latch key kid, best friend was her computer
In high school nobody wanted to do her
When she graduated from college she got paid
Got a good job, now she got it made
Gots some contacts, and let her hair down
She gots the legs and the walk that'll make you stare her down
You better get you're shit together you running out of time
Something on your mind, you need to stop lyin'
You ain't balling like her you can't get into the party
Out in Beverly hills trying flip a Ferrari
Butcha credit ain't cool and you got declined
He said ""you're welcome"" and ""But to come back anytime""
But me, I'm spending cash for this bitch
And that's just the way it is

[Chorus]",Good Life,1999
Too Short,"[Chorus]
We talk shit, cause we are the shit
Never looked back since we started it
When y'all want heat we provide it, ride it
'Til the wheels fall of, shaking 'em all off
Six figure niggas with it, over did it, spit it
In ways that'll cause a rush
Keeping your face in a state of disgust
Hating but still trying to be like us

Twist the lime on the corona, grab my crime diploma
Then head to the block, to pull up five in the mona
Shit, I need to chrome up, become a home owner
Look life's a bitch, but I'm on her
I almost cracked this, no more hustling backwards
Up the ave I zip, nigga trying to have shit
I'm your average, ghetto nigga turned maverick
You'd never, said to a nigga ""Whatever for the cash, I'm with""
I don't have step, I leave it in you're averix
Then shoot it it the air, whatever I have left
Outlaw, simply I out draw y'all
Wether clubs or the street, I out ball y'all
Niggas ain't ready, I doubt all y'all
Fly ass niggas I reroute all y'all
If it ain't for the paper I don't show my face up
Make a bet I turn the ace up, and Jay, what

I never stop making money don't give 'em no slack
Drinking dirty motherfuckers til a hoe come back
With my scratch, bitch I was born to mack
To uphold the pimping, I was sworn to that
I hear a lot of shit talking when I listen to rap
Only a few MC's get to hang that plaque
On the wall rappers ball, but they don't live phat
Nigga, I doubt if you go gold or platinum
What we do has only been mastered by a few
I take a half a million tapes sell 'em straight to you
All that shit niggas talking just cant be real
I don't need a record deal, I need eighteen wheels
I roll right up in the hood I got tapes for sell
Bitches running in their house they cant wait to tell
Somebody, she got a new Too tape
And hes spitting pimp game with his homeboy Jay

[Chorus]

Now here they come again the gold diggas trying to get paid,
Wanna trick the old rich niggas, trying to get laid
She'll suck his dick, as soon as she meet him
Don't have to sell a body for me I don't need her
To turn tricks for me, how much you cost bitch?
I'm all about large bank deposits
On and off the mic I always set trends
Either you see with bitches, or I'm rolling with pimps
Brook-laan to Oakland, I keep smokin'
Jay-Z and short dog at these hoes again
The kinda niggas that'll take a square bitch around the corner
Put this pimp game on her
I don't fuck with broke hoes and I don't trick
But I'll still rub my big ass dick on her clit
Get her hooked, wanna be mine I need some money
If she ain't kicking in all the time she don't want me

Hoes, flows, money, cars
Y'all wannabe stars cant fuck with none of these bars
This is real nigga rap, we can spit it through the mic
And you can feel niggas scratch, and sell a mil if that
So real when we drop this shit its in trouble
When I guess the pair you gotta ship it double
In the independent phenom, y'all miniature dons
Wannabe jigga, pops styles and hennessy richa'
When I die, leave my canopy richa'
I put it down hard ever since I entered the pit'cha
Can fuck with me for records to the recreational cent'a
I got it wrapped y'all from the grammy's to the back park
Short dog y'all, what you thought y'all, Oakland, Bk, New york y'all
Be the voice for the streets we supply for years
And go platinum on our most quiet years

[Chorus: x2]",Here We Go [Jermaine Dupri Remix],1999
Too Short,"[Chorus]
How does it feel when ya livin' like that, and ya pockets are fat?
'Cause you're a playa, and you're pimpin' hoes
So tell me how does it feel when ya money ain't right,
And ya pockets are tight?
You're still a hustla, and you can't let go

When I was broke, I used to feel the pain
Now I got money, ain't nothin' changed
Same hustla, tryin' to hold on to what I got
And that's a lot, players like me can't be stopped
I was starvin', couldn't afford a TV Dinner
But now I roll around in a DB-7
Throwin' up the two, to the hoes and pimps
It's all about the money, you know what I'm gettin'
How the fuck you think I felt when I was broke
All the rumors I got killed and I was smoked
I tell the truth, I don't care how you feel about me
I'm still in the game and you still gotta see
My face goin' down the muthafuckin' street
Top down, beat loud with a top-notch freak
You say it ain't real life
'cause you don't know what it feels like, beyotch

[Chorus]

I feel like I'm a million dollar bill
Still in the game, all about the real
Can't feel sorry for you, do your thang
Don't be mad at the world 'cause you can't hang
If you feel like doin' somethin' that ain't productive
Look in the mirror, check yourself and say ""fuck it""
It's the year two-thousand, I know you feel me
But I can't understand why you niggas want to kill me
Went from broke to rich, I got your bitch kneelin'
I told her ""smoke this dick bitch, don't fight the feelin'""
And when she did it, she started jockin' me
I saw it in your eyes, you felt like sockin' me
For every action there's a consequence
Playa-haters always tryna start some shit
But then you gotta fight these niggas here
It feels good to be a playa, bitches everywhere

[Chorus]

I feel like eleven albums ain't enough
And at the same time you feel like you can't come up
Sometimes real life don't feel right
You been fuckin' her for years but its still tight
Then I came through bammin', vagina started expandin'
Used to be shallow, but now you landed in
Deep water drownin' and that's some real game
It's been your pussy for years, but it don't feel the same
I been creepin', feelin' your bitch up on the weekend
Is it still good she calls me Dr. Feelgood
I'll be her last pimp, you just a has been
And when she talks about you its all past tense
I said I don't give a fuck about history
I'll tell you bout my life then show you how this dick'll be
In you all night, go ask your bitch was she feelin' me
Man, you niggas be killin' me, haters

Longevity

Fake niggas

And you can tell em I said it
I said motherfuckers is takin' the credit
Been in the game for 20 minutes, and they thinkin' they legends
All on their videos showin' off, frontin' for the camera
One-hit wonders is playin' games, fakin' stamina
I damage ya, throwin' blows to your egos
Flossin' new leather, think you the shit wearin' these clothes
And supposed to flash and have the finer things
But can't seem to keep your money, cause you're buyin' rings
What is you gettin', 7 or 6, new record contract?
Bustin' your bomb raps, but you ain't gettin' your funds back
Fuck that, I been around since '86
Way before my motherfuckin' mind played tricks
And when Too $hort told me this bitch, it wasn't givin'
Cause I'm sick and tired of niggas fantasizin' they livin'
All on the tell-lie-vision tryina' front like that's your car
With a fat-ass cigar, you ain't no motherfuckin' star
What you are is a nigga lost, dazed and confused
Back in the day that you stepped in it is the day that you do
But on the  cool, some niggas been around since the '70s
Steadily preachin' to us all longevity

[Chorus]
You don't get shit for free
Your own destiny
Longevity
Longevity

10 years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
But back then I said: fuck rhymin', I was tryina get laid
But now it's '98, I'm all about gettin' paid
Fuck that bullshit you niggas be on in your videos
Drive the shit your C.E.O. own
In their home, at their parties, you niggas dummies
Motherfucker, fuck the fame, it's all about the money
And then the power (money and the power)
Slingin' tapes like powder
Everything I own is mine, don't understand 'ours'
This's a serious business 
My nigga, take care of your business
Especially you niggas with gimmicks, your ass is finished
In the nick of time, fuck havin' the tightest rhymes
You better grind, it's plenty fools dope without a dime
So I'm tight with mines, and I prove that every time
Just to let you niggas know I'm out to get mine
That's longevity

[Chorus]

Who got the freshman flop or the sophomore jinx
Rappers blow up, fall off, and think
Been there, done that, about to make a comeback
I'm on some new shit, not like my young raps
I know what you sold, first album went gold
Then you changed the style, shoulda stuck with the old
Flows, and the old clothes, cause now you fake
You ain't got no hoes committin' foul play
Hatin' on me, but you're waitin' to see
Old school Too $hort in the place to be
I ain't backstage chasin' young girlies
I'm chasin' money, I'm in my early 30s
Still sellin' records, and I'm still a real player
Can't understand how you still could be a hater
Said I don't stop rappin' from the start
If you don't believe me, go check the charts
Bitch

[Chorus]",Longevity,1999
Too Short,"BEYOTCH!
Short Dog's in the house, once again with this pimp shit

These are the tales, the freaky tales 
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you want to have sex say hell yeah

I met this girl in Atlanta
She let a nigga fuck but I still can't stand her
The pussy wasn't good I said ""What's up bitch?
I'm tired of fuckin' can you suck dick?""
She said ""No"", but she had another friend
So I switched like a real pimp
Laying on my back with my dick in her mouth
I said ""Beyotch!!  What you talkin' 'bout?""
She mumbled something, I don't know what she said
Smoking on a joint gettin some bomb-ass head
Bitch said her name was Theresa
All on my dick like cheese on pizza
In the A-T-L where the grass is greener
I fucked Nina, Melina, Sabrina and Tina
When I first moved out there, I met Holly
Five-foot one with a bad ass body
Freaky little bitch she was a Gemini
She used to stand up and say ""Shoot it in my eye!""
I met another girl went to Spellman College
Every day after school I acquired the knowledge
I took her to my house so I could get some
I fucked her real good and made the bitch cum
She was hella limber, said her name was Amber
She wouldn't stop screaming, that's all I remember
I had another freak, her name was Wendy
When I first met the bitch she said ""Please don't pimp me!""
I did it anyway
I'm coming straight from Oakland, see-A
Ain't no other way, like my girl Shante 
She lives in Atlanta, but she comes from the Bay
Let me hit that hometown pussy on the strimp
Look out for a nigga, treat me like a pimp
You know I can't forget about the strippers
Cinderella with the glass slipper
Top down in the Benz ain't spendin' no ends
Fat bag of indo, bring all your friends
It's like Lotto, you get a quick pick
Bitches said they heard I had a big dick
So I showed it to 'em, only took one second
Dick rock hard, bitches gettin' nekked

These are the tales, the freaky tales 
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you want to have sex say hell yeah

I know another bitch, her name is Terri
I lied to the bitch ""It's about time I get married""
I couldn't see me pimpin' her
So I fucked her next door neighbor, Jennifer
She had two roommates, Cindy and Amy
Terri caught me creepin' and said ""Nigga don't play me!""
But them hoes liked to freak
I used to send 'em new niggas every other week
I never would tell you all the hoes I fucked
These are the tales, some of this shit I made up
I change the name so I can rhyme and shit
So if it's you, you know the time bitch!
I spent the night with Monique in between the sheets
It was her, her girlfriend April and me
I do it on the regular, two at a time
Call it what you want I be a fool wit' mine
Like them Texas niggas, I never would change
Like my niggas up in Cleveland spit the good game
These hoes recognize when I come in the door
I ain't trickin bitch, so what you want me for?
Like Natalie, swearin' up and down I had to be the one
Bitch lets have some fun
I fucked her, you thought I didn't
Short Dog's in the house and I keep on pimpin'
So then I fucked the twins, Sharon and Karen
Went straight for the panties, but they wasn't wearin 'em
Don't ask me who I fucked first, it ain't my fault
In the end, I still got the same results

These are the tales, the freaky tales 
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you want to have sex say hell yeah

Hell yeah, I never would forget Charlene
We was layin real close like two sardines
Talkin', laughin', kissin' and shit
Next thing I know she started kissin' my dick
You know the rest, before she left I paged Mia
I told her ""I got a new freak over here""
She rushed over, I left and when I came back
Them hoes was lickin' cats
They call me ""Short"" when I'm pimpin', ""Dog"" when I'm mackin'
Gotta get the money, that's all that's happenin'
She wants to be my love slave, I need some bug spray
To keep these hoes away
I never would tell you all the hoes I fucked
These are the tales, some of this shit I made up
I change the name so I can rhyme and shit
So if it's you, you know the time bitch!

These are the tales, the freaky tales

Stress free from the drama, better go get your ticket 
Then come on cause some squares can't lie to kick it 
 
It feels good not to grind no more 
Don't get it twisted cause I still hustle 
Maintainin' just tryin' to reach my goal 
Livin' life truly successful 
So that my little soldier never have to sell no dope 
All the Cutties from the pens comin' home again 
And we ain't tryin' to kill each other cause brother we all in 
Beautiful black women give 'em much respect 
And ain't no funk 'tween the east and the west

We barbecuin' chicken, that's what we doin' 
Buy some breezys and we kickin' 
And Cap what you doin? 

I'm just sittin here timin' like a Rolex watch 
I figured by now y'all realize that Hip-Hop and Rap won't stop 
Puttin' it together like a racing track 
Where's all my Latino, Philippino, and Ese partners at? 
I know you feel me when I say that life's a struggle 
But God first, y'all know we all can't help but bubble 
So keep your head up 
And know that things are changing for the better 
Talkin' 'bout the youth, the little kids 
Forget about you, never 

Today's the day the Players play

Now all the real players throw your Rollies in The air 
And wave 'em all around like you just don't care 
From side to side and from front to back 
Throw the peace sign baby, show me where you at 
Dollar bill y'all, and we could scream it out loud 
And Mac Mall's here, homey that can move the crowd 
So what the deal with you nigga, you could cross the town 
Put the squeeze on the haters, ain't no need to clown 

None of the homies got pop 
None of the spots got batteram 
And I'll be damned, it's crackin' like a Summer Jam 
Barbecues, no more feuds, players embracin' 
Slammin' dominos, bustin' raps, still paper chasin' 
Competitors keep a distance, it's all love baby 
Rub-a-dub-dub love, welcome to the Players Club baby 
A family affair, a toast to the bay, hey 
Looks like it's gonna be one of them lovely days 

Mama used to put my clothes on layaway 
Now I'm dipped everyday and every see-note got big face 
Holler at me man, used to ride the back of the bus 
Now I'm spinnin V-12's though the times is rough 
In God we trust haters, you can only hate us 
But can't front cause you knew that we was bound to blow up

When you're dealin' with my type
Don't get caught up in the hype
I be takin' all your bitch money

And you know that just ain't right
'Cause you brought her to the club
But you didn't leave with her
Tryin' to figure how a playa like $hort Dawg could get her

Whoever try to buy a new Benz, spend money on your friends
Order up some shit with a pocket full of ends
Ain't no sympathy for suckers, bitch, I'm a hustler
For the last 12 years I could never get enough of
That cash, I keep it in my jeans, bitch
Have you ever seen it? A big pile of green shit?
When I spend it, bitch, I'm the man
I do what I want, suckers do what they can
That's why I moved to the A, straight from the Bay
I'm still mackin bitches everyday, anyway
And if you don't like it, I don't give a fuck
I'ma still let my top down and turn this shit up
Nothin' half on my business, keep gettin' paid
If niggas stick together, maybe we'll live to see the day
When everybody keep ballin like me and my folks

But the little trick need to learn some respect 
She made me beat her ass. 
Take a nigga out this game. 
See I don't beat my hoes cause all my hoes is payin'

Of hurtin' ass shit that I faced the last time
My last dime, goes on food I'm in the mood for a stick-up,
To pick up lil' somethin' on a get up
You hit up, blessed by the way I protest,
Your world, gettin' it all of my chest
Yes the struggle grab me, hatin' better have me,
Drama from my Momma, disowned by my Daddy
What should I do, tuck my head and throw them rolos,
If anybody know about the trouble I bet Joe knows
And raw livin' it remind me, 
Of the shit that I want to put behind me

She gave me that look like please make it better
I told her with my eyes, meet me over there,
Instantly, she was the victim of a player

What about your man, she said ""Fuck him""
Let's roll, so we jumped in the Benz,
Left you at the bar, talkin' to your friends

I met this girl, her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked the ON microphone
When I met Joan, I took her home
She was just like a doggy all on my bone
I met another girl, her name was Ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann, I shook her hand
We ended up freakin' by a garbage can
The next young freak I met was Red
I took her to the house and she gave me head
She likes to freak is all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
There's another girl, her name is Mary
Talked about sex and the girl acted scary
I heard she was freakin' for my homeboy Jerry
Took her to the house and I popped that cherry
Young and tender, sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast
I tell you, homeboy, if you get a piece
She only talks about signin' a lease
I met this tender, her name was Lori
And a X-rated movie wouldn't tell her story
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa
And just like Lori, she's a real dick pleaser
My girlfriend's name was Michelle, 
Her booty was bigger than a tale on a whale
When i freaked Michelle, I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than flames in hell
I G'd this girl, her name was Tammy
I didn't want to do it cause the bitch was flammy
She had a best friend, her name was Jane
I pulled to the side and I spitted that game
I met a lot of freaks in my lifespan
Freaked one night with a girl named Pam
The very next day I saw her with her man
One week passed and I was in her again
I had an old tender, her name was Janine
She was thirty-two and I was only eighteen
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans
I want to big freak, fat and sloppy
I kick on back and I watch her mouth
Two tons of fun, big mama jama
A country-girl from Alabama
I met this freak, her name was Betty
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as hell, I was drippin' sweat
But I was all up in her tryin' to hold my breath
Bake and shake us, I met this freak in Vegas
She said her name was Donna
She was a built little freak from China
I said I don't pimp or gigolo
I'm havin' so much money that I don't need a hoe
You can break yourself but you can't break me
You never met a player like $hort, baby
I knew a dick sucker named Betty-Jo
Took her to my home and we did it on the floor
The girl got freaky and I tell you more
She was down on her knees beggin' to blow
She's like another freak named Rene
You get her alone and she'll make your day
Like Burger King, she knows the play
But a freak like Rene, you can have it your way

These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well

I met this girl, thick as hell
Only sixteen, said her name was Linell
I took her to my house, I could not wait
Her shit was much tighter than Central Safe
Let me tell you this since we talkin' young
I met another girl, said her name was Yvonne
Always talkin' about havin' fun
Once again in the bed I got it goin' on
I'm Sir Too $hort, couldn't be no punk
I try to get funky like female funk
So when you see me comin' or see me goin'
I keep my money, let the hoes keep throwin'
I once met a tender, she did it for free
On the Foothill bus number forty-three
All the way on the back she was workin' me
Had my big beatbox and I was jammin' the beat
I met this freak named Antoinette
Macked on the baby like an ice-cold vet
Everythin' she had is what I get
Cause I'm Too $hort, baby, I don't play that shit
I met another freak, her name was Rita
Baby thought Too $hort just might eat her
I told her like this, she can suck my peter
Or even go home cause I  knew I didn't need her
Scratched her name off my telephone book
Never again I took a second look
Cause the next young freak, her name was Sharon
She kept lookin', while I kept stairin'
Baby came through with my homeboy Darren
Her booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearin'
She never left, he cut out
I know you all know what I'm talkin' about
There's a freak named Shannon, such a sinner
She smokes that pipe and she's gettin' thinner
Shannon is cool but her mind is gone
One fat rock and it's goin' on
She had another buddy, came by my place
Thick ass bitch, said her name was Grace
She walked in the door workin' lace
You shoulda seen that look that was on my face
She's like this tender named Belinda
Homeboys call her Belinda the Blender
She gave head like she made it up
She was twenty years old with a big round butt
Had a girl look like olive oil
Her father was rich and the girl was spoiled
When she got mad he blood would boil
But I rapped her all up like aluminum foil

These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well

Shockedy life, Friday night, it's goin' on Too $hort
Three weeks ago I met this freak
She followed me around like Mary's sheep
I hid around the corner and when she came
I grabbed her by the arm and I asked her name
She said it was Anita and her man's in Santa Rita
I took her to my house and homeboy, I geed her
Set her on the way the very next day
Playboy $hort was ready to play
I bumped into this girl, her name was Roseann
We hit the motel and had it goin' on
Holiday Inn to the break of dawn
When I took baby home, I freaked her mom
I knew this tender named Sherrie
I took her to the house and let her freak on me
Baby was a fan, she loved my beat
But I wouldn't raise my leg to let her kiss my feet
I met this freak named Yolanda
Rolled baby doll like a brand new Honda
I was on top and she was up under
The bed hit the wall and it sounded like thunder
I once had a date with girl named Kitty
She was so fine with big fat tiddies
All night long she was actin' shitty
So i macked on baby like I was Frank Nitti
There's another girl, her name is Rose
I use to ride baby like brand new Volv's
I never saw Rose wearin' clothes
She's a penthouse pet, ready to pose
I was ridin' down the street when I met Janet
Her booty was bigger than the whole damn planet
Ass everywhere, I just can't stand it
Tried to palm it but I could not manage
I had this freak, her name was Bunny
Said I'm the only man who ever called her honey
Everythin' I did to her was funny
I macked on bunny and I took her money
Eight tonight a date with Shirlie
She was really short and her hair was curly
If you saw baby you liked this girlie
She was so fine I went to get her early
Shirlie was freakin' like a girl named Rachel
Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal
She liked to kiss all on my navel
Those are her lips on top of my label
I knew another freak, her name was Candy
Real big lips and they came in handy
I smooth got worked and it was so dandy
I hooked the brood up with my homeboy Randy
He did me a favor in return
Gave me a lizard, said her name was Laverne
Baby got tossed and I got it on
I grabbed the microphone and started singing my song
My young homeboy heard me rap
And said he had way more freaks than that
So I told him like this, they might be freakin'
But, boy, you never had that T-P-Treatment",Freaky Tales [Beat],1999
Too Short,"Yeah we gettin' real on this album y'all. 
You know I'm hearin' all these  rumors out here bout, 
They ran $hort Dogg up outta East Oakland. 
Nigga  moved to Atlanta, ain't got no mo love in the town. 
I got much love in Oakland y'all, you know what I'm sayin', 
I been doin' this shit fo years. 
So I'm a tell it to you jus' like it happened, bitch!.

I don't stop rappin',
Ever since the very first day,
I grabbed the microphone, made a funky ass tape,
I had sixteen hoes,
Suckin' ten toes,
Game from the ""O"",
An any real pimp knows,
The only love hoes get is what they paid fo,
Gimme my scratch,
What the fuck I'm a stay fo?
I gotta make moves bitch,
Stack some G's,
From the whole stroll,
To my fax machine,
I got money comin' in from everywhere,
From New York,
To L.A.,
To the motherfuckin' Bay,
It's true,
I'm the man G,
I'm underground 106 can't ban me,
All on the air sayin' they don't fuck wit me no mo,
I go back wit rap like K-P-O-O,
From the very first time I grabbed the mic,
Niggas smokin' burner,
Ready to fight,
I don't promote violence,
I'm from Oakland where the real kick it,
You might get killed nigga,
Or make a mill ticket,
Move down south 'cause the town is wild,
Now the radio jocks want to clown my style,
I raised too many rappers you support,
Ask 'em who they grew up on, Too $hort,
Fuck all that black ball shit it won't last,
Kmel y'all can kiss my ass.

[Chorus]
That's why the town got rid 'o $hort
That's why the town got rid 'o $hort

It all started back when see & H,
Went to T and be tryin' to playa hate,
I flipped a brand new Lexus,
93,
Joda Balls called me up said ya lyin to me,
He said I heard you an Ran got the cash an split it,
If I don't get my cut,
You motherfuckers gonna get it,
It was thirteen G's all mine,
Didn't give Teddy Gram one dime,
Now listen real close 'cause it might be,
Hard to follow,
Chris told Ted it was fifty thousand dollers,
Shit sound petty,
An it is,
But that's how it goes when you in show biz,
Niggas fallin' out,
Should be makin' millions,
Instead of studios,
We seein' lawyers in buildings,
Then we stop speakin',
Shit got funky,
I don't give a fuck, 
Motherfucker get my money,
I ain't never been a hoe you can't pimp me,
I do all the work while you pimp me,
I tried to buy him out,
But right about then, 
They let the lions out,
Niggas start eatin' that shit up,
You shoulda never listened,
I'm always on this money makin' mission,
Sold a car an a truck in Oakland fo that Lex,
Jock loaned me five an I was rollin' that bitch.

[Chorus: x2]

Don't believe everything you hear nigga.

I went to the freak-nik,
Shit turned me out,
Came back fo jack the rapper,
Bought me a house,
That was August '93 time to dip,
I hade warrants in the town an I was hot as shit,
Every time I got stopped,
Nigga went to jail,
Treat me bad 'cause I was hangin' wit criminals,
I wanted to buy me a house in the Oakland hills,
Nice lil' somethin' fo a half a mill,
That's was right around the time Chris hooked Dru Down,
The Luniz came through an them tricks got clowned,
Rappin' Ron tore 'em up on the freestyle tip,
An niggas ain't ran nobody outta shit,
Then they put it on the town,
Shit got real,
When you was in the fourth grade I had a record deal,
You got one hit record now you ballin',
You make one fake album you'll be fallin',
An that shit don't apply to me,
Present or past,
You can meet me at the mall an get my autograph,
Or you can flash back,
If you can do all that,
Me Fred Benz,
An Freddy Craps,
Smokin' burner upstairs in hot lips house,
It's been fifteen years an I ain't played out,
They playin' Too $hort steppin' on a Chevy pedal,
Back in the days Kmel played heavy metal.

[Chorus: x2]

Niggas shootin' at the studio late at night,
Seen a Cherokee,
Started shootin' at Spice,
At the E-40 picnic out in the park,
Niggas gather round fo some shit to start,
They had bullets wit my name,
But we never got to me,
See me sucker mothefucker,
Shootin' at the street,
It was me,
Boo, Howard, an Jock,
A full clip,
One in the chamber an it blockin' T.B.,
Still tryin' to be my pimp,
I could lose my life,
Or give my money to him,
I'd rather die before you use me,
I tried to buy him out,
The nigga sued me.

[TS] Beyotch!
[8B] Yeah, you know how they like it baby, nigga you can't retire!

Verse One: Too $hort, Eightball

From nineteen-eighty, through eighty-eight
I Don't Stop Rappin like my first tapes
When I was broke, I used to sell em instantly (instantly)
One look, you could tell it was the pimp in me (pimp in me)
In eighty-nine, I went on tour with Eazy-E (Eazy-E)
A bunch of fine bitches tryin to sleep with me
Every night, sold out, turnin young hoes
Tell her baby, no doubt, stick this dick in yo' mouth
I smoked a lot of weed, I said a lot of rhymes
Always fucked up in niggaz bitches all the time
Now I'm ridin on twenties wearin nice clothes
but ain't nuttin like pimpin hoes, and ridin Vogues
I live a good life, in my pursuit of happiness
I'm so glad, to get to the point of havin this
opportunity, for you and me to pass it on
Two years ago, I thought it'd be my last song

Me, Squeaky, Flex and J, on Saratoga Street
Smokin white boys, bumpin dopefiend beats
Eighty-eight, my pockets wasn't straight, but I was makin it
Niggaz like Lil' Tim was out there ballin sellin cakes n shit
I was right there, on the Mob Circle, writin raps
All about my snaps, tryin to put Ball and G on the map
Nowadays I own my shit and bone bad bitches
Kickin it with rich niggaz in rollers, and candy sixes
Deliverin hot shit like Pizza Hut for them hardcore thugs
Niggaz who pimp bitches and hit the highway with them drugs
Feel my flow, mix it in witcha chronic main
$hort Dawg, I don't know why you tryin to leave this game
State to state, plenty hoes and plenty money to make
Writing raps, makin more than them niggaz movin weight
The game been good to me, and I know that muhfucka bless you
Thanks for passin game, now let's get out here and make this loot

Chorus: Too $hort, Eightball, MJG

[TS] I won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
[TS] I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
[8B] We some presidential players, with money by the layers
[8B] Ain't nuthin you broke ass niggaz do that can fade us
[TS] I won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
[TS] I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
[MJ] I drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes
[MJ] and meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapes

Verse Two: MJG, Too $hort

I had to sacrifice, get things right
In this rap life, I paid my dues
Learn how to crawl, before I walk
Then I learned how to tie my shoes
Tryin crime, but it just didn't work for me
Matter of fact it did it worse for me
Gettin eyes scarred, bein weak one time ya hard
It can only do hurt to me
So I sucked up my peer pressure, and my pride
And realized that this rap shit was gon help me to survive
Stay alive, go with the flow but don't be no muhfuckin fool
Hell this music thing is all I got, I ain't makin straight A's in school
And ain't wind up to be dumber nigga, only to be different
So all the shit that you think we are, the shit that we isn't
When you raised up, where I come from, make it out is a blessing
Cause half the cats, where I come from, don't ever learn they lessons
My first love, even before I had a daughter, or a lady
was rappin, sweet lyrics, I love you, my baby
MJG, what you see, on TV, is fame
But the rapper I let loose almost anything, I love this game

I won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
I make too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
I live the fast life of a MC
and I sell a lot of records makin pimp beats
I could do a show tonight and make ten G's
Fuck til the mornin, sleep late and smoke weed
Three cars in my garage, truck in the driveway
I always, get my dick sucked on the highway

Verse Three: Eightball, MJG

My way (pimp til I dieee) fuck a hoe
Unless that hoe is breakin me off some dough, to hit the studio
Blowin, niggaz ain't knowin, how far this shit is goin
I wrote all my shit, but niggaz always talkin bout what I owe them
But I'm gon' show them, real niggaz stand on they own ten toes
So I'ma make all the money, and try my best to fuck all these hoes
Friend or foe, a bitch or hoe, rich or po'
Eightball got flow, MJG 

Here comes the one they call the P-I, M-P, never will retire
The tree-high, green leaf, helps me to get higher
Eightball and MJG, Too $hort, we all must be
the pimps of the industry, shit people pretend to be
Fuck so why should we, settle down
Leave the kitchen put the kettles down
Stop from fillin all you hoes
Give up the life of trues and vogues
Hell no, it ain't gon' happen, this shit too deep
So I hooked up with my comrades so we can all get rich, nigga

Pussy smellin sweeter than a half a key a dope smell
Knock that top back, told her I'd be right back
Nigga where your wife at, y'all niggas don't like that
I bring a bitch the rough shit, you be on some love shit
Kiss and hold and hug shit, she be wantin thug dick
You winin, and dinin, puttin all ya time in
I be into windin, knockin out the linen
Silk pink panties, but she can't understand me
I be buyin condoms, you be buyin candy
She love you, lust me, gansta shit, it must be
All the while you spoilin that bitch, so thinkin 'fuck me'
Hard for you to see that, 'cause you be on that weak rap
""Ay, can I get some roses please?"", nigga where your 'G' at
A gentleman, fuck that, wearin suits, what's that?
You hit the hoe she lay there, I hit the bitch she fuck back
Makin voices, noises, voices and noises (moaning)
But when she do, I send her home to you
Pussy hole swole up, everytime she roll up

Now I admit, I didn't put my prick up ya gal
She saves her pussy for you, she's just my dick sucking pal
She tells me her problem, I like to listen and learn
And I don't mind because she's always got a Swisher to burn
And a six-pack, I sit back, chill while she drives
With her skirt pulled down and her panties to the side
Wanna smoke, what's up, open up the glove compartment
Grab the Swisher, kiss her, get my lighter and spark it
Don't know how she do it nigga but when she be drivin
She be slobbin and bobbin while she's givin me noggin
And I've been, tryin to tell myself to chill
But I find myself just takin the wheel

(Hook) 2x

(Too $hort)
She followed me to the bathroom, and I ain't have to pee
I'm at the club tryin to do this little nasty freak
I met last week, you know the panties drop quick
She suck dick with two hands and a whole lotta spit
Average niggas get nervous around the bitch
Lick between her legs and run circles 'round her clit
Fall in love, she'll make your mind a wreck
When she lay on her back, and put her legs behind her neck
Sperm drinker, come in her mouth, she keeps suckin it
It's too sensitive, have a nigga sayin 
'fuck this shit, bitch, can I have my dick back'
You don't wanna hit that, you don't wanna be inside that kit-cat
She's too nasty, but I like that
Pussy have you right back, fuck where your wife's at
It's hard for you to fight that
Long throat, nut-gobblin bitch with a tight cat
Gettin head in a white 'Lac, bitch

Pimp niggas don't pay a dime,
I'm fuckin' 2 bitches at the same time
Then I hit the studio and I write a rhyme,
I Call it ""Tramp Hoes ain't Hard to Find""

I took 2 bitches to a hotel
I told em both ""you know I won't tell""
Bitch, curiosity killed the cat
you gotta lick the clit while I hit it from the back
Don't be stingy girl, lick my balls too
You was talkin' big shit when I called you
You said you never fucked another girl before
And you wanted me to help you so
Bitch, I took you down to the strip club
I told you ""look around, who you want to fuck?""
You picked thick chocolate, big booty, big tits
I told her she could have you, and this dick
She got so excited she got off work early
Jumped in the back and started lickin' on my girlie
I couldn't get home fast enough
Now its time to fuck

[Chorus] 

When we got to my room she started actin' nervous
Sat down and said ""lets order room service""
I said ""bitch, what are ya smokin'?
A big fat dick comin' from East Oakland""
I stuck it in her mouth she started moanin'
I said ""hang up, get off my telephone, bitch""
I put the game down immediately
I'm a vet from the town started freakin' them freaks
And once they started, they couldn't stop
I fuck em for awhile then I kick back and watch
Two bitches at the same time
And neither one of these hoes is mine
I don't give a fuck I'm a player
I been doin' this for years, I got bitches everywhere
You think I'm payin' hoes? You got the game distorted
You a trick, mad cause you can't afford it

[Chorus] 

Them bitches kissed 20 minutes straight non-stop
Strip girl on the bottom, lil' momma on top
It was beautiful, you know what happened next
Spent 20 more minutes lickin' each others breasts
Two titty suckin' hoes, navels and toes
Bitch rolled her on her stomach, licked her asshole
I was smokin' on a fat one, layin' in the cut
After seein' this shit, I ain't want to fuck
I want to see how long they can keep goin'
I don't know, I fell asleep on 'em
When I woke up I was gettin' my dick sucked
These hoes horny as fuck, they can't get enough
I was fuckin' them sluts till the sun came up
Nut in both their mouths, you ever done that stuff?
Dog baby, this shit ain't really nothin' to me
You better handcuff your ho or I'll be fuckin' your freak, nigga

[Chorus] 

Sing it, pimp niggas don't pay a dime
I'm fuckin' two bitches at the same time,
Fuckin' two bitches at the same time
Let em know pimp niggas don't pay a dime, bitch

Spend it on the strippers and the prostitutes
Do what you gotta do
No SoundScans got your record label hot at you
They droppin you, two years ago we was poppin you
You was talkin shit about nobody stoppin you
I told the lil' homey a long time ago
If you put your mind to it, you can find some dough
It don't matter, even if yo' pockets kinda low
All you gotta do is knock a fine ass hoe
Fuck that bitch like a porno star
Walk her to the corner I bet she won't go far
I knew the day would come when you would notice it
Get wise and realize bein broke ain't shit

That's why I'm pimpin, all the time
Gettin hoes to give me money, I'm gettin mine
You know I ain't lyin
cause what I spend and what I'm ridin is the shit
That's why I do this; straight pimpin, all the time
If you see my bitch hoein, I'm gettin mine
You know I ain't lyin, tricks love what I'm supplyin
It's the shit, that's why I do this

It's been around a long time
Pimpin, manipulatin minds, prostitutin women
Pussy - is worth a lot of money
She says that everyday you gotta pay me when you want me
Tricks like to fuck and do that freaky shit
You know I kick my hoe ass, she don't bring me gifts
I'm talkin cold cash money, nothin else'll do
Get my money bitch you better fuck until he's through
Make that trick come quick, and don't stop him
And if he's slippin, you better rob him
Go out and turn another date, don't hesitate
You know daddy loves you when you keep my money straight
You ride the best cars, eat good, and drink fat
You can't do this shit without me don't you ever think that
Recognize my bald head and my gangsta limp
Damn it feels good to be a pimp

That's why I'm pimpin, all the time
Gettin hoes to give me money, I'm gettin mine

It's the shit, that's why I do this

I hear you squares, you try to criticize us players
but when the pussy's on sale I see you always there
A good customer, you know yo' game ain't tough
And even though we came up doin all the same stuff
I'm a pimp, I turn a bitch out quick
Have her standin on the corner tryin to get some dick
Lay on yo' back bitch, and get my cash
Cause if you don't, I gotta kick yo' ass
Fuck all that drama
This ain't HBO I whup you like yo' momma
if you don't pay me hoe, I do this everyday
I check bitches and get paid
I want the money I ain't tryin to get laid
Ain't nuttin new about this shit, it's the oldest profession
Sellin pussy while it's snowin at the coldest intersection
I know how you feel about me, you love me
Turnin tricks thinkin of me

It ain't logical fuck an obstical bitch
How can I make twelve albums

And I am still clowin'

I used to be a broke nigga
Dreamin' about broads and smoking bigger
Dedicated to the rap game

2000 makes me a 20 year veteran
Still making money and I don't stop rapping
That's my motto even if you niggas hit the lotto
You never could win not until I go
I know you squares can't hang with me
What you talking about you can't spit this game like me
Some of y'all suckers need to fall in love
And stay there and quit trying to be a player
Fuck around and fuck your life up
Or a tramp ass bitch with a nice butt
You should of went to collage
Got your degree and a job stop trying to be like me
It's too hard cause you don't even know this streets
And me I mack this hoes with need
See and you all you do is smoke that weed
She broke your heart and got you on your knees
But me I know how to treat a bitch
Fuck all that nice ass sweetheart shit
Suck my dick now that's foreplay
Now I am about to fuck you on the floor in the doorway
Treat you like a hoe okay? you like that
Leave when I am finished and say I'll be right back
Bitch! you already knew what it was
What's a dog like me going to do with your love
I drive it down the street tied to my bumper
I don't care how find she is
I am trying to dump her
I already fucked her
You need to get on bitch and find you a sucker
Get married divorced and get half
Maybe you should reason with her before she gets mad
Or maybe my nigga you should slap that bitch
If not then you need to snatch that bitch
By the thought and let her know this is how it goes
Say what's on your mind, now she knows
Some of y'all ladies need to check your man
For acting like a bitch every time he gets a chance
Back slap him tell him shut up and stop crying
And stop all that wineing
Bitch ass nigga you need to buy yourself some business
And quit askin' all them motherfucking questions
Ain't no slaves around here
Ain't nobody gettin' payed around here
It's all true about this hoes and me
You ain't got no game you don't know what she needs
Lame than a motherfucker about this mack shit
Still letting bitches manipulate your actions
When you going learn how to wear the pants
Try and give this real player rhythm a chance
It's all about the money and feeding your family
If I am mackin' hoes and you can't stand me
Keep my name out your ? mouth
You hate a player and I find out
I might fuck your bitch little sister or your momma
More than one time just to add to the drama
Give you something to talk about
Life long trick learn your mouth
Cause I don't stop mackin' and I am always rapping
I fucked your little sister but I was just praticin'

Diggin' this big ass dick in her gut

But you never knew your father, he never bothered
Your last boyfriend used to grab you by the collar

Fine woman like you, I don't find the shit funny
You need management, not an amateur pimp
Who don't know what to do, when the money ain't cool

I'm a hustler, I always eat good
Fat house in the hood, new shoe on my foot
Things ain't been the same since he put you out
Something you ain't never felt good about

Let's get this money, that's what I want you for
Don't make me wait too long, cause life is too short

Jumped in my Caddy, and called me daddy

You trying to convince yourself it's the right thing
Once upon a time you had nice dreams
Now you don't sleep good, what you thinking of?
Nobody can't tell you how to get that love

It's right here, I know you understand me
I'll be your daddy, I'll be your whole family
No stress, never have to worry bout a thing
The best restaurants, furs and diamond rings

All paid for by the suckers and lames
All you need is me in this motherfucking game
To the top, that's where we going
Where the good green don't stop growing

Don't ever turn on me
Give me everything you earn for me
Be together forever, never lonely
Smoke my last weed, a big fatty

Pull up her skirt, and lick on her clit

I'm a California nigga, born and bred.
Got a wild imagination when I'm on the bed.
I love my woman, I love her girlfriend and her sister.
Felt on her momma's booty but never kissed her.
Been mackin' on these hos since the eighties.
It don't take much for me to break hos.
You must be dreamin' if my bitch chose you.
We in another lifetime, my game is foolproof.
It won't happen as long as she's my bitch.
I give a fuck if you fake pimps peep my shit,
'Cause I'm a mack these hos like never befo',
And every time I grab the mic I gotta better flow.

I went from rappin' about the clothes I was wearin' at a party,
To all the hos that let me see their naked bodies.
It's not an overnight transition thing,
I wasn't born pimpin' hos, wearin' pinky rings.
Never walked around sayin', ""Who am I?""
'Cause when I seen old movies like ""Superfly,""
It was my destiny, to live a pimp legacy,
And reach levels other niggas never see.
In '81 I rapped friendly, but now its on.
One day I said somethin' on the microphone
About sixteen hoes, suckin' ten toes,
People loved it, that's how the story goes.
It's true, in 1982
Me and Freddy B sold the tapes to you,
X-rated, talkin' 'bout bitches and thugs.
All the dope-dealers gettin' rich sellin' drugs.
Too $hort bumpin' in the background.
You thought I retired, bitch, I'm back now.
Like a house party, or a side show,
I got the Spanish, black, and white hos.
Ask an east Oakland nigga, I bet you he know,
""Is she mixed with Japanese or Filipino?""
I always spit the game when I rap.
All I want to know is where the hos at?",Where They At?,2000

I love gettin my head blown
I love gettin my nuts rubbed
I love gettin my dick licked
I love gettin my nuts sucked
 I love gettin my pussy ate
 I love when niggas see me masterbate
 I love it when you nut all in my face
 I love it baby, but I can't stand the taste

I once knew a bitch named Erica
Way back in the day, she had a geri curl
I made her suck my dick on the ferris wheel
Been pimpin all my life, big player for real

It's makin me nut, but feel our fantasy
Come on come on baby, won't you get the best of me
I SMELL PUSSY!!

Get T double D on the double stack
And one dose of the dick, she be doublin back
See me, I've been known to shit on hoes
Cuff her cold, straight spit on hoes

I been known to step on a bitch
Put a thumb in your ass, while I slap your clit
But ain't no way that I'ma lick yo' shit
Tell 'em what she is Short Dog (Be-itch!)
[Chorus - 2x]
[Trick Daddy]
I love, gettin my thug on
No dirty joints, in this cool zone
I love gettin my thugs on
Everything that's copper, put dubs on
I love this..
[Too Short]
When I'm at the club
See a girl get freaky and I slap her butt
She try to say ""Short Dog, that's enough""
You know I love it little mam, can't pass it up

Man look at her, baby look good
The way she dancin, maybe I should
step up to her, and run this game
I want to FUCK - I don't want to know her name
I play the role though, act like I'm interested
By the end of the night, she done been molested
And she loves it, that's how I do it
You tried to get with her too but you blew it
I told her I ain't had no woman, I got three
And you ain't leavin this club without me
cause I'll be - your breakfast in the mornin
See the sun rise while you're nake and you're moanin
And when I get up, talkin like a pimp
That's when reality, starts to sink in
You want me to fuck yo' pussy 'til it hurts
And I want to put yo' fine ass to work, bitch

you're a player (a real player)
I don't care about these other hoes

I can look in yo' eyes and see I got you
You so fine girl I had to knock you
We left the bar, we in the car
I'm treatin this bitch like a movie star
It's all game, I just want to hit it quick
Try to turn a bitch out so I can hit a lick
And it's a trip, she's such a good bitch
Mama told you bout niggaz that look slick
You knew about the hoes when you met me
I'll add you to my stable if you let me
So you can get me, what I need so quickly
I want G's bitch, about a hundred fifty
All these hoes, know my style
I'll put you to work but don't go too wild
Cause we'll get this cash, just take our time

But he still stuck his dick in yo' mouth bitch
And after all that gettin' fucked on the floor
He called a taxi to take you home in the mornin'

Dumb bitch, you just got fucked by a flunkie
See you at the club and you actin' like you want me
Don't make me laugh
We get married, and you take half

You wanna walk down the aisle but I can't go

Hope you come back, but you just can't stay
We can get together on another day
I come get you, when I miss you
'Cause if I see you every day I'd probably diss you

Rich man, what she gotta do to get you to call her?
Better talk about, might like what you hear

Smob to the tip, I feel no guilt
She's young and she's fine and she bout to get peeled
I know you heard why, no need to tell
You looking at a certified P.F.L.
You want to be like me? I don't think you can
Your girlfriend loves you, need to be her man
She never told you how she was a Too Short fan
She kept it to herself, you wouldn't understand
I met her at the mall when she was mad at you
She said, gimme a call and I was glad to
That night, I gave your girl a ex tab
The best sex she ever had

It'd be nice to wake up to some little smiling faces
Saying, ""Daddy"" instead of being in wild faces
Smoking fatties, four hoes in my Caddy
Each one willing to have me
Sometimes you want my life, sometimes I want yours
I'm trying to find a wife and you trying to find whores
Which one of us is looking in the devil's eyes?
I'd settle down if I could have seven wives
But that's illegal, and everywhere we go
We roll through the town taking every ho
And of course, we show no remorse
I'm doing one-twenty with your ho in the Porsche

Till death do us part, with all your heart
It was love, right from the start
But could you do it, would you change yo' life
And get married, stop running game every night?
Ex-player with his wife and kids
Looking happy, I wonder if he really is
I would hate to be committed even though I ain't wit it
Still out in the streets trying to get it
It's hard for a man with access to one vagina
To be faithful, when she's so much finer
Than his wife, she seen it coming
He fell in love with another woman

[Chorus]

I keep coming back to the same thought
Falling in love'll throw the game off
You let her get to you, you know you still care
But I was raised by them real players
I try to tell the homies fuck the party
This player lifestyle ain't for everybody
You gotta make your own choice, it's yo' life
How would it be without yo' kids, and no wife?
Waking up with a tramp, you don't like
Nigga, you better hear what I'm saying on the mic
You want to be a pimp, you better go back home
Leave them tramps alone, you know you wrong

These are the tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
(Tune in to the history channel)
These are the tales (learn a lesson bitch)
These are the tales that I tell so well (Short Dog)
I'm thinking way back, it's been a long long time
In 1980 I wrote my first rhyme
I like to spit a lot of game
But back then, I was just saying my name
I had a record player, on my stereo
Got down on my knees with my radio
From Oakland California with some new shit
I'm Sir Too Short I'm bout to do this
In 1981, that's where it all begun
We do it for the money we don't rap for fun
Five dollar's for a tape, Too Short and Freddy be	
Money in my pocket's all I ever need
It was me, Fred B, and Freddy Brack 
Dipped the sermon sticks then we smoked them phat
While we rapped about the bitches and all the ho's 
Can't be in the hole trying to ball without vogues
In '82 you was in the game
With a Falcon, Cougar or a Mustang
Me and Freddy B used to hit the turfs
With a bag of tapes putting in work, bitch
In '83 you hit a house party
A dollar get you in and a dollar for a drink
I'm on the turntable smokin' get-right
And at mid-night I'll be rappin' on the mic
I did the same thing, for the next two years
That's why they say my name, when I come through here
When I was 16, I wanted to be a mack
I went to Fremont High with Lil' D and Black
Young ballers in the town livin' real phat
Never had the sack but I smoked a little crack
Crushed up in the weed, we call em bass rock Caddies
Goin' on them grimmies make them ho's call me daddy

[Chorus] 
These are the tales, these are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, these are the tales that I tell so well

[Too Short]
It's been 15 years since that shit happened
But Too Short don't stop rapping
In '85, I was on the right page
Ten thousand niggas, Short live on stage
Underground tapes was all they ever heard
But the whole crowd sang along with me word for word
And that changed everything
Went to Seventy Five Girls and hooked up with Dean
Real player-ism and that's no joke
Snort a lot of coke with ho's that like to smoke
I was making records but wasn't making money
You can take it seriously or you can think its funny
By '87, I was on my own, started Dangerous Music
And I made the song ""These are the tales, the freaky tales""
No radio or video or CD sales
Six platinum's in a row Ice Cube and Cool J
Who else did that shit? Short Dog from the Bay
These ho's try to play it safe
But I been macking hard since eighty-eight
And from eighty-nine to ninety-six
I was rappin' on the mic talkin' shit about a bitch
I'll retire 10 times and I'll still be here
My old records sell about a half a mil' a year
I say ""bitch get naked"" so pimpishly
Spit rhymes through decades and centuries
And bitches just love my dirty mouth
When I see you again I'ma cuss you out, bitch!
That's my gift, now all you rappers get to say that shit
I won't sue you, but that's the trademark
I was a grown ass man when you was playin' in the park lil' nigga

[Chorus]

[Too Short]
Now I'm in Atlanta I still love the O
I gave you my bitch but you can't have my flow
I guest appeared on 47 albums
Fuck McDonald's and fuck Calvin
I get money with Erick Sermon when I'm in New York
I get respect, they call me Too Short
I live swell in A.T.L. cause I'm a player
We fucking hella ho's at X House in Decatur where it's greater
You know how we ride
I got love for all niggas from the EastSide
It was me, Ant Banks and Shorty be	
All we need to do is find my nigga PeeWee
We used to be on Murdel Street makin' funky songs
If you see him tell him Short said its back on
Lets get this money, midwest down South
East coast West coast ride out, bitch

We can still get together, 'cause I'm goin' be here for a couple of days""

Couldn't nobody ride wit me doe, cause the car only had 2 seats

Told me her name was Sharell but all of her friends call her Cici
Say she up he a going to NYU, but originally she frum DC
Say she'd love ta freak me, reminisce while listening to my CD
Lay me out on the beach feed me strawberries n kiwi

No sleep, I'm lookin' 40
With three bricks in a 740
Bitch I ain't got time to party
I'm breakin' bread with Dominican niggaz
Over a hot Bennigan's dinner
Thinkin' how I'ma cop the 6 at the beginnin' of winter
Chrome it out and then fit it with timber, that's wood grain
What you ain't know, this a hood thang
All my thugs let ya wood swang

They claim they caught me at the docks with a flock of snow
I bring the pain, cock back and swing the thang
Yo' girl mad cause she told me don't even bring the thang
And then I told her, I said it's cool, get at me
And then my voice got raaaassspy
'Cause I was smokin' on some Cali and my eyes was dazed
I was in the zone, coulda thrown up them tre's

Punched him in his chin and then he passed out

'Cause niggaz will run up in yo ass like you a nasty bitch
You little bitch, that's what the callin' you

Tryin' to reap my harvest
I'm starvin' livin a life of ballin'
I'm still tryin' to find my callin'
And make a change, look into my eyes all you see is pain
Look up in the sky all I see is rain, ain't no sunshine
Call me a monkey, but look I got Kay Nine bloodlines
With P-9's and semi-autos, ain't guaranteed tomorrow
Maintain my burrow

Now I'm reachin' for a new height
Nothin' but love and we glued tight
Played and renew sight

Too Short,"Me and Too Short, we do the frequent miles
In and out of ports keep secret files
First peep the smile, then flash the wrist
Diamonds get them pissy when it's stashed like this
On a flash like this, according to the script
Hoes do the choosin', a boss he flipped
I skipped from Peru, went straight to the map
Them boys from the Bay and all day we be at it

Yea, we fly first class, touch down like pimps
What's the next event, tell me what town it's in
I'll see ya there man, I always do
I had some good weed, some hoes too
What the feinin' for, give it too'em
All around the world we get to do'em
When I'm on vacation everyday I fuck
Bad bitches see a player, wanna lay up

The places I go make me so international
People I meet make me so international
Wherever I go I'll be so international
Wherever it goes I'm just so international

I run into my folks, nothin's too far
Got a few breezies, gettin' drunk at the bar
I don't care where I'm at, I'll make ya girl share that
I step in the room she recognize a player mack
Known for my raps, gettin' blown in the back
Gimme 10 G's a microphone and some 'Yak
And don't forget my Kahlua and Baliey's
Look and learn, don't ask me what I'll do to ya lady

Now what I'll do to ya lady, I'll do to ya life
Come through, break you, get out with my stripes
Pipe down big dog, ain't no need to be soar
'Cuz I'll I'm comin' for is the Christian Dior
Catch ya boy off shore, candy bars in the store
Forever papered up but they handed me more
Did Twins in Minnesota at the All-Star Break
Bounced all accross state on them concert dates

The places I go make me so international
People I meet make me so international
Wherever I go I'll be so international
Wherever it goes I'm just so international

California Baby, that's the way we get down
Handcuff'em now, you know we comin' to town
No, we don't smoke brown but we do shoot rounds
Green 16's over Rick Rock sounds
Call me flip flop now, mix yellow and brown
Korean, European, know they all get down
Muslims get the money, man, I'll see you in Guam
I'm there 2 weeks need freaks and bomb

We knocked these grey girls from Oregon
They had a flight to catch early in the mornin' to Portland
It doesn't matter where ya from, baby
It's the last line, we can have some fun, maybe
Me and B-La, yea, we got jungle fever
But it's all about the money with us
We don't want ya people to think we discrimanatin'
Can't make the pimpin' wait
I spit a lil' game then I listen to what women say

Wherever I go I'll be so international

I knew a tight white bitch named Marianna
She lived right around the corner from Temecula
See I was bored, I fucked both of them whores before
So I called my other bitch Elsinore

She wasn't cracking
So I called up Hesperia and Monrovia and Valencia
I got some pussy from Pomona and her sister Corona
It ain't nothing like them hoes in southern California

I knew a bitch named Irvine
She had a cousin with the name Santa Ana
It was short for Anaheim
I got high in Riverside with Receda and Rosarito
And Santa Clarita and [unverified]

I'm pleased to meet you
I've been all around the world
And with over a thousand girls
And homeboy I don't know what you have been told
But Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

But lately I been doing the platinum pose
Knoc-Turn'al's on 128 girl
What? I'll be right over

Magazines choreograph me in photos
I put out with three dime pieces slamming four doors
And if I can use cities in relation to hoes
I probably fucked San Fernando's daughter, Santa Barbera

And her best friend Alameda and Sierra
And Ramona's little sister Covina
And I don't know what you thought
Whether you turned the cat in the night bitch

Still the only manipulation weapon you got
Knoc-Turn'al ain't the one to fall victim to your plots
Before I save a hoe from the block
Her great grandchildren's corpses will rot
Fuck a hoe

I'd rather have money and a multiple round spitting glock
Four mansions with multiple cars investing my chips in stock
Even if I can't spell dow jones I still pull out fat knocks

Can't understand it girl

You know us ballers never have one woman

And when you need us we never come running
That's why now you think about your ex again
You want to page him just to have sex with him
But instead you better call your next of kin

And complain these ballers won't let you in
She don't love you she loves money and sex
Bitches shoot you in the head for a Rolex
I know the bitch is a dick fiend

I fucked her one night when she was sixteen
I know it seems like a long time ago
But I fucked her again when she was twenty four

Somebody let him know.. tell that nigga
His bitch is out of pocket
It was me and yo' broad, ridin in my 'llac

She tried to climb on top of me and slide on my lap
I said hold on baby, we almost to the spot
We goin' do somethin' nasty, with all this lust you got
I fucked her on the floor then we got up in the bed

Woke up in the mornin', can't remember what we did
Last night we was drunk, stinkin' dirty motherfuckers
Stayed up all night, 'til 7:30 can't touch us
When we down on the beach, in the sand in Miami

I done found me a freak, done got my hand in her panties
She was playin' in the water, MAN she was wet
So I laid her on her back, I pulled her panties to the left
I told her... naw baby, we ain't do it too soon

Straighten up your dress, let's go up to my room
Tell your man you was lost, ran into a boss
Then I opened that ass up like a can of sauce

Sucker ass niggaz don't know how we rock
They can't even handle it
When you tell the truth, they can't stand a bitch

We don't like those lame marks
That run the other way when the game starts
'Cause they don't know what to do
Don't lie tell me why would I fuck with you

Stop hatin' since we datin' the same lady
Don't hate the player, hate the game baby
I like her style, she's kinda wild
And when we do it we don't waste time goin' out

We into it like the X-Rated flick with no plot, it's so hot
Don't hesitate and don't stop 'til we on top
She got a dude - but what I gotta prove?
Ain't no need to creep, you know she's a freak

Take it all, 'til the balls, disappear in her jaws
Then she take off them drawers, let me hit them sugar walls
And when I'm done havin fun tryin to be a player
She kiss my thang goodbye and say I'll see you later

Now if you can't take it mayne you need a good girl
Take a ride around the town and try to look for her
'Cause yo' wife's a hoe, you might like to know
If she see a big dick, she might go..

[Chorus]

I watched her eye, she witcha man, stop starin
Stop the lies, there's no comparin
You want to ride well let's go; I got a magic carpet with vogues
I'm nice to the ladies but I'm hard on the hoes

And when you jump in my car bumpin ""Freaky Tales""
You told me pull it out, you want to see it's real
I know your type girl, you ain't fin' to wait
That's how a pimp taste ridin on the interstate

It's in your mouth, make you want to scream and shout
You can swallow or spit, when the cream comes out - bitch!
Just don't tell your man
'Cause whores start wars when they know they can

I understand, you really want to do me
Dance to a slow jam, ""Feelin' on Your Booty""
And after tonight, when you kick it with a real one
All them fake-ass niggas you ain't even goin' feel 'em (hell nah)

When she'll give the pussy up, even to a total stranger?
And, I'm just one of 'em, you can't trust none of them
They'll say they love you while they wipin' your cum on them

Then they'll run and tell her friends how she found another sucker
To pay a fee for pussy but not me, motherfuckah
I move quick with my pool stick, slicker than Willie
Slicker than Kelly, slicker than KY Jelly

But really this dick has got me in a lot of trouble recently
I bend 'em and go in 'em and don't even have the decency
To call her, my balls have been leaked of most of their fluids
I used to put the rubber on and skeet straight through it

And it seems, that I always keep my pipe in these hoes
Keep my mic at these shows, 'cause that's the life that I chose

Back then I woulda broke ya broad, nowadays I just let her be

Booty calls, it ain't nuttin for her to just stick around here and lick me
'Cause I run through broads and never get enough, maybe I'm too selfish
But I can't help it, can't stay witchu girl
'Cause I can't tell if it's official or just another ritual

It's hard for me to find a wife, it's nothin' for me to get a hoe
I know it sounds pitiful, sometimes I'm blessed, sometimes I'm cursed
If it's supposed to be the best then tell me, what's the worst?
I'll be a PFL 'til I'm a old nigga

'Cause I never spend my life with groupies or gold diggers
I see these bitches now, shake it naked tryin' to make it
If you spendin' all his money, take it bitch, you can't fake it
When it's real, I'm cappin' like the snub-nosed, they pay me

I love hoes, never go home when the club close
I do shows, ride new vogues and keep two hoes

Ever since you was young, you felt the need to explore

Baby girl you'se a natural, you can't hide it
The way you put that strap on, and let her ride it
Gave her multiple orgasms, witcha vibrator
All five flavors tasted like Life Savors

I know you love her, everything about her
Laid in the bed, you sprinkled baby powder, on the sheets
Smilin, kissin down her spine
Climbed over, and then why'all did the 69

Soft as a baby when her butt is in yo' hands

She didn't take ex pills, smoke weed or drink
Just take your clothes off, and let her kiss that thing

While I'm foldin yo' money in half

She's been tellin me things that I want to hear 
So I hit you on another day, another year maybe 
I still want to see you baby 
I know I told a few lies, you want to be my lady 
I let you ride with a player in my new truck 
Take you straight to my house, you can do me up 
And back down again, get around your friends 
Let 'em know, e'ry nigga from the town's a pimp 
My daddy was a player, my grandpa too 
Now what the fuck else am I supposed to do? 
Put my finger on the pussy, rub the nipple next 
Short Dawg's in the house with the triple X 
I'm a hooker's dream, a hoe's delight 
They prove it, with bankrolls every night 
You like to kiss her, she like to drink sperm 
Get you high, smokin that pink sherm 
I don't have sex with her, she just give me head 
Like the ex-President, I don't need a bed 
Let it drip down your cheek, get all on your dress 
Rinse the evidence or rub it all on your tits 
I don't care - cause I'm cold as ice 
I don't feel nothin for you, think you know I'm nice 
That's what you heard about Todd when I'm gettin hoes 
Leave a trail of broken hearts when I let 'em go 
It's not my fault, cause they be all in the club 
Believin what I say, bitches fallin in love 
When all I really wanted was a little sex 
Turn your ass out with my triple X

And if I cain't knock you I bet I get her 
Cause I'm a hard workin pimp, I'm not a quitter 
These hatin lames, don't even realize 
Short Dawg's dirty rhymes make them fantasize 
I don't dream about pussy cause I get too much 
Can't believe that nasty slut didn't let you fuck 
But maybe you ain't ready for the skills she got 
Non-stop, hit the cot, the bitch still be hot 
She's workin tonight, she'll stick to the script 
My life is so tight, when hoes flip you tricks 
Put a sponge on her pussy and she'll still be wet

It's nothin new - I've ran up in a few 
Hit the party had the hardest G's cuffin them too 
Cause I'm a mack, the whole world knows that 
I'm in the house, you better hold your hoes back 
Fuck $hort - that's what the bitches thinkin 
Put my hand up her dress and her clit was stinkin 
I gotta pass! Pussy smell like ass 
So I jumped in my Benz and gave it hella gas 
I can't believe you nasty girls tryin to get some 
Sit on my shit and give my dick the runs 
Like the East coast homies they don't slip son 
Too many women in the world, you bound to get one

Last week I had everything
Uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago
I had the money, had the cars, the bitches
Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago
And the jewelry,
And then my motherfucking niggas started snitching
Uh-huh, uh uh, yo
Bitch!

Growing up in the hood just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for, all to see
Problems, I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Met him unlocked doors, off my keys
Yeah we spoke, much more than cordially
Man he broke bread with me, my business spreads with me
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
He's talkin' reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said, ""Damn dog, what, nine weeks and you're home?""
He said, ""Main man, you think shit's sweet cause you're home.""
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
The crackers up there bleaching your dome, you're reaching
I said, ""The world don't stop I've got to keep keep on.""
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spot, store to add some more features to my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe cause niggas is two-faced
And they show the other side when they catch a new case
It's on

It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago)

Funny what, seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip now you dropping names
Uh-huh, uh-huh (It was all good just a week ago)

Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell
We both came in this game, blind as hell
I did a little better, had more clientele
Told you put away some cheddar now you crying for bail
Seventeen and I'm holding on to around a mill
I could bail out and blow trial and come around on the pill
Had niggas thinking I was from Uptown for real
I had so much hustle plus I was down to ill
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville
Down and dirty, down to fight the round thirty
Freezing on them corners still holding my crack
Looking up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?
Came from flat broke to letting the dough stack
You tell them feds I said I'm never going back
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious

It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked

Funny what, seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip now you dropping names
Uh-huh, uh-huh (It was all good just a week ago)

The lawyer I retained you said you leaking some things
All this after a week in the bang
I'm mad at myself cause I didn't spot the weak and lame
I would of bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing
Nigga this was the oath, to the top of broke
Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us
We sposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry
That's right, the same game that make you mad could make you die
It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap
Who would of thought you'd get popped one time and rap?
Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad
And your son gotta grow up like, ""This is my dad?""
The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
You'll always be in jail nigga, just minus the bars

It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked

I kick her where she stash the crack
In the plastic sack, when she crash the 'llac
Punk bitch!

They tryin' to give the rap game to some real punks
It's just like when disco, killed the funk
Can't tell me nothin', when I know I'm right
Like a bowlegged bitch with a overbite, that suck it right
Player this pimp don't lie
How many porn stars you know that went to Crenshaw High?
A lot of fuckin' for a whole lot of nuttin'
You just wannabe noticed so you're out there sluttin'
I never really cared about popular fame
It's all about sittin' on top of the game
So don't stop 'til your panties drop
Fuck the mayor, the preacher, and a cop
You better tell him what it cost, get his mind on track
Cause he look like he lost
Bring him back, and dig in his pockets quick
Steal his watch, and make sure he got a drop, beotch",Burn Rubber,2003

Girl, you worked all night for that chump change
Let them ballers write you off as a fun thang

Take my hand, I got a quick plan
I know you dream about marryin' a rich man
See his wife in the Benz with the cute babies?
The hype'll make your friends and you crazy

'Cause you know about his two ladies
But he ain't fuckin' wit'chu, baby
Come, holla at your Uncle $hort
I'll have you playin' these niggaz like a sport

All this time you play around, you love to love me, lay you down
If you'd like to suck a dick, I bet you'd like to fuck a trick

My name is Too $hort, I'm known for pimpin' women
And last night, I did it again
New money, new bitches
Why they actin' crazy, who is it?

I never heard of Too $hort, then you must be a square
Fuck around and get slapped when you fucks with a player
Real women get much respect
Gold diggers and groupies, don't fuck with it

I'd rather get a real hoe
Put the bitch to work and get some real dough
I don't wanna spend a night for cash
What'chu been doin' all day wit your triflin' ass? Bitch

All you ladies in the place, I'd love to let you have a taste
I'll put my dick up in yo' face, why you hobo hoe?

I made too many songs to name the tracks
Not enough walls to hang the plaques
Say hater, what you aimin' at?
You ain't no G, you can't be claimin' that

Your girl said she had to find a trick
'Cause she don't like you or your tiny dick
I don't really care, what she's sayin'
As long as this song is what she's playin'

I know she better slow that roll
I ain't said a word and yo' hoe just chose
You know I gotta take her from you
And after today, you couldn't make her want you

All this time you play around, you love to love me, lay you down
If you'd like to suck a dick, I bet you'd like to fuck a trick
All you ladies in the place, I'd love to let you have a taste
I'll put my dick up in yo' face, why you hobo hoe?

I just don't know what bitches see, why all these hoes want chicken feed
Ain't none of these hoes worth 50 cents
So break these ladies all you pimps
Never have this much fun anywhere, to go back home, I just don't care
Me leave this game, no I don't dare, why you hobo hoe?

Don't make me hurt yo' ass

I heard Short Dog settled down and tied the knot
You think I'm dreaming, you think I fade 'em all and lied a lot
My real friends know I always try to find me a woman
But everywhere I go, bitches try to slide me something

Now listen up, I try to make it quick
I tell you about my greatest hits my latest flick was a porno
'Cuz I reached that level I fulfilled all my fantasies
I passed several beautiful women, I'm a thrill seeker, a pro player
My specialty is ex-cheerleaders, dancers, gymnasts and ballerinas

They all hot like some halapenos
If I released the names and pictures of all the bitches
Drop everything you doing and call the missus
She was young when she met me, so don't hate her
I'm an entertainer and a master manipulator

Way before you knew your bitch, she's kinda fast
I still wanna do your bitch

You know the saying, don't bring your girl 'round me
Did you think my greatest hits was gonna be some songs?
Nope, just some stories about a bunch of thongs, fo' sho'

She's the type that you had to marry
You walked in the room and said Hallie Berry
That's what she looked like so I put my thing up in her
Rolled over and said goodnight

When I woke up in the morning, she looked the same
So I did the same thing to her, hooked her mayn
I hit her two best friends first that's what I did
She heard I was good in bed that's what they said

From 14-41, 4'11-6 feet
Lil' mama was a big freak
The 6 footer had her time with me
I got some supermodel head on Miami Beach

Then I finger fucked the woman on the plane next to me
When it landed, the flight attendant had sex with me
And they ask, “Is it the pimp in you?”
I hit reporters morning after interviews

Checking in, lil' cutie at the front desk
All in my face, lookin' like she wants this
Later on, she asks me to play her a song
Getting nasty in my room with her uniform on

I been with roommates, sisters, even twins
Next door neighbors, so rose and best friends
I got passed around the crew, willingly
Until this very day they all feeling me

Cause nowadays a lil kid might shoot you down
Life's wild in the town

Caught in a trap, but don't know that you in
Had a million, now you ain't got two cents
You can't say nothin, now what
I don't hear you talkin all that loud stuff
If you live and you die by the game and you lose
At least you did spend your life tryin to change
You're thuggin and you love the streets
Huggin the block, sellin rocks, gettin major heat
And niggaz hatin, and you ain't stop to think about
Niggaz runnin they mouh, niggaz cessed you out
That's how it goes down
What happened to the days when we could hug a block
Flippin rocks and just get money
I remember when you and me used to ball, we had it all, and we took a fall
That's how it goes down
That's how it goes down

She's all about that get rich
Treat a nigga like the lotto, he's a quick pick
... it's nothin to a boss bitch
What happened to his cash flow? He lost it
She don't give a fuck about none of you guys
She make you look so bad, I bet you want a disguise
I knew the day and time would come
When she went out in the world and had to find her one
He sponsors all her daily, activities
I'm not her pimp, she don't pay me or give me fees
I just laced her with the game, so she could shake those lames
And try to take her change, I told her make yo' name
And turn the tables on 'em, I call her DJ Break-a-Trick
Cause all your money she'll be takin it
Put her on the pedestal, your queen on the throne
And she's still gon' bring the money home
[Chorus: Too $hort]
(Make me say ohh) What she gon' do?
(Ye-yeah ye-yeah) What she gon' do?

(You're blowin my mind with the love that you're givin)

[Verse Two]
I knew she had potential, to be a real player
Get paid up the ass by a millionaire
She ain't tradin sex, like these broke hoes
Her shit is worldwide, these bitches loco
She took the show on the road, for the fun and the thrills
Now it's nothin but hundred dollar bills
She got a lot of G's, spend 'em how you please
All you broke-ass hoes, get up off yo' knees
Don't go to Hoe College if you want some mo' knowledge
Cause bitches graduate and end up with fo' dollars
You can be a hustler, and never be a baller
He tried to bread her up whenever he would call her
But the bitch was too dumb, to ask for a thang
I try to teach 'em when they young, so they don't pass on the game
And when you get your thang on
Remember where you got your game and where you came from
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
It's obvious, we don't come from the same world
But you still fell in love with the game girl
Now you're, dedicated since you elevated
And you, you never hated, just celebrated
You can't play with the game, you gotta go get it
It's fire - stop drop and then roll with it
Let a baller finance your brand new car
And if he can't do more, you better kick him out the door pimpin
Tell him how you like diamond rings
So fine, that's why he want to buy you things
Now you spendin and shoppin, like you playin a sport
Cause you listened to the game that you got from Uncle $hort
I'm proud of you - what you grown to be
Don't tell him nothin - you always belong to me
You can travel the world and get your stack on

[Verse One]
I spent so many days with you, so many nights
It's nice, I wanted you to be my only wife
We didn't make it, I couldn't take it
I tried to square up, it's too hard I couldn't fake it
And now I see why, since I was knee high
I swore to live and die by the P.I.
And I'm stayin true, born in this game and it's payin too
I wish I could have stayed witchu
But it's over, I love you and I still care
We can kick it any time, but I'm still a player
... damn you got that look I like
I tried to settle down it felt like you took my life
I left town, I got women all around
While I was out soul-searchin, guess what I found?
The more hoes the merrier, you think I want to marry her?
Bitch that sounds scarier and scarier
I need to have a few wives
Cause I don't want to come home and tell you lies
In my heart I think I found her if she feels the same
You think I've changed, think I'd play her if I'm still in the game?
Hell yeah! One woman, I don't think so
I let the game be my wife, and I'm faithful
I never do her wrong, I never cheat on her
And if the game was baseball, I'd be on first

[Verse Two]
It's like this
I don't lie, I told you what I felt at the time
I wasn't high, I know you see yourself in my rhymes
A lot of women I dealt with, could hear these words
And realize there's no way I could still be hers
Unless you want to share me with a hot one named Tarrie
And don't get mad at me when I'm out poppin cherries
I know some ladies they just want to have babies
Collect child support from rich men in Mercedes
It's cool, but that's not what players do
Get with me, those days are over, I swear it's true
You're through, havin sex for nothin
Hopin some day some man'll give you somethin
Your own bank account - don't laugh, it's not funny
You only fucked with him cause he got a lotta money
But you never get paid, don't lie to me
You just look good, and you get to ride for free
What you eat and what you drink, you trade for sex
Pick you up in the Benz, next day in the Lex
Are you happy? Do you think you're, on a roll?
Do you love your life? Are you achievin any goals?
Or are you sad, mad cause it ain't your way?
Call mom and dad they'll be glad that you ain't gon' stay
Or call me, I got a solution
Choose me and then hit the top with your new man
[Chorus] w/ variations
[Verse Three]
I don't have fantasies, just needs
I need more than one woman to please
And she's like a love roller coaster, the thrill never lasts
And I always seem to find some better ass
Some bitch that can suck better, get wetter
She got them super skills to do anything you let her
So I'm done with you, I still care
I love you baby but I'm still a player
I always been aware and I never been scared
Found some magazines on the top they said Player$
I was young but I was old and I wanted those hoes
Found out playin with girls was mo' fun with no clothes
You can call it what you want to, Doctor or House
Hide and Go Get It, then I'm knockin it out
If she ain't widdit, I find another little chick
I'm quick to switch, even when I was six
I had a backup bitch, when my bitch would trip
I'd go play with my other girlfriend and get me a kiss
And at the age of thirty-six I'm to the same old tricks
Too $hort baby no the game don't quit
I'm playin games with these lame brains
Treatin superstars, like some plane Janes
I want to get new thangs, so I used the game to maintain
Bitch I refuse to change

1983, Too Short
Word for word
Like this, baby
Invasion of the flat booty bitches

A nigga like me, I know what's up
I want a nasty bitch with a lotta butt
If I can't find one anywhere
It turns my dreams to nightmares

Baby, right there, ain't got no ass
But she's okay if she's got cash
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the flat booty bitches

I'll tell you 'bout a day that I had
Seen nothin' but bitches with no ass
I woke up early, feeling right
Do the same damn thing every day of my life

'Cause every morning, you know I get
A good blow job from a real fine bitch
Strokin', smokin', Sir Too Short
Thinking about the day before

30 minutes after I rolled out
I pulled a freak, took her to my house
She was hella young with a lot of butt
She sucked my dick and then we fucked

That good tight pussy, I couldn't pass
A light-skined freak with so much ass
At 1 P.M., I was fuckin' away
I wanna do the same thing again today

Today my story made itself
Every bitch I saw was flat as hell
I told myself, ""I must need glasses""
Where's them bitches with the big round asses?

Me and me homie just wanna be tuff
Bring two bitches then switch 'em up
It was 3:35, the strip was lit
Every two blocks I saw a different bitch

Waiting on the bus, someone was walking
Me and my homie just started talking
I said, ""Homie, she looks good""
He said, ""That ass is flat as wood""

I said, ""What about baby in the black?""
And he said ""Short, she's all that""
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the flat booty bitches

Every single day of the week
For every nigger living, there's a freak
If you got game and a bed
Why not get fucked and get some head?

'Cause bitches all over wanna get fucked
I just need one with a lot of butt
Me and my homie rollin' and smokin'
Flat booty bitches took over Oakland

I told my homie, ""I hate to say
All the bitches with ass stay home today""
And he said, ""Short, what now""
Put the pedal to the metal and hit the beat town

I thought them bitches out there was fine
But the invasion was on and it fucked my mind
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the flat booty bitches

We hit the beat town like Oakland players
I knew it, bitches was everywhere
The first one had tities so fat
But that don't work, her ass was flat

The second bitch was flat too
Talked about the bitch like a muthafuckin' fool
I said beyotch, I know I'm capin'
Where's your ass, baby? What happened?

She turned around, caped back on me
Said, ""Fuck you, nigga, where's your teeth""
I dam near fell jumping out the car
But I slapped that bitch and slapped her hard

My homie said, ""Short, we gots to cut""
But I was spankin' that bitch on her big flat butt
We parked the car and took a walk
I saw another bitch and I had to talk

I said, ""Baby, baby, baby, come here
Yeah, you baby with the long, long hair""
Baby, came over from across the street
Standing on the corner talking to me

I was spittin' the game but I talked too fast
'Cause I didn't even notice that she had a flat ass
Sheit and I was ready to go
We was rollin' back to the O'

I told that bitch, ""I changed my mind""
She looked at me and she said, ""Why?""
I said, “I'm Sir, Too Short, the Oakland player
I'm not one of them niggas who don't care”

It's no thang to do my duty
But not with you and your flat booty
In the Berkley town what did we find
Freak after freak with no behind

One long day, I never got in
I'm glad that shit never happened again
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
The invasion, beyotch, is on

The return of Mr. X to the Z, damn

To my niggaz in them Cadillacs, swingin' that battle axe
A million dollars every 90 days, imagine that
My habitat is black, ramsacked with heavy gats
Hit a nigga so hard that his head gon' touch his back

Dog, set it off, motherfuck them haters
I keep it pimpin' for my paper in my now or later
Made my mark for my spark, terror tear you apart
You better have you some heart, comin' out here after dark

If you gon' start, you must finish, nigga, handle yo' business
Because you spoke like a menace, you got sent off to the dentist
I don't be goin' back and forth like full court tennis
We gon' handle what we gon' handle, have you walkin' in sandals

In a hospital robe, back of your body exposed
I stay in militant mode, I staple holes to your clothes
Because it's one for the hustle, two for transition
For my brothers in position still cookin' in the kitchen

To all my pimps, sli-sli-slidin' in your gators

But we gonna kick it like this on the last album

Now let me holler at ya partner, spit this game
In you ear for a minute, quit complaining
Bout how you can't spend it cause you ain't got it
You got what it takes but not enough to get started
I hope you get the message, no it's not a test it's
Just me ridin legit, they can't arrest me or bust me
I'm still hungry, I want some more stuff
Get fat and watch my whole crew blow up
So get yours, and buy my new album
Peep the game and don't be like calvin
Get everything you want, get real, get you mail
Get your girl to make bail and get your ass out of jail
You should be gettin it, everything you want
Everything you dreamed of, never have to front
You shoulf be gettin it, gettin money
I'm talking bout you black, don't laugh it ain't funny
You should get a good lawyer, like johnny cochran
Swear to tell the truth, hell no I didn't pop him
Get your kids to school, so they can get an education
Get a degree, and take a vacation
You see I got all my game from the streets of california
Young millionaire with no high school diploma
Livin real good, taking care of my folks
Roll up a fat one for the players to smoke
Short dawg in the house, I know you ain't trippin
Cause life is too $hort you gotta get in where you fit in
Stop looking for what you never seem to find
It ain't what you think you got to read between the lines
Cause life ain't long, for a young black man
Tryin to make money doing all he can
Sellin dope don't ya hope he would go to classb
But the boy makes money and he makes it fast
With the twenties on top and the fifties on the bottom
I fuck the top notches oh yes we got em
It's been a long time since I first got down
But I still keep makin these funky sounds
Get your money man
Get yours

You should be gettin it
Get it while the gettin is good, get it while you can
You should be gettin it
Get it while the gettin is good

I know you tired of being broke just hanging out
You gotta lot a dreams but you can't get out
The first thing you need to do is set your self some goals
Think positive, everything else is old
And work hard, never stop hustlin
Cause they just love to see the black man strugglin
(So what are you saying todd? )
It's time to come up, put your dollar bills in the air
He said meet me at the white house and I was there
Cause I'm one in a million, black man rising
They wanna keep me down but I always surprise em
Spend my money in the hood, I know it's all good
And you should do the same I told you peep the game
Too $hort, you know I'm the man
I lend my brother a hand cause I know I can
I keep going and goin but I'm not the pink bunny
I'm not beatin on a drum I never stop thinkin money
I'm gettin all I can if you don't ya slip
I can't wait to get to heaven just to have a grip
When I was broke, I couldn't afford a meal
But now I'm now rich I can't be fake I gots to keep it real
It's been a long time baby since I first got down
But it still keep making these funky sounds

The bitch tried to act like I didn't know her
So I just ignored her, placed a order with her friend
And after her friend was rollin', she was all in
I ain't mad at ya, upset, I ain't trippin'
Just make sure before I put my dick in
Your mouth, you tell me how it feels
To get dick from a nigga that's real
I knew all along you wanted to do it to me
And I knew your homegirl was in that cooch
She just smiled and giggled
Then she ate my balls off like Halls and Skittles
(Ah shit) Now this was the bomb
Cause her homegirl over there watchin' it all
My homegirl came over and we had a ball
One was eatin' the other while I was beatin' the walls

Can't get enough of your love
You see I can't get enough of your tongue in my pussy

I was with these two hoes last night
They was hooked on my dick like a glass pipe
They ate each other out, again and again
Everytime they took a break I was stickin' it in
And when I took it out, put my dick in her mouth
Looked down, the other bitch was eatin' her out
And that's how it be, and now ya see
It's just that everyday player lifestyle to me
Too $hort baby, you know I'll never treat a bitch like a lady
You know I never stopped pimpin' since the '80s
And I never will, I'm the player you can't play me
These niggaz be hoe-less, and they know this
On the money real players stay focused
It's all game ain't no hocus pocus
Me and Daz in Miami bout to take yo' bitch

Can't get enough of your love
You see I can't get enough of your tongue in my pussy
Can't get enough of your love

Cheap hoes, I took a flick of her tits and her hips
And her lips and the click and her body was the shit (god damn!)
We engaged in a threesome, she wanted some freedom
So we decided to freak it, she was black and Belizean
Firm body, she was a hottie fresh outta New York
With a girl from Shreveport, was fine of course
We took a hot bath, we giggled and laughed
Plus I tickled that ass and she gave me some head
While you do me and you do her
Whatever occur we shall keep between us
And you do her, and I'll watch you
And kiss and just start freakin'
We did it big - we smoked, we drank, that's how we live
She 24 without no kids (Break the bitch)
Yeah, she did it like this and like that
(Break that bitch and take that cash, she just a beotch!)

So while you going out having your fun, I should sit here waiting for you
All this time I've invested in you baby,

I used to slang dirty raps to my P.A. fans
And back then, I knew you couldn't stop this flow
No other MC around can go like I go

I brought the new style in and the bass it got crunker
I bought me a slab and now I'm a pop trunker
Do I wanna rap or swang on 4's?
Your brother's comin' down slammin' Cadillac do's

People tellin' me that it's just my time
They know it's UGK for life and I get down for mine
14 on the mic and you never seen me play
Big, big chain and comin' straight up outta P.A.

Quote out the Texas, the land of the trill
And fuck your diamonds man these boys done put a gun to your grill

Been a legend since 1993

I'll write your rhymes, sang the hook and I'll make ya a beat

Ain't no mo' ridin' up that ten with that shit tryin' to win
I let the young whippersnapper take all the risks
They'll serve a nigga dope and now it's all on a disk

They call 'em shorties, we call 'em hoes

Don't you hate when broke niggaz be on yo' dick?

I can make a lot of money, I know I can
But the mo' I make, the mo' I spend
Lot of cash in my pockets just to show my friends
I can put it in the bank to buy fo' mo' rims

For my fo' do' Benz, with the royal blue paint
Sometimes you wanna quit, but you know you can't
You gotta keep hustlin' or you lose it all
If you choose to ball you pay your dues and fall

I said fuck bein' broke, if I gotta sell coke
I'ma rock the shit up and raise hell with my folks
I'll be posted on the block, at night I gotta get mine
I'll pimp hoes and I do white collar crimes

They tellin' on they homeboys and that's terrible
Was it way too much time or nothin' big?
'Cause if you tell on us, we'll be splittin' your wig

Now my freedom is to me my main asset
So I'ma keep it 100 and give like I get
Chill at the Ponderosa and smoke that good
I'm tryin' to get rich while I rep for the hood

See everybody's got that same old dream
Of big cars, bad bitches and a mountain of cream
Drive a brand new Bentley, Benzo or a Beem
But ain't none of that worth tellin' on yo' team

It's on you homeboy, so what'chu gon' do
You need to take my advice and stop snitchin' fool
Or you can close yo' ears and run yo' mouth
But when they catch you homeboy you'll soon find out

What's up with you girl, maybe we can do somethin'
Do you drink, do you smoke?
I could tell by your purse and your shoes you ain't broke
Hang with me, the first thing you do is get stuck
Take you somewhere, later on you'll get fucked, beotch!

[Snoop Dogg]
I've been trappin' all day, gettin' paper
Headed to the club in my brand new scaper
Gators on my feet, money in my pocket
I gotta do a show so you know I'm bout to rock it
See my homie Short, layin' low-key
I strolled over to him, and passed him the bleezy
Dogg y dog, anything goes
Snappin' my fingers, crackin' at some hoes
What do ya know, I'm in The A gettin' play all day
A lot of y'all wanna ball and try to walk this way
Y'all want that shine-shine but that's all mine
I'm bonafied, qualified to have a hot damn time
Now listen, get the picture, and take a picture of me quick
See cause tomorrow I got a new city that I'm gon' hit
A double whammy, right before I do the Grammy's
I do a show with Puff Daddy way out in South Miami

[Outro: Too Short]
Count 'em man... There's about 12, 13, 14 bad bitches
It's me, two of my homies... Drinkin', we smokin'
I see all the ballers in the house, what's up mayne?
They doin' it big over there too, but you know mayne
If I wasn't here, it wouldn't be the same
Cause I'm the life of the party baby
I hope you feel the same way about yourself, beotch!",Life of da Party,2008
Too Short,"I remember how it all began
I used to sing dirty raps to my East Side fans
Back then I knew ya couldn't stop this rap
No M.C. could rock like that
Then the new style came, the bass got deeper
Ya gave up the mike and bought you a beeper
Do ya wanna rap or sell coke?
Brothers like you ain't never broke
People wanna say it's just my time
Brothers like me had to work for mine
Eight years on the mic and I'm not jokin'
Sir Too Short comin' straight from Oakland
California, home of the rock
Eight woofers in the trunk, beatin' down the block
Short dog, I'm that rappin' man
I said it before and I'll say it again

Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
Too short

Life is to some people unbearable
Committin' suicide and that's terrible
Was it much too much or nothing' big?
If ya live my life, you'd be fightin' to live
Life is to me my main asset
I be doin' all right and keep it just like that
Chill out at the house and pump that bass
I'm tryin' to get rich as I rock the place
Everybody's got that same old dream
To have big money and fancy things
Drive a brand new Benz, keep your bank right here
Never hear me stutter once because I talk real clear
It's on you, homeboy, watcha gonna do?
You can take my advice and start workin', fool
Or you can close your ears and run your mouth
And one day, homeboy, ya soon find out

Life is too short
Too short
Life is too short
(Too short)

Life is too short, would you agree?
 
While I'm livin' my life, don't mess with me
It's been a long time, baby, since I first got down
But I still keep makin' these funky sounds
Cause I don't stop rappin', that's my theme
I make a lot of money, do you know what I mean?
Like this, complicated ya must stay up
Ya asked a simple question boy, don't say ""What?""
Ya only live once and ya callin' it hell
Policeman tryin' to take ya to jail
You could give a man time but you don't know
I a matter of time, I'll be runnin' the show
Now another young buck wants to be on top
Makin' big money, slangin' hop
The task force tryin' to peel your cap
Turn around, homeboy, ya better watch your back

Life is too short
Life is

You can take back all the things you give
But ya can't take back the days you live
Life is to some people who've been on earth
Livin' every single day for what it's worth
I live my life just how I please
Satisfy one person I know that's me
Work hard for the things I achieve in life
And never rap fake when I'm on the mic
Cause if a dream is all you got, homeboy
Ya gotta turn that dream into the real McCoy
Not time to waste, just get on that case
Ya can't be down 'cause ya need to taste
A good life livin' like a king on a throne
Gettin' everything ya want
And tryin' to have all your own
Its your life
Don't be stupid though
Cause when ya waste it, you'll know

I den found another chick I wanna bone

I'm nothing nice

Upside down with a bear in her pussy

Slid back down she was getting it loose

I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I'm influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by giving money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe with a legacy of taking her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista going in warp speed breaking atoms
Blowing O.G. has got me creating anti matter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me now
I got her because she ready to party and then move to the club
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly
And I'ma be strange as Lady Gaga
Probably
A dollar be the business

I feel like the money could never do it like the club
I feel like a diamond can never do it like a drug
And I want it so come on and take it with me so that I can hit it
I can admit it, I'm influenced by desire when I approach her
I try to provoke her by giving money and jewelry and accessories
Instead of the recipe with a legacy of taking her to another place when I get it
Hold up
Twista going in warp speed breaking atoms
Blowing O.G. has got me creating anti matter
Let her pop it and smoke on it with me now
I got her because she ready to party and then move to the club
Because you know the way I think is an anomaly

These are the cries of the carrots, the cries of the carrots!

It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch
You looked up at your sky then
That made blue be your color, you had your knife there with you too
When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes
Your hands were sticky
You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green
Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this
You were already getting nervous again
Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up
Your head was almost empty
It always hurt you when you woke up like this
You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk
Waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you
You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it
If God is our Father, you thought, then Satan must be our cousin
Why didn't anyone else understand these important things?
You got to your car and tried all the doors
They were locked. it was a red car and it was new
There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat
Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods
You began to walk towards them
Now red was your color and, of course
Those little people out there were yours too",Disgustipated,1993

Me. The Chosen One? They chose me?
And I didn't even graduate from fuckin' high school

You better
You better
You better
You better listen

When he looked right through me
With somniferous almond eyes
Don't even know what that means
Must remember to write it down
This is so real
Like the time he floated away
See my heart is pounding
'Cause this shit never happens to me

Can't breathe, right now
It was so real
Like I woke up in Wonderland
All sort of terrifying
And I don't wanna be all alone when I tell this story
And can anyone tell me why
You all sound like Peanut's parents
Will I ever be coming down?
This is so real
Finally it's my lucky day
See my heart is racing
'Cause this shit never happens to me

Can't breathe, right now

You believe me, don't you?
Please believe what I just said, see the Dead ain't touring
And this wasn't all in my head
See they took me by the hand and invited me right in
Then they showed me something
I don't even know where to begin

Strapped down my bed, feet cold and eyes red
I'm out of my head
Am I alive, am I dead?
Can't remember what they said
God damn, shit the bed

High
High
I, I-I-I-I-I
High, I, I-I-I-I-I
High, high
High, high, high

Overwhelmed as one would be, placed in my position
Such a heavy burden now to be the one
Born to bear and read to all
The details of our ending
To write it down for all the world to see
But I forgot my pen
Shit the bed again
Typical

Strapped down my bed, feet cold and eyes red
I'm out of my head. Am I alive, am I dead?
Sunkist and sudafed, gyroscopes and infrared
Won't help, brain dead
Can't remember what they said
God damn, shit the bed

I can't remember what they said to me
Can't remember what they said to make me out to be a hero
Can't remember what they said

Oh no, help now (can't remember what they said)

Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know
Don't know, won't know

Tool,"Eye on the TV
'Cause tragedy thrills me
Whatever flavor it happens to be like
Killed by the husband
Drowned by the ocean
Shot by his own son
She used a poison 

In his tea
And kissed him goodbye
That's my kind of story
It's no fun until someone dies

Don't look at me like
I am a monster
Frown out your one face
But with the other
Stare like a junkie
Into the TV
Stare like a zombie
While the mother 

Holds her child
Watches him die
Hands to the sky crying
""Why, oh why?""

'Cause I need to watch things die, from a distance
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies
You all need it too, don't lie

Why can't we just admit it?
Why can't we just admit it?
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing
Neither the brave nor bold
Were writers of the stories told
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing

I need to watch things die
From a good safe distance
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies
You all feel the same, so

Why can't we just admit it?

Blood like rain come down
Drum on grave and ground

Part vampire
Part warrior
Carnivore and voyeur
Still have the transmitter
Synched to the death rattle

La, la, la, la, la, la-la-lie
La, la, la, la, la, la-la-lie
La, la, la, la, la, la-la-lie
La, la, la, la, la, la-la-lie

Credulous at best
Your desire to believe in
Angels in the hearts of men
Pull your head out of your hippie haze
and give a listen
Shouldn't have to say it all again

The universe is hostile, so impersonal
Devour to survive, so it is, so it's always been

We all feed on tragedy
It's like blood to a vampire

Vicariously I live while the whole world dies
Much better you than I",Vicarious,2006
Tool,"You believed
You believed in moments not conceived
You believed in me

A patient in spirit
Uncompromise
Without us in your heart
A light in your eyes that
Ends all lies

Vacant, broken
Fell at the hands of those moments that I wouldn't see
'Cause you, you pray for me too
What have I done to be a son to an angel
What have I done to be worthy

Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence
Difficult to see with this light
Please forgive this selfish question, but
What am I to say to all these ghouls tonight
She never told a lie
Well might have told a lie
But never lived one
Didn't have a life
Didn't have a life
But surely saved one
Alright, now it's time for us to let you go","Wings for Marie, Pt. 1",2006
Toomorrow,"I want to go back to those sweet and simple days
Goin' back to that cheerful little place
Goin' back, back through time
Back through space, goin' back

Do you remember when we had such fun
Playing all those happy games in the sun
We didn't have too much to think about
All our problems had a way of working out

I want to go back to those sweet and simple days
Goin' back to that cheerful little place
Goin' back, back through time
Back through space, goin' back

Skipping through the park and holding hands
We were building castles in the sand
Everything was rosy way back then
Oh, come on, let's make it happen again 

I want to go back to those sweet and simple days
Goin' back to that cheerful little place
Goin' back, back through time
Back through space, goin' back",Goin' Back,1970

While sippin' on a gallon here's the tap we crank
Bodies feelin' good from the X we take
And pockets filled up from the mission we bring

Street game all in your face watch the rolex cushion
Heavy weightier, I'm the champ, Mr. 3-2
Really though big baby and it's 2002
Wreck a shop with Mo-Yo I'm boy hard
Boys, want to got to war black them out like tar
Swingers, on my guard, in a old school
I'm a god damn fool, start to busting with the two
Fresh braided, player made it, deuce out the roof
Rest in peace to my old and in these streets running loose
Ain't no use, trying to stop it just come and pop it
Loco, big dozer and we still sitting sloppy

Cash me Gucci coat, slicing a bad bitch
Watch her get a china face lift
Gear shift, we performing up in the land
Suicide doors, dubs and twin cams
All bitches on the fam' heads turning tonight
Watch us be the star traction and a harder night
More than Sprite, plus my neck and wrist are cold
Ice cubes in my watch and the piece is just froze
These hoes, all on a nigga dick cause I'm young, fly and rich
Escorting a bad bitch, doja lit, I ain't worried about the laws
Hoes whisper to each other girl I think he played ball
No bitch, I'm just a rapper out the hood
And I'm wrestling with the wood, powered up feeling good
Little engine that could, beat the block for it's stock
Turn around and swap game for a political job
R.I.P. to Pab aka Mr. Sweets
If you peeping from the south we about to blow you fin to see
Gucci boots on her feet, Gucci boots on my feet
I'ma pay a lot tonight, shine and have a seat

[Lil' Flip]
When I hit the scene, I'm crispy clean
I got a box of doughnuts from Crispy Creme
Everybody looking at me like Flip you the shit
Hell yeah I'm the shit, look at my wrists
I roll up a Philly, roll up a Philly
Head to the town and watch 3rd Ward Billy
Knock a nigga out while pouring up a drank
Got my mind on the bank, in the jail I use a shank
I sip that, flip that, wood grain grip that
Go to the Papa Do's yeah I'm gone tip that
It's Lil' Flip I'm a million dollar star
Blue, black or red don't touch my car, uh

I'm shook up, I'm looking throwed
Gucci wardrobe to match the Gucci soles
Gucci hoes and hop out the SL
I'm popped up and sliding on Sprewell
We sell, everything you need
Riding through with Pardon Davis and some falling t.v.s
Moe and me, we have been a lot
Looking for some head in a little bitty shop
On top, on wrist rock it's going down

Pulled up acting and class so they'll know
The south on shine cause we ain't broke no more

Toon Roos,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1989
Toon Roos,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes
For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2003
Toon Roos,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark

But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?",Skylark,2003
Toon Roos,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When,2003
Tooper,"All I needed, and there's a day
Yeah, ah, yeah, aha, yeah, what, only you baby, only you

I reminisce, and think of how it used to be, a park, roses,
We were kissing, you were holding me, walking down the streets of our hometown,
Getting down, wasting money, just fooling around, we felt free,
Like birds in the sky, I want you all to get everything,
If I should die high on hopes on our own dreams
And scenes gotta ticket for a ride to reach the bright side baby,
There's a better life, no tears, no fears, no hate, no strife, no pain
Yo, I'm the golden first,
You'll write me a letter that will ease my thirst
And then, sweetheart after you follow me to the city of love,
Where we'll both gonna be with a shine goodbye
We made our own choice as I sat on the train and I heard your sweet voice

All I needed was the love you gave,
All I needed for another day, and all I ever knew, only you
All I needed was the love you gave,
All I needed for another day,
And all I ever knew, only you
(You and me)

I found a good job and a place to stay,
But luck's been missing since you left my way,
But I hold you on the phone, you spoke so sweet,
Of love, devotion, faith and now you miss me
But in the instance I begin to feel that my mind's
Been played like a game on the wheel
Stealing my heart, I see a man by your side, giving you the love I tried,
But I couldn't provide
Please, dreams we shared are just souvenirs,
Yours, for glad laugh, said tears,
Last night we talked,
And you didn't say much, I told you that I love you,
You said ""We'll keep in touch""
I sit back and remember how it used to be back than,
You and me together again those dreams and wishes are where they belong, son,
In my heart and in the rest of this song

All I needed was the love you gave,
All I needed for another day, and all I ever knew, only you
All I needed was the love you gave,
All I needed for another day,
And all I ever knew, only you
(You and me)

Padadada, padadada, padadada, padadada
Padadada, padadada, padadada, padadada

All I needed was the love you gave,
All I needed for another day, and all I ever knew, only you
All I needed was the love you gave,
All I needed for another day,
And all I ever knew, only you

I remember when I lived for candy and cartoons 
I also remember the first time I ate shrooms 
It was me, little John, Chris Vergera, and Joe 
We all ate an eighth at a Grateful Dead show 
Joe told me in slow motion it feels so good 
Then he turned into Peter Pan and ran into the woods 
I found a VW bus with the keys inside 
And I could see just enough to take it for a joy ride 
I started in New York, ended up in LA 
Thought it took ten minutes but it took ten days 
I stayed for two weeks made love with two freaks 
When they found out I was seventeen they made me leave 

That's the high life I got no regrets 
I do fucked up shit get high and forget 
It's so out of control it's all disrespect 
I might say sorry then I do it again 

Well I used to steel lollipops, candy and gum 
Sold 'em two for fifty cents in the back of the bus 
I was an entrepreneur went from Blow Pops to blow 
To t-shirts with Nancy Reagan saying ""just say no"" 
Plus picture me cutting your grass in army fatigues 
Choppin' down trees 'til someone pays me to leave 
Then I show up at your house drunk on a lawn mower 
Honk the horn and tell your mom its cool to be sober 
I dare you to keep kid off drugs 'cause life sucks 
When you're in the suburbs with a backwards hat driving a truck 
And the smart kids go to college to change the world 
Then all they want to do is come home and fuck high school girls 

That's the high life I got no regrets

Throw the little ticket in the back of the drawer 
Tell the judge don't pay me no mind 
Throw the little pink ticket in the back of the drawer 
'Cause I'll be out in six days with a fine 

Well I realized when I get high I don't make any progress 
I quit smokin' for six days and I wanted to run for Congress 
To advance legislation 
For the legalization 
Of marijuana but I got stoned and lost my motivation 
It's the same sad story every time I apply for a job 
A piss test to see if I get high 
Well I do so I'm stuck in this sorry as town 
Where white kids trick out Hondas and drive around 
And everyone I know wants to be Eminem 
I just want to do my own shit and be his best friend 
But years of substance abuse got me lost and confussed 
I see my toes through my shoes now I'm singing the blues
