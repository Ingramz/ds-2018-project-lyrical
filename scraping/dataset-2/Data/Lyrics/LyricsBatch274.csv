Frank Zappa & the Mothers,"Give me 
Your dirty love 
Like you might surrender 
To some dragon in your dreams 
Give me 
Your dirty love 
Like a pink donation 
To the dragon in your dreams 

I don't need your sweet devotion 
I don't want your cheap emotion 
Just whip me up some dragon lotion 
For your dirty love 

Give me 
Your dirty love 
Like some tacky little pamphlet 
In your daddy's bottom drawer 
Give me 
Your dirty love 
I don't believe you have ever seen 
That book before 

I don't need no consolation 
I don't want your reservation 
I only got one destination 
An' that's your dirty love 

Give me 
Your dirty love 
Just like your mama 
Make her fuzzy poodle do 
Give me 
Your dirty love 
The way your mama 
Make that nasty poodle chew 

I'll ignore your cheap aroma 
And your little-bo-peep diploma 
I'll just put you in a coma 
With some dirty love

Frank Zappa & the Mothers,"I might be movin' to Montana soon 
Just to raise me up a crop of Dental Floss Raisin' it up 
Waxen it down 
In a little white box 
I can sell uptown 
By myself I wouldn't 
Have no boss, 
But I'd be raisin' my lonely Dental Floss 
Raisin' my lonely Dental Floss 
Well I just might grow me some bees 
But I'd leave the sweet stuff 
For somebody else...
but then, on the other hand 
I'd Keep the wax N' melt it down 
Pluck some Floss N' swish it aroun' 
I'd have me a crop 
An' it'd be on top 

(that's why I'M movin' to Montana) 

Movin' to Montana soon 
Gonna be a Dental Floss tycoon 
(yes I am) 
Movin' to Montana soon 
Gonna be a mennil-toss flykune 
I'm pluckin' the ol' Dennil Floss 
That's growin' on the prairie 
Pluckin' the floss! 
I plucked all day an' all night an' all Afternoon... 
I'm ridin' a small tiny hoss 
(His name is MIGHTY LITTLE)
He's a good hoss 
Even though He's a bit dinky to strap a big saddle or 
Blanket on anyway 
He's a bit dinky to strap a big saddle or 
Blanket on anyway 
Any way I'm pluckin' the ol' Dennil Floss 
Even if you think it is a little silly, folks 
I don't care if you think it's silly, folks 
I don't care if you think it's silly, folks 
I'm gonna find me a horse 
Just about this big
An' ride him all along the border line 
With a Pair of heavy-duty 
Zircon-encrusted tweezers in my hand 
Every other wrangler would say 
I was mighty grand 
By myself I wouldn't 
Have no boss 
But I'd be raisin' my lonely Dental Floss 
Raisin' my lonely Dental Floss
Raisin' my lonely Dental Floss 
Well I might Ride along the border 
With my tweezers gleamin' 
In the moon-lighty night 
And then I'd Get a cuppa cawfee 
N' give my foot a push... 
Just me 'n the pymgy pony 
Over the Dennil Floss Bush 
N' then I might just Jumb back on 
An' ride Like a cowboy 
Into the dawn to Montana 
Movin' to Montana soon

Out in cucamonga
Many years ago
Near a holy roller church
There was once a place
Where me and a couple of friends
Began practicing for the time
We might go on tv

And as fate would have it
Later on we got a chance to play.
All we ever really knew:
That it was crazy (nanook, no-no)
To be doin' it any other way
",Cucamonga,1975
Frank Zappa & the Mothers,"Baby love, my baby love, I need you oh how I need you
But all you do is treat me bad
Break my heart and leave me sad
Tell me what did I do wrong to make you stay away so long
'Cause baby love, my baby love, been missing ya, miss kissing ya
Instead of breaking up
Let's start some kissing and making up
Don't throw our love away
In my arms why don't you stay?

Need ya, need ya, baby love, my baby love

Baby love, my baby love, why must we separate my love?
All of my whole life through
I never love no one but you
Why you do me like you do, I guess it's me
Ooh, need to hold you once again my love, feel your warm embrace my love
Don't throw our love away, please don't do me this way
Not happy like I used to be, loneliness has got the best of me my love

My baby love, I need ya oh how I need ya
Why you do me like you do
After I've been true to you
So deep in love with you
Baby, baby ooh
'Til it hurt me, 'til it hurt me
Ooh baby love
Don't throw our love away
Don't throw our love away",Baby Love,1991

Frank Zappa & the Mothers,"The mystery man came over
And he said I'm outta sight
He said for a nominal service charge
I could reach nirvana tonight
If I was ready, willing and able
To pay him his regular fee
He would drop all the rest of his pressing affairs 
And devote his attention to me

But I said look here brother
Who you jiving with that cosmik debris? 
Now who you jiving with that cosmik debris? 
Look here brother, don't waste your time on me

The mystery man got nervous and he fidget around a bit
He reached in the pocket of his mystery robe
And he whipped out a shaving kit
Now I thought it was a razor
And a can of foaming goo
But he told me right then when the top popped open
There was nothin' his box won't do
With the oil of aphrodite, and the dust of the grand wazoo
He said you might not believe this, little fella
But it'll cure your asthma too

And I said look here brother
Who you jiving with that cosmik debris? 
Now what kind of a guru are you, anyway? 
Look here brother, don't waste your time on me
(Don't waste your time)

I've got troubles of my own, I said
And you can't help me out
So, take your meditations and your preparations
And ram it up your snout
But I got the crystal ball, he said
And held it to the light
So I snatched it, all away from him
And I showed him how to do it right

I wrapped a newspaper 'round my head
So I looked like I was deep
I said some mumbo-jumbo, then
I told him he was going to sleep
I robbed his rings and pocketwatch
And everything else I found
I had that sucker hypnotized
He couldn't even make a sound
I proceeded to tell him his future, then
As long as he was hanging around
I said the price of meat has just gone up
And your old lady has just gone down

Look here brother
Who you jiving with that cosmik debris? 
Now is that a real poncho or is that a Sears poncho? 
Don't you know, you could make more money as a butcher? 
So, don't waste your time on me
Don't waste it, don't waste your time on me (om shanti, om shanti, om shanti, shanti)",Cosmik Debris,2018

Did a vehicle
Come from somewhere out there
Just to land in the andes?
Was it round
And did it have
A motor
Or was it
Something
Different

Did a vehicle
Did a vehicle
Did a vehicle
Fly along the mountains
And find a place to park itself

Or did someone
Build a place
To leave a space
For such a vehicle to land

Did a vehicle
Come from somewhere out there
Did a vehicle
Come from somewhere out there
Did the indians, first on the bill
Carve up the hill

Did a booger-bear
Come from somewhere out there
Just to land in the andes?
Was she round
And did she have a motor
Or was she something different

Guacamole queen
Guacamole queen
Guacamole queen

Or did someone build a place
Or leave a space for chester's thing to land

Did a booger-beer
Come from somewhere out there
Did a booger-bear
Come from somewhere out there
Did the indians, first on the bill
Carve up her hill

It's been like that for a while
Everything seems strange to me
I feel like a newborn child

 And I know I don't belong down here
 I guess it'd always be the same
 I wish I wouldn't have to fear

 Under the water 2x

'Cause here's a lot of danger
The great big sharks with long sharp teeth
Would love to catch a stranger

Can't you see? 2x
That I was left to drown 2x

Can't you see? 2x
That I was deep down under

That I am deep deep deep down under
That I was left to drown, left to drown, left to drown, oh

Down down down down)

And now you feelin the rain
Its like pourin on you
Don't ever say I never warned you
No

I don't mean to rub it in
But I told you so
You asked me as a friend
But I gave my best advice
When I told you no
He's not the one for yous
S'what I said
But you had to find that out on your own
You're so grown
Well lemme guess
He got what he wanted
Left you alone and
He don't call no more
I told you so

So I guess you feel bad enough
As it is and you should cause I told ya
And you're kickin yourself
Right bout now over this
Don't want to see you hurtin this way
Well I guess you'll know for next time
Just what to do
No matter how many opinions you get
You'll know who to listen to

Call me crazy,say I'm trippin', it's okay
Just as long as I don't hear you say

Don't even waste my time you can step right now

I think you're crazy cool and its all good
And I'm diggin' you,you're official
But I don't really need a relationship
Just want to have my fun,got my life to live

Boy who the hell are you
Walking around like you own something when the truth is not at all
Gave you my credit cards so you could hit the mall
Still you complain saying things tryin' to make me feel small

Who the hell are you to try to make me cry,I need to know why
Thinking of you the shit you really ain't shit to do me like this
And who the hell are you to try to bring me down
Lemme put you down, 
I'm not with this, lemme show you how it is

So baby on the real you ain't nobody to ever try to make me feel
This way
You're so lame, you better ask somebody
Looks like I'll have to take my love away

Why you want to curse at me
Call me all outta my name
Watch yourself player you don't want to see it get ugly
Why don't you get a job,really it ain't that hard
Instead of doing things to bug me

You ain't nobody to me so
That's why its easy to leave you
Pack all your shit I don't need you

Frankel,"Come on along and listen to
The lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo
The lullaby of Broadway
The rumble of a subway train
The rattle of the taxis
The daffodils who entertain
At Angelo's and Maxi's

When a Broadway baby says good night
It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight
Until the dawn

Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
Hey

The band begins to go to town
And everyone goes crazy
You rock a bye your baby round
'Til everything gets hazy
Hush a bye, I'll buy you this and that
You hear a daddy saying
And baby goes home to her flat
To sleep all day

Frankenstein Drag Queens from the Planet 13,"Screams break the silence
Waking from the dead of night
Vengeance is boiling
He's returned to kill the light
Then when he's found who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon

Years spent in torment
Buried in a nameless grave
Now he has risen
Miracles would have to save
Those that the beast is looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him

Bark at the moon

They cursed and buried him
Along with shame
And thought his timeless soul had gone
In empty burning Hell-unholy one
But now he's returned to prove them wrong

Howling in shadows
Living in a lunar spell
He finds his heaven
Spewing from the mouth of hell

And when he finds who he's looking for
Listen in awe and you'll hear him
Bark at the moon",Bark at the Moon,2001

Make it home by tomorrow
And I refuse to die on
This planet of horrors

I know that there's no escape
Here on this planet of the apes
Get your paws off me

And not mention, my voice from me

Blue guitar,

Making of my days.

If you can't put the words to the tune,

And darker days are drawing near

And one by one they disappear.
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here

Like a song through the trees you came to love me
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way
You always loved this time of year.
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
Cause you're not here

Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away

Call me a player cause I crush a lot 
And I make that money, cause I make it hot
And we use to kick it, shoulda never stop
Girl u know whats up
Cause I'm still after ya, 
And I'm still a bachelor
Are you still alone alone alone alone alone

So how you doin' how you been and how you livin'
You know baby girl your boys place still pimpin'
Plus I heard you got a man with a game plan
With a wedding plan
But you know I'm not the man, I had a different plan
For me and you to follow, a runway model
With a self made baller
But you was caught up with your lil' man a simple life  
You didn't want no fast life, poppin' bottles err night
So I get the movin' just like a g should
Three years later and your boy still livin' good
I cant fuck baby girl, yea I'm missing times
Creepin' on the low, you could swear we was doin' crimes
It was all good, we use to freak
And fuck late night in the back seat
Same number you can call me when you get that urge
Still got 25 cars, money to splurge
(Holler at me)

It's been a minute since we last had a talk
Still hypnotized by the hips and the walk
I'm tryin to figure out who you with, hopefully alone
If thats the case you still got the number to my phone
It might seem like I'm tryin' to holla for some ass
But with the green that I got, I can get that fast
It was something that we had, and I still want it
So if you tryin' to give it to me, let me know I'm on it
I'm still after ya, I'm still a bachelor
If you got a man, understand that I'm not mad at ya
I might have fell off track, but I'm tryin' to bring it back
To the way it was, and if your feeling love

[Chorus]

I'm still here, right here, if u wanna ride
We can take it back how we did it up in '95 
With no strings attached,
I'll put u on your back 
Do those freaky things, make u always wanna come back
Writin' checks without a man, you cant say that your mine
Cause I'm still a free agent
Not tryin' to resign
I'm not a ball player
But I'm a  baller, player
And if your still alone
I'll be callin' later

"Frankie ""Sugar Chile"" Robinson","[Chorus]
Call me a player cause I crush a lot 
And I make that money, cause I make it hot
And we use to kick it, shoulda never stop
Girl u know whats up
Cause I'm still after ya, 
And I'm still a bachelor
Are you still alone alone alone alone alone

So how you doin' how you been and how you livin'
You know baby girl your boys place still pimpin'
Plus I heard you got a man with a game plan
With a wedding plan
But you know I'm not the man, I had a different plan
For me and you to follow, a runway model
With a self made baller
But you was caught up with your lil' man a simple life  
You didn't want no fast life, poppin' bottles err night
So I get the movin' just like a g should
Three years later and your boy still livin' good
I cant fuck baby girl, yea I'm missing times
Creepin' on the low, you could swear we was doin' crimes
It was all good, we use to freak
And fuck late night in the back seat
Same number you can call me when you get that urge
Still got 25 cars, money to splurge
(Holler at me)

[Chorus]

It's been a minute since we last had a talk
Still hypnotized by the hips and the walk
I'm tryin to figure out who you with, hopefully alone
If thats the case you still got the number to my phone
It might seem like I'm tryin' to holla for some ass
But with the green that I got, I can get that fast
It was something that we had, and I still want it
So if you tryin' to give it to me, let me know I'm on it
I'm still after ya, I'm still a bachelor
If you got a man, understand that I'm not mad at ya
I might have fell off track, but I'm tryin' to bring it back
To the way it was, and if your feeling love

[Chorus]

I'm still here, right here, if u wanna ride
We can take it back how we did it up in '95 
With no strings attached,
I'll put u on your back 
Do those freaky things, make u always wanna come back
Writin' checks without a man, you cant say that your mine
Cause I'm still a free agent
Not tryin' to resign
I'm not a ball player
But I'm a  baller, player
And if your still alone
I'll be callin' later

[Chorus]

I'm not a player, I just crush a lot [Repeat: x2]

Lived a puppet maker who would give a puppet show
And his lifetime wish, for which he used to pray
Was to hear his puppets sing and play

That his little puppets, to him were very real
Every night, he dreamed that soon would come the day
He'd hear his little puppets, sing and play

My name Pedro
My name Cisco
My name Jingo

Frankie Avalon,"In the southern part of Texas
In the town of San Antone
There's a fortress all in ruins that the weeds have overgrown
You may look in vain for crosses and you'll never see a-one
But sometimes between the setting and the rising of the sun
You can hear a ghostly bugle
As the men go marching by
You can hear them as they answer
To that roll call in the sky.

Colonel Travis, Davy Crockett, and a hundred eighty more
Captain Dickinson, Jim Bowie
Present and accounted for.

Back in 1836, Houston said to Travis
""Get some volunteers and go
Fortify the Alamo.""
Well the men came from Texas
And from old Tennessee
And they joined up with Travis
Just to fight for the right to be free.

Indian scouts with squirrel guns
Men with muzzle-loaders
Stood together, heel and toe
To defend the Alamo.

""You may ne'er see your loved ones,""
Travis told them that day
""Those who want to can leave now
Those who fight to the death let 'em stay.""

In the sand he drew a line
With his army sabre
Out of a hundred eighty five
Not a soldier crossed the line
With his banners a-dancin'
In the dawn's golden light
Santa Anna came prancing
On a horse that was black as the night.

Sent an officer to tell
Travis to surrender
Travis answered with a shell
And a rousing rebel yell
Santa Anna turned scarlet
""Play deguello!"" he roared
""I will show them no quarter
Every one will be put to the sword!""

One hundred and eighty five
Holding back five thousand
Five days, six days, eight days, ten
Travis held and held again
Then he sent for replacements
For his wounded and lame
But the troops that were coming
Never came, never came, never came...

Twice he charged and blew recall
On the fatal third time
Santa Anna breached the wall
And he killed 'em, one and all
Now the bugles are silent
And there's rust on each sword
And the small band of soldiers...

Lie asleep in the arms of the Lord...
In the southern part of Texas
Near the town of San Antone
Like a statue on his pinto rides a cowboy all alone
And he sees the cattle grazing where a century before
Santa Anna's guns were blazing and the cannons used to roar
And his eyes turn sorta misty
And his heart begins to glow
And he takes his hat off slowly...

Frankie Ballard,"I was headed north on Highway 5
On a starlit Sunday night
When a pick-up truck flew by me out of control
As I watched in my headlights,
He swerved left and then back right
Never hit the brakes as he left the road

I found him lying in the grass among steel and glass
With an empty whiskey bottle by his side
Through the blood and tears, he whispered in my ear
A few last words just before he died

And he said, ""Don't tell mama I was drinking
Cause Lord knows that her soul would never rest
Now I can't leave this world with my mama thinking
That I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath""

I still think about that night
And how that young man died
And how others sometimes pay for our mistakes
Well the last thing on his mind
As he left this world behind
Was knowing someone else's heart would break

And he said, ""Don't tell mama I was drinking
Cause Lord knows that her soul would never rest
Now I can't leave this world with my mama thinking
That I met the Lord with whiskey on my breath""

Said, ""I'm a little hot and bothered, if you know what I mean.

Hair in the wind, Tom Petty up loud.

This wonderful girl of mine
 
If her eyes are blue as skies, that's Peggy O'Neil
If she's smiling all the while, that's Peggy O'Neil
If she walks like a sly little rogue
If she talks with a cute little brogue
Sweet personality full of rascality
That's Peggy O'Neil
 
Every thing's planned for a wedding so grand
In the spring I will bring her the ring
Then somewhere in town we'll both settle down 
And all through the day I'll sing

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

To have these bitches be like askin' you a season in your brain
Flashin' jewels, talkin' blastin' if he pack the tools
I got a Glock to cock back to knock 'em, flat out your shoes

Shit is real on the muthafucking hill  God 
Times is hard  visons blurred kid  I can't see far 
Thinking will I be the next nigga deceased 
Over some bullshit beef I pack heat 
Son it's '96 and I ain't going out like that 
Never roll a dollo 'cause my crew got my back 
And it's a fact  niggas don't know how to act 
Till I cop back  react  leave 'em laying on they back 
Sometime I try to maintain and chill 
Stop my brain from thinking, restrain from grabbing my steal 
I'm stressed out, trying to live right on the wrong route 
Thinking of ways to get loot in large amounts 
So I chill on the block, nigga respect mines 
?A giver wit the nets? and the muthafucking tech nines 
So pack steel if you come through, front if you want to 
Before you do, so let me warn you 
We more infamous, crime shit, take it to the gat 
Fuck the rhyme shit, you reminded of what the nine did 
Remanded, QBC, then left stranded 
We cock cannons, punishing and back handing

Yo, I'll leave your whole body twisted when you get lifted 
And police'll have to fist rumblistics on a bisket, another statistic 
I try to chill but you insisted coming all in my district 
I don't know why the fuck you risk it 
I be more deep, walking the streets, packing the heat 
Bring the cowmeat, you'll lifted off your feet and leave you sleeping 
on 
the concrete 
Get blown at home or whatever is on your bone 
Get to flown to your dome, blow chromosones out your flesh and bones 
Hitman for hire, who's the next one to expire 
Shoot it up in black attire, hit you wit the rapid fire 
The stainless bisket will leave your brain smoking 
Your whole frame broken and clothes soaken, head blown the fuck open 
Try to step inside of fort and get caught 
Wit the trey pound shorter left on the sidewalks of New York 
The decompose, blood flows are holes in your clothes, eyes closed 
Body be frozed, posing for pictures with a rose 
Head to your toes, look like you got wetted with a hose 
The road you choose got your brain drain through your nose, nigga 
So who be committing crimes, dangerous minds, put two to your spine 
Lay you behind enemy lines 
When we cross it and leave you like a broken faucet 
The underworld production family can reinforce it 
(Mobb Deep) 
Yo, when shit get real, it ain't what you expected 
Me and kikos are known to get hectic 
Only to wreck shit, many slugs in all directions 
Make you see the light when my shot makes connections 
Niggas get their face split in section 
Shooked, using ice grilled looks for they protection 
?We saw? everything you fear 
And indulging in crime-filled atmosphere 
This shit ain't nuttin' new, it's only things that we used to 
We used to stick niggas on the F through to 
The E train, when it's time to recruit 
I humble on the D train, see my man D, Don't need to purchase my 
cocaine 
Word to my newborn seed 
A nigga gotta make loot to support greed 
On the wildside of the fence, the shit is on the verge of explosion 
It's so cold, you might get frozen 
If you leave yourself vulnerable and time lasping 
Fools collasping and caught up in gun clapping 
No matter who you are if you know many faces 
I don't discriminate, my shot bleed all races 
And coaches, we sorts like vultures 
Eating your insides like ulcers and pour niggas closer nigga

Get caught out of bounds and get you wig ?clocked? 

I put a hole in the chest of any nigga trying to be the best 

Who the fuck you think you trying to impress 

I express stress for any nigga out there lying to the press 

I'll put your soul to rest 

Wherever you be at, pack your gat 

'cause police want to know where the bitches and the money at 

But fuck it, bust it, we'll discuss it

To be good scheming, on that teaming thang 

(Some niggas got the green, thinking they can hang) 

So let's take it to the square where Boot Camp is bang 

Like Iron Mike, fresh out, on this hunt for gold 

Tell Frankie, throw the Cutlass on cruise control 

We ?have to be out?, breeze out to the weed house 

From Midtown, hit the FDR heading South 

(No doubt) plus big up to Stash, count the cash before we go in 

?'cause plain co' through the do'? 

Trying to catch niggas wit they eyes closed 

(Niggas wit they eyes closed) 

Move swift and stay on your toes( stay on your tippy, tippy toes)

To your livest MC, without a doubt

Breakin niggaz off somethin real proper word 

You can't see me, and as I appeared on the TV

Take a minute to adjust, pump the Reebok shoes 

And I'm Swayze, leavin niggaz misty and hazy 

Fuckin like a mad Russian from here to Haiti 

Ladies, I keeps em locked down like bikes

Shorts I take none that's word to my mother 

Reputations, really makes people wonder 

Can I take em, shake em, one time 

But I won't lose composure, freeze when I froze ya 

Thirty-two below just-ice sacrifice 

to the Gods of rap, true indeed infact

From, lyrics to birds, guerilla tactics like the Serbs 

The kid want to be at the bar with the big boys 

I'll serve that ass a glass, this should be a blast 

I rhyme real fast, but I can still reach the mass 

Oh you got some heads with that lime green grass? 

Put it in the air, in war everything is fair 

And violent off the hoarse, you don't file for divorce 

On the grounds that I left a pound around in your crown 

Now Rule rip, but also Boogie Down 

I be the man on the stage like the man on the wax 

The blue collar MC with the blue collar job 

Walk around on the streets with my blue collar mob 

Train wrecks couldn't cause more damage than a runaway X 

Two-one-five line is up in your behind 

I rock from one-oh-six, all the way to one-ten 

Black puerto rican and dominican 

I came to rock for all my people and my uptown fans, c'mon

Lock up your doors while my metaphors make your glock pop up

Disaster that Freddy couldn't possibly imagine 

Beatin down beats like BeatNuts bruise crews 

Damage your conscience, totally fuckin your sleep up 

I need that OJ Juice in my system 

That make us income, of the victims 

Freaky deaky, blow your Platoon to Twins with Dangerous Minds

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

Silver winged they fly, they know the call of freedom in their breasts
Soar Black Head against the sky
Between the rocks that run down to the sea
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets, asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland

Talking all the day with true friends, who try to make you stay
Telling jokes and news, singing songs to pass the night away
Watched the Galway salmon run like silver dancing darting in the sun
Living on your western shore saw summer sunsets, asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland

Drinking all the day in old pubs where fiddlers love to play
Someone touched the bow, he played a reel, it seemed so fine and gay
Stood on Dingle beach and cast, in wild foam we found Atlantic Bass
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland

Dreaming in the night, I saw a land where no man had to fight
Waking in your dawn, I saw you crying in the morning light
Lying where the Falcons fly, they twist and turn all in you e'er blue sky
Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
I stood by your Atlantic sea and I sang a song for Ireland

In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on highway 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run

Wendy let me in I want to be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs round these velvet hips
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire
'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know out how it feels
I want to know if love is wild, wanna to know if love is real

Ooh
Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I want to die with you Wendy on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss

Oh, oh, oh
The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight but there's no place left to hide
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday girl I don't know when we get to that place
That we really want to go and we'll walk in the sun

Frankie Goes to Hollywood,"Oh why in this world must we work life like a deal, sometimes I feel,
Its all make believe.
Put glory in your heart and never say die,
forget your troubles go where hearts are Happy hi,
so Happy hi, yeah!

And why in this world is life like a train, never stopping at stations.
If I could freeze time under the starry sky, never questioning why.
And what in this world is achieving perfection,
We may not get there but boy do we care,
Don't be scared.

Put glory in your heart and never say die,
forget your troubles go where hearts are Happy hi,

Frankie Goes to Hollywood,"If I could change the things I've done
Would I be the only one
To with again if only I could take your pain away
And think of better, better things to say
The highest price I'd gladly pay
For you to live, just golden days, golden days, golden days
So celebrate the moment now, have all that you desire

[Chorus:]
We'll keep each other warm, together we'll weather the storm
The children are dying and nobody's crying
There's got to be something out there, someone who cares
Got to be something out there

Give me real life, the worry and the strife
I'll throw it out of the window, to the dogs below
So come with me I'll guide you through wardrobes of fantasy
And treasure chests of what could be
A world without anxiety
A legacy of golden days, golden days, golden days
Leave it all behind the blind leading the blind
Have all that you desire

Gotta be, gotta be someone out there

Let's break the rules scattering the jewels
Of joy amongst ourselves
The lonely, lonely of the shelves
Feel good about yourself, I'll drink to your health
Have all that you desire

[Chorus]

I'm looking for something, and I don't know what it is

",Is Anybody Out There?,1986

This wasted land is gone now and
Swept away , swept away
Better not let the side down
Whirlwinds of time

We can build an ocean
Of hope despair to drown
Sail upon the waves a crashing
Devils to the ground
I'll follow you to fires of hell
And cast my soul in wishing wells
The colours of the sheddred sky
Hear the children sing

Kill the pain, we'll never be the same again
Once we have changed the nature of the game
Of the game
Breaks the chains we can rise up again
Once we've rearranged the nature of the game
Of the game

Don't you forget
What you give is what you get
Take love away there's nothing
Better not let the side down
So God on high has opened up the sky
Up the sky

We can build an ocean
Of hope despair to drown
Sail upon the waves a crashing
Devils to the ground
I'll follow you to fires of hell
And cast my soul in wishing wells
The colours of the sheddred sky
Hear the children sing

Kill the pain, we'll never be the same again
Once we have changed the nature of the game
Of the game
Break the chain we can rise up again
Once we've rearranged the nature of the game
Of the game

We're all walking through the fire
Walking on the nile
Let your spirit fly

This wasted land is gone now and
Swept away , swept away
Better not let the side down
Whirlwinds of time
Sing

We can build an ocean
Of hope despair to drown
Sail upon the waves a crashing
Devils to the ground
The legend of this dying land
The earth is acorched by devil's hand
This place we love can live again
We rise up and sing

Kill the pain, we'll never be the same again
Once we have changed the nature of the game
Of the game
Break the chaing we can rise up again
Once we've rearranged the nature of the game
Of the game

Fratello su fratello
Partoriti in un avello
Come carne da macello
Uomini con anime
Sottili come lamine
Taglienti come il crimine
Rabbiosi oltre ogni limite
Eroi senza una terra
Che combattono una guerra
Tra la mafia e la camorra
Sodoma e Gomorra
Napoli e Palermo

Succursali dell'inferno
Divorate dall'interno
In eterno
Da un tessuto tumorale
Di natura criminale
E mentre il mondo sta a guardare
Muto senza intervenire
Basta alla guerra fra famiglie
Fomentata dalle voglie
Di una moglie colle doglie
Che oggi dà la vita ai figli
E domani gliela toglie
Rami spogli dalle foglie
Che lei taglia come paglia
E nessuno se la piglia:
È la vigilia

Di una rivoluzione
Alla voce del Padrino
Ma don Vito Corleone
Oggi è molto più vicino:
Sta seduto in Parlamento
E'il momento
Di sferrare un'offensiva
Terminale decisiva
Radicale distruttiva
Oggi uniti più di prima alle cosche
Fosche attitudini losche
Mantenute dalle tasse

Abbassagli la cresta
Guarda la sua testa
Rotolare nella cesta
Libera la mente da ogni assurdo pregiudizio:
È l'inizio della fine del supplizio
Che da secoli ti domina

Ti ingoia e ti rivomita
Potere di quei demoni
Che noi chiamiamo ""uomini""
Che uccidono altri uomini
Che sfruttano noi giovani
Che tagliano le ali
Agli angeli più deboli
Potere che soggioga
Potere della droga
Potere di uno Stato
Che di tutto se ne frega:
Strage di Bologna Ustica Gladio
Cumuli di scheletri ammassati in un armadio
Odio il tuo seme germoglia nella terra
Fecondato dal sangue della guerra
E la camorra indomita ricca e strafottente

Continua ad uccidere la gente
Tombe ecatombe
Esplosioni di bombe
Raffiche di mitra
Falcidia di bande
Cosenza Potenza
Carne morta in partenza
Consacrata alla violenza
Senza opporre resistenza

Frankie Hi-NRG MC,"Sono intorno a noi, in mezzo a noi, in molti casi siamo noi
A far promesse senza mantenerle mai se non per calcolo
Il fine è solo l'utile, il mezzo ogni possibile
La posta in gioco è massima, l'imperativo è vincere
E non far partecipare nessun altro
Nella logica del gioco la sola regola è esser scaltro
Niente scrupoli o rispetto verso I propri simili
Perché gli ultimi saranno gli ultimi se I primi sono irraggiungibili

Sono tanti, arroganti coi più deboli,
zerbini coi potenti, sono replicanti,
Sono tutti identici, guardali,
stanno dietro a maschere e non li puoi distinguere.
Come lucertole s'arrampicano,
e se poi perdon la coda la ricomprano.
Fanno quel che vogliono si sappia in giro fanno
spendono, spandono e sono quel che hanno

Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio

e come le supposte abitano in blisters full-optional,
Con cani oltre I 120 decibel e nani manco fosse Disneyland,
Vivono col timore di poter sembrare poveri
Quel che hanno ostentano, tutto il resto invidiano, poi lo comprano,
In costante escalation col vicino costruiscono
Parton dal pratino e vanno fino in cielo,
han più parabole sul tetto che S.Marco nel Vangelo..

Sono quelli che di sabato lavano automobili
che alla sera sfrecciano tra l'asfalto e I pargoli,
Medi come I ceti cui appartengono,
terra-terra come I missili cui assomigliano.

Tiratissimi, s'infarinano, s'alcolizzano
e poi s'impastano su un albero
Nasi bianchi come Fruit of the Loom
che diventano più rossi d'un livello di Doom

Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio
Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio

Ognun per se, Dio per se, mani che si stringono tra I banchi delle chiese alla domenica
mani ipocrite, mani che fan cose che non si raccontano
Altrimenti le altre mani chissà cosa pensano, si scandalizzano
Mani che poi firman petizioni per lo sgombero,
Mani lisce come olio di ricino,
Mani che brandisco Manganelli, che Farciscono Gioielli,
che si alzano alle spalle dei Fratelli.
Quelli che la notte non si può girare più,
quelli che vanno a mignotte mentre I figli guardan La TV,
Che fanno I boss, che compra Class,
che son sofisticati da chiamare I NAS, incubi di Plastica
Che vorrebbero dar fuoco ad ogni zingara
Ma l'unica che accendono è quella che da loro l'elemosina ogni sera,
Quando mi nascondo sulla faccia oscura della loro luna nera

Sono intorno a me, ma non parlano con me.
Sono come me, ma si sentono meglio

Frankie Hi-NRG MC,"Chicco ha una cicatrice sulla faccia
Sta con suo fratello che si fa chiamare Spillo
E sanno già sparare come dei cowboy

Chicco prova al sole di scaldarsi il cucchiaino
Spillo sta rubando un altro motorino
Il maresciallo guarda l'Italia dentro un bar

Vecchi materassi, copertoni, lavandini, cessi rotti
Cazzi disegnati sul palazzo del cornuto
Gli africani alla stazione, l'avvocato del barbiere
Ancora un altro film di Alberto Sordi alla televisione

Chicco è a casa con la faccia sulla radio
Che trasmette la rubrica dei consigli
E lui vorrebbe chiedere come si fa
A fare una rapina in una banca
E a scappare senza che si slaccino le scarpe
E andare dove non c'è mai nessuno che ti sputa contro
E ti vuol mettere nei guai

Tubi di cemento, scatoloni, pannolini
Sacchi d'immondizia messi come pali dai bambini
L'ambulanza della Croce Rossa, c'è qualcuno che sta male
Il prete prepara la chiesa per il funerale
Per il funerale, per il funerale, per il funerale

Spillo ha chiuso la felicità in un fazzoletto
Ma si è seccata in un secondo benedetto
""Pronto chi parla?""
""Sono Chicco, vieni qua, che questa volta è proprio quella buona
Basta un cacciavite per entrare in paradiso""
""Un cacciavite? Aspettami, che arrivo
Prendo il motorino e in un minuto sono lì""
""Ma ti rendi conto quanti sono questi soldi
E come è stato facile rubarli?
Finalmente ci possiamo comperare quello che ci pare
Spiegami perché non parli""

""Lascia stare, sta un po' zitto, non ho voglia di parlare
Manca poco, abbiam finito e andiamo via
Scappa, presto non fermarti, corri, cazzo, non voltarti
La sirena è quella della polizia""

Chicco e Spillo saltano come due gatti sulla sella
E schizzano tuttamanetta
""Figli di puttana! Non ci prenderete mai!""
""Guarda che casino, guarda dove vai a finire, ho anche freddo
E ho paura di morire: stai attento! Stai attento! Frena!",Chicco E Spillo,2008
Frankie Hi-NRG MC,"Scrivia m la nostra storia usando biciclette
Inseguendo la memoria su strade molto strette
Su per le salite senza avere una borraccia,
Giù per le discese con il vento sulla faccia.

Perché la bicicletta non importa dove porti,
È tutto un equilibrio di periodi e di rapporti,
È tutta una questione di catene e di corone,
Di grasso che lubrifica la vita alla persone.

Come nella vita c'è una ruota che gira,
Una ruote che spinge e con quest'aria che tira
Se una ruota si fora la caduta è sicura
Una toppa ripara, una ferita si cura.

Non avere paura che sennò ti deconcentri,
Devi far coincidere i peso e i baricentri.
L'impegno di coppia per un singolo momento
Due le forze in gioco,un solo movimento

Pedala insegui la tua storia ovunque vada
Pedala macina chilometri di strada
Pedala l'hai voluta tu la bicicletta
Pedala più in fretta
Pedala più in fretta

Pedala insegui la tua storia ovunque vada
Pedala macina chilometri di strada
Pedala l'hai voluta tu la bicicletta
Pedala più in fretta
Pedala più in fretta

Se è libero il pignone lo sceglie la corona,
Chi attraverso una catena condiziona
Il moto del sistema monarchia, meccanica
Che ha giurato fede eterna alle leggi della fisica
Statica, termodinamica, quasi democratica

Se quando si ferma si va a ruota libera,
O tirannica, con la fissa dello scatto,
Senza i freni che difendo dall'impatto

E' mansione del pignone fare la rivoluzione,
Portare il movimento in ogni direzione,
In costante acrobazia irradia l'energia
Dal centro fino alla periferia

E' solo una questione di rapporto tra ingranaggi
E tutto gira liscio fino a che non ti scoraggi,
Che l'unico motore qui sei tu con il fiatone
A spingere in salita per la vita il carrozzone

Pedala insegui la tua storia ovunque vada
Pedala macina chilometri di strada
Pedala l'hai voluta tu la bicicletta
Pedala più in fretta
Pedala più in fretta

Pedala insegui la tua storia ovunque vada
Pedala macina chilometri di strada
Pedala l'hai voluta tu la bicicletta
Pedala più in fretta
Pedala più in fretta

Sai bene che la storia è ciclica, come la pazienza è biblica
E la peggior salita è una discesa ripida, repentina, tutta tornanti
Serpentina, peso in avanti, giù dalla China
Come una valanga controllata precipiti in picchiata,
Il paesaggio vola dentro a una zoomata
Guardi foce vai, vai dove vuoi
Occhi aperti e sai come stai
Fai come può
Il traguardo arriva quando meno te lo aspetti
È un parcheggio di bici appoggiate ai cavalletti,
Bici abbandonate là, senza controparte
Pronte a ripartire se qualcuno parte

Pronte per andare lontano, cambiando i rapporti andandoci piano
Pensa che una volta una bici fece piangere un uomo
Diventarono amici, lei gli chiese perdono

Pedala insegui la tua storia ovunque vada
Pedala macina chilometri di strada
Pedala l'hai voluta tu la bicicletta
Pedala più in fretta
Pedala più in fretta

Pedala insegui la tua storia ovunque vada
Pedala macina chilometri di strada
Pedala l'hai voluta tu la bicicletta
Pedala più in fretta
Pedala più in fretta",Pedala [Live] [Live],2014
Frankie Howerd,"Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen

Always shouts out something obscene

That you haven't got a call from him or even have him come your way
Tell me what kinda man just gets up and leaves both his wife and kids
That ain't no real man, let me tell you that's no real man
He's not supposed to run and leave just because things aren't right
He made a vow to you in saying he was down with you
So now you've come to me girl 'cause you know he's my best friend
But what am I supposed to do, nothin I do's gonna make him change

You can count on me easy as one, two, three
You can count on me, don't worry about a thing
You can count on me
You know that I'm so so down for you surely, yeah listen now

Now it's been about a year and still he hasn't shown his face
He hasn't come around
He hasn't even seen his kids
And every day she prays that one day he'll be coming soon
'Cause they keep asking her mommy tell us where did daddy go
'Cause he wasn't supposed to run and leave just because things weren't right
He had made a vow to you by sayin he was down with you
So now you've come to me girl 'cause you know he's my best friend
But what am I supposed to do, nothin I do's gonna make him change
You did everything you could
To try to change his ways
Even tried to make it work, still he chose to walk away

Que tu estas aqui

Te comienzo a mirar
Y comienza a palpitar
Mi corazon cuando te veo pasar
Que me pasara, que me pasara, baby

Te veo sonreir, y no se que decir
Un nudo en la garganta tu me haces sentir
Y no me deja hablar
No me deja hablar, baby

Lo que yo siento por ti
Es algo extrano aqui en mi corazon
Me hace enloquecer, baby
Yo te voy a demostrar que quiero mas que una
Simple amistad te voy a enamorar, yeah

Ya que estas aqui, oh, yeah
Te tengo que decir que tu estas aqui
Me vuelvo tan loco por ti, yeah

Te tengo que decir, te tengo que decir
Que tu eres para mu, baby

Algo extrano aqui en mi corazon, yeah
Esto me hace enloquecer
Yo te juro que te juro que te voy a enamorar, baby

It's like I dread every time you go
I know that we friends but I want much more
I wanna pull you close and whisper in your ear
I need you ma..just stay right here with me

But you always leave before I could open
Up my mouth to speak and I'm left by my self all alone
But I year for the day to complete my soul
And I don't know if it's you but you make me feel

Like the way I ain't felt since my teenage years
But it's more than a crush, more than a lush, cool
It be that I'm fallin' in, naa, it can't be, It can't be that
Only a fool can love someone who don't love them back

And that won't be me
No way, no how but I gotta
Tell you this right now that

Te tengo que decir
Que tu eres para mi, baby

En tu almohada why el espejo
Why en la soledad

I can't believe it

You kept insisting and resisting
That you would not fall again

And you're trying to come back home

Frankie J,"Yo, I wanna dedicate this song to everyone out there
Who's goin' through the same thing, just keepin it real, listen

Well, she was five foot, three, unique with them brown eyes
So beautiful that I had to make her my wife
I put my trust in her, I had a kid with her
I thought that I would be happy till the end with her

So you live an' learn, that's what you had told me
And now I'm feeling so miserable and lonely
I should've listened to your words
I should've listened to your words

From that long conversation we had long ago
'Bout the same situation, I be goin' through
From a friend to a friend, you would say the truth
From the outside looking in

She wasn't good at all, I thought that she loved me
She wasn't good at all, I really, really thought she cared
She wasn't good at all, how could I have been such a fool
To never listen to your words, yeah
She wasn't good at all, I should've never, never, never stayed with her, yeah

I told you from the beginning about this girl
That she only come and play some games
And I know she didn't feel the same

Because I seen it in her eyes man
That she's only out for your money
Now usually I won't say a word
But I know about these type of girls

These type of girls they come and go
Remember when we told 'em about it
When I told you that she wasn't down
That she wasn't about it

From that long conversation we had long ago
'Bout the same situation you was goin' through
From a friend to a friend, I would say the truth
From the outside looking in

She wasn't good at all, I told you 'bout this kind of girl
She wasn't good at all, I know you knew but I never listened to you, no
She wasn't good at all, you know she wasn't down with you
She wasn't good at all, I should've listened to your words

Yo, we must of had a different vision of love, tender kisses and hugs
Makin' me weak in my knees, that's how vicious it was
I'm from the gutter girl, you know it's vicious for thugs
Where unfamiliar faces look suspicious to us

I used to miss you so much, I put the pimp aside
Broke all my criminal ties, gave you the simple life
Call me the family man, gettin' my salary tight
But soon as you drop your guard, that's when reality bites

And leave a open wound, greed got your cover blown
But I be over you, I'm solitary born
I should of listened an' my boy and I would'd known
You do your thang, I ain't concerned, baby, girl I'm gone

She wasn't good at all, I knew she wasn't good enough
She wasn't good at all, I knew but I didn't care, yeah
She wasn't good at all, I told you 'bout this kind of girl
She wasn't good at all, I know I did this to myself
I know I did this to myself

She wasn't good at all, I tried to warn you 'bout this kinda of girl
She wasn't good at all, I just was so blind by her love
Or at least I thought it was love, yeah

Ooh, on and on
She wasn't good at all
She wasn't good at all, yeah, yeah

Then I'm left by myself all alone
But I yearn for the day to complete my soul

And I don't know if it's you but you make me feel
Like the way I ain't felt since my teenage years
But this is more than a crush, more than a lust, could
It be that I'm fallin' in na, it can't be, it can't be that I

Love them backhand that won't be me

Frankie J,"Como creer despues de tanto tiempo que paso
Tu decidistes terminar con nuestro amor why con los suenos que teniamos los dos,
Como quisiera que esto fuera solo un sueno
Porque perderte o olvidarte no era mi intencion
Pero insististes why te fuistes, lejos de mi corazon

why ahora regresas para covencerme a comenzar de nuevo
Que te arrepiente que me quieres que no olvidas,
Que no aguantas el dolor pero ya...

Ya no es igual, ya no es igual, ya no es igual ya no...
Es demasiado tarde para enmendar tu error
Ya no es igual, ya no es igual si todo se acabo why se termino why se perdio,
Que el dano fue tan grave amor
Ya no es igual, ya no es igual dentro mi corazon
Es imposible de olvidarme del dolor
Ya no es igual, ya no es igual, ya no es igual, ya no.....
Para que vivir, para que mentir, para que seguir si no hay amor....

Recuerdo cuando hablabamos en el telefono
Surgian planes de un hogar solo para los dos con illusiones de volverse en realidad
Pero ahora eso se va tan lejos de mi,
Tuve que infrentarme a la verdad,
Despues de tanto tiempo que lo que me hiciste pasar...

why ahora regresas para convencerme a comenzar de nuevo
Que te arrepientes que me quieres que no olvidas,
Que no aguantas el dolor pero ya...

Ya no es igual, ya no es igual, ya no es igual ya no...
Es demasiado tarde para enmendar tu error
Ya no es igual, ya no es igual si todo se acabo why se termino why se perdio,
Que el dano fue tan grave amor
Ya no es igual, ya no es igual dentro mi corazon
Es imposible de olvidarme del dolor
Ya no es igual, ya no es igual, ya no es igual, ya no....
Para que vivir, para que mentir, para que seguir si no hay amor.....",Ya No Es Igual,2003
Frankie J,"[Chorus: Frankie J]
Show me what yo body do
You can bring yo girlfriend too
We can have a rendezvous
Menage-a-Trois
We can have a drink or two
You can bring yo girlfriend too

[Baby Bash]
Down and dirty
Rough and rugged dog
Nasty but you love it
You gon' lick it
I'm gonna shove it, ugh-ugh, ugh
When I hit it from the back
You commence to cap
Grab yo toy baby grab yo strap
I'ma kick back light up a sack
Last name ""OFF"" first name is ""JACK""
You know the deal do
So grab the dildo
And let's do the damn thing
So I can tell my kin folks
About that there shit we did
About that there freak you did
And landed on my face, ooh
Baby girl but I love the taste
Got me livin' my fantasy
Baby come and dance for me
You got that candy cream
Let me see you pull yo panty string
Let yo thong slide to the side
Chica open wide
And let my fine ass baby mama put her tongue inside
Tongue kissin' naked to the world
Such a nasty girl
You got me fiendin' every time I'm dreamin' of the pearl
Twice last night, once in the mornin'
That's yo favorite song
It turns you on
Leave your pumps on
Baby watch me hit it strong
Baby Bashy you so nasty
Love the threesome for the top notch jazzies
Smokin' on some of that purple grassy
Now what yo body do

[Chorus x2]

[Mr. Shadow]
Ain't no tellin' what a fella gonna do
When it's me off Ren and you
On the phone when we getting' it on
Like the name off the song
It's just the freak in you, and me
Ya heard, fuck it, every body in this mutha fucka
We doin' this hit not givin' a shit
Shadow the chicken plucker
I want to know what you got on your mind
Is it the same as mine
We can bump and grind
And tell your friend she can come along, Why?
I would never leave her behind, hell no!
Never mind the love we share
Remember I'm a thug you bitch
Fuck her up rub 'round your dick
'cause all I give you dirty tricks and that's it
No shame in the game I play
Me and Bash got pie to lay
Texas Californ-I-A
Smokin' weed, pokin' bitches all night and day
Ride away in the hot one
Put my hook in the sea then I caught one
I gotta take it or leave it
And believe it or not
I got the eye of an eagle and I spot them

[Don Cisco]
Holiday Inn, Howard Johnson
Me and two friends like Charlie Bronson
Locked up in a suite in between sheets
Gang bangin' top nothes, huh
I'm the bossiest playa like the freak Steve Austin
I don't give a fuck what shit be costin'
Keep bad bitches, pretty friends be flossin'
Sex and the City every time we tossin'
Never leave the pad without packin' precaution
Frisco Mac, so proceed with caution
You and these dudes are in these streets is often
Blaze up a sack get the chronic often
Outlaw on the run come ? me none
Don Cisco baby
When I ride, I'm bossin' on that ass
And ? rollin' pregnant
2-1-1 girl I like them odds
You can rock my world
I'll make you scream for the Gods
In between the sheets all night
I'll freak you hard
Keep it cool
What you speakin' on?
Shut your mouth and just tweak it on
Close your lips, leak you wrong

You kept insisting and resisting
That you would not fall again
And now you're trying to tell me that you're sorry
And you're trying to come back home
You're telling me you really need me

Talks about one day of having a place of our own
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table

But all of that seems so far away from me
Had to wake up face reality
It all just seemed to good to be true
After all you put me through

Knowing now that it's wrong
It's too late 'cause she's gone

It's like doing time in the pen

But the hardest thing is there's no one else to blame but me
So I guess I have to take it like a man
But I don't know if I'll ever love again
Yeah, yeah

'Cause this pain I'm feeling inside is like a hollow point through my heart
I know that it's kinda crazy

The very sound of her name
Without the sky turnin' into clouds
Without the rain falling down
Falling down, again, again

How do I deal with
The fact that you had a chance

That your heart hurts with me

She ain't even thinkin' about me, honestly (honestly) 
Bein strong to carry on ain't easy (It ain't easy) 
Gotta face it, she's gone, gone 

Without some kind of intervention 
I can't go on another day 
And I can't even bare to mention 
The very sound of your name 
Without the sky turning to brown 
To keep the rain from falling down (falling down) 
And I don't need to look around, again, again

				",Gone [DVD],2005
Frankie J,"Lay your head on my shoulder
Everything is gonna be alright
Baby don't you worry 'bout a thing
I see a rainbow at the end

It's gonna be alright
So many problems around me
Dammit won't they just go away
Every night I pray, yeah

Lord won't you come my way
Won't you come and rescue me
Help me see the light

What do you do when your water runs dry
When your greens and your blues turn to black and white
It's the story of my life
When the fires get out, can you turn 'em off
Can you turn 'em off

I've tried so hard to make it
Tried to do the best I could
Tried to do some good,yea
Like the people that I could 

Like my family if you would
Trying to live a better life
Fake friends all around me
Trying to be up in my scoop

Acting like they're cool, yea
They don't know that I ain't bline So stop trying to waste my time
And go on with your bull, yeah

What do you do when your water runs dry
When your greens and your blues turn to black and white
It's the story of my life
When the fires get out, can you turn 'em off
Can you turn 'em off

Cada vez que siento que el mundo se me esta cerrando
Solo pienso en escaparme del mal
Why cada vez que siento que el aire se me esta acabando pienso en volar
Hasta donde nadie me pueda encontrar

What do you do when your water runs dry
When your greens and your blues turn to black and white
It's the story of my life
When the fires get out, can you turn 'em off
Can you turn 'em off",Story of My Life [DVD],2005
Frankie J,"[Chorus]
Call me a player cause I crush a lot 
And I make that money, cause I make it hot
And we use to kick it, shoulda never stop
Girl u know whats up
Cause I'm still after ya, 
And I'm still a bachelor
Are you still alone alone alone alone alone

So how you doin' how you been and how you livin'
You know baby girl your boys place still pimpin'
Plus I heard you got a man with a game plan
With a wedding plan
But you know I'm not the man, I had a different plan
For me and you to follow, a runway model
With a self made baller
But you was caught up with your lil' man a simple life  
You didn't want no fast life, poppin' bottles err night
So I get the movin' just like a g should
Three years later and your boy still livin' good
I cant fuck baby girl, yea I'm missing times
Creepin' on the low, you could swear we was doin' crimes
It was all good, we use to freak
And fuck late night in the back seat
Same number you can call me when you get that urge
Still got 25 cars, money to splurge
(Holler at me)

[Chorus]

It's been a minute since we last had a talk
Still hypnotized by the hips and the walk
I'm tryin to figure out who you with, hopefully alone
If thats the case you still got the number to my phone
It might seem like I'm tryin' to holla for some ass
But with the green that I got, I can get that fast
It was something that we had, and I still want it
So if you tryin' to give it to me, let me know I'm on it
I'm still after ya, I'm still a bachelor
If you got a man, understand that I'm not mad at ya
I might have fell off track, but I'm tryin' to bring it back
To the way it was, and if your feeling love

[Chorus]

I'm still here, right here, if u wanna ride
We can take it back how we did it up in '95 
With no strings attached,
I'll put u on your back 
Do those freaky things, make u always wanna come back
Writin' checks without a man, you cant say that your mine
Cause I'm still a free agent
Not tryin' to resign
I'm not a ball player
But I'm a  baller, player
And if your still alone
I'll be callin' later

[Chorus]

I'm not a player, I just crush a lot [Repeat: x2]
Girl you know whats up
You know whats up
I'm not a player, I just crush a lot 
Not a player, I just crush a lot

Are you still alone, are you still alone girl?",Are You Still Alone,2005
Frankie J,"[Hook]
She's callin me on my phone
Tellin me, she's feelin freaky
Her body's in need of me
Ya'll know player's get Jones
So, if you're feelin freaky and
Your body's in need of me
You can... call me, call me, call me
You can call me
When you're feelin freaky and
Your body's in need of me
You can... call me, call me, call me
You can call me
When you're feelin freaky and
Your body's in need of me

[Skillz]
Her body's feelin freaky
She calls me when she needs me
She can't wait to please me
I don't need you to believe me
I'm not her man or lover
We understand each other
It's somethin bout the cover
We always usin rubber
She loves to go down
I never return the favor
That's why she so down
Creepin so much
You would think we neighbors
She loves to keep it deep inside her
I would say a definite rider
And just because of the player she chose
It doesn't mean I'ma give her the go

[Hook]
[Play]
She won't roll with a player like you
She want to roll with a player like me
She callin me 'cause she's in the need
Of a player like me that's stackin G's
Better bring it back, pull it back
Don't be mad 'cause your girl keep callin
23's coop, she's callin me 'cause your boy is ballin
I know that she's gotta man
With a game plan, with the weddin plan
But, I'm not the man, we're not holdin hands
But, whatchu have, your man don't understand
She's callin me up when she leaves her job
That's what's up, when she leaves the club
Had too much she want to cut, that's what's up

[Hook]
[Skillz]
You hear my phone ringing
She callin for a reason
No time for any teasin
This time what friends you bringin
Some say it's a booty call
It might be new to ya'll
Never trick my dawg
Never fuck 'em low
Ya'll already know what player she chose

[Play]
So, I pick her up round quarter to 8
Chop the block and at quarter to 8
Get cha hot 'cause I know you can't wait
Pretty face, but I give her her space
So we can do it nice and slow
I mean we can screw it nice and slow
Like Usher, I gotta confession
Call a player when you get this pleasure

Frankie J,"He drops his suitcase by the door
She knows her daddy won't be back anymore
She drags her feet across the floor
Trying to hold back time, to keep him holding on
And she says...

Daddy, daddy, don't leave
I'll do anything to keep you right here with me
Can't you see how much I need you?
Daddy, daddy, don't leave
Mommy is saying things she don't mean
She don't know what she's talking about, somebody hear me out

Father, listen, tell him that he's got a home and he don't have to go
Father, save him, I would do anything in return
I'll clean my room, try hard in school
I'll be good, I promise you
Father, Father, I pray to you

Now she hasn't slept in weeks
She don't want to close her eyes 'cause she's scared that he'll leave
They've tried just about everything
But it's getting harder now for him to breathe
And she says

Daddy, daddy, don't leave
I'll do anything to keep you right here with me
Can't you see how much I need you?
Daddy, daddy, don't leave
The doctors are saying things they don't mean
They don't know what they're talking about, somebody hear me out

Father, listen, tell him that he's got a home and he don't have to go
Father, save him, I would do anything in return
I'll clean my room, try hard in school
I'll be good, I promise you
Father, Father, I pray to you

Please don't let him go
I'm begging you so
Let him open his eyes, need a lil' more time
To tell him that I love him more than anything in the world
It's daddy's lil' girl

Father, listen, tell him that he's got a home and he don't have to go
Father, save him, I would do anything in return
I'll clean my room, try hard in school
I'll be good, I promise you

",Dance,2006
Frankie J,"Don't remember were we met (All I do know) 
Is that I said hi and she looked me up and down 
(And she said lets go) 
So we went to a spot, out the back, blazin' hot
Clothes come off, it was on, head board broke. Mine was blown. After the session she checked her messages on her cell. All of a sudden her face just froze and her eyes got big as hell. The message said hey baby, surprise surprise, girl I'm free. I'll be home around 3. But it was already 3:15. 

[Chorus:]
(Hurry up) 
Grab your shoes 
(Hurry up) 
Grab your clothes 
(Hurry up) 
Cause my man coming be home 
Hit the street 
(Hurry up) 
Disappear 
(Hurry up) 
Gotta get outta here 
Baby, he's crazy
Believe me he'll kill you 
Leave your number 
I'll call you 
Whatever you just need to 
Just leave 

She said he stood about seven foot nine 
Killed some cat for looking at her and got twenty five to life
And somehow he's out today,and this fool he's on his way
He'll snap your neck and not think twice 
Get your things and goodnight 
Now I ain't trippin, 'cause if there ain't no man I like, I feel 
So I am dragging around ever so slowly
Puttin on my gear, I grab my jeans, off the floor 
And I hear keys in the door
She changes the locks that bought me time
But still this dude is right outside. 
And she said... 

[Chorus:]

She said get under the bed, likes that's a good place to hide 
H kicked in the door, no hello.He just said who's car is that outside.
I looked at him, he looked at me 
I still had one leg out my jeans
Where do I go running through my head, I guess I should've listened when she said

Frankie J,"I ain't trippin', oh yeah

First day at work, girl, I met you
You laid your pretty eyes on me
Right then, I knew it be somethin'
I didn't know what it could be

So I asked if you had a man
And you showed me the ring on your hand
The look on your face when I asked for your name
Your expression said it all to me, yeah

I can't deny, you stayed on my mind
Too bad I got a girl and you can't be mine
But damn, you're so fine
I think it's worth a try, so girl, let's just get down

I won't tell, if you won't tell
I'm tryin' to keep it on the low
Cause if he finds out and she finds out
You know it's gonna end for sure
(It's gonna end for sure, baby)

Even though you got a man
And even though I got a girl
It is what it's gonna be

I like the way it's goin' down

When we went out on our first date
I remember it was Thursday, yeah
It was the day before we got paid
And I can't front, I didn't know what to say

It was supposed to be business, that's what we both said
We had some drinks, ended up in a hotel bed
I really hope this doesn't get around
So keep it on the low and we can keep on gettin' down

Now I know we crossed the line when we got down girl
But how could somethin' wrong feel oh so right?
We both got down, so don't say nothin'
You know I'll be around to do a lil' somethin'
Me and you, you and me gettin' down, gettin' down

Frankie J,"You've seen him many times,
There's no use denying,
I've heard you on the phone

I've even followed you to all the places were you've secertly have been alone

I even know about the times when you would say to me that you was overwhelmed with work,
You had to stay longer working overtime,
But you were always lying,
Baby I might be dumb but I'am not blind

At times I feel like I want to break down inside

I got to find a way out 'cause this is tearing me to pieces, I just want to make it right

Is this what you call love explain to me baby, Is this really what you want from me
(Is this what you want from me)

I'am losing my patience, just hear what I'am saying You don't want to break the family
(Don't break this family)

Is this what you call love
Then you got it all wrong
This isn't the way our lives should be
I just won't allow somebody to become between us

Is this what you call love
Is this what you call love

You come home late at night,
Pretending it's alright, acting like you're doing nothing wrong, As you lay down right
Beside me, inside I'am dying

You just don't understand the pain that you have put me through (just don't understand)

After all the thing I have ever done for you, sometimes I rather be alone
Than have a broken home

I need you there (got a big ol house up on the hill

Frankie J,"I was coming out my front door. 
When I looked to my left and seen 
The flyest chick I swear I'd ever seen before. 
She must be something special. 
I'd never seen nobody like her ever. 
Everything about this chick was (?) from head to toe. 
And then I noticed that she was smiling at ya boy. 
But before I holla, I gotta make sure that my game is proper. 

The clock is going tic-tac, tic-tac, tic. tac. 
Your about to miss a once in a lifetime shot. 
But I gotta get it straight. to make sure what I say. 
Let her know just what I'm feeling. 

[Chorus] 
What do you do when you finally see. 
The girl you've been waiting for, the girl of your dreams. 
Say something (don't let her pass by) 
Say something (just look her in the eyes) 
Hey shorty, can I get a minute of your time? 
I know we never met before but I. 
Just say something (don't let her pass by) 
Say something (cause she only comes once in a lifetime) 

I'm getting ready to step to her, but I noticed her friends 
Was looking at me like they really didn't think I should. 
A lonely man has got to have it. 
He can't let nothing in the world. stop it. 
So excuse me Miss, but can I get your number. 
I think your sexy. can I call you up sometime? 
I get that, baby girl take mine. 
Anytime you wanna call, it's all right. 

The clock is going tic-tac, tic-tac, tic. tac. 
Your about to miss a once in a lifetime shot. 
But I gotta get it straight. to make sure what I say. 
Let her know just what I'm feeling. 

[Chorus] 

I can't believe I found the one right outside my front door. (outside my door) 
It seems like I have heard about this a thousand times before. (a thousand times before) 
So I knew I had to build the nerve, I knew I had to find the words. 
The right thing to say. I just couldn't let you walk away. 

[Chorus] 
What do you do when you finally see. 
The girl you've been waiting for, the girl of your dreams. 
Say something (don't let her pass by) 
Say something (just look her in the eyes)

I know we never met before but I.

Frankie J,"I got a call late last night from a number I didn't know 
It was so strange I knew who it was from the moment she said hello 
And I paused for a minute 
I couldn't believe it 
I kept my cool so my girl just wouldn't see She said, ""I'm sorry but there's something you
Should know"" 
This is what she said to me, 

""I didn't let you go 
No I can't let you go"" 
She said, ""I'm having such a hard time"" 
Then I heard, ""I didn't let you go 
I just can't let you go"" 
And then she said, ""I think I'm loosing my mind 

""'Cause I still love you 
This I must confess 
I guess I still need you 
I feel I have to tell you this again 
Yes I still want you 
Oh these words I did not plan 
So if I've interrupted anything 
I promise I won't call you again"" 

So I told her my heart felt 
The same that it did before (as it did before) 
Its never changed 
My feelings never went away girl (no) 
My heart never closed the door (no, no it never closed the door) 
Then I stopped for a minute gotta think about my lady 
And what we have going on (what we have going on) 
She's about to have my baby 
Girl, you waited much to long 

I gotta let you go 
I'm hanging up the phone 
This conversation can't go on no more 
I gotta let you go 
'Cause if I don't let you go 
I fear that I met let you know 

'Cause I still love you 
This I must confess 
I guess I still need you 
I feel I have to tell you this again 
Yes I still want you 
Oh these words I did not plan 
So if I interrupted anything 
I promise I won't call you again 

Now I'm doing just fine with my girl 
Not about to let her go (can't let her go, let her go) 
Just because you find me once again it doesn't mean you're coming back home
(doesn't mean you're coming back home)
Now its been about 2 years or so (its been about 2 years) 
Since we went our separate ways (went our separate ways) 
You gotta face the fact we're over with and done 
'Cause I 

'Cause I still love you 
This I must confess, Baby 
I guess I still need you 
I feel I have to tell you this again, Baby 
Yes I still want you 
Oh these words I did not plan 
So if I interrupted anything 
I promise I won't call you again 

'Cause I still love you ('cause I still, I still love you Baby) 
Yes I still need you
(but I better not talk about it 'cause I rather move on with my life and do what I gotta do) 
Yes I still want you (I'm sorry Baby) 
You gotta move on

We'll mail em a box of tissue

In what ever place we park the brakes 

I work my hands to the bone
If that's what it takes ta 
Give us everything

I'm prepared for that 
It may take a while 
But ima make you smile

Just hurt me now 
She said would you please jus let me talk for once 

Then all at once she went into how 
Shed been tryin to prevent this all for months 
Not at all because she didn't love me 
And only me 

Its jus that she 
Had withheld one vital piece of info 
She looked up at me 
Wit both eyes full of tears 

She said you remember that day at the clinic? 
I went in wit the doctor and I told you I did it 
I wasn't able to go through wit it 
No you didn't 

How could you 
Wait minute that makes you what? 
Three months and some change 
Well baby doll that jus ain't enough 

To derail us 
'cause see that jus means there's three of us 
But answer this, at what point did you think this topic should be discussed? 
I don't know whether to cry or smile

Pensando porque te has ido
Oye Bimbo solo quiere amarte
Mi corazon quiero regalarte
Todo lo mejor de mi quiero darte
Por favor mami no te marches
Al contrario quiero demostrarte
Que despues de la tormenta
El sol vuelve a asomarse
Quiero que sepas
Que si hoy eh de marcharme
Por siempre eh de amarte

Habita en mi interior
Mientras trato de olvidar
Que estoy tan lejos hoy de ti

Tu mensaje en mi buzon
Que me habla de tu amor
Es lo unico en el mundo
Que me hare sonreir

Ya ver tu foto me ayuda a sobrevivir
Esta soledad quisiera volar

Quisiera volar
Para perderme en tus besos
Why llenarme de tu amor
Quisiera volar

Porque no aguanto este juego
Que me quema de pasion
Quisiera volar hacia ti

No me quiero imaginar
Ni un minuto mas asi
Nesecitandote, aorandote
Why extraandote baby

Tu mensaje en mi buzon
Que me habla de tu amor
Es lo unico en el mundo
Que me hare sonreir

Ya ver tu foto me ayuda a sobrevivir
Esta soledad quisiera volar

Quisiera volar

Hum

She's the type of girl
(Every man would like to know)
You give her the world
(She's so beautiful)
She could catch your eye
If she walked right by

She would leave you mesmerized
(So let me walk outside my door)
I'm so sure that I can find her
(I can't hesitate no more)
Just can't wait any longer

Time is running out
And I don't want to live in doubt
I'm sure that she's out there
If it's the last thing I do
I'm gonna find her

I'm gonna search the world

No matter what I do
You just wait and see
I'm gonna find that girl

I thought I saw her
(Just the other day)
Somehow I found her
(It was only in my head)
It felt so real that I couldn't understand
(I couldn't understand)

How could I let her get away
(So let me walk outside my door)
I'm so sure that I can find her

Just can't wait any longer

Mamita, why we gotta keep going through this?
Talk to her, Frankie

Just yesterday you said you loved me
That there was nobody else above me
That I was yours and you were mine
That there was no limits to our skies
But then you had to put our love on hold
When it came to making love, it wasn't you anymore
And now you're telling me to leave
I gotta walk out the door
Can't you see that this is killing me?
It's hurting my soul
Oh baby

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to leave you
When my heart tells me to keep you?
How can you ask me to let you go?
No, I just can't let you go
No, I just can't let you go
(No)
Can't you see I'm slowly dying?
But I'm gonna keep on trying
Please don't ask of me to let you go

Let me start
By telling you I love you with all my heart
But I can't understand the reason
When you tell me you're leaving
Girl, me and you were supposed to be forever and ever
Now instead of being in love
It's like we are used to each other
How could we do this to each other?
We use to ride for each other
Die for each other
Cry for each other
Now, it's like all we wanna do is say is bye to each other
I can't let this happen
I refuse to lose you
I love you, baby
It's the truth as usual
I wanna make you happy
Girl, it ain't hard to see
You mean the world to me
We had been though it all
Thick or thin, right or wrong
I can't let you go 'cause this love is too strong

[Chorus]

Look, baby, just tell me what you want
Look, baby, just tell me what you need
Look, baby, I know I'm far from perfect
But the game and the money - they can take 'cause it's worthless
I know it's hard to deal with my life
I know it's hard to deal with all the gossip
I done seen 'em wit' this one
I done seen 'em wit' that one
But everything they say is monotonous
Can't you hear it in my voice?
Mami, you know you're my heart, my soul, my love
And I swear to you, baby
I just want to give you my heart, my soul, my love
I know we can work this out
I know we can
Baby, let's try
But one thing I won't do is let this love die
(Is let this love die...)

[Chorus]

Believe me; yes, I'm trying to let you go
But the only thing I get from it is all this crying
Tell me, how am I supposed to let you go?
No, no, no

If I could turn back I would slow it down
If I could go back I would do it again
Do it again
Do, do, do it again
Oah

Ain't got no time for no bullshit
Gotta make moves quick
If you snooze then you lose it
Lay you down like my cheverlet
After a day of play
After i juice it
Get stupid
Hit the corner crooked
Don't remember how i took it
Don't remember how i made it
I remember being faded
Remember when i had more than anticipated
Got intoxicated
I almost got incarcirated
Put my petal to the metal
Hear me screechin' down the pavement
I'm messy lil rob
And I'm back up on the block
In a rag top with a back drop not knowin' when to stop
So i'ma keep on rollin' till the wheels are fallin' off
And it might get a little crazy but nobody call the cops
We got it under control
We're on a gangsta stroll
Watchin' out for the pigs on patrol
'Cause my homboys on parole
My little homboys on probation
Still gots a chance to change his life
But right now its incarciration that he's facin'

Slow it down
If i could go back i would slow it down
If i could turn back i would slow it down
If i could go back i would do it again
Do it again
Do, do, do it again
Oah

See homboy vato down the block 
He told me vato got shot
In the parking lot of the taco shop
The towns been hot
Been full of cops 
Been full of blacas
I told them i don't really understand it homie
Bumpin' this is for la raza
Hit the switch like this
Its your big end of the street
Where i keep my cuete under my seat
Where i keep on the creep
Where we go to the grave with the secrets we keep
And i'ma always keep my word so that i'm able to sleep
I'm bumpin' the beat when i heard her body talkin' to me
I like what its sayin' and i love what i see
You're comin' with me
Her body's cold and comfortable the whole
So magicly now she's sittin' in my passenger seat
We got it under control
We rollin' low
It's so slow i 
Hit the land yo and live my life in slow mo
If i could do this one more
Time again just tell me when so i can do it again

Slow it down
If i could go back i would slow it down
If i could turn back i would slow it down
If i could go back i would do it again
Do it again
Do, do, do it again
Oah

See one of my homboys he's doin' good
He started life over
Another homboy not so good
He slid now life's over
He was supposed to be gettin' married
In february
Now he's in the coffin being carried at the cemetary
Getting burried
Take a hit of the joint and keep it cherry
'Cause this shit is gettin' heavy
Like the chevy on 5 twentys
And that's pretty heavy
Tryna make that pretty penny
Where there's plenty
And i'll be damned if i ain't makin' any
Comin' out stronger than many
Many bolder than most
We get sick with it
Sicker than my flows; fuckin' gross
The products was where i was brought up
It's the bomb like a feline
Tag my name on a street sign
Throwin' up the peace sign
Lookin' for a feline
That's bad enough to be mine
Fuck ya homboy; she fine
So we gon' keep on rollin'
Even if i don't know where i'm goin'

If i could go back i would slow it down
If i could turn back i would slow it down
If i could go back i would do it again

Ayo, listen to my story
Come on, come on

Well, it all started on a late night creepin'
I planned my getaway, 'cause my shorty she was trippin'
Just trying to get out to breathe a little different air
If you know what I mean, yeah

So as I'm jumping out the window of my room
I hear my homies calling out, they're on the move
Driving Escalades and Hummers with them blades
Hiding behind shades, ready on their way, yeah

So as we driving, we ended up on the strip
We see some hunnies and damn, I just began to flip
'Cause this shorty she be staring straight at me
This sexy fine lady, she be callin' me out now

What's a man to say?

What's a man to do?
When you and your girl just can't pull through, damn

See I been trying to find a way out of this misery
'Cause only God knows this is not the way I be
I'm just too young to be stressin' this ain't right for me
So she better act up or I'm gonna straight up and leave

This is not the first time that we go through this
It's 'bout the second, third, fourth maybe even fifth
And I've been trying to work it out only with you, babe
So listen close 'cause not all men are the same

So what's a man gotta do? So we work this
I've just about tried almost everything I can
So let me learn you something then you better learn right quick

Frankie J,"Perdóname que no hay cariño
Perdóname que lo perdimos
Perdóname que no hay ternura
Y cada noche es más oscura

Ni esperanza de dar un paso para atrás
No es tan fácil de olvidar
Y es que sé que no hay manera
De ser amigos
Como si no te hubiera amado
Es imposible convencerme que ya no eres para mí

Y no te quiero ver con él
Y no me quieres ver con ella
Prefiero no volverte a ver
Que estar pasando noche en vela
Mejor no nos comuniquemos ni pretendamos seguir igual
Es un problema que no tiene solución
Más que un adiós

Yo sufro de un dolor constante
Por más que trato en reemplazarte
Sus besos no me llenan tanto
Y cada día me trago el llanto

Ni esperanza de dar un paso para atrás
No es tan fácil de olvidar
Y es que sé que no hay manera
De ser amigos

It would really be X rated, baby - for you.

And if you could speak, what a fascinating tale you would tell.
Of an age the world has long forgotten.
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today.

The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada,
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada.
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wanderr along.
Entranced by the beauty before me,
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song.

And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada,
I envy the blush of the snow-clad Sierra Nevada.
For soon it will welcome the stars while a thousand guitars,
Play a soft habanera.
Then moonlit Granada will live again the glory of yesterday,

And squeezes it 'n' says ""How ya feelin', hon?""

That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun 
 
And if that's not lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say

And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss 
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime 
And when my self is feelin' low 
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind 
 
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy 
And ask her if she could get away and meet me 
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat 
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me 
And I'm always late 
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me 
'cause she's made that way 
 
And if that ain't lovin' me 
Then all I've got to say 
God didn't make little green apples 
And it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes

I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie

Frankie Laine,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,1993
Frankie Laine,"Jealousy, night and day you torture me
I sometimes wonder
If this spell that I'm under
Can only be a melody
For I know no one but me has won your heart, but
When the music starts, my peace departs

From the moment they play that lovely strain
And we surrender to all its charm again
This jealousy that tortures me is ecstasy, mystery, pain

We dance to a tango of love
Your heart beats with mine as we sway
Your eyes give the answer I'm dreaming of
That soft word your cruel lips will never say

I fear that the music will end
And shatter the spell it may lend
To make me believe when your eyes just deceive
But it's only the tango you love

Frankie Laine,"Memories in Gold (Frankie Laine)
Those melodies that we two crossed years . . . 
Have underscored our laughter and our tears
With every phrase we see the . . . past unfold . . . 
Like memories in gold.

Some tunes remind us of our childhood days . . . 
Sunday afternoons and . . . songs of praise . . . 
Reflecting happy times in . . . joys untold . . . 
These memories in gold.

From those early nursery rhymes . . . 
Through our adolescent times . . . 
We find more varied as we went along . . . 
And how could we go wrong . . . 

And how could we go wrong . . . 
With a special song . . . 
That would always . . . see us through?

Our lives without them might be . . . cold and bleak . . . Our favorite song is more than words can speak . . . 
They helped me win your love to heaven hold . . . 
Sweet memories in gold.

When the band played rock and roll . . . 
And the people called it soul . . . 
Our favorite songs were like a tapestry . . . 
Edged in melody . . . 
They would always be . . . part of you and . . part of me. 

There?s little more to add when . . . songs are sung . . . 
The words and music help . . . keep us young . . . 
And so we?re not afraid of . . . growing old . . . 
With memories . . . let?s hear them, please . . . 
Sweet memories in gold.

Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

And dream your troubles away.

Just smile as they fall,

Always follows the rain,

And dream your troubles away.

For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair

With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

Frankie Laine,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2001

And miss it each night and day

Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Fly gypsy cry gypsy love will not die gypsy

Hey good looking what you got cooking
Hows about cooking something up for me
Hey sweet baby don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe

I got a brand new car and a ten dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill
The juke box's jumping the dance is free
So if you wanna have fun come along with me

Hey good looking what you got cooking
Hows about cooking something up for me

I'm free and ready so we can go steady
Hows about saving all your time for me
No more looking, I know I've been cooking
Hows about keeping steady company

I'm gonna pull my date book over the fence
And find me one for five or ten cents
I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age
Cause I'm writing your name down in every page.

I sometimes wonder
If this spell that I'm under
Can only be a melody
For I know no one but me has won your heart, but
When the music starts, my peace departs

From the moment they play that lovely strain
And we surrender to all its charm again
This jealousy that tortures me is ecstasy, mystery, pain

We dance to a tango of love
Your heart beats with mine as we sway
Your eyes give the answer I'm dreaming of
That soft word your cruel lips will never say

I fear that the music will end
And shatter the spell it may lend
To make me believe when your eyes just deceive
But it's only the tango you love

Sad am I sad am I

I could cry to think of the lips left unkissed

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A'plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o
Ghost herd in the sky
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful cry
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o
Ghost riders in the sky
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' flame an' fire, as they ride on, hear them cry

Ghost riders in the sky
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name

""Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride""

For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada.
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wanderr along.
Entranced by the beauty before me,
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song.

And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada,
I envy the blush of the snow-clad Sierra Nevada.

Play a soft habanera.

It was midnight Come to think of it
It was spring
There was music I was listening
Then in the room somewhere someone began to sing 
This serenade made for remembering
 
A small cafe, Mam'selle
Our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet 
And so were you, Mam'selle
And as the night danced by 
A kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle 
Just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way mine does for you
And yet I know too well 
Some day you'll say goodbye 
Then violins will cry 
And so will I, Mam'selle

And that happy tune is your step

oh what a shock ""you're on the wrong block""

Peeking at the dollys and the shiney choo-choo trains
Santa's hitching up his reindeer, has his bag packed tight
Everything is ready for the sleigh ride through the night

Glasses filled with snowflakes sprinkling

Oh Da-a-a-anny boy
I love you so
But come ye ba-ack
When summer's in the mea-eadow
Or when the winter's whi-ite
And hushed with snow
I'll be here
In sunshine or in sha-adows
Oh Danny boy
Oh Da-anny boy
I love you so",Danny Boy,1994
Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers,"Though you've decided that our love is wrong
And think that we should part
It seems as though I have loved you so long
You'll always be in my heart

Is it a sin
Is it a crime
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you

Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
Dreaming the lonely night through
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of dreaming of you

What can I do
What can I say
After I've taken the blame?
You say we're through
You'll go your way
But I'll always feel just the same

Maybe I'm right
Maybe I'm wrong
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you",Guilty,1994

Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers,"I got a gal who's always late
Anytime we have a date
But I love her, yes, I love her

Mmm, he's gonna walk up to my gate
And see if he can get it straight
Cause he wants her, he's gonna ask her

Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
The way you're actin' lately makes me doubt
You's is still my baby, baby
Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out

A woman is a creature
That has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one
You find she's gone and made a change

Is you is or is you ain't my baby?
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true?

Is you or is you ain't my baby, baby?
Baby boy, the way you're actin' lately makes me doubt
See here, who's been cuttin' me

Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers,"You went away, I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind

Still the magic if the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind
The sky was blue and high above
The moon was new and so was love

This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover, where can you be?
You came at last, love had its day
That day is past, you've gone away

This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
When I remember every little thing
You used to do, I'm so lonely

Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new but love is old

And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
When I remember every little thing
You used to do, I grow lonely

Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new but love is old

And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me","Lover, Come Back to Me",1994
Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers,"Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes
And he loves me
Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say
There is nothing more I can say",Sweet and Lovely,1994
Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1994
