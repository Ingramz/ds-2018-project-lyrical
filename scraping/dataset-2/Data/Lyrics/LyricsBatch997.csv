The god of love preparing to depart
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder,
They slip between the sentries of the heart

Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine
And radiant beyond your widest measure
They fall among the voices and the wine

It's not a trick, your senses all deceiving
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for this to happen
Go firmly to the window, drink it in
Exquisite music Alexandra laughing
Your first commitments tangible again

And you who had the honor of her evening,
And by the honor had your own restored
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Alexandra leaving with her Lord

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for the occasion
In full command of every plan you wrecked
Do not choose a coward's explanation
that hides behind the cause and the effect

And you who were bewildered by a meaning
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

With everything.

From a withered limb,

They sing for him.

Sharon Shannon,"Galileo fell in love as a Galilean boy
And he wondered what in heaven who invented such a joy
But the question got the better of his scientific mind
And to his blind and dying gaze
He looked up high and often sighed
And sometimes cried

Who puts the rainbow in the sky
Who lights the stars at night
Who dreamt up someone so divine
Someone like you and made them mine

Love can make you ask some funny questions now and then
But just remember the alternatives for I remember when
I was lonely and unhappy
And my lips were cold as ice
But you kissed me, and good heavens
Now I'm here in paradise
So if ever I'm not kissing you or looking in your eyes
I won't be blind, and I won't cry
I'll look up high and gladly sigh
And thank the guy

Who lights the stars at night?
Who dreamt up someone so divine?

All the stupid little crimes
A thousand million different times
And she forgave me
Promise me this will get better
And it will heal in the bright weather
And as long as were together 
I don't mind?

And if we go to Mexico,
Will it be a new leaf?
We'll watch the evening disappear
Into the arms of the night thief

You looked so tired and a little blue
You were in your Sunday best
With your father's tie upon your chest

Hey, you always will

In the corridor of one hotel
We once crossed paths I recall it well
Voices in an empty hall
Slamming doors to hearts that fall

And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls

To see the way that light attaches to a girl

And it's one more day up in the canyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood

Drove up to Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.
And talked a little while about the year

Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her

Into the fog where no one notices
The contrast of white on white.

And in between the moon and you
The angels get a better view
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right.

I walk in the air between the rain,
Through myself and back again.
Where? I don't know
Maria says she's dying.
Through the door, I hear her crying
Why? I don't know

'Round here something radiates

She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
And she walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside of my house, takes her clothes off,
Says she's close to understanding Jesus
She knows she's more that just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous

'Round here we're carving out our names
'Round here we all look the same
'Round here we talk just like lions
But we sacrifice like lambs
'Round here she's slipping through my hands

Sleeping children got to run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning

She says, ""It's only in my head.""
She says, ""Shh, I know it's only in my head.""

But the girl on the car in the parking lot
Says: ""Man, you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling.""

Then she looks up at the building
And says she's thinking of jumping.
She says she's tired of life;
She must be tired of something.

'Round here she's always on my mind
'Round here (hey man) I got lots of time
'Round here we're never sent to bed early
And nobody makes us wait
'Round here we stay up very very very very late

Around here
You catch me if I'm falling
You catch me if I'm falling
Will you catch me because I'm falling down on here

Sharone Scott,"Oh, there?s one thing that I?m sure,
It?s so proud and it?s so pure.

And it comes from deep within,
It?s got no hair it?s got no skin.

As we travel far and near,
We bring the world for you to hear.

And the message that we bring,
Is the light in the words we sing.

And no matter how bad you feel,
We got something, they can?t steal.

No they can?t, no they can?t, no they can?t,
Take away our music, no.

No they can?t, no they can?t, no they can?t,
Take away our music. 

In the ghetto, it gets cold,
But we got something to warm our souls.

Like the blanket of our faith,
Keeps us covered when we shake.

Though they take my brother?s life,
And deny his given rights.

Yes, the message will be heard,
As the four winds spread the word.

And our spirit, they can?t break,
?Cause we got power to communicate, yea.

No they can?t, no they can?t, no they can?t,
Take away our music, Lord.

No they can?t, no they can?t, 
I say, they can?t take our music, music, little baby (unintelligible)
But his message is my book, my book, is your book, is everybody?s book. Come on.
Music is fine, music is alright, alright with me, yea.
Come on, come on, sing it mom, sing it pop, sing it brother, sing it sister. 

Everybody, come on. Get up on your feet, now, and stomp your feet, clap your hands, come on. Oh.
Sing it to your man, sing it to your woman, sing it to your baby, sing it to the sky,
Sing to ev?, sing it to the ground, sing it to the earth, my, my, my, my, come on.
They can?t take it away, they can?t take it away. Oooo. Come on, come on, come on.

That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along

And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Donny Hathaway singing on the ring tone.

Tellin' me life wasn't shit to fool with.
These young niggas steady
Dyin' over dumb shit,
Fast money for your soul,
Now your done with.
You hear the gun click. 
Blood stains on the walls and carpet,
Pain and the hardships
Of a father identifyin' his child
From a photo of the plan,
With his brains blown out now.
Lets rewind to where it all took place,
Started off in math class early that day.
Hey! it's high school,
And everybody's tryin' to earn a rep
And he gone gun shot a homie to death.
The impossible is happenin',
Children are left to make decisions.
Do ya let 'em die or kill them yourself?

As I look at my life
Remembering where I've been.
I may not have been here.
Coulda been in the gutter,
Drowning in my tears.
I remember how hard it is on
The block. (Yeah)
Every time you turn around
Somebody got shot
Oh,
But I'm still here.
I'm still here.

Another homie got murdered
In the dope house,
Ass pocket full of money,
Chillin' gettin' smoked out.
Two shots hit him in his
Face when he blast it,
Frame pictured,
And it's closed casket.
This is so tragic.
I see death on every block I turn,
It's just not my turn.
Live the same lifestyle,
Cash money to burn.
Weed blowin' steady slippin'
In the darkest term.
When it feels like real life,
Knowin' is next.
Rep to take it,
Be the last left,
Humble yourself.
In slow-mo you see your
Whole life flashin'
That second from the beginning,
Back to the end and that lesson
Is nothin' short of what a nigga expect.
Livin' life like this,
This is duly respect.
And I refuse to give debt.

[Chorus]

Yeah I remember,
We tatted are names on our arms for fun.
Writin' rest in piece for
The dead and gone.
That's just me,
And I ain't the one to stunt,
But seems like I'm losing
Somebody every other month.
That's why I walk through the hood
Tryin' talk to the hood,
But some niggas is lost in the hood.
And we blind to that fact,
That we actin' like they
Wanted us to act.
White man versus black.
Reason I ain't vote for my
Iraqs 'cos I love 'em.
They gonna want him hanged after that.

Sent to die in the war in a fight,
That never should took place.

Driving 100 miles an hour to get back to you
And even though my eyes are closing, I'm pushing through
Because I see you I know I've kept you waiting, but I have to see this through
See this through

This is all too familiar
This vision, this vision’s haunting me

The words I hear, the words that we both know
No one knows what I'd do to get back home
I know you feel alone and I have my regrets
This road feels never-ending

I think about the memories, all the times we held so close
And when my strength is fading every mile that I go
I hear you
Your voice, my second wind to see this through

See this through

There's truth in consequences
I'm living with the hope that one day
One day you'll embrace this
You can strengthen your legacy
Is there something, something you would die for…

Show me
The heart you have inside
Show me
You won't ever let this die
Show me
Strength through the hardship
Of what you are

I'll make this life into something more
Take away, take away
Our regrets
‘Cause the pain we feel is worth it
And the time we get, time we get is luck

You speak about time and space between
As if it justifies your way out
You’re not the only one to chase this dream
Show me there's something
Anything you would die for

Show me
The heart you have inside
Show me
You won't ever let this die
Show me
Strength through the hardship

I'll make this life into something more
Take away, take away

There is a way to force ourselves
Forget the past
We can revive
We can revive
Our Family

Focus and look past on how they divide us
Let's draw our lines in the fucking dirt
Protesting the loss we have inside us
Look into my eyes…
There's not weakness anymore

I can tell there's no winning in this
Just surviving for ourselves
That doesn't mean we can’t find a way
A way to define us

I know together we are not
Hopeless
But alone we fall short
Through your eyes I find motivation
We are…
We're the fucking cure

We can't trust, trust in the way you guide us
The writing’s all over the wall
Place the blame on all but the obvious…
You’re lying to us all

That doesn't mean we can't find a way

Steadfast we will proclaim

Shaun Cassidy,"Do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart 
How the music can free her whenever it starts

It makes you feel lovely like an old time movie

But it's like tryin' to tell a stranger 'bout rock and roll

If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues 
Just go and listen it'll start with a smile 
It won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try 
Your feet start a-tappin' and you can't seem to find 
How you got there, so just blow your mind 

If you believe in magic, come along with me 
We'll dance until mornin', 'til there's just you and me 
And maybe, if the music is right 
I'll meet you tomorrow, sort of late at night 
And we'll go dancin', baby, then you'll see

I'm a hummin' and a strummin' all over God's world
You can't remember when you had your last meal
And you don't know just how a woman feels

You didn't know what rock and roll was
Until you met my drummer on the Grey tour bus
I got there in the nick of time
Before he got his hands across your state line, yeah

Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
The heater don't work and it's oh so cold
You're lookin' tired, you're lookin' kinda  beat
The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet

Until you caught your sister with the guys from the group

There's  blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
Can't keep you home, you're messin' around

So you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
You got the rhythm, you got the speed

And every time that you're good, I forget all the hurt and redeem you

Caught feelings, now I gotta face them

Then you come and crawl into bed and I let you

Let you get away, I let you get away-way-way

Everyone says you're hot, that you mean well, but you're not a keeper
But if I let you loose, I may look back at you and I wonder
The truth behind the wondering eyes
The loose ends always coming untied
While I'm hanging by threads, will I miss out instead on another love?

I put up with your cold shoulders
You're going through my texts and numbers
As if I got something to cover and I let you

Not really sure where that's leaving us

Shaun Groves,"My cup is never empty
My eyes are never dry
I'd be drunk by now if
Selfishness were wine
Seems like a million years
That I've been standing here
Holding on to all that holds me down

Come and move me
In a holy dance
Through my circumstance
Come and move me
From my hiding place
Into Your embrace
Where the whole human race sees You
Move me

Let the sun burn brighter
I'll run into Your shade
Dip the sky in darkness
I'll cry out for Your day
Use bitter and sweet
To move my frozen feet
Far beyond all that holds me down

I know it's true
When I'm destitute
You come running to me
But sometimes
I believe you simply

Shaun Groves,"Walking with you is not without hazards
Trippings this traveler's curse
Price paid for falling is more than my stumble
In a world that is watching and waiting for words

But I listened when You said to go
And I set out in spite of my fears
About truth mixed with my imperfection
And the question of what to say when I got here

And now that I'm here
Should I tell them that
You are the one who has made me
And saved me and set up a home there inside
Should I tell them that I am a perfect example
Of all You can do with a life.
What should I say to them?
What if I'm failing them?
What should I tell the tonight?

Now don't get me wrong
I'm thankful to be here
With this song to sing and a spotlight on me,
But lately I'm wondering if you are mistaken,
If you're seeing all of me there is to see.

Cause on every face I detect
The same questions I've posed to you
Like do you speak through the imperfect
Are we too dirty for your light to get through?
I want your light to get through.

What should I tell them when
They're thirsty Lord
My cup is empty Lord
Come and lead me here in this place
'cause I'm unashamed, but I'm unprepared
And I'm just plain afraid

That's all I'm asking, all I'm asking

Welcome to this heart of mine
I've buried under prideful vines
Grown to hide the mess I've made 
Inside of me
Come decorate, Lord
Open up the creaking door
And walk upon the dusty floor
Scrape away the guilty stains
Until no sin or shame remain
Spread Your love upon the walls
And occupy the empty halls
Until the man I am has faded
No more doors are barricaded

It's not my own
Make it home
Come and take this heart and make it
All Your own

Forgive me for the disrepair
And the souvenirs from floor to ceiling
Gathered on my search for meaning
Every closet's filled with clutter
Messes yet to be discovered
I'm overwhelmed, I understand
I can't make this place all that You can

I took the space that You placed in me
Redecorated in shades of greed
And I made sure every door stayed locked
Every window blocked, and still You knocked

There in the moon's glow, I find Your eyes
Watching over me through clouds of silver
Stretched like fingers over midnight skies

Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives He releaseth my soul

He maketh me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets,
For lo, He hath great power, and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones,

Through quiet reflection, and great dedication
Master the art of karate,
Lo, we shall rise up,
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water

And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

Cause therels something in a sunday

Wanna tell you I don't love you tell you that we're through and I've tried
But every time I see your face I get all choked up inside

When I call your name girl it starts the flame burning in my heart
tearin it all apart no matter how I try my love
I cannot hide 'cause

Sugar Pie Honey Bunch you know that I'm weak for you
Can't help myself I love you and nobody else

You think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe

Lifeless

You have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child of peace
Every cloud and sea
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise (that's right)
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me as a guide
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'ma stick around with Russ' and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

""The only thing bigger than your will to do something
Is your will not to do something
And even that's the power of your own will

Man, Tahir, love life
Whether good or bad times
I'ma climb?
Make it all better instead of sitting around uptight
Looking down 'cause it ain't right
Whatcha gon do is the question
Mope around fessing
I stuttin nothing 'cause nothing stuttin me
When them chips get low
And I got no dough
Sleeping on the floor
Haters been poor and always will be
'cause I know my self-worth, haters can't kill me
See I realize that
Niggas need to ask themselves how they feel about that
Whether you trying to get paid
Or trying to get off crack
But you can't and you ain't unless you change that

What you think is what you will see
How you act is how you will be
Say it's hard and it never will be easy
Make a fist if you feel me
Chill if you can't
Nigga ain't and you will see

Asking myself why do I try (will power, will power)
Do we begin to unite

These pessimists
Cowards don't exist
Scared to take a risk
Turn around and be the first to make a diss
Try to keep it crisp and tight and let it rip
If it don't work, at least I tried
Hell I coulda died not satisfied
You said you couldn't but you lied
People don't try 'cause they petrified
Of what though
I ain't even worried about the po-po
And once we ??? them
There ain't a place that can't go
And bump takin things slow
Watching people shit from get-go
In my way-get blowed
In my space-get towed
Use shit as fertilizer
Make yourself grow and get wiser

How you act is how you will be
Say it's hard and it never will be easy

Add water with the sun and some help from man

No need to stall 
Stack bricks real tall 
And you get brick walls 
Get a plan 
Keep it going til you figure things out
Work your plan

True thinking is a deliberative act of the mind
Held fast to its task
Good or bad
The mind will bring into you life what you conceive
Strong will is the master of the body
Directed in the ? in the dictates of desire or reason
Will is itself power to bring forth the motive
On impluse that is strongest
Be it positive or negative
As is the mind, so is the will
Contemplate confidence and belief in your will
So your mind will be clothed 
With the power to have all possessions
Self-possessions, self-restraints, self-direction
And self-complusion to have anything you desire
The law of the will is the law of all rounds
Of symmetric character of self
God gave us a choice to direct thy will
And the power to be or not to be
The choices is ours-Willpower",Willpower,2001

We used to make love, now we hate each other guts
No more words between us you in the streets I'm in the cut
I figure, give me space, give it some time
And we put me out on a highway I hitting on mine
Caught a taxi to my crib, roughft up my six
Full throttle to you crib, crying and shit
Should of listen, cause we was like, night and day
Should of seen it, you break my heart, anyway
But I lost my mind you hit my spot when you made love to me
Was you loving me or fucking me when you was inside me?

?????????
Insecure, get it from a girl that's yours when the streets beat you up and
You can't take no more
And that life style you living, lead's you to back to my door
Tell me, I played the fuel forever, as long as you and I could stay
together forever

Ohh, I forgot to be your lover
We going do it

Throwing their panties on stage's for me like Maxwell
Yeah, getting my hand's well to an extended this hard ?????
You know who I'm coming home to, I'm blush you
Just giving problem's, trying to trick me to marriage like Carmen Electra
Did to Dennis Rodman (Heh heh)
You violating lotta trying to creep with sedude's
When I provided you with Benz, Jeeps, beepers, and Jewels
She confused, it's my apartment
I cheated on you more than Dirty got police warrants
Just being honest

Sorry
All the shit you brought upon for glass
Sorry
I turned your little sexy ass out
Sorry
You got the key's to my apartment and house

Had chicks chasing you down, just to see where we live
I was the baddest bitch in Cali, having your kid's
And you didn't even love me, you just like fucking my rib's
Take the key's off the dresser let you stuck at the crib
And I don't even swallow cum 
I give's a fuck who you is
Now your ass fill you's with my ???? on your ????

Sorry

Momma said you only wanted my wealth
Still I ended up loving you more than I love myself
Five year's prom bitches taking down off the shelf
Ate your pussy imaging you was somebody else
In the Court House, I'm wilding out, you my housekeeper
(Uh) We split up and the judge let you keep the house

Sorry

We not even legal I'm tripping
The only rain you was getting was around the bathtub after you finish stripping
Apologies? Save 'em all for your Priests
And the stepdaughter you helped me to raise
Is also your niece (That's your sister?)

Did I reach you out and hold you, in my lovely arm's?

In the old sharecroppers one room country shack
They say my mammy left me, same day that she had me
Said she hit the road and never once looked back

And I just thought I'd mention, my Grandma's old age pension
Is the reason why I'm standing here today
I got all my country learning, living and a churning
Pickin' cotton, rasin' hell, and bailin' hay

I wudn't born no yestday
Got a good Christian raisin' and an eighth grade education
Ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way

And now sweet Caroline, I don't guess I'll ever find
Another woman put together like you all
With your wiggle and your walkin', and your big city talkin'
Your brand new shiny Plymouth rag-top car

Yeah it's hurry up and wait, in this world of give and take
Seems like haste makes for waste every time
And I pray to my soul, when you hear those ages roll
You better know I'm gonna get my share of mine

But I always be around
Just like the songs I leave behind me

Be good to one another
Please try to raise your children right
Don't let the darkness take 'em
Don't make 'em feel forsaken
Just lead them safely to the light

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Shaw Blades,"Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.",The Sound of Silence,2007

I can try to repay
All I've taken from you

On my way back to you.

Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a bright sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said the world's a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love, with you as my sweetheart

Act 1 was when we met, I loved you at first glance
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came Act 2, you seemed to change, you acted strange
And why I'll never know

Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you

Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down

Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

Shawn Colvin,"Maybe somewhere in the southern hemisphere
 There could be room for all this love
 Where they've saved a place for innocence
 And what is still mysterious
 And their dreaming time
 They're dreaming time

 Because we've broken down the wilderness
 And we've blackened up the skies
 And we cry 'cause we've got no vision left
 While the smoke gets in our eyes
 And there's no more time
 And the dream is dying

 But I love you baby
 And I know you and I
 Can find a way to heaven
 Just like Orion in the sky
 He's the long lost hero
 He's the guardian of your son
 But can he protect us baby
 From all the sad things we've done

 Now I know there's no sense in hiding
 And we can't escape this war
 And I have made my peace with dying
 Down here on this killing floor
 In a world gone blind
 Where there's no more time

 But I love you baby
 And I know by and by
 We gonna find a way to heaven
 Just like Orion in the sky
 He can walk upon the water
 He can shine for everyone
 But can he protect us baby
 From all the sad things we've done

 Is it too much to ask in a lifetime
 For just one shot at happiness
 Do you just have to laugh at the right lines
 Until you come face to face
 With the looking glass
 To be reckoned with the sins of our time

 I love you baby
 I can see you and I
 As we fly away together
 Up to Orion in the sky
 He's the last of the fallen angels
 He's the light of the Southern Cross
 Maybe he can take us baby
 Back to the paradise we've lost

 So I'll see you darlin'
 Now fly baby, fly
 Down across the Fiji Islands
 To where the Seven Sisters cry
 Gather all your dreams and take them
 Somewhere so far out of reach
 Follow the sword of the hunter, baby
 And meet me on the beach
 We are forever tied
 Still on the run
 To the medicine man
 For all the sad, sad things we've done",Orion in the Sky,1992
Shawn Colvin,"Please no more therapy
 Mother take care of me
 Piece me together with a
 Needle and thread
 Wrap me in eiderdown
 Lace from your wedding gown
 Fold me and lay me down
 On your bed
 Or liken me to a shoe
 Blackened and spit-shined through
 Kicking back home to you
 Smiling back home
 Singing back home to you
 Laughing back home to you
 Dragging back home to you

 I was so wary then
 The ugly American
 Thinner than oxygen
 Tough as a whore
 I said you can lie to me
 I own what's inside of me
 And nothing surprises me anymore
 But forests in Germany
 Kids in the Tuileries
 Broken-down fortresses
 In old Italy
 And claiming his victory
 Shrouded in mystery
 He went running away with me

 Back in our home New York
 Walking these streets forlorn
 We all in our uniforms
 Black and black
 Doing that slouch and jive
 The artist must survive
 We've got all we need we cried
 And we don't look back
 Thinking we had it made
 Poised for the hit parade
 Knee deep in accolades
 The conceptual pair
 But ever the malcontent
 He left without incident
 Vanished into thin air

 Now I am always amazed
 Words can fill up a page
 Pages fill up the days
 Between him and me
 But the vows that we never keep
 From bedrooms to business-speak
 Make me remember how cheap
 Words can be
 And the letters I wrote you of
 Were those of the desperate stuff
 Like begging for love in a suicide threat
 But I am too young to die
 Too old for a lullaby
 Too tired for life on the ledge

 But I had a dream last night
 Of lovers who walked the plank
 Out on the edge of time
 Amidst ridicule
 They laughed as they rocked and reeled
 Over the mining fields
 Coming to rest on this ship of fools
 But he just took Polaroids
 Of her smile in the light
 Of the dawn of the menacing sky
 And before they went overboard
 She turned and held up a card
 And it said Valentine",Polaroids,1992
Shawn Colvin,"Here we go again
Another round of blues
Several miles ago
I set down my angels' shoes
On a lost highway
For a better view
Now in my mind's eye
All roads lead to you

So wherever you go
You better take care of me
This time
If you're gonna go
Remember me and all
This time

We had our bitter cheer
And sweet sorrow
We lost a lot today
We'll get it back tomorrow
I hear the sound of wheels
I know the rainbow's end
I see lights in a fat city
I feel love again

So wherever you go
You better take care of me
This time
If you're gonna go, go
Remember me and all
This time

All this time
I been making deals
Shades of black and white
On a Hollywood reel
All this time
I been missing
Something so real, so real
All this time
I been a face in the crowd
Now I'm living in color
And laughing out loud
All these names
For just fooling around
It's a new breakthrough
It's an old breakdown

We smoked a lot of hope
We did our cryin' too
We're finally waking up
To what real love can do
Oh, down a lost highway
Under the twilight moon
A chorus in your eyes
Another round of blues

So wherever you go
You better take care of me

That same sad nature
I wanna cover every inch of you
Like ink on paper
Like the blind parade of souls
Consumed by religion
I can't wait 'til I get you
In that defenseless position

[Chorus:]
When we set the prairie on fire
Oh we go down to the water
Naked and slow
You and me
And the heart of desire
We set the prairie on fire
How hard will the wind blow
How far will it go

When the feeling burns down
To one solitary color
The velocity of longing
Melting into each other
It's a song our fingers play
All at once and together
You can bet we never learned it
But we've known it forever

Oh I dreamed that we were flying
Carried up from the ashes
Black silhouettes of velvet
Against the crimson of passion
We can almost hear the echoes
From the smoldering meadow
It's the rapture of the angels
And the rage of the devil

[Chorus]

In the cool dusk of horses
Through the rusted wires of sleep
With our arms around midnight
We're headed for release
We go riding in the wind
We go riding in the dark
Go riding, riding

In a field with a crutch
Behind his rich southern daddy

Of the feelings I have for him
In my heart

Every thing he does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for him goes on

Do I have to tell the story?
Of the thousand rainy days
Since we first met

Its a big enough umbrella
But its always me 
Who ends up getting wet

Cause every lil thing he does is magic
Every thing he does just turns me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now I know my love for him goes on

I resolve to call him up
A thousand times a day
And ask him if hell marry me
In some old fashioned way

Long before I reached the phone
Long before my tongues tripped me
Must I always be alone

What they were
They are haloed in anger, bitter
And hurt
And it's not so you'd notice but
It's a sinister thing
Like the wheels of ambition at
The christening

So I went out walking on the
Streets of the dead
With a chip on my shoulder
And a voice in my head
It said you have been brought here
Though you don't know what for

Well the mystery train is coming
Right to your door

And I hear you calling, you
Don't have to call so loud
I see you falling and you don't
Have to walk so proud
You can run all night but we
Can take you where
You can cry like an angel

There were high school night dances
When we played stump the band
We were raising each other
In a strange land
There were hard pills to swallow
But we drank 'em all down
Oh the nights were too short then
And now they're a little too long

I hear you calling and you
Don't have to call so loud
I see you falling and you don't
Have to walk so proud
You can run all night but we
Can take you where
You can shout out in anger
You can laugh like a fool
You can cry like an angel

So look homeward baby
Keep your eyes on the sky
They will never forgive you
So don't ask them to try
This is your party, I know
It's not your ideal
May we all find salvation
In professions that heal

I hear you calling, you
Don't have to call so loud
I see you falling and you don't
Have to walk so proud
You can run all night but we
Can take you where
You can shout out an answer
You can laugh like a fool

You can call up to heaven
We'll be listening to you
You can sing hallelujah
You can fly like a bird
You can cry like angel
When there are no words",Cry Like an Angel,1995
Shawn Colvin,"As a little girl I came down to the water
With a little stone in my hand
And it would shimmer and sing
And I knew everything

In a little while I got steeped in authority
Heaven only knows what when wrong
When there is nothing so cruel
Than to bury that jewel when it was mine all along
And I'm gonna find it

You're shining, I can see you
You're smiling, that's enough well
I'm holding onto you, like a diamond in the rough
Like a diamond in the rough

Ever now and then I can see that I am getting somewhere
Where I have to go is so deep
I was angry back then, and you know I still am
I have lost too much sleep and I'm gonna find it

You're shining, I can see you
You're smiling, that's enough well
I'm holding onto you, like a diamond in the rough

In my dreams I go down by the water
With a little girl in my arms and we shimmer and sing
And we know everything

Shawn Colvin,"Baby you leave me in a cold state of mind
Goodbyes are never on time
The blues just keep coming, drying out your eyes
Don't you think I feel it, too?

A cold rain, a slow train
I'm all inside out
Your lights just aren't shining on me
To live it again I would believe a lie
Don't you think I feel it, too?

Oh, in a world of my own
The ground is my home and the lights
Shine only from the sky
Like you, a fool, I am lost in these blues
Don't you think I feel it, too?

Oh, in a world of my own

Don't you think I feel it, too?
",Don't You Think I Feel It Too,1995
Shawn Colvin,"I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls

And from the shelter of my mind
Through the windows of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streaks
To England where my heart lies

My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
And kiss you when you start your day

And the song I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme

And so you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you

And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There before the grace of you go I

We had a live and it went all wrong
I had a dream and you let me down
I wouldn't ask you to take that on
Knowing what I know now
Would I ask a seeing man to go blind
Would I ask a sane man to lose his mind
Could I expect you to come back somehow

As much as you are in my heart
As much as I want you around
I wouldn't ask you to play that part

Lately I could swear I'm thinking
Clearer and clearer
And I've been working hard

My mirror, my mirror
But I daydream in my room
I'm baying at the moon
Ricochet in time to the the music
You just pick a day and I'm in
A new destination

I know too many names and I
Forget them

Would lie
You said they would try and I
Said let them
You just let them
But I kill dreams in the chase
I slap love in the face
Ricochet in time to the music
You just pick a day and I'm in
A new destination
I crawled up from the sewer
For something that was truer
Than I intended
I ended up on my knees

I transcended

 You didn't know how but
 There will always be something to believe in

 Do you believe in a miracle
 Or just the things that you heard
 Do you believe in a lover
 Or just the curve of the world
 Another stab every morning
 To make sense of it all
 Now you can go home
 To nothing at all
 There will always be something to believe in

 There will always be stars in the wind

 There will always be something to believe in",Something to Believe In,1995
Shawn Colvin,"Was it really two summers ago
 Or was it outer space
 We both had nowhere to go
 In search of a state of grace
 All in all we never had time
 When we met each other we stopped on a dime

 Floating nowhere
 Suspended in dreams
 That we were side by side
 We both had to see what it means
 Whenever two worlds collide
 All in all the pieces were scattered
 A world so small that nothing else mattered

 Was it really two light years past
 We left the atmosphere
 We both had to catch our breath
 Somewhere way down here
 All in all and by and by
 The tears for forgiveness
 Will hang out to dry",Stranded,1995
Shawn Colvin,"Some people remember the first time
Some can't forget the last
Some just select what they want to from the past

It's a moon you tried to bring down
On a four-in-the-morning drive through the streets of town

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

It's a photograph taken in Paris, at the end of the honeymoon
In 1948, late in the month of June
Your parents smile for the camera in sienna shades of light
Now you're older than they were then that summer night

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

It's a need you never get used to, so fierce and so confused
It's a loss you never get over the first time you lose

And tonight I am thinking of someone, seventeen years ago
We rode in his daddy's car down the river road

Come on come on, it's getting late now
Come on come on, take my hand
Come on come on, you just have to whisper
Come on come on, I will understand

Reminding me of when we got along 
They're only renting time and space to fill up with their dreams 
And dreams are what they'll have when they have gone 
How could it be that I was born without a clue to carry on 
And still it is the same now I am older 
Armed with just a will and then this love for singing songs 
And minding less and less if I am colder 

But I have this funny ache and it's burning in my chest 
And it spreads just like a fire inside my body 
Is it something God left out in my spirit or my flesh 
Would I be saved if I were brave and had a baby 

It was never clear what would come but that's the risk and that's the test 
And you were the only one so far to follow 
And no one talks about when one might stop and need to rest 
Or how long you sit alone before you stop looking back 
It's like you're waiting for Godot 
And then you pick your sorry ass up off the street and 
Go... 

And what the hell is this? Who made this bloody mess? 
And someone always answers like a martyr 
Is it something you should know, did you never do your best 
Would you be saved if you were brave and just tried harder

I hadn't seen or heard you're name

I'd never imagined before

That the world could be turned on it's head

I'd never have thought

To be here in this place

I'd never have dreamt that in love

I'd be lost and so easily led

I guess I was caught

By that hint of a smile on her face


I thought I was happy

When my life was as easy as pie

But that was the past

Of an ignorant youth

I'm falling in love with the girl

But I'm forced to be living a lie

And she'd never love mew&d

If she knew the truth


Is it asking too much

If I pray for a miracle, miracle

That one day she'll love me

One day she'll say I care


Although he's changing day by day

He finds these tender words of love

Impossible to say

He walks in the room

And I'm never quite sure

If he's trying to be somebody else

I'm liking him better that he's

Not his arrogant self

Perhaps I'm expecting too much

Of a miracle, miracle

One day he'll love mew&d

One day he'll say I love you

And I will love him until I die


Distant Star

Cast your light

On my life


And one by one

I didn't anticipate feeling the power of love

In this way


And day by dayw&d

We've never been closer than this

And I find myself daring to pray


We'll find these tender ways of love

Impossible to disobeyw&d


One day she'll love me


One day he'll say I love you


And I will love her


Until the moment

Our hearts stop beating

And we are light

I wanna know if everyone is dead

You and the Italian woman naked
Your fingers between her legs
She lay like a body in the water
She barely made a sound
She fell as quiet, as quiet, as a leaf falling
To the ground

Fuck off and go away

New York to LA

Girlfriend died in a plane crash

Is so heavy it rips away upon impact
And then you just bleed inside
You don't even feel a thing

Intact among the debris

And the band plays on
And you know you can save no one

[Chorus]
Maybe a message is coming to you
In the middle of nowhere from out of the blue
Then cross the dark distance and lay down your guns
For Rome it has fallen
And morning has begun

In anyone's heartache
And in anyone's blues
Is the beautiful feeling
Of nothing to lose
When you know you can save no one

[Chorus]",Fall of Rome [*],2001
Shawn Colvin,"

I'm gonna let you down

I know that now

Make you cry, I know I will

Why should you believe

I would never leave

Or that I love you still

For all the by and by

Hard as we try

The boughs breaks and the craddle falls

For everything I do

That will tear at you

Let me say I'm sorry now

So you can sing your song

You can get it wrong

You can kiss the rock of ges

The liars and the sages

You can walk awhile

down the mystery mile

You can beat the drums of freedom

And in love and war

Through the rush and roar

You just call 'em like you see 'em


",I'd Say I'm Sorry Now,2001
Shawn Colvin,"There are places I remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain

All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends
I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

Though I know I'll never lose affection

Then your love disappeared
You can't help crying
When you love something so dear
There's a mile of heartache that I had to cross
Face down, longing for the love I lost
I can't help wonderin'
How I ended up here.

So I cried so hard
I was trippin' on my own tears.

What was so confusing
Is now becoming so clear
She tried to tell me
What I never wanted to hear
It don't matter if the sun does shine
It's always clouded know that you're not mine
For one foolish moment
Won't you forgive me dear.

So I cried so hard
I was trippin' on my own tears.

Why you can't that I'm dying?
I'm not a saint, but god I'm trying, trying.

It don't matter
If you're wrong or wright
When you're walking the floor
And you're up all the night
I'll wait for you
If it takes a millions years.

I'd never imagined before

That the world could be turned on it's head

I'd never have thought

To be here in this place

I'd never have dreamt that in love

I'd be lost and so easily led

I guess I was caught

By that hint of a smile on her face


I thought I was happy

When my life was as easy as pie

But that was the past

Of an ignorant youth

I'm falling in love with the girl

But I'm forced to be living a lie

And she'd never love mew&d

If she knew the truth


Is it asking too much

If I pray for a miracle, miracle

That one day she'll love me

One day she'll say I care


Although he's changing day by day

He finds these tender words of love

Impossible to say

He walks in the room

And I'm never quite sure

If he's trying to be somebody else

I'm liking him better that he's

Not his arrogant self

Perhaps I'm expecting too much

Of a miracle, miracle

One day he'll love mew&d

One day he'll say I love you

And I will love him until I die


Distant Star

Cast your light

On my life


And one by one

I didn't anticipate feeling the power of love

In this way


And day by dayw&d

We've never been closer than this

And I find myself daring to pray


We'll find these tender ways of love

Impossible to disobeyw&d


One day she'll love me


One day he'll say I love you


And I will love her


Until the moment

Our hearts stop beating

And we are light

Pick me up and turn me 'round
I come home, I'm born with a weak heart
I guess, I must be having fun

But the less we say about it the better
Let's make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground, head in the clouds
I'm okay, I know nothing's wrong

Hi ho, got plenty of time
Hi ho, you got light in your eyes

And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money always for love
Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight

Home is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home, you lifted up your wings
I guess, this must be the place

Because I can't tell one from another
Did I find you or you find me?
There was a time before we were born
If someone asks this is where I'll be

Hi ho, we drift in and out
Hi ho, sing into my mouth

And of all those kinds of people
You've got a face with a view
And I am just an animal looking for a home
To share the same space for a minute or two

Will you love me until my heart stops?
Will you love me until I'm dead?
You've got eyes that'll light up, eyes that look through
Cover up the blank spot, hit me on the head

Say goodnight
Say goodnight

Makes Dick a dull dull boy, career gets in the way.
Square jaw, ooo, such a handsome face,
Why do you have to save the human race?

Life of crime, no it never pays,
Clean up the streets and make your secret get-away.
All alone, in your room with your radio,
No one to hold you, had to let her go.

Waging a war between good and evil can be a bore.

Take your love on the run,
Oh God, let me be the one.
Ah, ah, ah, man with a gun

All boss and no brains,
Bullies and thugs, they take up all your time in vain.
Can't let go, someone cries and you hear the call,
Who's gonna catch you, don't good guys ever fall?

Shawn Colvin,"My grandmother's house is still there but it isn't the same
A plain wooden cottage, a patch of brown lawn
And a fence that hangs standing and sighing in the Seattle rain

I drive past the strangers and wish they could see what I see
A tangle of summer birds flying in sunlight
A forest of lilies, an orchard of apricot trees

Secret gardens of the heart where the flowers bloom forever
I see you shining through the night in the ice and snow of winter

Great grandfather's house is still there but it isn't the same
The barn is torn down and the fences are gone
The Idaho wind blows the topsoil away every spring

I still see the ghosts of the people I knew long ago
Inside the old kitchen they bend and they sigh
My life passed them up and the world in it's way passed them by

Secret gardens of the heart where the old stay young forever
I see you shining through the night in the ice and snow of winter

But most of all it is me who has changed but I'm still the same
That's me at the weddings, that's me at the graves
Dressed like the people who once looked so grown up and brave

I look in the mirror through the eyes of the child that was me
I see willows bending, the season is spring
Silver blue sailing birds fly with the sun on their wings

Oh, and that music filled my soul

I've been wild since I was young
Takin' my freedom out on the run
Fought the rules, fought the ropes
When I was rolling, when I was broke

Did my drinking, had my fun
Nothing ever got in my way
Did my loving as I pleased
""This is livin',"" I used to say

I am an eagle and I've got to fly
Climbin' against the wind
I am a spirit who will never break
Never have a heart to mend

Oh, oh, I was raised on rock and roll
Oh, and that music filled my soul

Somewhere on that freedom road
Started fighting for my own soul
Thought of Jimmy and Janis, too
Livin' fast til they were through

Then my heart began to break
Fallin' when I wanted to fly
Someone said, ""Gal, slow down
You're too young, too young to die""

Even an eagle has to fall sometimes
Climbing against the wind
Even a strong heart has to break
And learn to love and heal again

All that runnin' got to me
Could I stop and still be free?
Could I break and still be whole?
Would I live to rock and roll?

Got some friends who stood by me
Tellin' me that I would survive
Said, ""You're strong, you sing your song
Know you're lucky to be alive""

Still my spirit yearns to run
Chasing every star in the sky
Wild and free I'll always be

Went for the subway but there was no train

You could spend forever
Makin' a friend in this town
All you get to do
Is lay your dollar down
Until you're stumbling drunk up the stairs again

They don't care who was bought or sold
Or who died to mine it

They buy an ounce of Marseille white

Then somewhere in a crowd
Lookin' that kinda way
That'll make you turn around
There'll be somebody who knows
What it's about
And he'll take the ribbons from your hair again
And welcome you to American Jerusalem

The homeless lie down at the dawn
The pretty people wonder what they're on
And how they afford it

The prophets live their deaths out on the corner

I'm amazed at the price I choose to pay
And to think I ignored what really mattered
Cause I thought the sacrifice would be too great
But when I finally reached the point of giving in
I found the cross was calling even then
And even though it took dying to survive
I've never felt so much alive

For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live
Not I but Christ that lives within me
His Cross will never ask for more than I can give
For its not my strength but His
There's no greater sacrifice
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live

As I hear the Savior call for daily dying
I will bow beneath the weight of Calvary
Let my hands surrender to His piercing purpose
That holds be to the cross but sets me free
I will glory in the power of the cross
The things I thought were gain I count as loss
And with His suffering I identify
And by His resurrection power I am alive

For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live
Not I but Christ that lives within me
His Cross will never ask for more than I can give
For its not my strength but His
There's no greater sacrifice
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live

And I will offer all I have
So that His cross is not in vain
For I found to live is Christ
And to die is truly gain

For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live
Not I but Christ that lives within me
His Cross will never ask for more than I can give
For its not my strength but His
There's no greater sacrifice
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live

At oceans of Your hopes for me, just beyond my reach

A prisoner of my comfort, a slave to my own fear
Doubt is saying got to stay, faith is saying sail away

I know it's safe here on the shore
But freedom is worth dying for
Liberation comes to those
Who hear the truth and sail with You

I'll go where You are calling me
I'll be what You meant me to be
I know the risk is real, but I wanna feel
The freedom of the sea

With eyes to the horizon, mist against my face
I'll leave behind this island in Your abounding grace
With Your word as my compass I'll chase my destiny
For I know the words of Your will can set my spirit free

I'll be what You meant me to be
I know the risk is real, but I wanna feel
The freedom of the sea
The freedom of the sea
The freedom of the sea

",Freedom of the Sea,1998
Shawn Craig,"Once there was a holy place
Evidence of God's embrace
And I can almost see mercy's face
Pressed against the veil

Looking down with longing eyes
Mercy must have realized
That once His blood was sacrificed
Freedom would prevail

And as the sky grew dark
And the earth began to shake
With justice no longer in the way

Mercy came running
Like a prisoner set free
Past all my failures to the point of my need
When the sin that I carried
Was all I could see
And when I could not reach mercy
Mercy came running to me

Once there was a broken heart
Way to human from the start
And all the years left it torn apart
Hopeless and afraid

Walls I never meant to build
Left this prisoner unfulfilled
Freedom called but even still
It seemed so far away

I was bound by the chains
From the wages of my sin
Just when I felt like giving in

Mercy came running
Like a prisoner set free
Past all my failures to the point of my need
When the sin that I carried
Was all I could see
And when I could not reach mercy
Mercy came running to me

Sometimes I still feel so far
So far from where I really should be
He gently calls to my heart
Just to remind me

Mercy came running
Like a prisoner set free
Past all my failures to the point of my need
When the sin that I carried
Was all I could see
And when I could not reach mercy
Mercy came running to me

",Mercy Came Running,1998
Shawn Craig,"This life is the life that I've chosen 
Nobody made me do it 
Feels right, givin' all my devotion 
Take it from a man who's had a taste of both sides 
There's no sweeter freedom than a godly life 
I just want to testify

[Chorus]
This is the life 
I'm where I want to be 
Livin' from the center of a heart that's free 
Oh, I'm feelin' alright 
Day or night, rain or shine 
This is the life 

You think it's a dull life I'm livin' 
Yeah, you say it's such a pity 
So weak, to need a crutch of religion 
Pardon me a minute but I think I need to say 
I don't need your sympathy so don't be talkin' that way 
You will see the light some day

[Chorus]

Now I'm not sayin' that I never had a bad day 
But since I've been livin' for Jesus

Shawn Craig,"Almighty God, The Great I Am,
Immovable Rock, Omnipotent, Powerful,
Awesome Lord.
Victorious Warrior, Commanding King of Kings,
Mighty Conqueror and the only time,
The only time I ever saw him run,
Was when

He ran to me,
He took me in His arms,
Held my head to His chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""
Lifted my face,
Wiped the tears from my eyes,
With forgiveness in His voice He said
""Son, do you know I still love You?""

He caught me By surprise, When God ran

The day I left home,
I knew I'd broken His heart.
And I wondered then, if things could ever be the same.
Then one night,
I remembered His love for me.
And down that dusty road, ahead I could see,
It was the only time,
It was the only time I ever saw Him run.
And then

He ran to me,
He took me in His arms,
Held my head to His chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""
Lifted my face,
Wiped the tears from my eyes,
With forgiveness in His voice He said
""Son, do you know I still love You?""

He caught me by surprise.
And He brought me to my knees.
When God ran, I saw Him run to me.

I was so ashamed, all alone, and so far away.
But now I know, that He's been waiting for this day
I saw Him run to me,
He took me in His arms,
Held my head to his chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""
Lifted my face,
Wiped the tears from my eyes,
With forgiveness in His voice
I felt his love for me again.
He ran to me,
He took me in His arms,
Held my head to his chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""
Lifted my face,
Wiped the tears from my eyes,
With forgiveness in His voice
He said ""Son""
He called me Son.
He said ""Son, do you know I still love You?""

Miss the way you, close your eyes when you feel it
Say my name and tell me what you been missin'!

It's the young whipper snapper, quick to slap the ass of a dame.
In the club and I ain't even ask you your name
By the bar 'n I ain't gotta ask for the change
Buckle up Ma, I'm comin down fast in your lane.
(??) in the Benzo.
No spokes on the motorcycle bike ma like some Lorenzos.
See somethin' nice in the window
I throw the car down like a football spike in the end zone
Depends on if your friends gone
Mami, I'm the one with the jims and the peanut butter timbs
Just ask me when, and I ain't frontin'
We can stunt like Jet Li and Jackie Chan
And I ain't screamin I need space
I gotta brace myself, You drive me crazy like a high speed chase
Me and Shawn got practice, yeeea

Swear to god, I never thought it would end up this way.
Always figured you'd be back some day.
But it's over and I know that
It's All because of mistakes that I've made.
And I'm going crazy for trying to deal with all of this pain.
But played it off like everything's okay.
But the truth is that it isn't, so
And what I'm tryna say, I hope it's not to late for us.

I know I hurt you a thousand times, (a thousand times)
But I want you back and that's the bottom line. (the bottom line)
Without you here I think I'm gonna die.
I'm down on my knees look what you've done to me.

Baby I can't sleep,
Cause I'm lost with out you, can't stop thinking about you.
And it's killin me,
Girl I know I was wrong but I can't make it alone.
Baby I can't sleep,
I'm a mess without you, can't stop thinking about you.
And it's killing me,
Tell me what I gotta do I'm tired of missing you.

[Verse 2]
When I'm alone I feel these walls closing in on me.
Sometimes it's even hard to breathe. 
And it's different without you, 
I miss everything about you, girl won't you come home.
Don't know what I was thinking when you said ""I'm leaving"",
Then I told you to go, and you walked right out the door.
Now I'm starting from zero I'm losing my ego.
Girl, I'm swallowing my pride, I wanna make it right.

Baby I can't sleep, 
Cause I'm lost with out you, can't stop thinking about you.
And it's killin me,
Girl I know I was wrong but I can't make it alone.

Shawn Desman,"I guess I fell in love too quick
Kinda got burned up by a red head chick
So I ain't tryin' go that route again

I was rolling through a stop sign
Lookin' at a red light when I seen her ass walk by
That's when I found my new friend

And she had blonde hair, bright blue eyes
Looking like a flower child
Top down, music loud
Jamming to her favorite song

I'm down, she was down
So we really hit it off
And I know she could never do
Do to me what them red heads do

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head
'Cause every time I go there
I see them red head girls just ain't no good

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head
'Cause every time I go there
I see them red head girls just ain't no good

Got a girl whose a real knock out
Got me all turned out but I still have doubts
Why she gonna get her hair done again?
(She's gonna get her hair done again)

She did something kinda strange the other day
I was looking at a picture of her family
She came and snatched it away, it away

And I don't know why she would hide it
But I let it go
And there are certain things about her
That I still don't know

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head
'Cause every time I go there
I see them red head girls just ain't no good

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head
'Cause every time I go there
I see them red head girls just ain't no good

My girl walked in today
But there was something strange
I still recognized her face
But something else had changed

She had bright red hair
I just stopped and stared
Walked by me like she didn't care
That hair was always there

See I know I'ma be okay
I got rid of Miss Red today
Tryna cover up behind my back
But I knew that red would come right back

See I know I'ma be okay
I got rid of Miss Red today
Tryna cover up behind my back
But I knew that red would come right back

I'm scared that girl's a red head
I'm scared that girl's a red head

And went to his papa to ask his advice
His papa said son, I have to say no

In front of the picture show
Every night at half past ten
Madeleine, she loves that so

I'm waiting for Madeleine
We'll go down and eat at Joe's
French fries are from who knows when
But Madeleine, she loves them so

Madelein's my Christmas tree
She's America to me
I know that she's too good for me
That's what her mother always says

I'm waiting for Madeleine
We'll go to the picture show
I'll tell her that I love her then
Madeleine, she loves that so

She is much more than pretty
She is all that you know
She is my whole life to me
I love my Madeleine so

So, I'm waiting for Madeleine
But I'm getting soaked and wet
I've been soaked since half past ten
Madeleine is not here yet

I'm waiting for Madeleine
Joe is closed by now I'll bet
No French fries from who knows when
Madeleine is not here yet

Madeleine's my shining sea
She's America to me
I know that she's too good for me
That's what her father always says

I'm waiting for Madeleine
I've still got the picture show
I'll tell her that I love her then
Madeleine, she'll love that so

She is much more than pretty
She is all that you know
She is my whole life to me
I love my Madeleine so

So I waited for Madeleine
I only have myself to blame
I went and caught a cold again
And Madeleine, she never came

I waited for Madeleine
All I did was call her name
A thousand times since half past ten
Madeleine, she never came

Madeleine's my ''Tis of Thee'
She's America to me
It's true that she's too good for me
That's what her brother always says

I waited for Madeleine
It's always been the same
Waiting here since who knows when
Madeleine, she never came

She is much more than pretty
She is all that you know
She is my whole life to me
I love my Madeleine so

So I'm gonna wait for Madeleine
In front of the picture show
Tomorrow night at half past ten
Madeleine, she'll love that so

I'm gonna wait for Madeleine
We'll go down and eat a Joe's
French fries are from who knows when
But Madeleine, she loves them so

Madeleine's my Christmas tree
She's America to me
So what if she's too good for me
Her mother, yeah

I'm gonna wait for Madeleine
We'll go to the picture show
I'll tell her that I love her then
Madeleine, she'll love that so

Shawn Elliott,"The old folks don't talk much
And they talk so slowly when they do
They are rich, they are poor, their illusions are gone
They share one heart for two

Their homes all smell of thyme, of old photographs
And an old-fashioned song
Though you may live in town, you live so far away
When you've lived too long

And have they laughed too much, do their dry voices crack
Talking of times gone by
And have they cried too much, a tear or two
Still always seems to cloud the eye

They tremble as they watch the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks dream no more
The books have gone to sleep, the piano's out of tune
The little cat is dead and no more do they sing
On a Sunday afternoon

The old folks move no more, their world's become too small
Their bodies feel like lead
They might look out the window or else sit in a chair
Or else they stay in bed

And if they still go out, arm in arm, arm in arm
In the morning's chill
It's to have a good cry, to say their last good-bye
To one who's older still

And then they go home to the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks never die
They just put down their heads and go to sleep one day
They hold each other's hand like children in the dark
But one will get lost anyway

And the other will remain just sitting in that room
Which makes no sound
It doesn't matter now, the song has died away
And echoes all around

You'll see them when they walk through the sun-filled park
Where children run and play
It hurts too much to smile, it hurts too much but life goes on
For still another day

As they try to escape the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old, old silver clock that's hanging on the wall
That waits for us
All

Shawn Elliott,"We find love, you and I
It's a new game to play
Then we tell our first lie
And see our love go away

And we find, we're alone

We rush on, you and I
We don't need love at all
We need thrills, we need speed
Then we stumble and fall

And we find, we're alone

We're loyal, you and I
To flowers that are dead
We forget how to cry
We save photos instead

And we find, we're alone

We hear guns, you and I
We ask what is that
Then we open the Times
We're informed where it's at

And we find, we're alone

We're moral, you and I
We stand for what's right
We slaughter all evil
By dawn's early light

And we find, we're alone

We're lucky, you and I
We're alive and secure
But in the bank and the church
We can never feel sure

And we find, we're alone

We've made it, you and I
We have glory and fame
Yet we never know why
We feel so ashamed

And we find, we're alone

We have power, you and I
But what good is that now
We would build a new world
If we only knew how

And we find, we're alone

We are old, you and I
We beg warmth from the sun
In the dreams that we dream
We ask what have we done

And we find, we're alone

Shawn Elliott,"On Sundays the bulls get so bored
When they're asked to show off for us
There is the sun, the sand, and the arena
There are the bulls ready to bleed for us

It's time when grocery clerks
Become Don Juan
And all the ugly girls
Turn into swans

Who can say what he's found
That bull who turns and paws the ground
And suddenly he sees himself all nude
Who can say what he dreams
That bull who hears the silent screams
From the open mouths of multitudes

On Sundays the bulls get so bored
When they're asked to suffer for us
There are the picadors and the mobs revenge
There are the toreros and the mob's revenge,
there are the toreros - and the mob kneels for us

It's time when grocery clerks
become Garcia-Lorca
And the girls put the roses in their teeth
Like Carmen

On Sundays the bulls get so bored
When they're asked to drop dead for us
The sword will plunge down
And the mob will drool
The blood will poor down
And turn the sand to mud

It's time when grocery clerks
Become Nero
And the girls scream
And shout the name of their hero

And when finally they fell
Did the bulls dream of a hell
Where men and worn out matadors
Still burn
And perhaps with their last breath
Would they pardon us their death

Shawn Elliott,"In Trinidad there was a family
With much confusion as you will see
It was a mama and a papa, and a boy who was grown
Who wanted to marry and have a wife of his own

He found a young girl, that suited him nice
And went to his papa to ask his advice
His papa said son, I have to say no
This girl is your sister but your mama don't know

Woe, is me, shame and scandal in the family
Woe, is me, shame and scandal in the family

A week went by and the summer came 'round
And soon the best cook in the island he found
He went to his papa to name the date
But papa shook his head and to him he said
You can't marry this girl, I have to say no
This girl is your sister but your mama don't know

Woe, is me, shame and scandal in the family
Woe, is me, shame and scandal in the family

And told his mama what his papa had said

Shawn H.,"Man, on a normal occasion
I'd tell you to roll something up
Po some'ing up, but I ain't feeling that way
Everytime I turn around, another funeral
Another away man, how much can we take feel this

I'm riding one deep with my gun, naw I ain't having fun
Wondering how to break the news, to my partna lil' son
His daddy probably the saw the angels, death he couldn't stop it
But God, why'd you have to take my dog Todd Prophet
Already lost Mello, now who gon be next
Think I'm feeling safe fake ass rappers, having plex
Who you playing with, don't take your life for granted
So many good people, seem to be the victims on the planet
Can't understand it, now which religion talking noise
Them Catholic priests, be touching on lil' boys
Can't trust your homeboys, you drop em off at home
He call his partna on the phone, they done broke in your home
Now what's wrong, said the Lord people dying too often
With no health or no insurance, can't afford no coffin
So today no flossing, another wake at eight o'clock
Jam Master Jay wasn't a gangsta, but he still got shot what's up

My partna use to be a baller but
(Now he's gone, ah-oh)
And all I can tell his son, is
(Try to hold on, ah-oh)
Yeah she use to be a star, but
(Now she's gone, ah-oooh)
Hey mama, they thought your son wouldn't make it but
(I stayed strong, ah-oooh)

Now lil' Tamika up the street, wanted a baller real bad
Only 16, but already giving up the ass
You got cash you could smash, you don't have to ask
She needed money for clothes, so she stayed skipping class
Catch her flipping in a Jag, or flipping in the Lex
Laughing at the nerdy chicks, who believed in safe sex
She had one baby, had twins then another
Now didn't slow at 18, all living with her mother
Steady bouncing out of town, rent-a-cars with crack
Missing her kids birthday, what kind of mother is that
The ass started getting flat, without using Metabolife
Whole neighborhood wondering, if Tamika on the pipe
Strip clubs late at night, with bags under her eyes
Had the flu for three months, feeling like she bout to die
Boyfriends disappeared, and so did the queen
HIV in her bloodstream, girl died ay 19 damn

Now Lord I know, I'm in the valley of death
And can't no man predict, how many days he got left
Use to run the street, with some devilish ass demons
High on dust not giving a fuck, smoking wet steady scheming
Had to change my ways, and go another route
Now I use the studio, to let my pain out
No more chasing dreams, gotta make it on my own
Can't be waiting on the next man, gotta get my hustle on
Now in case you ain't know this, playboy I'm focused
Only got one chance, no way in hell I can blow this
Turn my last five dollas, into a quarter million
But money can't change, the fucking pain that I'm feeling
From Chris, Paul to Tremain, who else gon go
They even killed Romeo, from the Steve Harvey show
Said I'd be dead in a year, that was two years ago
Thank the Lord I'm still here, hope I live to see mo' let's roll

Now he's gone-gone, (now he's gone)
But I'ma hold on, (try to hold on)
Oh she's gone, (now she's gone)
But I'ma stay strong, (I stayed strong)
Now you gone-gone, (now he's gone)
But I-but I-will hold on, (try to hold on)
Whoooh mama gone, (now she's gone)
But I will stay strong, (I stayed strong)
Ooooh my partna's gone, (now he's gone)

Pried scrolls and read excerpts.
He spoke in foreign phonetics
And read runes from ancient relics,
Stirred ointments with potions, and
Functions with doses.
He whisked it until smoke rose and
Seeped into her nose!

The illness had relinquished.
The doctor had fixed it,
The cleansing accomplished.
Their love was free to flourish.
But before it could sink in,
The front door was kicked in!
Standing in its place was Pallis!
Driven by malice, he had barged in 
To challenge Adakias!
To prove their love!

We can both sneak out the back door
We don't have to say goodbye
'Cause, it's alright, it's alright
I wanna make you mine
Are you guys ready to scream it out

Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
If this is what it's like falling in love
Then I don't ever wanna grow up
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
It'd be cool if it's the two of us
But I don't ever wanna grow up

'Cause I got it all, sing it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And I got it all
And I don't ever wanna grow up

Said, your place is kinda close
And your 'Rents are out of town
Baby, there's no pressure
But if you're down, I'm down
'Cause, it's alright, it's alright
To just talk tonight

If you're feeling kinda crazy
Turn down the lights
We can take our time
Do whatever you like
It's alright, it's alright
I wanna make you mine

Alright guys, let's hear this, sing it as loud as you can, here we go
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
If this is what it's like falling in love
Then I don't ever wanna grow up
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Maybe I'm just a kid in love
Oh, baby
It'd be cool if it's the two of us
But I don't ever wanna grow up, sing it

'Cause I got it all
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And I got it all
But I don't ever wanna grow up

Shawn Mendes,"She would not show that she was afraid
But being and feeling alone was too much to face
Though everyone said that she was so strong
What they didn't know is that she could barely carry on

But she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way, sing with me

Sometimes it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

She would always tell herself she could do this
She would use no help, it would be just fine
But when it got hard she would lose her focus
So take my hand and we'll be alright

And she knew that she would be okay, scream it out
So she didn't let it get in her way, sing it with me

Sometimes it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

A little too much, I said a little too much, oh

Sometimes it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much, yeah

Sometimes it all gets a little too much, sing it
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much, it all gets a little too much",A Little Too Much [Live] [Live],2015
Shawn Mendes,"When I wake up to your footsteps
As you get up out of bed
They make a sound that sounds so simple
But dances in my head
A melody so perfect
That it gets me through the day
And the thought of us forever
Is one that won't ever go away

All I need to know is
Where to stop
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

So let's hold on together
To this paper and this pen
And write down every letter
To every word we've ever said

All I need to know is
Where to stop
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

Let's write our story
And let's sing our song
Let's hang our pictures on the wall
All these precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all

Memories after all
Memories after all, and oh

You gave me hope
But I've got to let go
I've got to let go
Oh
It's deep in my soul
Deep in my soul
Now I've got to let go
We wrote our story
And we sang our songs
We hung our pictures on the wall

Now those precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are all the memories after all",Memories,2015
Shawn Mendes,"Weeks on end, I'm on the road
I start to lose my sense of home
I should've called so many times
But I, I just sat next to my phone

Just know it takes it for me
To end this darling, oh

And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
Woah, and maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go

Woah, woah
Woah woah
Thinking back to every night
That we just laid there for a while
And when I looked into your eyes
I, I never thought I'd say goodbye

Just know it takes it for me
To end this darling, oh, yeah

And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
Woah, and maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go

Just needed time to, to find my own
But I promise someone will give you all you want
Can give you all you need
And you just gotta see
I never meant to hurt you, no

And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
Woah, and maybe I will never feel

Shawn Mendes,"Met this girl when I was three years old
We were holding hands tight so I'm told
And it felt like an eternity
Said it felt like an eternity
'Cause I knew back then we were more than friends
Two sided story it all depends
And I'll say it once, and I'll say it again
It'll only end up hurting me

Years flew by I was less than twelve
Long division I need your help
Can you come on over and work with me
Anytime you like I'll make it work for me
'Cause I knew back when if we get too close
When the time is right maybe I'll propose
Baby climb on up, show me the ropes, sing it

Darling I want all the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
'Cause baby I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever
I won't let a moment pass
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings, all the strings attached

All the strings attached girl
All the strings attached girl, oh

So come on girl let me hold your hand
Let's go get lost, live without a plan
And I know you've got the world to see
But you know you mean the world to me
And I know right now you got second thoughts
Do whatever it takes, pay whatever the cost yeah

You know me, not the type of guy
To stick around, to do the time
But you must have me hypnotized
I'm d-d-d-down to be by your side, yeah
Every night, yeah

And darling I want all the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
'Cause baby I want all the strings attached
It's like always and forever
I won't let a moment pass
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings

All the strings and when you fall down
I fall too
And if you get lost, then I'll get lost with you
And when the waves crash down
I promise I won't move
'Cause I need

All the strings attached
I love it when you look at me like that
And you're the only girl that brings me back
Baby I want all the strings attached, sing it out
It's like always and forever
I won't let a moment pass (beautiful)
And when I'm with you I feel better
I want all the strings

I'll keep you safe
I'll keep you sound

Right now it's pretty crazy
And I don't know how to stop
Or slow it down

Hey
I know there are some things we need to talk about
And I can't stay
