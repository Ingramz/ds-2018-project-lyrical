Karmen Michael & The Godselettes Choir,"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me 
And then
Spin me around 'till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me 
And I knew for sure 
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk
Another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love 
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother 
Would disagree
To get my way I would run 
From her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
yeah yeah
Then finally make me do 
Just what my mama said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he 
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step 
One final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
Cause I'd love love love to 
Dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how mama would cry for him
I'd pray for her even more than me
I'd pray for her even more than me

I know I'm praying for much to much
But could you send her 
The only man she loved
I know you don't do it usually
But Dear Lord
She's dying to dance with my father again

Every night I fall asleep
And this is all I ever dream",Dance with My Father,2006
Karmin,"This is more than a typical kinda thing
Felt the jones in my bones when you were touching me, oh oh
Didn't want to take it slow
In a daze, going crazed, I can barely think
You're replaying in my brain, find it hard to sleep, oh oh
Waiting for my phone to blow

Now I'm here in a sticky situation
Got a little trouble, yep and now I'm pacin'
Five minutes, ten minutes, now it's been an hour
Don't wanna think too hard, but I'm sour

Oh oh, I can't seem to let you go

See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right
Honest baby I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio

What's the time, such a crime
Not a single word, sipping on that Patron
Just to calm my nerves, oh oh
Poppin' bottles by the phone
Oh yeah
Had me up, had me down, turn me inside out
That's enough, hold me up
Maybe I'm in doubt, oh oh
Now don't even think you know, no no

See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right
Honest baby I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio

Anything you wanna do, I'll be on it too
Everything you say, it's like a gold with a view
Business on the front, party in the back
Maybe I was wrong, was the outfit really wack
This kinda thing doesn't happen usually
I'm on the opposite side of it, truthfully
I know you want it so come and get it, cheerio

See I've been waiting all day
For you to call me baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Oh oh oh oh
Honest baby I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheeri, cheeri, cheerio

When you gonna call
Don't leave me broken hearted
I've been waiting up
Let's finish what we started, oh oh
I can't seem to let you go
Come on, that's right, cheerio, uh!",Brokenhearted,

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat, call me Al Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You don't want start Weezy, 'cause the F is for Finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a World without enigma?
Two chicas at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the man twisted 'cause he open when you twist him
Never met the guy, but I treat him like I missed him
Life is the witch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, what an awkward family picture
You know father time, we all know mother nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buying, I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, forget segregation
Screw that foo', my money up, you jiggas just Honey Nut
Young Money running this and you jiggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'm a keep on doing this stuff
Lil Tunechi or Young Tunafish

Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

Okay, I'm goin' back in
Okay, yo stop playin, I do it like a king do
If these jiggas animals, then I'm a have a mink soon
Telling peoples I say, ""put my name on the wall""
I speak the truth but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't see the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothing, you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money

Paper chasing, tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Yo, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Man of my dreams- I don't sleep, already found ya
You jiggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on a bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishing well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my butt, call it kiss and tell

Yeah word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, yo, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you jiggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you jiggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the floor like Luda
Yo, I flow like scuba, yo, I'm bald like Cuba
And I keep it killer dough, I'm a blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stacking, now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
Jiggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, yo, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these jiggas out they mind
I told these stupid jiggas, so many times
That to get them bucks to be on my mind
Suck these, I tuck these on my mind, pause
Too on my grind, did I get a little love?
Yeah bit by God
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, 'cause ain't no peace on my side, oh
I'm a girl, I visit bathroom lines abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shooting when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a GX jigga, ya heard?
Gunna gunna yeah

Karmin,"Ain't no way for me to love you,
If you won't let me, no
I know that a woman's duty is to help and love a man
And that's the way it was planned

Oh, ain't no way (ain't no way)
It ain't no way (ain't no way)
Just ain't no way, baby (ain't no way)
Ain't no way baby (ain't no way)
It ain't no way for me to love you

Karmin,"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting throught the wind
Wanting to start again

Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in

Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six feet under scream
But no one seems to hear a thing

Do you know that there's still a chance for you
Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the 4th of July

Cause baby you're a firework
Come on show 'em what your worth
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh!""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh!""
You're gonna leave 'em fallin' down-own-own

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow

Maybe you're reason why all the doors are closed
So you can open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow
And when it's time, you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

Cause baby you're a firework
Come on show 'em what your worth
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh!""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh!""
You're gonna leave 'em fallin' down-own-own

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

Cause baby you're a firework
Come on show 'em what your worth
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh!""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make 'em go ""Oh, oh, oh!""
You're gonna leave 'em goin ""Oh, oh, oh!""

Karmin,"Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Should have known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, 
Why were they open?

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked 'cause 
What you don't understand is I'd catch a grenade for ya (yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (yeah, yeah) 

Oh oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya baby
But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no
Black, black, black and blue, 
Beat me 'til I'm numb, 
Tell the devil I said 'hey' when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman
That's just what you are, 
Yeah you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did

Karmin,"I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it
When I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day
It's just so grey and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
They don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
You and me were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight me when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do 'cause

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled, cause I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, but you're supposed to be my mentor
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
It was you, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'
You don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white girl, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up now I'm dyin', I need you, come back for heaven's sake

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor

And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name

I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better

'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name

I set fire to the rain

Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name

I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died

The last time

Karmin,"It's written on our palms, and
It's written on our hearts
It's written in our songs, and
It's written in the stars
Sometimes all we can do
Is stand up tall
When they're standing in line
Just to watch us fall

Whoa
We can't forget, these are the days
Whoa, don't be afraid
We can't forget, these are the days

Well, we got each other, and that's all we need
From here on out it's just you and me
Two hometown hearts up against the world
That don't stand a chance against this boy and girl
We faced 'em down, fought bigger fights
And I know, babe, we're gonna be alright

[Chorus]

Well, it feels like we're living from pay check to check
And we wake up wondering what might happen next
Yeah, sometimes it feels like we won't make it through
But the hard times pass
Like the good ones do
Baby, wrap your fingers and
Hold on tight
I'll be right here beside you tonight
Baby, climb up here
Watch the city glow
Let's make a wish on the fireworks below
We're making moments that we won't forget
And feeling ones that haven't happened yet

Don't be afraid

I've seen your ways
Show yourself
Better than what you make believe

All I hear
Is the sound of sleep
Deafening
Comfort in the arms of sweet dreams

Now, this won't take long
We'll rise up again
And rewrite these wrongs

I won't do it
I've rushed you
Patiently
Guarding the life that you deceived

I've crawled for you
Or so they say
We rise to it
Fall again into the same dream

You won't have to wait long
They'll show up again
Make way for the fall

Wake up
There's blood in your sweat when you wake up
Cower, bloodsucking liar
Who you gonna call when you wake up?

See now
What you gonna see when you wake up?
Beg, you little fucking liar
Your head on this chopping board

If this is entertaining
I hope you enjoy the view

Wide awake
And still asleep
I'm failing this riddle in my head, I
I'm failing to get it
Can you say?
Honestly?
Wide awake
And still asleep

Don't leave this too long
(It won't take long)
Tomorrow will come
(Hang around)
You won't have to wait long

It's your day in the sun

They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again

Please wake up!!
Please wake up!!

Quem casou, separou, quem chorou, se vendeu

Faz de conta que nem viu 'cê vai ver
Se a vingança é um prato que se come frio
Isso é mole o desprezo é um prato podre
Que se engole

A vida é assim muitos vão te julgar, mas no fim
Eles querem seu lugar e o objetivo é negativo
É destrutivo, eles estão vivos por um único motivo
É porque tudo o que eles querem é mais like

Mais like, mais like, mais like
Vão falar de você
Vão tentar te dizer como deve viver
Mas ae, eu sei que tudo o que eles querem é

Mais like, mais like, mais like, mais like
Vão falar de você, vão tentar te dizer como deve viver
Mas ae, eu sei que tudo o que eles querem é mais like

Oh mano, dá um gato mano
Dá um gato pra esses vagabundo, mano
Que assim ele cuida das sete vidas do gato e esquece da minha
Pelo amor de deus, faz essa, mano
Deixa nóis em paz

Salgo en la noche en busca de caserío
Porque lo que a mí lo que me gusta es el party, party
Y los latinos estamos locos pa' eso

Con par de pesos en la cartera
Y buscando el hombre que me mueva más sexy esa cadera
Pero lo más importante, lo quiero sin una nena

Tan chula, colombiana su figura
Cuando yo me siento enfermo, tus besitos me curan

Que tú para provocarme te pones traje
Prendemos un habano pa' que te relaje
D.J., sube la música, el volumen no lo baje

Que lo que bailo con ella
Sus pasitos me gustan, sus movimientos hacen que me luzcan
Sabe lo que quiero y me pide ella que la acalore
Nos queremos pero sin amores

Que me haga la mirada matadora pa' escaparnos
Que quiera que yo me lo lleve en el carro

Quién quita que esta noche de tanto calor nos desnudamos
Ven y dime si tú quieres (eh, eh)

Quiere que lo hagamos en la discoteca
Traiganle un vaso de whisky
Que apenas bailando este disco peta

Salgo con mis amigas bien clean en fire
Huelo bien, visto bien, estamos claras
La envidia por la calle dispara
Pero no importa solo vestimos gucci
Ya no compramos es Zara
Soy la mala que a todas opaca
Y por eso me tachan
La vida me ha obligado a ser así
Ese no fue el destino que yo elegí
He amado he sufrido
Mil problemas también he tenido
Es que a pesar de todo yo sonrió
Por que de lo malo ya yo me rió

Tiene su expediente
Aunque tu no seas soltero
No son diez, ni veinte
Esta puesta para el ticket entero

The next time you see me comin', you better run""
Well, Abe said, ""Where d'you want this killin' done?""

Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose
Welfare department, they wouldn't give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard, ""Where can I go?""
Howard said, ""There's only one place I know""
Sam said, ""Tell me quick, man, I got to run""
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
And said, ""That way, down Highway 61""

Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
""I got forty red-white-and-blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?""
And Louie the King said, ""Let me think for a minute, son""
Then he said, ""Yes, I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61""

Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right
""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white""
He said, ""Come here and step into the light""
He said, ""Hmm, you're right, let me tell the second mother this has been done""
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61

Now, the roving gambler he was very bored
Trying to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said, ""I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes, I think it can be very easily done
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61""",Highway 61 Revisited,2007

I watch them bloom for me and you

The bright blessed day and the dark sacred night

Do you want war or peace?

That this world can still be saved

She said that someday soon

And I will never let a day go by
Without remembering the reasons why
She makes me certain

Had a Porkie Pig hat on
A bright star
In a dark age
When the bandstands had a thousand ways
Of refusing a black man admission

In those days they put him in an
Underdog position

And some saw red
And drove them from their hotel bed

It's short of the hope we have for happiness

Embracing out in the lunatic New York night
It's very unlikely we'll be driven out of town
Or be hung in a tree
That's unlikely!

Are happy and loud
Children are up dancing in the streets
In the sticky middle of the night

Of taxi horns and fun arcades
Where right or wrong
Under neon

And a circus
Dangerous clowns
Balancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions
They have been handed

Generations on down

On the music midnight makes
To Charlie's bass and Lester's saxophone
In taxi horns and brakes
Now Charlie's down in Mexico

Here,making each day of the year
Changing my life with wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there.
There,running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there.
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to meet her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there.
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to meet her everywhere

Here with you so close to me
Till the final flicker of life's ember

Nothing stays the same
Everyone will change

Except the rain comes from the clouds
The sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

Winter turns to spring
A wounded heart will heal
But never much too soon
Yes, everything will change

Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me,

Bump into things like someone in love.

I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1997

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

I lived all my life this way, hah
For example, take yesterday

I breeze home happy bringin' her my pay
Her note read, so long savvy, I haven't gone away!
An' I threw myself down across our empty bed
An' this is what I said

Oh shit Oh Oh Oh
What? Oh what are you gonna do with me?
Oh wow uh
But I was cool!

So I ""one for the roaded"" at a all night bar
I wound up so loaded, I tore up my car

An' when I read, the sentence there, I said

Ow! Please ow ow, please I got to know, I got to know
What? what went wrong?
I don't underst' I oh a,
But I was cool!

So I said she's the only one, that I have to pay
And I found her an' pulled my gun, an' fired point blank
The shot whistled right past that woman's head
An' I killed my hound dog, dead!

Karrin Allyson,"Tristeza nao tem fim Felicidade, sim...
A felicidade é como a pluma 
Que o vento vai levando peloar
Voa tao leve Mas tem a vida breve       
Precisa que haja vento sem parar...

A felicidade do pobre parece 
A grande ilusao do carnaval, 
A gente trabalha o ano inteiro
Por um momento de sonho 
Pra fazer a fantasia
 
de rei, ou de pirata, ou jardineira 
E tudo se acabar na quarta feira
Tristeza nao tem fim Felicidade, sim...
A felicidade é como a gota de orvalho 
Numa pétala de  flor
Brilha tranqüila Depois de leve oscila     
E cai como uma lágrima de amor
A minha felicidade está sonhando 
Nos olhos da minha namorada
E como esta noite 
Passando, passando 
Em busca da madrugada 
Falem baixo por favor
Pra que ela acorde alegre como o dia   
Oferecendo beijos de amor 
Tristeza nao tem fim

Er will eur Heiland selber sein

Luftmatratzen im Swimmingpool
Ein Sprung auf Papas Liegestuhl
Ja, die Kleinen werden die Größten sein
Wenn der Sommer kommt

Sommerzeit, Sommerzeit
Und auf einmal ist es soweit
Sommerzeit, Sommerzeit
Und wir träumen noch, wenn es wieder schneit

Oma badet im Titisee
Opa lüftet sein Toupet
Und er kriegt nachts mal wieder kein Auge zu
Wenn der Sommer kommt (Wenn der Sommer kommt)

Heiße Hits aus dem Radio
Breakdance Fieber und JoJo
Alles, nur nicht zur Schule gehen

Denn zum Glück wird mancher ein fauler Hund

Da, wo Mädchen sind, ist Wüste, alles lahm, gar nichts los

Wenn Mädchen rappen, seh ich rot

Für diese richtig dünnen Worte hast du richtig fett geübt

Karsten Vogel,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Every time your name was brought up
I would act all nonchalant infront of an audience
Like if you was just another shorty I put the naughty on
But uh, truth be told you do me for a loop, this hov
I'm too old to be frontin when I'm feeling denzel
And you acting like you ain't appealing when you are
Stunting like you ain't my only girl when you are (i was just frontin')
I'm ready to stop when you are

You have the best for texture feel
And to kim, karyn, nicole or ce'cile
Now for my love for you in time will reveal
Mi a go make you wear a ring like shaquille o' neal
Keep it real with me and I'll keep it real, you know

Don't be fooled by my glitter and my fame girl
Cause it's you that I really wanna share my name, yeah, my name
Yo, hey, a lot of girls come and go with the hype up
To me you mean more than just one night, yo, one night

I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin (you know I want ya babe)
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya (you should stop frontin babe)

Kartet,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",Y,2007

All my niggaz all my bitches
Get high get drunk get wild buck fool
You know my style get crunk
Bitches bounce niggaz bounce
Let me give you that funk shit blunt shit
While I make you bang it out your trunk

[Verse 1 - DMX]
You cats, talk slick but walk quick when the dog hit
The dog hits coming back to the raw shit
Aww shit they done let me back out the gate
Back out to tape back out to rape
Back off the chains so please back out the way
Before I blow ya back out with this fuckin AK
Don't give a fuck what a nigga say no matter who he sound like
Make sure you know what the rain is but its gonna be coming down like
Cats and dogs hold up it is cats and dogs
Keep fucking with the dog its gonna be cats in the morgue
Twenty- two million sold lets keep it real
Most y'all killers ain't even twenty- two years old
Ain't never felt the cold wet behind the ears
Know what real pain is cried real tears
I go hard bogard and stand my ground
Fuck y'all niggaz it's how its goin down baby

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Jadakiss]
It just don't look right
Bullshit coke don't cook right
The judge ain't throwin the book right
Should thank the lord that you blew up softy
Don't talk greasy you grew up off me
I ain't letting go of the block
And if I get a good enough grip I ain't lettin go of the lock
If I happen to pinched I ain't goin to shock
I'm gonna to get aquatinted with niggaz in general pop
Stop but don't hate 'cause everybody got a lil blood to donate
Thugs'll go ape the women'll come around
Shortly after that is when the jealousy sets in then they'll shut it down
It's just raspy nothin on the neck wrist ware just classy
No way I'm letting this money just get past me
When all I had to do in the first place from the beginning was get nasty

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Kartoon]
Niggaz been waitin' for that west coast shit I tell them to go fish
Blowin purple in a purple Laker jersey wit the gold kicks
Bitches be like Toon you a mutha fuckin trip
Hop in the whip and lean til that mutha fucka flip
And every club in Cali crackin' its gangsta town
Keep a couple of niggaz with me that'll bang you down
Now lil mama put switches on and make it jump
Before me you needed Lil Jon to make it crunk
Naw for real come to Cali player take ya pump
My New York niggaz leave y'all wit razor bumps
Now pappa raised a rolling stone I feel like pops
In the absence of Makaveli I feel like Pac
Even though I got the deal I still might pop
Right in front of the po-po you could feel my shots
Man all my niggaz carry bangers we feel like SWAT
And that's the reason why Rialto feel like Watts

But all this fighting left me weak
If I could defend
But the ink runs from my pen

I'd beg you not to go away
We should be here together
Though we are somewhere near the edge
I'm begging you don't go away
We should be getting better
Though we are somewhere near the edge

I'd leave the past without a trace

Replace the words disguised as mine

I'm begging you don't go away
We should be getting better

Love is not loving without you

This is something that I feel
The tight squeeze and the cracking cold steel
And I can't stop it - my heart
Must be breaking

Karyn Malone,"I was up all night
dreaming of you
Pretty valentine
Bleeding again from the sole of her shoes
Cause she's got to carry the weight of the truth

Would you take it easy on me
Would you take it easy on me
Would you like to see me crawling
Would it do any good
Good would do if it could

I was up all night drinking of you
We got into a fight
Love always drains the life out of me
But I can't complain
I'm in the deep freeze

Would you take it easy on me
Would you make it easy on me
Would you like to see me crawling
Would it do any good
Good would do if it could
Through the grace of your heart

I'd be alright through the grace of your heart
Sleep through the night through the grace of your heart
Keep me in line through the grace of your heart
Keep me alive through the grace of your heart

I got up alright
Breakfast for two
Pieces of hate all over the room
Your love is a light that leads to my soul
That's melting the wall,
That's drowning me, so

Would you take it easy on me
Could you make it easy on me
Would you like to see me crawling
Would it do any good
Good would do if it could
Through the grace of your heart
The grace of your heart

I'd be alright through the grace of your heart
Sleep through the night through the grace of your heart
Swallow my pride through the grace of your heart
Buried alive through the grace of your heart
Love has no pride
Love has no pride

I feel blue, as blue as a bird on fire

I feel stupid like anything I got to say's not worth it
I feel lonely and mute, but I'm not blind and I'm not perfect
and I've got to let it happen
I've got to let it happen
I've got to let it happen now

Let it out

Will my doggy dog me out?

Why does my man wanna roam all over
Burying bones on every corner
Better keep him on the leash
Teach him how to be sweet
I am just walkin' the dog

Better keep him on the leash

He's a Rover gettin' over
Don't say a thing 'cause it's good I told ya
Never when you teach a old dog new tricks
He's too slick, get out quick

No runnin' out chasin' the cat
I'm walkin' him, walkin' the dog
No runnin' out chasin' the cat
I'm walkin' the dog, he's my dog

If he gives me what I want and need
He's my doggy dog indeed

Karyn White,"Early in the morning I put breakfast at your table
And make sure that your coffee has its sugar and cream
Your eggs are over easy, your toast done lightly
All that's missing is your morning kiss
That use to greet me

Now you say the juice is sour
It used to be so sweet
And I can't help but to wonder
If you're talking 'bout me

We don't talk the way we used to talk
It's hurting so deep
I've got my pride
I will not cry
But it's making me weak

I'm not your Superwoman
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down
And think that everything's okay
Boy, I am only human
This girl needs more than occasional hugs
As a token of love from you to me

Oh, baby

I fought my way through the rush hour
Trying to make it home just for you
I want to make sure that your dinner will be waiting for you
But when you get there you just tell me
You're not hungry at all
You said you'd rather read the paper
And you don't want to talk

You'd like to think I'm just crazy
When I say that you've changed
I'm convinced I know the problem
You don't love me the same
You're just going through the motions
And you're not being fair
I've got my pride
I will not cry
Still I can't help but care

I'm not your Superwoman
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down

As a token of love from you to me

Oh baby, look into the corners of your mind
I'll always be there for you
Through good and bad times
But I can't be that Superwoman that you want me to be
I'll give my love, oh lasting love
If you'll return love to me

I'm not your Superwoman
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down
And think that everything's okay

And you understand me
Stop right where you are
Everybody sing along with me

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm the kind of girl that can treat you so sweet

Summer dresses pass

Keep them in their corners

We can start and turn off everything
It's all the same, don't say I'll laugh again

Save me
Oh, come on and save me
From this world
Tell me
'Cause I need to know
I'm not alone

We are taught to watch the puppets
Not the hands controlling
Do you think if we pull out the rug
The world would stop revolving?

'Cause I need to know

We are going nowhere fast
Are we made of glass?
No one knows, no one knows

A wise man told me that we are born with wings
But never taught to fly
Doesn't that make you wonder why
Is it to prevent us from falling out of the sky
Or is it to stop us from soaring too high
So let me ask you this
Are you running around in a circle, going nowhere fast?
'Cause when you look at the man in the mirror
He's made of nothing but glass
You're never aware that mountains don't move themselves
Tectonic plates make them shift
That all it took was a staff to part the Red Sea
All it took was a bus to Montgomery
A single woman who refused to give up her seat
We fought an entire army with a bouquet of flowers back in the '70's
But now you're taught to remain without will until you run out of energy
Afraid that if you strive for an ideal you end up like a Kennedy
It's like being on a treadmill every day but never losing any weight
'Cause to see success the food before you digest has to change
We're stressed and high, get depressed and die
But still afraid to question why
One of the biggest criminals I ever met wore a suit and tie
When did we stop believing? When did we stop marching?
When did we stop chanting?",Glass,2014

We lost a few good men on the way
Started out as quite a crowd

Under streetlights such a mad ride
Running from our friends to kiss you in the alleyways by the riptide
There was only us in our world
And the music it never died, never died, never died",Wasted,2017

The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

Though we exist and breathe some believe currency comes to G's 
Stresses after battle with success comes greed (echo) 
They got me hot When they shot me 
Plotted my revenge 
To increase my ends 
Enemies gettin' dropped 
Win or lose 
Red or blue 
We must all stay true 
Play the game nigga 
Never let the game play you 
And for the fame 
Niggas change fast 
That's a shame 
What's the game 
Lost souls 
Who controls our brain? 
Who can I blame? 
The world seems strange at times 
Somewhat insane 
I'm hoping we can change with time 
I'm living blinded 
Searching for refinement 
Curse, I know death follows me 
But I murder him first 
And worse yet 
With each breathe 
Steps I take 
Breathless 
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish? 
Cigar ashes 
Coaster 
Crystal glasses 
We mash on them jealous bastards 
With a ski mask 
I'm the first one to warn them 
Blast it 
Wrapped in plastic 
Bullshitting got his ass hit (outlaws) 
Ain't nothing left now 
Treated like a stepchild 
Was not for me 
Nothing but busters and bitches (fuck 'em all) 
Be rocking beats 
Fake in fame 

Block run and shoot slugs 
We throw them back like hardballs 
Without the gloves 
No love for these fake desperados 
And thugs I bleed to envy 
Smoke and blow out they blunts 
Sipping Henney 
Drunk nights 
And hot days 
Cocking my heat shooting it sideways 
A wife on the run 
Full of common blunts 
Unconditionally married 
To my gun 
Fulfillin' my destiny 
On knees 
And ones desires 
Be pulling all my cabbage like priors

Mother fuck flossing the chain  
All the blame 
Belongs to the part of the brain (
That we never use nigga 
Plus my heart is in pain 
And if I ever lose homey 
Bet I'm at it again 
Outlaws don't die 
So united we stand 
And if family come before 
All the fortune and fame 
 
As I walk up in the crib 
Laid to rest my head 
Say some rhymes to angels 
Hope they bless my bed 
Hope they bless me the righteous way 
Got a homie locked down 
Outta town 
I sent him a kite today 
Man that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it dog 
Praying for my downfall and I can sense it dog 
I was passed down the street fame 
Like glock clocked and keep aim 
Was raised up with a clock box 
And I ran with the local street gang 
They say the light is faded 
But still shine in the dark 
You can easy been a man 
But you is a boy in your heart 
And that's some game that I got 
From generation of game 
In the road of life dog 
We need to switch up lanes 
Think about it 

One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

I can't complain 
I've seen my fair share of the fame 
It won't change me 
Now I've got this piece of change 
I feel strange I got so used to the hood 
That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good 
I was just a baby still retarded from slavery 
When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me 
Ghetto ain't made me I made myself 
Poverty raised me thinking ain't no help 
I pray for my health my mind and my family too 
State of myself my grind and my family crew 
Where one hand watches the other 
No we ain't blood 
But we still real brothers 
The struggle is real 
Nothing can steal 
What we build 
And that remains the same 
'Till that day we killed 
And that's real 
Life that I was aimed to be 
Love by my family tree 
That's fame to me 
How about it 

One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game

Kasbro,"Now of course I want peace on the streets, but realistically
Paintin' perfect pictures ain't never worked, my misery
Was so deep, couldn't sleep through all my pressures
In my quest for cash I learned fast, usin' violent measures
Memories of adolescent years, there was unity
But after puberty we brought war to our community
So many bodies droppin', it's gotta stop, I wanna help
But still I'm steppin', keep my weapon, must protect myself
The promise of a better tomorrow ain't never reached me
Plus my teachers was too petrified in class to teach me
Sippin' Thunderbird and grape Kool-Aid, callin' Earl
Since my stomach was empty, it seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my lil' homies lose, they childhoods to guns
Nobody cries no more 'cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace, if you can't grant it
Niggas fightin 'cross the whole planet, so it could never be peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
'Cause there could never be peace

Somebody owes me, will they control me? Not
I ain't a hater player but I want all you got
Y'all babies had babies now we fightin' each other
My dawgs got rabies, they bitin' each other
And it ain't hard to find a friend like mine
Bigfully is a bullet and he don't mind dyin'
And I gotta be blind, missed sign after sign
Time after time, after time, after time
And I don't like nobody, they don't like me more
And I'm good with that finally but it heard it before
Dawg, we livin' in a prison, losin' our religion
On Thanksgiving, we thankful, just for livin' in hell
Damn, homey, I don't mean to be harsh
But there's a devil in the ghetto tryin' to tear it apart
And if we make it up out, we still stuck in the dark
Will there ever be peace? Just a piece of my heart, never

The only peace, we got, is the peace of our heart
Peace of our mind, or that damn piece
That we hold in our waistline
You feel me, dawg? C'mon, uh

So will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace, never
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
'Cause there'll never be peace

Thangs is changin', nigga you better read the signs
I'm only concerned about me and mine in these times
The world is a ghetto and peace is not a part of it
We all believe God's new plan to make it out of this
Niggas spendin' too much time hatin' on each other
Niggas buyin' guns, loadin' 'em up, aimin' at each other
And the victim is you and me, it's sick but it's true indeed
The good die, mostly over bullshit, repeatedly
Deep in me, there's a part that wants nothin' but love
But the rest of me know, war is what's waitin' for us
So I stays ready, keep my pay heavy and boss up
Stack my funds and my guns, never rely on luck
Asking God to point out the impostor
Never let no weapon formed against me prosper
'Cause there'll never be peace, so don't rely on it
Soldiers dyin' for it and in the ghetto
They cryin' for it, but fuck peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Fool, there'll never be peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Nigga, there'll never be peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walks the streets
Nigga, there'll never be peace
Will there ever be peace?

Shit, fuck peace
On the strength 'til my niggas get a piece, we can't have peace
How the fuck we gon' live happy when we ain't got nuttin'?
You muh'fuckers are smilin' but I'm mean muggin'
Why, 'cause I gotta be thuggin'

It seems drugs done turned this whole motherfuckin' hood out
All us niggas actin' up, wild-ass, motherfuckin' adolescents
These niggas ain't even got no childhoods no more
How the fuck can you have a childhood?
And you at the funeral every muh'fuckin' weekend?
Pssh, and you muh'fuckers talkin' about peace
Nigga, it ain't no motherfuckin' peace
You ain't seen the news motherfucker? You ain't heard?
Lil' babies gettin' smoked, muh'fuckers killin' they whole family
Lil' kids gettin' thrown off buildings, muh'fuckers gettin' abused
Peace? Nigga is you out your fuckin' mind?
Fuck peace, we can't never have peace
'Til you motherfuckers clean up this mess you made
Till you fuckin' clean up the dirt you dropped
'Til we get s piece, fuck peace, Westside",Never B Peace [Nitty Remix],2002
Kasbro,"There you go, 
Acting like a hoe

I don't know why I'll be fucking with you

Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin' to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit
Tryin' to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
'cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin' me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin', what am I tryin' for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin' to get in my P's
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggas
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin'

So how I look, gettin' hooked, like I ain't got G?
Truly cutie booty big, but that ain't enough
And the head make me beg, still that just ain't enough
When I don't trust her, the bitch be lyin' too much
When she be dyin' to fuck me you be buyin' her stuff, hoe

See girlfriend I know, your whole M.M.'s preoccupied with mostly
Gettin' clown after clown, town coast to coast, see
I been tryin' to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump yo' aim, straight through them spandex, don't front
Just name, spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game
I keep flowin' like H20 it ain't Outhin' for me to say
Why you keep actin' like a hoe? but there you go

And you know I'm on the road for like weeks at a time

All this bullshit is irkin' me girl, but there you go

I blame it on yo' momma, she need to holla at you
But should I blame it on yo' daddy for all the things that you do

Kasbro,"Hell yeah
And ugh

I started out dumb sprung off a hood rat
Listening to the radio wishing that I could rap
But nothing changed I was stuck in the game
'Cause everybody in the industry was fucking me man
Listen I've got a scheme break away do my own thing
Drop some conversation sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas they want to see me rise
'97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
And if I catch another case ], lord knows how they hate me
Got a playa in the court room please don't let them frame me
I've been dealt a lot of bad cards living as a thug
Count my blessings don't stress in this land with no love
Maybe if they see me rolling look at all this green I'm holding
I guess that's why the envious get their eye swollen
Hoping the heavenly father love a hustler
Be the hardest nigga on earth to ever bust a nut
My homies tell me have a heart fuck they feelings
I've been trying to make a million since we started
We cold hearted, niggas in masks that'll blast at the task force
Empty out my clip time to mash they asked for it

Kase & Mystic of The Lost Tribe,"[Chorus]
I'll be yo' thug for life, my love will drive you crazy
You know nobody ain't gone (fuck) you like you need baby
Let's slip and slide together and go get this cheese baby
Hold me close and always be yo' thug for life
Keep it tight and always be yo' thug for life
Speak the truth and always be yo' thug for life
Break the bread and always be yo' thug for life

No, no, can't nobody get deep in the stomach like I do
And on top of that get 'cha high to
A nigga know that you liable
Jumping out a Chevy on sky blue
Lot a nigga try to
Getting ready to kick it for me
To picky for me
Nigga's to sticky for me, stickin' with me
You got some nerve, you must think you pot superb
Nigga first tried to hide it, you shot the bird
K-Dog without a mouth full of filthy shit
Mouthing off nigga you would have been killed me bitch
Don't do shit but want a hundred dollar hair do
Come here, something I want to tell you, what

Don't, don't I have a heavy Levi that a slide in dunk,
Never find in the trunk
Where the weed at in the spot with the lump
I can't help but want to rub on them thighs and the hump
Shot her down in the zone, my love got 'cha high and it's on
I want leave ya' down alone or crying on the phone
Cause if ya' fed up then grab the chrome
Burning ya' home
I can't take it no mo' tell me what turns you on
Quick to yo' home, (???) (???)  baby hold me tight

[Chorus]

Really will ya' roll with a thug
A young nigga in a big car, with a big gun,
Ridin' round sittin' on dubs
Smoking on a fat blunt, baby was up
I heard you was lost in love and I don't see ya' much
But I know you done lost ya' touch
Ever need a paper stake
Ever want to get away just call me up
Yeah, hit me on my 984-4040
Yeap, you know the rest
You know right where to go,
Right where to come when you want the best
And I'm on this thug shit
Making money and drug shit
And I ain't with that bullshit
Cause got damn it I love this

You and me baby can get a little close and stop before your heat baby
Let me drop dem' draws and give you some of this weed baby
I really love the way you touch and suck on me baby
And the way you look when you run up in that three eighty
But do them haters they acting real shady
Broke or rich you still gone be with me baby
Break a nigga off bread when I need some cheese baby
Tell them niggaz I'm gone be yo' thug for life, my love will drive you crazy
You know nobody ain't gone (fuck) you like you need baby

Jump on the top wit a drop that nigga down in the dirt
The first nigga quick to get it first
Call the paramedics 'cause the police be stealing from the herse

I aim it at ya hat when I burst
If I don't get a grammy I'm headed at the rat niggas first
And I'm back full of perk strap on the curb
Slap that bitch on the third

Nigga done caught wit a slurr
Can't see shit but a blurr

Your camera looks through me with it's X-ray visions

Winds up locked in the circuity

No way to control it, it's totally automatic

My legs too weak to stand
I go from sadness to exhilaration
Like a robot at your command

Up and down goes my temperature
I summon doctors to get some relief
But they tell me there is no cure, they tell me

With a ball an' a chain behind him

Run Joey , Joey run run the hounds are on your trail

He's also got a blackjack, he's mad
He'd bust your head with one wack,
Here I go now.

When she heard of Joey's jail break
But she knew all the while 'cause
She sent him a file
Baked inside a fudge cake.

I didn't ask for a name, I knew it was you
In your bulletproof grin and your false eyelashes
You took a handful of blood and you painted the sidewalk blue
And they said, they said
You were out there raising the dead
But it looks like you covered up most of your tracks
They're sure they'll find
Something you left behind
But I know you a little better than that
You don't look back

I remember all the rules that you taught me
You said, ""step right boy, this city's just a game""
And ""stick to the sidestreets, you'll never get caught
But you left me on the boulevard, cold and screaming out your name
And you said, you said
The sky was spitting out red
But I just saw a couple shades of black
You moved like smoke
Left me holding your coat
And I know, wherever you're at
You don't look back

I heard your hair's a different color
That don't change how you look in the back of my mind
The older I get, the more I discover
You stare into the dark long enough
Something's bound to shine
And I said, I said
You left me for dead

I'm not as pretty as I was
I've kicked myself at times because I've lied
So I will have to learn to stand my ground

I'll move on over to your town and hide

And you be the captain
And I'll be no one
And you can carry me away if you want to
And you can lay low
Just like your father 
And if I tread upon your feet you just say so

Searched here for my second wind
Is there somewhere here to let me in I asked
So I slammed the doors they slammed at me
I found the place I'm meant to be
I figured out my destiny at last

So it's just a little harder for me to play the part of
Watching you walk away

So before you disappear again
Just think of what you're feeling and Don't Go
There's more to what you're telling me
I'm not buying what you're selling me Don't Go

Don't you understand that I'm stranded
In a feeling I can't shake
Don't you realize that I'm frightened
Of all the things you're gonna take
And now you seem so distant so much
More resistant
To ever let the feeling show
So it's hard for me to face it
Even less replace it
Everything you're letting go

Too tired to do just what I should
And last night I asked if I could
Take comfort in the rosewood
The road said nothing at all 

Well cos it don't talk back unless the wind blows hard
I drive it all night with the wheel of my car
It won't leave me running for the door
And if the paints still wet I can just slow down
And it all goes away on the other side of town
And nothing is that easy anymore 

Well the hurt won't leave with the sight of white line
But it eases up my pain for a while
The only habit that I keep
And miles take time but the time is mine
And always moving suits me fine

I'm not half what I'd hope that I'd become

I'd have you back I wouldn't lose you again 
But I learnt the hard way
I can't have it back what I had then
Yes I learnt the hard way

With a feeling of alone
Wondering if your ever coming home

You could pass right through it in twenty seconds flat
But the south was like the whole world to me
Wasn't easy to stay but it was harder to leave

Yeah I was a south bound child
Yeah I had a small town life
But I turned out all right in the North
Living that Southern kind of life

Old friends and Bibles filled the house
No room for money and no money anyhow
Deprived was something we always heard
But to me and my brother it was just another word

I used to think the north was the end
Cos people go there and
They don't come back again
But my father's father was a man of the sea
He lived the southern kind of life two blocks
Away from me

Should I stay and pretend that I'm happy

Are not mine

Couldn't put me back together again

You didn't see me from
The sidewalk the south side of town

Kasey Chambers,"Late on a Friday my husband went up to the mountains with three friends
They took provisions and bottles of bourbon to last them all through the weekend
One hundred miles they drove just to fish in a stream
And there's so much water so close to home

When they arrived it was cold and dark; so they set up their camp quickly
Warmed up with whisky they walked to the river where the water flowed past starkly
In the moonlight they saw the body of a young girl floating face down
And there's so much water so close to home

When he hold me now I'm pretending
I feel like I'm frozen inside
And behind my eyes, my daily disguise
Everything's turning to white

It was too hard to tell how long she'd been dead, the river was that close to freezing
But one thing for sure, the girl hadn't died very well to judge from the bruising
They stood there above her all thinking the same thoughts at the same time
There's so much water so close to home

They carried her downstream from their fishing; between two rocks they gently wedged her
After all they'd come so far, it was late
And the girl would keep; she was going nowhere
They stayed up there fishing for two days

They reported it on Sunday when they came back down
There's so much water so close to home
When he holds me now I'm pretending
I feel like I'm frozen inside

And behind my eyes, my daily disguise
Everything's turning to white
The newspapers said that the girl had been strangled to death and also molested
On the day of the funeral the radio reported that a young man had been arrested

I went to the service a stranger; I drove past the lake out of town
There's so much water so close to home

When that sun beats down
Will you stay
Will you turn around
And fly away
Like a bluebird tail wing
It sounds just like the angel singing
Am I ever gonna see you again
Bluebird with a brand new wing

When that sun beats down
Will you stay
Will you turn around
And fly away
Like a bluebird tail wing
It sounds just like the angel singing
Am I ever gonna see you again
Bluebird with a brand new wing
Like a bluebird tail wing
It sounds just like the angel singing
Am I ever gonna see you again
Bluebird with a brand new wing
Bluebird with a brand new wing
Bluebird with a brand new wing",Bluebird,2004
Kasey Chambers,"In the year of sixty two the land received a soul
A baby cried, a mother smiles,
A hero made of gold
A heart like a burning flame
Beats like an old steam train
Bound to an other by chain
Silver lining

As the boy because a man
The child inside remained
High on life with wide eyes open
A smile that could dry up the rain
A name that would now ring true
Like a sun on a sky of blue
The khaki legend grew
Ten feet tall

With heart in heard
You bridge horizons
You paint the wild
Mother nature rises
You walk alone
But I will follow you home

If the earth could mold
A man underneath the perfect sky
Like a diamond from the ground
An image of you would rise
Bearing a will of steel
Roll like an iron wheel
Teaching the world to feel 
Heart and soul",Follow You Home,2004
Kasey Chambers,"Wouldn't you think that 
I'd have it all figured out by now
That I'd know exactly what I'm doing
Wouldn't you think that I'd have a key
To open every melody and sing
Like it is all here at my feet
Wouldn't you think that 
I'd have a life hanging on my wall
So I could prove that I'm alive
But these are just things I've been given
For a plastic way of living
And I'm not sure if that really is my style

The second hand it rolls on by
It never looks back to wait for mine

And if I fall any harder this time
If I dig any deeper Lord what will I find
Well you can buy my life on radio
And order me by mail
But not everything about me is for sale
No not everything about me is for sale

Wouldn't you think that
I'd have the strength to carry anything
And I could buy myself
A brand new set of hands
But sometimes like the others
I just ran away take cover
And I swear that no one really understands

The second hand it rolls on by
It never looks back to wait for mine 

And if I fall any harder this time
If I dig any deeper Lord what will I find
Well you can buy my life on radio
And order me by mail
But not everything about me is for sale
No not everything about me is for sale

Wouldn't you think that 
I'd have it all figured out by now",For Sale,2004
Kasey Chambers,"Wrong way down a wrong way track
Cold run down the length of my back
Whip my heart with a mighty crack
You gave me the closest thing 
To a heart attack

My body shivers my body it shakes
You rock the house with the 
Love that you make
I'm growing weak with 
This intangible ache
But baby keep it coming
For goodness sake

Wash me down with the dirty water
Open the door baby let me come in
If it's a crime to let you under my skin
Lock me up cause I'm as guilty as sin

You got no style you ain't
Heart of romance
I'm like a food for even 
Taking a chance
You got me flying 
By the seat of my pants

But come on baby, I wanna dance",Guilty as Sin,2004
Kasey Chambers,"If I was in a movie
I would hold my head up high
And if I was in a movie
I would never be this shy
I would shout out loud and be so proud
Of what I have to say
And if I was in a movie
I would never let you get away

If I was in a movie
I would stand the test of time
If I was in a movie
I would get away with crime
I would run so fast
And always last the distance of the day
And if I was in a movie
I would never let you get away

[Chorus]
This is not Hollywood
There is no camera in my room
This is not Hollywood
The flowers grow before they bloom
Well you can hide away when you walk in dusky light of night
This is not Hollywood
This is my life

If I was in a movie
I would never be this sad
If I was in a movie
I would have more than I have
I would show the world I'm just a girl
Who has so much to say
And if I was in a movie
I would never have let you get away

[Chorus]

Yeah this is not Hollywood, this is my life",Hollywood,2004
Kasey Chambers,"Sometimes you walk like an angel
Sometimes you walk like a man
Sometimes you crawl like a baby
Makes me forget who I am
Have you ever been held before
Like honey to the bee
I've never been held before
Like you hold me

[Chorus]
You make me feel like a river
Like a water overflow
Wanna shout it out from the Mountain
Wanna sing it on the radio
I'll sell my soul like a sinner
If it means you'll never go

I think the sun is finally rising
Its burning down because I miss you
I'm gonna walk right through the fires
Cause all I wanna do is kiss you
Rain falls, won't wash this away
I'll build a stonewall to make you stay

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Never go
Never go",Like a River,2004
