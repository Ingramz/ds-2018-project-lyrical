Billy Bragg,"I was born at half past twelve, almost one in the morning 
I was born at half past one, almost two in the morning 
Now my birthday comes again and I don't know how old I am 
Half past one or two or three, almost four in the morning 

I was born at half past four, almost five in the morning 
I was born at half past six, almost seven in the morning 
How old am I, you ask of me? One year younger than I used to be 
Half past seven, half past eight, half past nine in the morning 

I was born at half past nine, almost ten in the morning 
I was born at half past ten, almost 'leven in the morning 
Today my age is tweedle and twee, I'm prettier than I used to be 
Half past 'leven, half past 'leven, almost twelve in the morning",I Was Born,2000
Billy Bragg,"Joe DiMaggio's done it again
Joe DiMaggio's done it again
Clackin' that bat, gone with the wind
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

Some folks thought Big Joe was done
Some just figured Joe was gone
Steps to the platter with a great big grin
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

I'm gonna tell you just the way I feel
Man can't run without his heel
Watch that raggy pill split the wind
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

All three fielders jumped their best
Trying to climb that high board fence
They all growed whiskers on their chins
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

Up along the clouds where the eagles roam
Joe cracked that ball to whine and moan
His buddies all laugh as they trot on in
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

Grandma's home by the radio
On the television watching Joe
She jerks the beard off of Grandpa's chin
Joe DiMaggio's done it again

The puppy dog barked at the pussycat
How does it look from where you sat?
Looks like a cyclone slidin' in
Joe DiMaggio's done it again",Joe DiMaggio Done It Again,2000
Billy Bragg,"If the folks next door to me weren't so good 
I'd do all the mean things anybody could 
I'd drink and I'd gamble and I'd louse around 
I'd be the meanest man in this whole town 

If I hadn't seen the light in that old lady's eyes 
I'd try to be a man you would hate and despise 
I'd rave and I'd rant and I'd scream and yell 
And I'd chase my neighbors from here to hell 

If I hadn't heard those kids laugh playing games 
I'd have nervous fits, I'd go insane 
I'd turpentine cats and tin can dogs 
I'd smother people to death inside of hollow logs 

If the people around me wasn't so nice 
I'd freeze my heart into a cake of ice 
Steal money from soldiers and working folks too 
I'd lend you a dollar and take back two 

If my wife didn't kiss me the way she does 
I'd carry four or five daggers and three or four guns 
I'd shoot craps and ramble and hang out late 
I'd steal baby buggies and Cadillac Eights 

If my friends didn't write me those letters I get 
I'd be a dictator, the worse one yet 
I'd be the only smart bird, you'd all be fools 
Send you all away to war and I'd stay home and rule 

If it wasn't for them songs I hear you all sing 
I'd put a crown on my dome and I'd say I'm your king 
I'd kidnap some and blackmail others 
I'd peddle black market stuff and rob sisters and brothers 

If it weren't for your talking I hear on the street 
I'd be the orneriest man that you ever did meet 
I'd preach the gospel of hate and I'd drink your blood 
But I can't be this bad because my folks are too good 
No I can't be this bad because my folks are too good",Meanest Man,2000
Billy Bragg,"My flying saucer, where can you be 
Since that sad night that you sailed away from me? 
My flying saucer, I pray this night 
You will sail back before the day gets bright 

My flying saucer, fly back for home 
You will get lost in the universe alone 
My flying saucer, end all my fears 
Sail back tonight, love and kiss away my tears 

My flying saucer, I pray this night 
You will sail back before the day gets bright 

You will sail back before the day gets bright",My Flying Saucer,2000
Billy Bragg,"Do you still sing of the mountain bed we made of limbs and leaves? 
Do you still sigh there near the sky where the holly berry bleeds? 
You laughed as I covered you over with leaves 
Face, breast, hips, and thighs 
You smiled when I said the leaves were just the color of your eyes 

Rosin smells and turpentine smells from eucalyptus and pine 
Bitter tastes of twigs we chewed where tangled wood vines twine 
Trees held us in on all four sides so thick we could not see 
I could not see any wrong in you, and you saw none in me 

Your arm was brown against the ground, your cheeks part of the sky 
Your fingers played with grassy moss, as limber you did lie 
Your stomach moved beneath your shirt and your knees were in the air 
Your feet played games with mountain roots as you lay thinking there 

Below us the trees grew clumps of trees, raised families of trees, and they 
As proud as we tossed their heads in the wind and flung good seeds away 
The sun was hot and the sun was bright down in the valley below 
Where people starved and hungry for life so empty come and go 

There in the shade and hid from the sun we freed our minds and learned 
Our greatest reason for being here, our bodies moved and burned 
There on our mountain bed of leaves we learned life's reason why 
The people laugh and love and dream, they fight, they hate to die 

The smell of your hair I know is still there, if most of our leaves are blown 
Our words still ring in the brush and the trees where singing seeds are sown 
Your shape and form is dim but plain, there on our mountain bed 
I see my life was brightest where you laughed and laid your head

I learned the reason why man must work and how to dream big dreams 
To conquer time and space and fight the rivers and the seas 
I stand here filled with my emptiness now and look at city and land 
And I know why farms and cities are built by hot, warm, nervous hands 

I crossed many states just to stand here now, my face all hot with tears 
I crossed city, and valley, desert, and stream, to bring my body here 
My history and future blaze bright in me and all my joy and pain 
Go through my head on our mountain bed where I smell your hair again. 

All this day long I linger here and on in through the night 
My greed's, desires, my cravings, hopes, my dreams inside me fight
My loneliness healed, my emptiness filled, I walk above all pain 
Back to the breast of my woman and child to scatter my seeds again",Remember the Mountain Bed,2000
Billy Bragg,"Who can guess the secret of the sea?
Who can guess the secret of the sea?
If you can guess the secret of my love for you
We can both know the secret of the sea
Tell me could you ever tell the secret of the sea?
Of these high rolling waves along the shore?
The footprints of the lovers that come here to love
By the tides washed away forever more
Who can guess the secret of the sea?
Who can guess the secret of the sea?
If you can guess the secret of my love for you
We can both know the secret of the sea
You claim to know the secret of a kiss and a hug
And the secret of grass and of the trees
And if you can tell the secret of a warm friends hand
Then we all would feel the secrets of the sea
Who can guess the secret of the sea?
Who can guess the secret of the sea?
If you can guess the secret of my love for you
We can both know the secret of the sea",Secret of the Sea,2000
Billy Bragg,"I done spent my last three cents
Mailing my letter to the president
I didn't make a show, I didn't make a dent
So I'm swinging over to this independent gent
Stetson Kennedy
Writing his name in
I cain't win out to save my soul
Long as smathers-dupont's got me in the hole
Them war profit boys are squawking and balking
That's what's got me out here walking and talking
Knocking on doors and windows
Wake up and run down election morning
And scribble in stetson Kennedy
I ain't the world's best writer nor the world's best speller
But when I believe in something I'm the loudest yeller
If we fix it so's you can't make money on war
We'll all forget what we're killing folks for
We'll find us a peace job equal and free
Dump smathers-dupont in a salty sea
Well, this makes stetson kennedy the man for me
Words: woody guthrie (1950) - music: billy bragg (1997)",Stetson Kennedy,2000
Billy Bragg,"They were strolling in the gloaming
Where the roses were in bloom
A soldier and his sweetheart brave and true
And their hearts were filled with sorrow
For their thoughts were of tomorrow
As she pinned a rose upon his coat of blue

Do not ask me love to linger
When you know not what to say
For duty calls your sweetheart's name again
And your heart need not be sighing
If I be among the dying
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again

When the roses bloom again
Beside the river
And the mockingbird has sung his sweet refrain
In the days of auld lang syne
I'll be with you sweetheart mine
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again

Mid the rattle of the battle
Came a whisper soft and low
A soldier who had fallen in the fray
I am dying, I am dying
And I know I'll have to go
But I want to tell you
Before I pass away

There's a far and distant river
Where the roses are in bloom
A sweetheart who is waiting there for me
And it's there I pray you take me
I've been faithful, don't forsake me
I'll be with her when the roses bloom again",When the Roses Bloom Again,2002
Billy Bragg,"At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me at the dark end of the street
You and me

I know time is gonna take its toll
We have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
But our love keeps coming on strong
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street
You and me

They're gonna find us, oh, they'll find us
They're gonna find us, they're gonna find us
Ooh, some day
You and me at the dark end of the street
You and me

And when the daylight hour rolls around
And by chance we're both downtown
If we should meet, just walk on by
Ooh darling, please don't you cry
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street
You and me",At the Dark End of the Street,2002
Billy Bragg,"Monday and the afternoon is bearing down on me
I'm watching the clock and the clock is watching me
Don't have to be cool but you know I am
Don't have to be here but you know that

I'm a hard worker but I ain't working on a Monday
I'm a hard worker but I ain't working on a Monday
A hard working fellow but I ain't working on a Monday
St. Monday's still the weekend to me

Two dozen inquiries are on hold for me
My shift supervisor is staring hard at me
Nobody can say what the matter is
I'm trying to recharge my batteries

I'm a hard worker but I ain't working on a Monday
I'm a hard worker but I ain't working on a Monday
A hard working fellow but I ain't working on a Monday
St. Monday's still the weekend to me 

Somewhere out on the road, I just wanna be free
I don't wanna do as I'm told
Don't wanna work 4, 5, 6 days and turnaround
Want to get high on life but first I got to get me back home

Nobody can say what the matter is
I'm trying to recharge my batteries",St. Monday,2002
Billy Bragg,"I've always been impressed with a girl
Who can sing for her supper and get breakfast as well
That's the way I am, heaven help me
He said, 'We don't like peace campaigners 'round here'
As he nailed another one to the wall
And that's what gets me in trouble, heaven help me

Goodbye and good luck to all the rubbish that
You've spoken
Goodbye and good luck to all the promises
You've broken
Your life has lost its dignity, its beauty, and its passion,
You're an accident waiting to happen

There you are standing at the bar
And you're giving me grief about the D-D-R
And that chip on your shoulder gets bigger as you
Get older
One of these nights you're gonna get caught, 
It'll give you a pregnant pause for thought
You're a dedicated swallower of fascism

Time up and time out for all the liberties you've taken
Time up and time out for all the friends that
You've forsaken
If you choose to waste away like death is back in fashion
You're an accident waiting to happen

And my sins are so unoriginal
I have all the self-loathing of a wolf in sheep's clothing
In this carnival of carnivores
Heaven help me",Accident Waiting to Happen (Red Stars Version),2003
Billy Bragg,"The wind sways the trees and the raindrops on the leaves
Tumble down, down my neck in the breeze
Yes, it's true I hid out in the shadow of your doubt
And this medal that I wear is not for bravery, I'm afraid

And we're both gonna have to accept
That this might be as good as it gets
As our love for each other respects
Neither rule nor reason

The queen on her throne plays Shirley Bassey
Records when she's all on her own
And she looks out the window
And cries

What should I do?
Scratch off all of my tattoos?
And forget those girls names?
But you're not about to let me do that, are you?

And we're both gonna have to accept
That this might be as bad as it gets
As our love for each other respects
Neither rule nor reason

And we're both gonna have to accept
That this might be as big as it gets
And our love for each other respects
Neither rule nor reason, neither rule nor reason",Rule nor Reason [Live][#][*],2003
Billy Bragg,"She said it was just a figment of speech
And I said, ""You mean figure?""
And she said, ""No, figment""
Because she could never imagine it happening
But it did.

When we first met I played the shy boy
And when she spoke to me for the first time
My nose began to bleed
She guessed the rest

The next day we went on a bus ride to the ferry
And when nobody came to collect our fares
Well, I knew then this was something special
I couldn't stop thinking about her
And every time I switched on the radio
There was somebody else singing a song about the two of us

It was just like being on a fast ride at the funfair
The sort you wanna get off because it?s scary
And then as soon as you?re off
You wanna get straight back on again

But our love is strange
And you have to take the crunchy with the smooth I s'pose
She began going out with Mr Potato Head
It was when I saw her in the car park
With his coat around her shoulders that I realized
I went home and thought about the two of them together
Until the bath water went cold around me

I thought about her eyes and the curve of her breasts
And about the point where their bodies met
I confronted her about it.
I said, ""I?m the most illegible bachelor in town.""
And she said, ""Yea, that's why I can never understand
Any of those silly letters you send me.""

And then one day it happened
She cut 'er hair and I stopped lovin' 'er",Walk Away Renee,2003
Billy Bragg,"If you love this land of the free
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home
Bring them back from overseas
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home

It will make the politicians sad, I know
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home
They wanna tangle with their foe
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home

They wanna test their grand theories
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home
With the blood of you and me
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home

Now we'll give no more brave young lives
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home

(Hoo-hoo hoo-hoo)

The men will cheer and the boys will shout
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home
Yeah and we will all turn out

The church bells will ring with joy
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home
To welcome our darlin' girls and boys
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home

We will lift their voice and sound
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home
Yeah, when Johnny comes marching home
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home

Bring 'em home, bring 'em home

Billy Bragg,"On Monday I wished it was Tuesday night
So I could wish for the weekend to come
On Tuesday I wished that the night would pass
So I could call you on the phone
Now a man can spend a lot of time
Wondering what was on Jack Ruby's mind 
And time is all I have without you here 

On Wednesday when you hung up
It was as much as I could do
To stop from wishing Thursday
Would pass so quickly too
They're out there making history
In the Lenin Shipyards today
And here I am in the Hammersmith Hotel
Wishing the days away

There's always room for one more soul
Down in the Human Zoo
I don't want you to come here though
I want to come home to you
Somebody's knocking at the door
Its later than I think
And its time to put on these stinking clothes
And get out there and stink

On Friday I wished there was something more
To be seen in the letters you send
On Saturday I wished it was Sunday
Oh will this torment ever end
Sometimes I get a notion to put a torch
To the tools of my trade
Here I am in the Hammersmith Hotel
Wishing the days away
",People Get Ready,2004
Billy Bragg,"Crowds gather round
kneeling at the feet of common thieves
hungry for the word but
God would never speak through such as these
such as these

Who offer healing hands and balms
and redemption
if you would cross their palms
they'll tell your troubles to the Lord
for how ever much you can afford

Hands holding hands in the circle
of the sinners and the saved
memories that linger from the cradle
placing puzzles in the grave
in the grave

No mortal skin and bone
can live on bread and circuses alone
the spirit needs must drive
the mystery of why we are alive

They look in their Book and they read
but their cold hearts say, ""follow me""

Dance in the dust
in the frenzy of the desperately in need
led by the voices of the men
who invoke ritual to hide their greed
hide their greed

Come every tongue, every eye
across the crumbling earth and cracking sky
the gates of hell stand open wide but
the path of glory you walk single file
they look in their Book and they read
but their cold hearts say, ""follow me""

These men make a cage
for the very souls that came here to be free
then they turn off their lights, fold their tents
they're fixing to leave

They look in their Book and they read
but their cold hearts say, ""follow me""

They'll close their Book and leave
but you'll remain
still in pain",Bread & Circuses,2005
Billy Bragg,"In a busy street, a man sits down
Oblivious to the traffic sounds
No chaos, no frenzied shrieking crowd
Thank God their silence, walking heads, bent down

Come when they saw us
Called it lethargy
The treadmill turns
There down below their feet

Should I pray for an end to come
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly
Or cross the waves of an angry sea
Risking, risking and braving, braving
The shipwreck and the mutiny assailing, assailing

In a haunted doorway and from the light of day
See another life fall to ruin in pain
False smiles from even children it seems
Landlocked ground for empty and lost dreams

A league against me
I hear him say
It's not worth half the effort
Or the price you pay

Should I pray for an end to come
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly
Or should I raise my face to the Heavens above
And tell God, dear God, stop jeering and jeering
As our human frailties and all our failings, are we failing?

Pound, pound on an endless street
Again and again the nightmare scene
All strained against the tightened rope
Not one with a lasting lingering hope

There's evidence
Everywhere you see
Put a quarter down at the newsstand
So that you can read

Should I pray for an end to come
Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly
Or should I raise my face to the clouds above
Entreating, entreating
Their mercy, some mercy

But as clouds will do, they'll rain down
First gently, gently and sweetly, so sweetly
Until they silence me
With a burst of thunder, thunder and lightning and lightning
And helpless landlocked screaming
I know god must be agreeing

It's the worst part of watching
It's the worst part of watching
It's the worst part of watching
It's the worst part

Landlocked in screaming
God must be agreeing
To be helpless is the worst
Must be the worst part of watching
The worst part of watching",Party of God,2005
Billy Bragg,"I'm leaving you, darling
And I won't be back
I found something better
Somewhere down the track

Oh, oh, I need you, darling
You've got the power

You've got the power of love
In your hands
You've got the power of love
To make me understand

Oh, oh, I want you to try me
You've got the power

I told you, darling
That I would stand by your side
Remember the days you made me cry
But, oh, darling, oh, my little darling
You've got the power to love

We belong together
And we love each other
We belong together

Have to look no further cause

And never mind that, can you meet me

Oh you look divine,

And her husband was one of those blokes
The sort that only laughs at his own jokes
The sort that war takes away
And when there wasn't a war he left her anyway

Norman Whitfield and Barratt Strong
Are here to make everything right that's wrong
Holland and Holland and Lamont Dozier too
Are here to make it all okay with you

One dark night he came home from the sea
And put a hole in her body where no hole should be
It hurt her more to see him walking out the door
And though they stitched her back together they left her heart in pieces on the 
floor

When the world falls apart some things stay in place
She takes off the Four Tops tape and puts it back in its case
When the world falls apart some things stay in place

Billy Bragg,"I have a letter from her
When she worked for the ""woman's realm""
And all the things she promised me
She promised herself as well
She said, ""I want my freedom""
And ran off along the beach
It's hard to love a girl so near
Yet so far out of reach

She came back when the tide came in
And introduced her friend to me
She said, ""don't ring while he is here""
And gave me back my poetry
She expected me to understand
As she's always done this before
And now she asks me
""why don't you send me poems anymore? ""

And she steals more than she buys
You can see it in her eyes
And she'll come back as soon as she's ready
She's a bad penny

Then she comes back and asks me
To sing all her favorite songs
As if she's never been away
As if she's done nothing wrong
But I've come to the conclusion
That she doesn't realize a thing
And she probably still thinks I love her
And she doesn't know that it's a sin",Bad Penny [#][*][Demo Version],2006

Rolled away now I'm bouncing back

Hungry for the word, but God would never speak through such as these, 
Such as these 
Who offer healing hands and balms, and redemption, a few would cross 
Their palms 
They'll tell your troubles to the Lord for how ever much you can afford 

Hands holding hands in the circle of the sinners and the saints 
Memories that linger from the cradle, placing puzzles in the grave, 
In the grave 
No mortal skin and bone can live on bread and circuses alone 
The spirit needs, must drive the mystery of why you're alive

They look and their Book and they read 
But their cold hearts say, ""Follow me"" 

Dance in the dust in the frenzy of the desperately in need 
Led by the voices of the men who invoke ritual to hide their greed, 
Hide their greed 
Come every tongue, every eye across the crumbling earth and cracking skies 
The gates of hell stand open wide, but the path of glory you walk single 
File

These men make a cage for the very souls that came here to be free 
They turn off their lights for their tents they're fixing to leave

Half glimpsed in the headlights between the trees
Who punctured the beauty?
And invited monsters such as these

The grotesque figure who never comes into town

Something waiting for the worms to claim
And you can never go there again
Except in nightmares

Knows excitements is merely the beginning of fear

But I have to say I'm scared tonight
Crouching in this hole with a mouth full of sand

Look at those slanted eyes coming up over the hill
Catching us by surprise, it's time to kill or be killed

Over here, over there, it's the same everywhere

All my life I wanted to be
As clever and strong as my best friend Lee
We grew up together along Half Moon Bay
Lee was Japanese, born in the USA

When Tommy was fighting Jerry along the River Seine
Me and Lee wanted to do the same
Then they bombed Pearl Harbor at the break of day
I was headed for these islands while Lee was hauled away

They said look at his slanted eyes, he's guilty as guilty can be
Sent here as enemy spies to sabotage the land of the free

I never got home, my platoon was never saved
That little fox hole became my island grave
Lee got out of jail but a prisoner he remained
Till he ended his own life to lose that ball and chain

Fill their pockets up with calling cards
And paint their faces red white and blue

And they salute the foes their fathers fought
By raising their right arms in the air
Oh look out my country's patriots are hunting down below

From the stands of the Empire Stadium
Come the heralds top the New Dark Age
With the simplicities of bigotry
And to whom all the word's a stage

Will glorify their feats
So that the general public fear them
And the authorities say give 'em all seats
And the wasted seed of the bulldog breed
Is chanting here we go
What do they know of England who only England know

Our neighbors shake their heads
And take their valuables inside
While my countrymen piss in the fountains
To express our national pride
And to prove to the world that England
Is just as rotten as she looks
They repeat the lies that caught their eyes
At school in history books
But the wars they think they're fighting
Were all over long ago
What do they know of England who only England know

And the society that spawned them
Just cries out Who's to blame?
And then wraps itself in the Union Jack
And just carries on the same

If only I could remember that sweet moment when we met
If I knew then that I
Would spend the rest of my life with you
I imagine I would have held your gaze a little longer
When first our eyes met

Did it rain or did sunshine attend out first meeting?
What words were said? what weight given to that first greeting?
My diary doesn't help
I don't even mention your name until that summer
When bloomed the
Seed sown on the first day that we met

I know the date, I know the place where in happened
Yet in my mind the scene I recall is imagined

And his handshake is so limp its like meeting a ghost
His apologies are tired 'cause he uses them a lot
His excuses are so lame if they were horses they'd be shot
He lies through his teeth with impeccable grammar
In the game of life he's just a dreadful goalhanger
Keeping all his options open till the very last minute
Checking every situation trying to work out what's in it
Trying to nail him down is like nailing water to a wall
He's incapable of making a commitment at all
Like trying to knock in a nail with an inflatable hammer
In the game of life he's just a dreadful goalhanger
Yesterday upon the stair I met a man who's never there
He won't be there again today
Well, that's what he told me to say
He's got the natural arrogance of an exclamation mark
And he wishes his bite was a big as his bark
He's appealing to the referee at every single stage
He's a fuzzy little bundle of impotent rage
And when he ought to have patience, he only has anger
In the game of life he's just a dreadful goalhanger
His lack of humility defies imagination
And he hangs round like a fart in a Russian space station
He doesn't even notice as he sells you down the river
Cause he's one of life's takers and he's looking for a giver

No warmth filters down through the dark

Of a deep ravine where can be seen

By such is happiness thrown away

I gave her gifts of the mind
I gave her the secret signs
That's known to the artists who have known
The true gods of sound and stone
And word and tint did not stint
I gave her poems to say
With her own name there and her own dark hair
Like clouds over fields of May

On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
I see her walking now
Away from me so hurriedly

That September morning was clear and fresh
The way she spoke and laughed at my jokes
And the way she rubbed herself
Against the edge of my desk
She became a magic mystery to me
And we'd sit together in double
History twice a week
And some days we'd walk the same way home
And it's surprising how quick
A little rain can clear the streets
We dreamed of her and compared our dreams
But that was all that I ever tasted
She lied to me with her body you see
I lied to myself 'bout the chances I'd wasted

Were far and few between
In the darkness at the dances in the school canteen
Did she close her eyes like I did
As we held each other tight
And la la la la la la la la means I love you


She danced with me and I still hold that memory
Soft and sweet
And I stare up at her window
As I walk down her street

I just made the first team laugh
And she never came to the phone

And I flew with them over the Great Wen till I had seen my fill
Of such poverty and misery, sure to tear my soul apart
I've got a socialism of the heart, I've got a socialism of the heart
I'm going upfield, way up on the hillside
I'm going higher than I've ever been before
That's where you'll find me, over the horizon
Wading in the river, reaching for that other shore
The angels asked me how I felt about all I'd seen and heard
That they spoke to me, a pagan, gave me cause to doubt their word
But they laughed and said ""It doesn't matter if you'll help us in our art
You've got a socialism of the heart, you've got a socialism of the heart""
I'm going upfield, way up on the hillside
I'm going higher than I've ever been before
That's where you'll find me, over the horizon
Wading in the river, reaching for that other shore
Their faces shone and they were gone and I was left alone
I walked these ancient empire streets till I came tearful to my home
And when I woke next morning, I vowed to play my part
I've got a socialism of the heart, I've got a socialism of the heart
I'm going upfield, way up on the hillside
I'm going higher than I've ever been before

When will you realise that as above so below there is no love
For the girl with the hour glass figure
Time runs out very fast
We used to want the same things but that's all in the past

And lately it seems that as it all gets tougher
Your ideal of justice just becomes rougher and rougher
Thank you for the things you bought me thank you for the card
Thank you for the things you taught me when you hit me hard

Night after night we would row
You woke up my neighborhood

I know we couldn't be like that for ever
Beneath the Seven Sister stars
The night we let it go too far
I slept out in the car

I remember skipping on the porch till it grew cold
I remember feeling like I was eight years old

Billy Bragg & the Blokes,"There's a chill tonight on the Yarra 
Winter is creeping in
While far away my loved ones
Wake up in England's spring

And although delights await me
All the way to Flinders Street 
It's that little piece of heaven
With which they must compete

When The Saints take on The Magpies 
Someday too far away 
I barrack for St. Kilda
In that funny game they play
But my heart's not really in it
My mind wanders to a town
Where The Hammers sing ""I'm forever blowing bubbles"" 
And the rain comes pouring down

Yes, it's still raining in England
Guess that's why I like it here
There's a brolly in my hotel room
For when the skies aren't clear

'Cos it never rains in Sydney
And it never rains in Perth
Adelaide's a desert
And Brisbane's just scorched earth

So excuse me please such days as there
And send me to the town
Where the children sing when St. Kilda win
And the rain comes falling down

So wake me up tomorrow
And send me home again
To where The Hammers sing ""I'm forever blowing bubbles""

Blackberry blossom when the summertime came?
The blackberry blossom, oh the last time I saw one
Was down in the bramble where I rambled in the spring

My love he wooed me as I lie there
With a flower in my hair and my cheeks all flashy 
Was the blackberry blossom from the blackberry bush 

When I picked the berry I didn't miss the blossom 
The blackberry blossom was white as the snow 
But the berry that it brings is sweeter than molasses 
And black as the wings of the Arkansas crow 
The Arkansas crow is a devil and a demon 
Known for his cackling and his screaming 
Driving away the swallow and the thrush 
From the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush  

I was picking berries when that crow flew above me 
Carrying my lover so far away 
Now each spring I lay a blackberry blossom 
By a cold gravestone on the Arkansas clay

With weeds growing over in the old graveyard 
And the day settles down to an evening hush  
Over the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush",Blackberry Blossom,2002

It's never gonna be what you want it to be
So if you want a good thing
Well think about me

Oh honey you gotta blow out the candle
Is a new flame too much to handle
Oh honey you gotta put out the old love
And let the new love begin

I know a young girl she needs
Some affection
But he's got you runnin' in the
Wrong direction
You know I'll be there
When he leaves you lonely
'cause I wanna be your one and only

Oh honey you gotta blow out the candle
Is a new flame too much to handle
Oh honey you gotta put out the old love
And let the new love begin
And let the new love begin

Sometimes love is all that matters
Sometimes not worth goin' after
You never know until you go
And just about the time that you think
You've got it
It slips right through that hole in your
Pocket and goes away
What can I say
'cause I've been one time two times three
Times in love and
It ain't easy
Love ain't easy when it's wrong
Love ain't easy when it's strong
You don't remember how good it was
'til it's gone
Love ain't easy I ain't lyin'
Love ain't easy but I keep tryin'
I've been one time two times three times
In love and
Love ain't easy
You don't think twice for the chance to make it
If any love comes along you take it
You may get burned, you never learn
I've been one time two times three times
In love
And love ain't easy
Love ain't easy when it's wrong
Love ain't easy when it's strong
You don't remember how good it was
'til it's gone - long gone
Love ain't easy I ain't lyin'
Love ain't easy but I keep tryin'
I've been one time two times three times
In love and love
Ain't easy

There goes my baby walkin' out the door
I never cried a bigger tear before
You don't know 'til it breaks
How much a heart can take
You don't know pain until it burns inside
I should have picked on a love my own size
How could a love so strong
Turn out to be so wrong

The bigger the love the harder the fall
When I lost your love I lost it all
I never hit the ground 
Until you shot me down
The bigger the love the harder the fall

If I had known you'd be too much for me
I would have kept you as my fantasy
To get you off my mind I'm gonna need some time

The bigger the love the harder the fall
When I lost your love I lost it all
I never hit the ground until you shot me down

Billy Burnette,"I just got over gettin' over her
I swore I'd never ever love again
But I got lonely and I lost my nerve
So I turned my sails back to the wind

I'm deep in two deep blue eyes again
And I can see those dark clouds rollin' in

I know I could stay where it's safe and warm
But I'm runnin' out of the rain, into the storm
Into the storm

I guess, I crave the craziness of love
The fool in me can never get enough
It always starts off with a gentle touch
But before too long the waters wind up rough

My heart can feel the thunder roar within
Lightnin' strikes and here I go again

I know I could stay where it's safe and warm
But I'm runnin' out of the rain, into the storm

I'm deep in two deep blue eyes again
And I can see those dark clouds rollin' in

I know I could stay where it's safe and warm
But I'm runnin' out of the rain, into the storm

Life's too short to go too long like this
Forget where you came from or came here with
Let's talk some serious business
Like just one kiss from your sweet lips

We're waistin' precous time
Are you with me baby

Well love's an ocean, deep and wide
Too big to see the other side
What's waiting there for me and you
Out in the blue
We'll never know until we try

It may be a rough and raging sea
That goes on for eternity
Throw your caution to the wind
Sink or swim
Just jump in and?

(chorus)
Let me rock you on the water
Where the winds of passion blow
If we go drifting out too far
We'll follow the brightest star
To the edge of love

Let me take you to another world
Where you an feel the undertow
And if that's getting in too deep
Just come with me at least
To the edge of love

Honey, let's just ride the wave
And let it carry us away
Let your heart just be your guide
I'll be there right by your side
Don't be afraid

We can tell each other's history
And leave the rest to mystery
We may never understand
Hold on tight, take my hand and?

You were surrounded in mystery
Just one look drew me in
Haven't been the same since

You had me hooked right from the start
Lights went out and the room went dark
Though I was blind and could not see
Felt the heat so close to me

I never wanted anything quite so bad
You got something that I never had
I'd climb those mountains, swim these seas
There ain't nothing in the world that I would not do
To get next to you

If I were wise I'd be more cool
I'm not the kind to play the fool
You got me where I just can't think
Like a puppet on a string

Can't remember ever feeling this
I'd give it all for just one kiss
Coming or going I can hardly tell
You got me underneath your spell

You love 'em then you just move on
Breakin' hearts everywhere
Acting like you just don't care

It's too much, too much information

I heard that just the other night
You caused a knock down jealous fight
Over just you being a tease
Like you used to do to me

Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a bright sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said the world's a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love, with you as my sweetheart

Act 1 was when we met, I loved you at first glance
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came Act 2, you seemed to change, you acted strange
And why I'll never know

Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you

Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down

And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

Spending my money, I didn't care
I carried my friends out for a good time
Buying bootleg liquor, champagne and wine

Then I began to fall so low
I didn't have a friend, and no place to go
So if I ever get my hand on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till them eagle's green

Nobody knows you when you down and out
In my pocket not one penny
And my friends I haven't any
But If I ever get on my feet again
Then I'll meet my long lost friend

Billy Byers,"When the skies are brighter canary yellow
I forget ev'ry cloud I've ever seen,
So they called me a cockeyed optimist
Immature and incurably green.

I have heard people rant and rave and bellow
That we're done and we might as well be dead,
But I'm only a cockeyed optimist
And I can't get it into my head.

I hear the human race
Is fallin' on its face
And hasn't very far to go,
But ev'ry whippoorwill
Is sellin' me a bill,
And tellin' me it just ain't so.

I could say life is just a bowl of Jello
And appear more intelligent and smart,
But I'm stuck like a dope
With a thing called hope,
And I can't get it out of my heart!

Billy Byers,"There's a far place, I'm told,
Where I'll find a field of gold,
But here I'll stay with you;

And they say there's an isle deep with clover,
Where your heart wears a snile all day through.

But I know well they're wrong,
And I know where I belong,
And here I'll stay with you.

For that land is a sandy illusion,
It's the theme of a dream gone astray;
And the world others woo
I can find loving you,
And so here I'll stay.

Billy Byers,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture (Excerpt) [From My Fair Lady],2001

Billy Childs,"New York tendaberry, blue berry
A rush on rum, of brush and drum
And the past is a blue note, inside me
I ran away in the morning

New York tendaberry, blue berry
Rugs and drapes and drugs and capes
Sweet kids in hunger slums

Firecrackers break and they cross
And they dust and they skate
And the night comes

I ran away in the morning
Now I'm back, unpacked

Sidewalk and pigeon
You look like a city
But you feel like religion to me

New York tendabery, true berry
I lost my eyes, In east wind skies
Here where I've cried, where I've tried
Where God and the tendaberry rise

Where quakers and revolutionaries
Join for life, for precious years
Join for life, through silver tears

You ask me what I see there.

I see you, I see you everywhere I go
I see you all around me
On a ship, on a train, on a plane, no matter where I am
I feel your love surround me.

You gave me everything and then some more
When I was cold you opened up the door
Don't want to stop I couldn't anyhow
You know I'm in too deep and I can't stop now.

You gave me everything and then some more

Billy Connolly,"Look over the hill and far away
We'll see the start of a brand new day
Heaven help us when it arrives
One more day with tears in our eyes
For the only one, lonely one
Lonely one, where can she be?

The figure stands at the windowpane
Up to the hill he looks again
Thinking back, he knows he was wrong
How could he leave his home for so long
And he's back to find no change of mind
He was blind, where can she be?

Why does he stand just outside the door
It does no good, he's stood there before
And just waved his hand, I don't understand
There's no one there, so who can explain?

Look over the hill and far away
We'll see the start of a brand new day

Lastly through a hogshead of real fire! 
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

I'd like to ease the pain in my troubled brain 
But as to how, I haven't a clue
Should I shout at the people who pass me by
Hey folks look at me, I'm no ordinary guy
I had a love and she swore she was mine
But she only loved me when the weather was fine.

My mind tells me what to do
Keep it to yourself, tell nobody else
Just how you loved her so, they don't want to know
Keep it to yourself.

On a subway train, I hide from the rain
And take a seat right next to the door
There's a man with a case and as I look at his face
I'm sure I've seen him someplace before
He looks up and I look down
And then we both look away
The train slows down and my head spins ‘round
It's like scene from a one-act play.

My mind tells me what to do
Keep it to yourself, tell nobody else
Just how you loved her so, they don't want to know
Keep it to yourself.

I feel much better when the sun has lost its glow
When the light of day is fading away
And there are shadows wherever I go
Yes the light is fading and I'm masquerading
As a poet with something to say
The inspiration's gone and I can't turn it on
It's been the same since she went away.

Than an Irish man who worked an honest day
From Steamboat Row, in rain or shine, he'd make his way down to the mine
Along the dusty road he'd travel
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

He used to tell about the time he got hurt down in the mine
He said he'd never go back down again
But in his heart he knew he would, he did the only thing he could
Kept on walkin' down that road
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

But when he took to drinkin' we knew that he was thinkin'
That his days were quickly coming to an end
He'd only speak of Steamboat Row, he said someday we ought to go
And walk along that dusty road
Fifteen miles to get there, fifteen miles to go
Fifteen miles back home again, home to Steamboat Row.

We hid in lonely places and we never seen the faces ‘til they fired.

I'm fed up walkin' (blood and glory)
I'll tell a story (blood and glory)
About blood and glory.

When we threw away our sabers and we joined with Preston's Raiders for a while
We looted and we plundered while the Yankee cannons thundered, we just smiled
But now back home in Kentucky, and I know I've been lucky to survive
I never want to see another cannon aimed at me while I'm alive.

Taking trips overseas, France, England, and my way
I'm the Don Datta, but you can't be my baby mama
Let me save you the drama, roll on like a Yokohama
We can, go half on the room, and half on a sack
And while you breaking the buzz down, I'ma be hitting it from the back
Bend over baby, I got something to show you baby
Turn around on your back toes up on the shoulders baby
Steady deep stroking don't mind me, just keep smoking
Bust a lot to break the serve and the soda water open
But you ain't my may thang, just a little something to the side
So don't talk when I'm talking on the phone, you keep quiet
Just open your mouth wide and let me put it inside
Smoke a sweet and to finish my cup and then it's time to slide
Don't worry about nothing cause it's confidential
Open up your runway for my ?con? to dent you

It's harder than a roll of quarters put your hips on that
Removing your thong, penetrate the pick and it's on
Still sipping and smoking stroking steady making you moan
I'm number 0 City Don, got a cottage by the barn
Automatic gauges vicious dogs roaming the lawn
You got to worry about nothing except for keeping me happy
And if it's with you than a bitch steady tapping and nappy

Steady tapping and nappy, getting the headboards clapping
Hell shot, pussy with your man asking what happened
And no excuses out your mouth cause you've been riding with me
Arrange my soldiers, T-H-you-G

Better soak on some alcohol, and leave me alone
Bitch ask for the cash I get it

But don't be tripping when I'm pimping in the club bitch

Knocking you down till I move around back on the streets
And keep rolling, got to keep my benjamins folding
Then I'm coming back to beat it up until it's swollen 
Baby it's non stopping fix a nigga a plate
So don't worry I be coming to your house real late
Meanwhile I'm a soldier in the battlefield
I'm on a mission trying to get it, I'ma make a mill
With or without you, but if you down
Then we can do it together, drank rubbers and automatic rounds
But don't be tripping when I say I need space
I ain't cheating but it's some reason it's a knee case
I'm a block bleeder, you got to share me with the drugs and shit
But when I'm fucking you it's beautiful I love the shit

Maintain in the family is a must, I would of died to
Do anything for my peeps
But it seems they would rather see me sleep six feet deep
But when I'm on my feet somebody got they hand out though
That'll feel me broke the heat be hiding the rain watch me soke
That's the millennium love if you can pay your way, maybe you can stay
In the mean time they hate you everyday
Want to see me and my baby girl break it off
Haters'll stop they self-defense friends every ten minutes drop it's off
When three's company and four is a crowd
And my situation is seven everybody else can move around
Look at your friends and your friends peeping, they burn bridges
In they household, come into your home and try to repeat it
Got you looking at your people meaning shit
When it's over you're lonely talking about I should of seen that shit

No love, no sacrifice, fellas in the street ain't acting right

Watch your enemies dog, keep them close like your block
Most of the ones closest to you cause they want what you got
Long as you spending money on them and your buying the drugs
They gone be down like four flats and ain't trying to budge
Say they love you everytime you rolling up the doe-doe
But when your ends don't spend they tend to leave you solo
I know, that's why I love Z-Ro, cause ain't nobody else gone love me
I think of myself, why'all don't think of me
I'm all alone but guess what, that's alright
Even though they use me for a punching bag, that's alright
Even if my woman don't want me no more, that's alright
I got Jesus and I can conversate with him all night
Give me a split that's what I'm asking
Cause I get reary ducking haters as they passing
I wish I was a sociable person, but socializing ain't for me
I want to die by myself in these streets cause that's love

It ain't no love no more everybody about the dollar
That's why when I pass by the G-O-V don't holler
I pop my collar and don't follow nobody
Keep god first and don't need no killumanati
To put it on your mind cause I say on no pages
Stacking big faces and travel to many places
Sipping ski tastes straight out the gallon 
Why don't you take a lick and don't swallow ?
The games is backstabbing, crooked it ain't right
Friends or kin folk it don't matter we can fight
It's whenever when we were boss want to do
Cause I'ma pull dollar prime till I'm dead and I'm through

I can't believe my best homie ain't my nigga no more
Remember days of playing hookie in the streets for fun
Now I'm getting dirty looks got me clutching my gun
On the one, I'ma shine like the sun my nigga
If I'm so low when I'm riding with some thugging niggas
Family members even say that I ain't use to shit
Cause I stay high all day straight abusing shit

[Z-Ro]
Cause lord knows Z-Ro ain't got no regular living
Even though I'm, trying I feel as if I'm headed to prison
Or headed to the grave, could it be I'm running out of time
Feeling hopeless, I lost my mama then I lost my mind
Will I heal in time, scarred up with bruise and shot
But see the pain is in my brain, hitting like a stash spot
My life, my life, full of drama and bullshit
We burn this out of my foes pull quick, where the love at

Billy Cook,"I was sitting back, and I was thinking man
I ain't even trying to deal with this shit no more, you know
Cham' I don't know what to do yo, ya know
Seem like everytime a nigga make one step man
Nigga take two steps back, you feel me

They told me that pain was just in the frame, the irony of that
Cause that was the slogan showing, when they tried to see my tats
Never knew what was in the skin, would finally be a fact
Feeling like mother nature's, right behind me with a gat
Take that, the rain's loud on the window when it taps
To hell with the time, I thought that I could finally be relaxed
Tired of being po', yeah trying to leave the rats
Walk out to see three of your tires, that be on flat
And that one tire, left a sign of hope
That helps you to keep on grinding, when you kinda broke
That helps you to keep composure, up around your folk
That keeps from trying to wrap a rope, around your throat
Don't choke, you feeling like giving up
Life isn't a million bucks, you feeling like living sucks
God's telling you hear your boy, but you don't wanna give him trust
Mama telling you pay your tithes, and you yell at her back, ""for what""
So the pastor can ride faster, to get some rims on his truck
I don't think that they'll miss, ten percent of negative bucks
Put some Henny up in your cup, your problems will start to drown
But soon as your buzz leaves, then problems come back around damn

Keep your head up is what they telling me
, well it betta be
Sorry but the world keeps stressing me
Rain drops cloudin up the memories
It's gonna be alright is what they telling me
Don't let the stress get the best of me
Trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
Till my brain gets cloudy bout a memory

God knows, how I feel now
On the outside I'm smiling, but inside a nigga know he hell bound
It's a dark road, and I'm right here in the middle of it
Do I walk slow or if I run, am I'm missing some'ing
I took the time out, to save a little bread
Now my eyes, got water in em
Why the fuck am I still standing here, nobody love me I ain't happy here
My mama said, she can't handle him
But still, I'm looking at the bright side
But I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky
Then the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come
So do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun
End it all, put a stop to the pain
That goes on in my head, everytime it rains
But that was speaking, so you listening to the thoughts
Of an evil spirit, in demonic verses everytime I talk
I'm confused, by my psychological set backs
In the storm, washin out through the wet cracks
Looking for heaven, off in all the wrong places
I've given up so why the long faces? Let it rain

Your bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer
Bill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves
Your rent due on the first, but right now it's the third
Telling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word
Feel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel
Not to mention the realest member, of your family is getting ill
Tell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real
In the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel
To deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama
You thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber
They tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
You'd have to be a Superman, to live as much as me partna
you're trying, but help is just what you dialing
Cause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying
The storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying
They saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling

Don't let stress take control, gonna be alright I know
I'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah - 2x

My memry, heeeey-heeey yeah
Stressing me-stressing me, my memories
That's what they telling me
I'm trying to focus on the road that's ahead of me
By my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah

When it seems like nothing but dark clouds
Are raining in on your bright, sunny day
Remember, the sunlight always comes after the rain
You should be thankful, everyday
should be a celebration of life.",Rain,2005

My life is real baby, you peeping me take a picture
You peeping me take a picture, (you should take a photograph) - [2x]

[Bun B]
Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak
Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback
(You see it's real, they be like look at that
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph)

[Chamillionaire]
Introducing the truest voice of the South, it's who else but me fool
Don't let all that foolishness they feed you, on T.V. mislead you
Don't let all the magazines, and them papers out there deceive you
The cups that be used to sip, but Caucasian kinda like my tee do
You see that hand be glistening, you see the Sedans we flipping
The hundreds of grands we getting, these units of scans we shipping
You see that Caddy tipping, them thangs on that Caddy twisting
That paint and that candy dripping, that drank and that can is missing
That ain't a Cola, though dry and you feeling sober
Boys trying to switch it over, apply it up in a soda
Home of the Houston hustlers, who grinding and hit the quota
Who fire and hit the doja, you high when you sniff the odor
Told ya you gotta have, a foreign or buy your slab
Afford it then buy it that's, important without it now
You ain't gotta take college class, to see that we bout our cash
You not if you gotta ask, let's take a pic by the slab hol' up

[Hook]
You see my slab, you see my candy slab
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph
You see my chick, you see my chick is bad
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph
You see it's real, they be like look at that
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph
Photograph, ph-ph-ph-photograph-photograph
Picture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph

[Chamillionaire]
When I'm tipping they'll probably watch me, the cops'll be paparazzi
And try to patrol my posse, we shining and glowing glossy
The jealous will try to top me, we keep it too real to copy
What I'm listening to ain't a floppy, that disc gon be Screwed and Chop-pied
All the ballers will ride to this, deposit deposit slips
Buy the car and apply the fifth, raise the trunk an entire lift
Use to go to that Kappa, but Kappa ain't been as crunk
So I'm popping up at Daytona, on chrome and I'm popping trunk
Jamming that ""Ridin' Dirty"", while riding beside the laws
And they staring over at me, trying to scare me like I'ma pause
Tell 'em naw they know I'ma crawl, all day in the robber cause
I'm trying to go wash the ride, till them tires have whiter walls
You peeping him take a picture, that chrome and that paint official
You smoking then take a swisha, there's plenty just take 'em wit ya
You chilling you ain't a sipper, then I'ma be hanging wit ya
Take a hold of the grain and grip a, handful and smile for the pictures nigga

[Hook]

[Bun B]
You see the bling up on my bracelet, and the shine on my chest
Syrup in my styrofoam, it's sweet with doja no cess
You done put it down with the rest, time to roll with the best
Cause when you ride with the original, you ain't gotta guess
I'm the connection that you need, when they say it's a drought
Cause it's not really a drought, them other niggaz just out
And I'm the plug you gotta have, when they say the river's dry
Cause it's not really dry, they just ran out of supply
I'm too fly for the clouds, too down for the green grass
Better wear tinted lenses, if you look at my clean ass
Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak
Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback
Candy still dripping, 4's is still tipping
Wood grain grass, steering wheel I'm still gripping
Repping for P.A.T., the West and the East
And I'm repping for Pimp C, till he get back on the streets it never cease

[Hook]

[Chamillionaire]
My life is real baby, ain't just a song (ain't just a song)
Gripping that wood wheel baby, and riding chrome (I'm riding chrome)
This is for the real playas, that get that do' (that get that do')
Tell me how it feel baby, to see I'm-I'm riding candy and chrome

[Bun B]
Catch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak
Cause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback - [2x]

[talking]
Know I'm saying, gripping wood
Riding through the hood, and feeling good
Just like we say down in Texas, it's already
You staring at me so hard
You need to go on, do yourself a favor playa
And take a motherfucking picture

But everywhere that I go niggaz say I cap-and they speak on shit they don't understand

Want every be no more Guerilla Maab if you step up to me I'll be solo maab

Some of these niggaz don't want to pay dues
I hope they buckle up they belt

You better get ya weight up before you fuck with me
'Cause I'll maab on a nigga-swung on a nigga

But I know one thing they better get they bitch ass

Won't you please bring my baby to me

I'm a Chamillionaire, but got billionaires for my neighbors (Rock On)
I been havin' paper, I been havin' stacks
The crowd screamin' loud in every city on the map
Got the groupies goin' crazy, they don't know how to act
I bring em backstage and tell em baby just relax

Rock on, they see the jewels is so sick,l like flu spit and flu cough
Take it off and you lost, the tough talk get tooled off
Keep the four iron near, keep on thinkin' that it's for golf
Nickel Plate on your head, silverware's food for thought
Grammy winner the haters is like 'How could this happen?' (how?)
On the red carpet so much they mistake me for Aladdin (wow?)
How I'm a rapper with revenue like a rock star?
If I'm near you can believe the black card is not far
'Teen Spirit' ain't what they smellin', they yellin' 'Where that Nirvana?'
The crowd is rockin' n rollin', them swishers full of marijuana
They judgin' me like your honor, your daughter's here with her mama
They tell me that I'm a charmer, more freakier than Madonna
Famous look right at me and said 'Know why I got my lighter up?'
Cause like the throwback P. Diddy alias I'm a 'Puff'
See how we rippin up tickets that police be writin us
Do like Michael Jackson's complexion Mr. and lighten up

You dress different round then me I'm a clean your nose
Step into the line of fire hide the penal code
Compared to big foot, you just twinkle toes

They love me, that's right you nailed it
They treatin' me like I'm Elvis
Naked pictures she mailed
She licked on a stamp and melted
So save your rap for the rookies, 'cause there ain't no rappers here
A show you do in a club is a show we do in the ampitheatre
We packin' stadiums, ladies come in I'll introduce ya
It's too packed to maneuver, crowd look like LaLaPalooza
We outshinin' the losers, know i ride with the Ruger

Of my bright lit stay
The steam of my misfortunes
Has given me the power to be afraid

As beautiful as the sun
Wonderful, you're wonderful
As wonderful as they come
And I can't help but feel attached
To the feelings I can't even match
With my face pressed up to the glass, wanting you

In the slipstream
Of thoughtless thoughts
The light of all that's good
The light of all that's true
To the fringes gladly
I walk unadorned
With gods and their creations
With filth and disease
Porcelina
She waits for me there
With seashell hissing lullabyes
And whispers fathomed deep inside my own
Hidden thoughts and alibis
My secret thoughts come alive

Without a care in this whole world
Without a care in this life
Without a care in this life
It's what you take that makes it right

So nobody knows, wherever I go it's you

To pack your bags and go
Hooray it's a beautiful day L.A.

From a distant past

And it's a...

Billy Corgan,"A life comes our way
A death comes our way
Which is the safer place
I'll tell you 

Who are we to complain
When God takes things away
Is it enough to confess
Some sadness

I gaze into the sun
My green eyes burning

I found no angels
I found myself
I found no angels

You and you are true
I can't meet you halfway
You and you are true
I can't meet you halfway

I found no angels
I found myself
I found no angels

Simple cares they escape me
If I walk away don't hate me
I got to see where the pain will take me

I found no angels
I found myself
I found no angels

I found no angels

Billy Corgan,"[Chorus x2]
All things change 
Never rest, never sure 
What is worth 
Fighting on for 

All things change 
Around 
All is faith 
Unwound 

I found a lead 
A single furtive reason 
My senses reeled 
In seeking youthful madness 
I trust belief belongs to me 
Someone will come 
To spit the seed 
A single weed gets respect 
I'll change my quills to break the will 
Forever must hold 

All things strain 
Be they changed 
Be they fair 
Be they hope 
Masked as care

You might 
Be there

Taste dirt 

You hurt 
Swallow

Stragglers weep
Hungers fight

Stay with me for a while, while I sleep
Mamas squeeze
Grace my spine
Walk on through the CameraEye

Listen, listen
This is the name I cannot speak
This is the flame I dare not douse
Here things are 
We'll never get that far
Close enough to die a time or two or three

Stretch my skin
Restless gods
Made it so
My heart would pounce
Deposit change in the CameraEye

Who needs pain to survive?
I need pain to change my life
In gentle myths and turning leaves 
We all come to bury truth

We stand alone

I can't help but try 
Am I bluffing 
Have I just denied?

I've lingered long 
Perchance to dream the sweetest dream

We used to hang out all the time
I called her up on the telephone
It was someone else's home
Lit a room like the sun, didn't rain
When she'd smile that smile that moved me so
Dark and gloom, gotta run from the pain
I wish she would've said good bye

I've been looking for a girl named Mary Lopez
I will search the world to find you Mary Lopez

She's 5 foot 2 and what a smile
My Mary always dressed with style
Won't you help my find her please
So I can have some inner peace
Lit a room like the sun, didn't rain
When she smiled that smile that moved me so
Now it's gloom, gotta run from the pain
I wish she would've said good bye

I see you walking out of my door, my door
Feeling mixed emotions
You never ever walked out before, before

Before when we were lovers
Before when we were friends
Before the party ended
Before the end began

Thinking back on our love
I gave you everything that I had, that I had
Now it's time to more on
The memories they make me feel bad, make me feel bad

Before when we were lovers
Before when we were friends
Before the party ended
Before the end began

We laughed until the sun rose
We always wanted more
We never left each others side
But that was all before

I never ever should have let you go
I'll always love you, girl, I hope you know
My heart will never ever be the same
Without you, girl, 'cause I have you, girl

Knew right then I had to have you babe
I saw your smile and looked in your eyes
And want you babe want you bad
The way you looked and the way you dressed
Let me know I couldn't settle for less
She's the one and she put me to the test

You don't really know what you do
You got me on a mission trying to catch up to you
I put you on surveillance or bug your phone
I'm like a secret agent trying to catch up to you

I thought it out and I made a plan
All with thoughts that I would be your man
I just hoped she'd feel the same about me
Don't get me wrong I'm not stalking you
I've picked up on all the things you do
The clues you leave let me know you want me too

You know you got me running here and there
Trying to find a place where you might be
I'll follow every clue that you might leave
Cause baby you know you're my destiny
I know I'm getting hotter and I'm close
To finally solving now this mystery
The evidence is clear and plain to see
That you need to be with me

The more I look into your eyes

Can't you tell I'm serious about us
Waiting for the day you feel it too
Can't you tell that I

Drop the top make you bounce
Sit there till the jam lets out

I see you checkin' me out
Maybe I can take you to my house, to the bedroom...then I'll break you off
I can put it down...if you come around
What's it gonna be, baby girl are you leaving with me

Cause I can do
The things you like
So girl c'mon and spend the night
If it's alright girl, I'll hit it right
Tonight's ya night
If it's alright...if it's alright

Billy Crawford,"I was your man, you were my girl
Would have given anything to you in this world
So, why is it lately you've been acting cold to me
You don't want to talk to me, you don't like my touch

So, tell me why would you do this?
Could have told me so, I'da let you go
Look how it ends
We can't even be friends

When you cheat, when you lie, when you kiss me goodnight
You didn't expect that I would find out
When it's late, when you say you were at your friend's house
You didn't expect that I would find out

So many little things keep on adding up
Girl, I've had enough pretending that I'm blind
Two way blowing up way past twelve o'clock
Let me tell you what, it's about that time

And yesterday, I followed you baby
I know where you've been, I saw you with him

Billy Crawford,"Two people take a vow to be together
And live, love each other forever
They promise love a lifetime
Funny thing then they change their mind
They both go their separate ways
And love is just a memory
Your heart doesn't stay sad long
Another love soon comes along

That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is

Two people don't get along
Deep down both are feeling very strong
They try hard to conceal it
Their heart burns 
They both know they can feel it",That's the Way Love Is,2003
Billy Crawford,"Oh.. When you're in love with someone yeah,

Oh... you...

See, the heart that you helped to mend
Was broken by a friend
Your kind, kind words
I'm sorry but they're hurting me
Love letters that I've never sent
Hidden from your eyes again
You never seem to notice
But to others it's so plain to see
Now it's time to tell the truth
I wish I could, baby, say that I love you

Chorus:
When you're in love with someone
Dreaming of a tender touch
Yeah, I love you so much 
To be friends is not enough
When you're in love with someone
(When you're in love with someone)
I don't know what to do 
Describe that someone...
Is you
( I hope you don't, hope you don't change a thing)
( I hope you don't, hope you don't change a thing)

My emotions cover me
Like a ship lost at sea
I'm waiting for the one who will fill my destiny
In my mind you undress
I touch you with tenderness
I open up my eyes, I can't believe you're right in front of me
I can feel that you see my pain
Then you say with a smile
That you feel the same 

Chorus

Ooooh...

When you're in love with someone
Dreaming of a tender touch
Yeah, I love you so much 
To be friends is not enough
When you're in love with someone
I don't know what to do 
Cause that someone is you

I hope it don't change a thing


",When You're in Love With Someone,2003
Billy Crawford,"Verse 1
You be dripping off my lips
Like chocolate covered cherries
And the way you swing those hips
Like mixed Berry Jelly
You be melting in my mouth cause you melting in my hand
Oh girl let me try to tell you how I feel
Oh girl strange love but this is what it is

Chorus
I wish that you were candy. wrap you with my body
Girl I'll take my time to savor your flavor. I wish that you
Were candy. I'd save some for later. Nothing would taste
Better then you to me.

Verse 2
I've got a sweet tooth for you
Will you help me fill it?
Like a big bag of skittles girl,
I want to dive in it
You can be my lollipop; I can be your candy cane
Oh girl sweeter than a glass of lemonade
Oh girl and to let you go to waste would be a shame

Chorus
I wish that you were candy. wrap you with my body
Girl I'll take my time to savor your flavor. I wish that you
Were candy. I'd save some for later. Nothing would taste
Better then you to me.

Brige
To me you are the candy, girl you come in handy
You satisfy your man and I love, I love it
Tell me what you're made of
And I can pick a bunch of it up,
So we'll never run out, run out

I wish that you were candy. wrap you with my body
Girl I'll take my time to savor your flavor. I wish that you
Were candy. I'd save some for later. Nothing would taste

Billy Crawford,"I'm intrigued but,
I can't get the words to speak
Something abot the way she looks at me
Ties my tongue so nervous inside
Eyes (eyes)green her body's like fire (fire) hot as hell so I try, baby
And I hope it's not too late

Cause usually it's so simple for me but not with that girl
She's so fine!

Baby so fine got me stuck lie hiccup
Tripping over words like a nerd when we get up
I try to play it cool but when I do
Ohh get the hiccups

I'm confused
I don't know what I should do
Cause everytime that I choose to move
Seems just like I loose her
Body has got me stumbling
Like I've been drinking something
Tipsy so high, she's so fine!

Ohh ohh
The next time that I see her
Ohh ohh
I think I'm going to tell her
Ohh ohh
How bad I really need her
Ohh ohh
If I could speak the words

I was at the bar when I saw you pass you gave me hiccups
But that wasn't from a glass, that was from your ass I ain't
Goin front from your back to your front got me wilden I'm smilin like
This is something I want hiccup there we go again I got ya
Holler in act your friends I see you girls I'm about to go with him

Tell me shorty
Where have you been all my life?
I see the sparkle in your eyes
Girl how can I make you mine?

On a bar stool she took off her ring.
I thought I'd get closer
So I walked on over.
I sat down and asked her her name.
When the drinks finally hit her,
She said, ""I'm no quitter,
But I finally quit living on dreams.
I'm hungry for laughter,
And here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings.""

In the mirror I saw him,
And I closely watched him.
I thought how he looked out of place.
He came to the woman
Who sat there beside me.
He had a strange look on his face.
The big hands were calloused,
He looked like a mountain,
For a minute I thought I was dead.
But he started shaking,
His big heart was breaking,
He turned to the woman and said,

I've lived through some sad times,
But this time the hurtin' won't heal.

I thought how she'd made him look small.
From the lights of the barroom to the rented hotel room

Were having us some beers and swaping 'I don't cares'
Talking politics, blond and red-head chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and habits we ain't kicked

We talked about God's grace and all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say;
""God is great, beer is good and people are crazy""

He said ""I fought two wars,
Been married and divorced""
What brings you to Ohio?
He said ""Damned if I know""
We talked an hour or two about every girl we knew
What all we put 'em through
Like two old boys will do

We pondered life and death
He light a cigarette
He said ""These damn things will kill me yet;
But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy""

Last call its two a.m., I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again
Then one sunny day, I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary, he was a millionaire
He left his fortune to some guy he barely knew, his kids were mad as hell
But me, I'm doing well
And I drop by today, to just say thanks and pray,
And I left a six-pack right there on his grave and I said;

Tearin' down an almost two lane back road
Freedom and fireflies in the air

The night's still young, never gonna get old
Livin' for today like there's no tomorrow
Follow the grooves, the tires in the grass
Stayin' on the gas like we're never comin' back

It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
2 twelve's in the truck back, beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing,
Whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa, everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight

Swayin' back-n-forth, can't you feel the music?
Time stands still, I don't wanna lose it

Dream as big as a midnight sky
So untamed and we're so alive tonight

We're gonna have a talk about this
I brought you in this club and you done stole my girl
And that ain't right

When we walked into the club I thought it was understood, mmm, hmm
It was my turn tonight and it was your job to make me look good
Then I pointed out that sweet little beauty in black, yes I did
I sent you over with a couple of drinks and you never came back

[Chorus]
You were supposed to be my wingman
Wasn't that your game plan
You take the grenade, and I'll take the fox
Supposed to talk me up bro
No matter what so
Don't go tellin' me you must've forgot
You waltzed her off the dance floor
Right out the back door
Leaving me to go it alone
You're supposed to be my wingman
But the only thing that it should've been me
That's taking her home

Shortly after you left, I was cussing your name, hell I was
When her ugly girlfriend comes over starts working her game, mmm
And I couldn't scare her off no matter what I'd said, nah, no
I was thinkin' I'm the one that should be kissing on that cutie instead

Cause if I get you back in my arms
I ain't letting go again

Billy Daniels,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,2005
Billy Daniels,"Because I still get a thrill thinking of you
And I still feel your lips kissing me too
Although our love affair wasn't to be
I wonder if you care care about me

I still remember that night under the moon
I recall that it all ended too soon
I can't believe you're gone memories linger on
Cause I still get a thrill thinking of you

You won't believe me that I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
But night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no else unless that someone is you, you, you

I intend to be independently blue
I want your love but I don't want to borrow
I have it today and give back tomorrow

Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it

Billy Daniels,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way,2005

I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight
To prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Don't cry
Don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland

We'll travel south cross land
Put out the fire
And don't look past my shoulder

Billy Davidson,"There's a man workin' in a field
See's the rain and it's burning
He's saying this can't be real
As he sees the color of the fields turning
Far away the men too busy getting rich to care
Close their eyes and let it all out into the air
Hoping nobody else would care

Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
See what's going on in the world around you

There's a man working on a boat
Pulling lines from the water
Just trying to stay afloat
Filling the nets is getting harder
Far away they bend the rules so secretly
Close their eyes and let it all out into the sea
Hoping nobody else would see

Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
See what's going on in the air around you

Far away too many leaders let them get their way
Close their eyes and let it all out into the bay
Say they'll clear it up another day

Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
See what's going on in the air around you

Look out, look out for the big boys
Telling you everything they're gonna do
Look out, look out for the fat cat builder man
Turning this into a wasteland
Look out, look out for the back room boys
That say the smoke is gonna blow away
Look out, look out for the men who say it's okay\

Billy Davidson,"Highways and dance halls
A good song takes you far
Your write about the moon
And you dream about the stars
Blues in old motel rooms
Girls in daddy's car
You sing about the nights
And you laugh about the scars
Coffee in the morning cocaine afternoons
You talk about the weather
And you grin about the rooms
Phone calls long distance
To tell how you've been
Forget about the losses, you exaggerate the wins

And when you stop to let em know
You've got it down
Its just another town along the road

The ladies come to see you
If your name still rings a bell
They give you damn near nothin
And they'll say they knew you well
So you tell em you'll remember
But they know its just a game
And along the way their faces
All begin to look the same
And when you stop to let em know
You got it down
Its just another town along the road

Well it isn't for the money
And its only for a while
You stalk about the rooms
And you roll away the miles
Gamblers in the neon, clinging to guitars
You're right about the moon
But you're wrong about the stars
And when you stop to let em know
You got it down
Its just another town along the way",The Road,2005
Billy Davidson,"There ain't a lot that you can do in this town 
You drive down to the lake and then you turn back around 
You go to school and you learn to read and write 
So you can walk into the county bank and sign away your life 

I work at the fillin' station on the interstate 
Pumpin' gasoline and countin' out of state plates 
They ask me how far into Memphis son, and where's the nearest beer 
And they don't even know that there's a town around here 

Someday I'm finally gonna let go 
'Cause I know there's a better way 
And I want to know what's over that rainbow 
I'm gonna get out of here someday

Billy Dean,"I was framin' houses in Houston one August afternoon
When the foreman's wife pulled up in her Lincoln and she said I been looking for you
The old man went home early do you wanna take a ride to town
I said I guess it couldn't do no harm and I threw my hammer down
We were shootin' straight tequila when the foreman came stormin' in
He said honey now didn't I warn you what I'd do if I caught you again
She pulled out her little pistol she fired and he hit the ground
She grabbed my arm we jumped into that Lincoln and I put that hammer down
Hammer down hammer down don't look back it's too late now
Ain't nothin' you can do about it anyhow
Just put that hammer put that hammer down

Well I heard the sirens moanin' just east of New Orleans
She cried out to the trooper thank God you rescued me
When they dragged me into the courtroom I knew where I was bound
That old judge threw the book at me then he threw his hammer down
Hammer down hammer down don't look back it's too late now
Ain't nothin' you can do about it anyhow
Just throw that hammer throw that hammer down

On a chain gang out of Houston one August afternoon
I see that same old Lincoln and at the wheel there's a brand new fool
Then the warden taps my shoulder says son quit your foolin' around
In ninety-nine years you can lay that hammer down

Wish I could say I've no regrets
But I didn't realize back then
Just exactly what I had
Now I do and it's so sad
Ooh, I miss you bad

I shoulda listened
To the beating of my heart
When I held you close
To the words I said when I said
""I'll never let you go""

I shoulda listened
To the voice inside my head
That said, ""It's love""
Now all I hear
Is the sound of falling tears
I shoulda listened

My mind, doesn't hesitate to say
""Oh, you fool, you let her slip away""
But I just don't want to hear the truth
So I try to cover my ears
But I'm coming in louder and clear
Wish I had when you were here

Billy Dean,"Daddy's will was stronger than the winds of a hurricane
Steady as a stone wall never did hear him complain
There were times when we had nothing but the hope in his eyes
His spirit went unbroken and his faith was never tried

Daddy's will held us together
Determined he would make a better life for us all
He sacrificed unselfishly so our dreams could be fulfilled
But then again Daddies will

Got a sister on the west coast and another who lives back east
I moved up to Nashville where I'm living out my dreams
But we all stay in touch these days talking on the line
'Bout how hard it is raising kids then we're reminded of those times
(When)

Daddy's will held us together
Determined he would make a better life for us all
He sacrificed unselfishly so our dreams could be fulfilled
But then again Daddies will

I won't forget the summer when Daddy passed away
Mama opened up the safe and read the will he made
It said our family fortune lies within our hearts
Then our eyes filled with tears but no one fell apart

I can tell her ""see you later""
But then I might be wrong
This voice inside is driving me
To find where I belong
I know I must leave her now
Everytime I try
I can't find the words to say goodbye
Don't know why
I can't find the words to say goodbye",I Can't Find the Words to Say Goodbye,1994
Billy Dean,"Tomorrow morning if you wake up
And the sun does not appear
I will be here here
If in the dark we lose sight of love
Hold my hand and have no fear
Cause I will be here

I will be here when you feel like being quiet
When you need to speak your mind I will listen
And I will be here
When the laughter turns to crying
Through the winning losing and trying
We'll be together
Cause I will be here

Tomorrow morning if you wake
And the future is unclear
I will be here
As sure as seasons are made for change
Our lifetimes are made for years
So I will be here

I will be here and you can cry on my shoulder
When the mirror tells us we're older
I will hold you
And I will be here to watch you grow in beauty
And tell you all the things you are to me
I will be here

I will be true to the promise I have made
To you and to the one who gave you to me",I Will Be Here,1994
Billy Dean,"I rolled off the Frisco mint in 1909
The last one they ever made, you should've seen me shine
When I landed on the counter they gave me to a kid
Making change for a jaw breaker was the first thing that I did

I got traded for a pocket knife, two marbles and some string
Wound up on a railroad track waiting for a train
Snatched up by a hobo and turned right into wine
Pitched up against the wall at least a thousand times

Round and round a penny goes
Round and back again
Listen and I'll tell you
The places that I've been

I was stolen from a banker by Pretty Boy Floyd and then
He gave me to a farmer who was trying to save his land
I was good luck to a soldier back in world war two
He lost me in a poker game the day the war was through

I got stuck behind the back seat of a '51 Chevrolet
Spare change in the sixties, getting worthless every day
Not it's piggy banks and gum machines and occasional wishing wells
Or laying on a bar room floor

As far and wide
So both of us can dare
A promise I will love and bide
That's all I have to share

A chance to sail among the stars
That few will ever see
To feel the deepest missing you
That most think cannot be
A heart that beats for only one
And loves you fast and true
A promise I will love and bide
That's all I have for you
These things I have to give to you
Their value isn't much
Just things that you can barely see
And rarely ever touch

A hand to hold when we're alone
And no one seems to care
A gentle touch to reassure
And tell you I'm still there
To try my best to reminisce
Our dreams that all come true
A promise I will love and bide
That's all I have for you
My promise I will love and bide
This I give to you",Indian Head Penny,1994

Billy Dean,"The only difference between men and boys
Is the size of their feet and the price of their toys
Always horsin' around makin' too much noise
Ain't it funny how men'll be boys

Kickin' tire round the pick up truck
Drinkin' been and just cuttin' up
Smokin' and jokin' out behind the shed
Cussin' a blue streak till the girls turn red

The only diffrence between men and boys
Is the size of their feet and the price of their toys
Always horsin' around makin' too much noise

Lookin' for somethin' that he ain't done
Look what the cat dragged in at the break of dawn

Jukebox records don't' play those wedding bells

All I see is a man who's fading fast

Tonight I'll need that woman again
What I'd give for my baby to just walk in
To sit down beside me and say it's alright
And take me home and make sweet love to me tonight

But here I am again mixing misery and gin
Sittin' with all my friends and talking to myself
I look like I'm having a good time
But any fool can tell that this honky-tonk heaven
Really makes you feel like hell

And we start talkin' about what we want to forget

Billy Dean,"She put away her rings, gathered up her things
Dusted off her wings and said goodbye
She left without a care, left the walls so bare

Way down deep I'm wondering
What on earth went wrong
My world's not returning
So I must move on

Starting over again
New set of silverware, new set of friends
It's hard as hell if you don't know where to begin
Starting over again

Down at the grocery, lots of folds like me
Buy one, get one free, but it's all in vain
The only thing on sale is day old bread gone stale
And broken hearts that fail to play the game

Round and round in circles
It's an up hill climb
Step by step I'm learning
One day at a time

Starting over again
New set of silverware, new set of friends

Billy Dean,"The movers came today
To take our things away
Memories that we held so dear
One by one they're out of here
I hung the ""For Sale"" sign
On what was yours and once was mine
One last look around to find
Any home we might have left behind
But the emptiness rings true
There's really nothing left to do

[Chorus:]
'Cause I'm not needed here now
You made it clear to me somehow
If it's not built on love
A home is just a house
So I'll close and clock this door
Not comin' back here anymore
It's time to face the fear
I'm not needed here now

That's where he said his prayers
And learned to climb the stairs
Every room has history
That holds a part of you and me
In my heart it's getting through
It's tellin' me that without you

Wouldn't make the same mistakes I did back then
I wouldn't write a day
Or let a moment slip away
To tell her just how much she means to me
If I could find the one I've waited for
Wouldn't take her love for granted like before
I'd try to recognize
The ""want to"" in her eyes
And her hopes and dreams I'd hold so carefully
I wouldn't let it fall apart
If I Could find the heart to love again
If I could find the heart to love again
I really wouldn't know where to begin
Time is passin' by
Still I'm to afraid to try
If only I could trust like I did then
I would make a brand new start
If I could find the heart to love again
Cause what I'm searchin' for
Is that special kind of love they're just not makin' anymore
That lasts through all the years
The kind of love that lives beyond the laughter and the tears
So I'll just keep on lookin' round the bend
And someday soon I'll reach my journey's end
Together we will grow
With a love we've come to know
And promises we'll keep eternally

He chose his words carefully cause it was hard for me to come
And he knew I had ta temper and where I got it from
I waited for the sermon, the one I knew so well
But this time he wasn't preachin'

I fell asleep and started dreaming
That everything created here on Earth

All had voices singing
Every rock and every blade of grass
Even the ivy that was clinging
Every leap and every drop of rain
All had voices singing
It brought the angels down
In my dream so clear
And the Lord sat down. 

So that he could hear
The sea and waves were rushing to the shore
With the joy that they were bringing
A sound so perfect that it made him cry
To hear their voices singing

I could not help but want to add my own
To all the praises that were ringing
And over all the world there fell a hust
To hear my one voice singing

And as the Lord sat down
The angels hovered near
But they made no sound

Billy Dean,"He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
A three car garage, her own credit cards
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss good night
If he could only read her mind, she'd say:

Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
And she can't help but wonder what she's doing wrong
Cause lately she'd try anything to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she said:

Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

And the more that he lives the less that he tries
To show her the love that he hold inside
And the more that she gives the more that he sees
This is a story of  you and me

So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
Opened the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
Cause I'm gonna make things right
I'm gonna hold you tonight
Do all those little things
For the rest of your life.",Buy Me a Rose,2002

Well then

But you get me every time

Take me places I have never been and

Just when I need you most

I want you in my life
And I always will

Billy DeWolfe,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo

Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

O night, O holy night, O night divine!
O night, O holy night, O night divine!

With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.

His power and glory ever more proclaim!

And now that dream is here beside me

Long the skies were overcast
But now the clouds have passed

Just one look and then I knew
That all I longed for
Long ago was you",Long Ago (And Far Away),

More lost without you and so it goes

Billy Eckstine,"Stars in the sky were dancing
One night perfect for romancing,
The night a sinner kissed an angel,
He wanted thrills, she wanted love,
Oh but his sighs were tender

As he begged her to surrender,
The night a sinner kissed an angel,
And she believed that it was love.
How was she to know that every lovely vow
Was part of the game he was playing,
But to his surprise he realized
Somehow he meant every word he was saying.

wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

With distant gay traces

Of a great love for me
But, I was wrong
I was wrong

Life is lonely again,
And only last week, everything seemed so sure.
Now life is awful again,
A trough full of hearts will probably be a bore, a bore

A week I might go to Paris 
At least a bite of it
All, all I want to do is laugh in spite of it

I'll forget you, I will
And yet you are still
Burning inside my brain
Romance is mush
And it stifles those who strive
Well I'll live a lush life in some small dive
And I, I'll be alright with the rest
All those whose lives are lonely too",Lush Life,1960

And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your ""hello""
That music I hear, Lord
I'm misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leadin' me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't ya notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm followin' you

Should I wander through this wonderland alone, now
Never knowin' my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove, Lord

Billy Eckstine,"Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love.

I hope to ask you, dear, will you be mine?
The lovers you have had say, you're the best egg
They repeat, you're completely divine

I've heard of Pompadour and Cleopatra
But you are better than the two combined
How can it be you fancy me, is it that love is blind?

I'm about the luckiest man in the world
To have a girl like you, I'm told by Fritz and Peter
Your lips would not be sweeter

Oh, you must be a marvelous thing to delight
The many men you do, the secrets they can find
Have made me swell with pride

We shall move to larger quarters
To make your boyfriends feel at home
Your iceman and your cops and porters
Would fill the hippodrome

Oh, I'm about the luckiest man in the world
To have a girl like you
I'm very lucky to have a little girl like you

I'm about the luckiest man in the world
To have a girl like you
I'm proud because I can't see
Yet struck the nations fancy

Oh, you must have a marvelous gift to receive
The many gifts you do with same old clothes
And things each time the doorbell rings

A gentleman you may recall
When you were through with him last summer
He couldn't plumb at all

Cover me with heaven's blue
And let me dream a dream or two
Sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the leaves

I'm breezing along, along with the breeze
I'm hearing a song, a song through the trees
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
That fine melody caressing the shore
Familiar to me, I've heard it before
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, that's Southland

Don't I feel it in my soul
And don't I know I've reached my goal
Sing me to sleep
Lullaby of the Leaves",Lullaby of the Leaves,1991
Billy Eckstine,"Ma, she's making eyes at me
Ma, she's awful nice to me
Ma, she's almost breaking my heart
I'm beside him
Mercy! Let his conscience guide him!
Ma, she wants to marry me
Be my honey bee
Every minute she gets bolder
Now she's leaning on my shoulder
Ma, she's kissing me

Ma, she's making eyes at me
Ma, she's awful nice to me
Ma, she's almost breaking my heart
If you peek in, can't you see
I'm goin' to weaken
Ma, she wants to marry me,
Be my honey bee
Ma I'm meeting with resistance
I shall holler for assistance
Ma, she's kissing me",Ma (She's Making Eyes at Me),1991
Billy Eckstine,"No orchids for my lady
No sparkle in the wine
For other lips have told my lady
To pass beside this love of mine
So there's no rapture in our meeting
No kisses when we part
The orchids I gave my lovely lady
Were clutched on someone else's heart",No Orchids for My Lady,1991
Billy Eckstine,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
On Green Dolphin Street
",On Green Dolphin Street,1991
Billy Eckstine,"I can't believe that you're not here with me,
To have a laugh or share a tear with me.
It's all so wrong, it can't be right,
It must have been something I dreamed last night!

To never see your funny face again!
To never thrill to your embrace again!
Oh, it's so wrong it can't be right,
It must have been something, something I dreamed last night!

Those midnight suppers for two,
Our corny duets at dawn,
Those crazy moments with you,
Don't tell me that they are gone!

To never look into those eyes again,
The sun might just as well not rise again!
Oh no no, it can't be right,
It must have been something, something I dreamed last night!",Something I Dreamed Last Night,1991
Billy Eckstine,"I want a Sunday kind of love
A love that will last past Saturday night
And I've got to know it's more than love at first sight
I want a Sunday kind of love

I want a love that's on the square
Can't seem to find somebody, someone to care
And I'm on a lonely road that leads me nowhere
I need a Sunday kind of love

I do all my Sunday dreaming and all my Sunday scheming
Every minute, every hour, every day
And I'm hoping to discover a certain kind of lover
Who will show me the way

And my arms need someone to enfold, to keep me warm
When those Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold
And I need a love for all my life, to have and to hold
I want a Sunday kind of love, oh yeah

I don't want a Monday or a Tuesday
Wednesday or Thursday, Friday or Saturday
I don't want nothing baby
But I want a Sunday kind of love",A Sunday Kind of Love,1991
